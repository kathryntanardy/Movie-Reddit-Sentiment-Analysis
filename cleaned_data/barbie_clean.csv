the girl playing with ken must be a horse girl,2023-07-21 14:49:10
michael cera really earned his moment when allan fights all those construction workers i am so glad they didnt make him completely useless,2023-07-21 04:08:13
the cut to the depressed barbie commercial was gold,2023-07-21 19:01:18
the line at the very beginning of the movie that talks about how little girls only played with baby dolls which only allows them to play as a mother until barbie came around i had never thought about it before but it feels so true,2023-07-21 07:26:33
"that ken war sequence that was half battlehalf musical elaborate dance sequence was perhaps the hardest i’ve ever laughed at a movie

if i had that i am kenough hoodie i’d never wear anything else",2023-07-21 03:11:43
ryan gosling’s experience in the mickey mouse club paid off in this he is ken,2023-07-21 02:35:20
just got back to the mojo dojo casa house  all around really good  gerwig killed it,2023-07-21 23:43:15
all the kens serenading push by matchbox 20 had me  the theater rolling,2023-07-21 19:15:13
i lost it when ken mentioned one time one lady asked me for the time and then showed he now wears 3 watches,2023-07-23 05:06:37
the  depression barbie ad had me cackling,2023-07-21 13:08:24
the people suggesting to see barbie before oppenheimer so you don’t start barbie with an existential crisis have not considered that you leave barbie with an existential crisis,2023-07-21 21:40:34
time to go to hot topic and see if they have the kenough hoodie,2023-07-21 03:28:34
i got so emotional when barbie told the older woman she was beautiful,2023-07-21 07:37:17
i  lost it when barbie margot robbie was crying saying she was  and the narrator broke the fourth wall saying note to producers margot robbie is the wrong person to cast if you want to make this point ,2023-07-21 11:22:49
the unexpected cameo of the bbcs pride and prejudice had me rolling with the accuracy,2023-07-21 02:52:17
very unrealistic ken doesnt have  how could a  twister be that effective,2023-07-22 00:55:59
my favorite moment was when barbie and ken were first hitting the streets of venice beach and everyone’s judging their outfits till two  walk by and say “cuuuuuuute”  i was dying,2023-07-21 15:48:13
"nothing couldve prepared me for the mans love of horse aesthetics 

the trailer was right  its perfect for people who love and hate barbie my favorite part was when i think ferrera said and now were doing that to a doll when referencing the judgement passed and critiquing its just a doll yet its received so much criticism for doing arguably nothing i love the layers",2023-07-21 02:33:16
there was a mini foosball table on top of the large foosball table in the dojo casa and it made me chuckle way more than it should have,2023-07-21 02:31:35
i had no clue what to expect walking into the theatre for this movie but it was brilliant it was really nice to see the movie hit on so many important points in a lighthearted way and i dont know about anyone elses experience but it was super cute how almost everyone in the theatre was wearing pink and how there was such a large age range watching,2023-07-22 00:45:38
sublime,2023-07-21 02:16:22
"“and just when he thinks you’re completely interested in what he’s doing you take it all away”

barbie pulls out her phone and starts texting

that  stung ",2023-07-21 02:37:41
ill give mattel points for making a movie that doesnt paint them in the best light,2023-07-21 19:00:11
ok but why was half the cast of  education on this lol,2023-07-21 15:23:12
"my favorite underrated line was 

x200b

 do giant hands come out of the sky

x200b

what no that would be insane",2023-07-22 09:26:09
"while ryan gosling indisputably stole the show the jenga wall killed me for some reason i was laughing almost nonstop through this entire movie so so good

also “we’re sons of mothers i’m the mother of a son i have a jewish friend”",2023-07-21 04:07:01
“to be honest once i found out horses have very little to do with the patriarchy i kind of lost interest”,2023-07-21 02:38:04
barbie was not the movie i was expecting gosling to go on the superhero diettraining for lol,2023-07-21 11:33:53
psa  “i am kenough” merch dropped on mattel creations today,2023-07-21 19:09:27
this movie was  weird and i loved it it was like they turned toy story into a black mirror episode and made it funny,2023-07-22 03:13:23
this is probably cause i usually watch movies on a tuesday at 2 pm when no one is there but i have to say watching this movie in a packed theater full of people wearing pink and with people just literally laughing out loud all throughout the movie was a very special experience,2023-07-21 02:53:29
"they did an excellent job bringing barbieland to life i feel like i need to watch it again because there are so many little colorful details everywhere you look

also john cena as the merman with dua lipa was unexpected lol",2023-07-21 02:37:15
"i am in love with the scene in which barbie sees an old lady sitting near her at the bus stop it was gorgeously shot and felt so warm barbie a plastic doll is the epitome of incredibly unrealistic beauty standards — and so to have a personification of that concept meet an aging woman for what seems like the very first time and for stereotypical barbie to say with utmost sincerity that the lady is beautiful… waterworks and for the lady to reply “i know” gosh it was so lovingly done i’m still thinking about this scene hours after and it will for sure stick with me for a long time

also magic earring ken growing up skipper what a fever dream of a film",2023-07-21 03:07:20
"barbie in tears i’m not stereotypical barbie pretty anymore

me are you serious she just looks kinda depressed and tired margot robbie is—

helen mirren note to the filmmakers margot robbie is the wrong person to cast if you want to make this point

me never mind",2023-07-21 11:03:44
"“where do the kens live”

“i… i don’t know”

guffawing",2023-07-21 16:10:18
it’s barbie and it’s ken and it’s allan,2023-07-21 02:14:40
gosling killed it as expected that final beach off dance sequence was something else maybe my favorite sequence in the movie,2023-07-21 02:35:56
to be honest when i found out the patriarchy wasnt about horses i lost interest killed me because same ken 3,2023-07-22 02:31:46
the ken war was very epic my favorite line had to be the 4th wall break about how margot robbie was the wrong person to cast for the role when barbie was calling herself  my entire theatre laughed,2023-07-21 08:43:46
curious for all the movie refences i got 2001 space odyssey matrix saving private ryan beach war generic teen movies removing the glasses,2023-07-21 03:28:44
i absolutely loved that they included earring magic ken,2023-07-21 02:14:15
the mattel logo blocking issa rae’s president barbie “mother f’er” was hilarious and was not expecting john cena to show up as a mermaid also an nice surprise was incorporating rhea pearlman as ruth handler the creator of barbie as part of the story did the ending imply she was actually a ghost,2023-07-21 02:19:51
the scene about how depression barbie rewatches the bbc pride and prejudice had my theatre busting up ,2023-07-22 02:10:32
barbie falling over in defeat was a great bit of physical comedy from margot robbie,2023-07-21 02:49:24
i lost it when president barbie called ken a ,2023-07-24 00:49:59
i found myself laughing hysterically any time michael cera was on screen regardless of what he said or did,2023-07-22 02:24:30
"protect allan at all costs 

i love how allan simply wears the same outfit throughout the film with the exception of the cute sparkly bow tie suit at the dance 

even when the kens took over he doesnt change other than having a ken patch on it",2023-07-21 02:48:34
overall i can’t get over how fun this movie was the dance sequences were all incredible and the jokes consistently landed shoutout to michael cera for being effortlessly hilarious as poor allan,2023-07-21 03:19:05
"i was so worried when barbie first met sasha that the movie was about to become barbie teaching her about being more positive etc i was thrilled when that didnt happen

honestly i thought i had this movie figured out from the trailers but it just kept swerving in the best possible ways

loved the worldbuilding some light exposition and then handwaves the rest of the way like will ferrell just casually mentioning that ruth was a ghost with an office like any other movie wouldve had the humans spend a lot more time questioning if barbie was barbie rather than accepting it within a single scene

also can someone tell me what allen said right before taking on the kens my audience was laughing so hard i didnt hear it and i better see blurry midge edited into the background a bunch of famous movie scenes",2023-07-21 02:18:55
one super great detail i noticed is at the end when shes a human barbie now has eye bags and her skin isnt totally airbrushedmakeuped you can see freckles and other little things shes pretty but still human,2023-07-23 14:48:44
simu liu did a lot more and had more lines than i expected i saw him in the initial trailer and thought he would be a complete side character he is a side character but he got more lines and screen presence than i expected,2023-07-21 11:24:48
ryan gosling put up wilt chamberlain numbers in this,2023-07-21 02:11:15
also the fake ad  i feel personally attacked  my frenemy just got engaged and has been posting about it all over instagram and on a whim i decided to watch the bbc’s pride and prejudice for the first time last week,2023-07-21 02:37:41
genuinely shocked that mattel let that joke about their cofounder and barbies inventor committing tax invasion make it into the final cut either they must have great senses of humor about themselves or greta gerwig is great at negotiating ironclad contracts,2023-07-22 00:12:24
"i love that in that one ken scene they did many takes and let ryan gosling shout something different each time and went with “sublime”

i need a highlight reel of all the takes asap",2023-07-22 00:33:03
that mother daughter flashback stuff reminded me of maeve from westworld,2023-07-21 19:16:59
"america ferrera is now old enough to play the mother of a teenage girl 

i remember watching her in  betty and gotta kick it off 

jesus were getting old",2023-07-21 21:05:58
"i love how when she’s given the ultimatum in the beginning it’s either a pink high heel or brown birkenstocks

at the end on the way to her appointment she’s wearing pink birkenstocks perfect",2023-07-24 01:35:20
everyone who doubted ryan gosling or called him too old needs to bake him a personalized apology cake im quite certain he was born to play ken,2023-07-21 02:12:49
"when i was watching the movie i mumbled how come warner bros and mattel let those jokes in the movies i cackled especially in this part paraphrasing

‘i’m not pretty i’m not smart enough for this’

  narrator hellen mirren ‘a note to the filmmaker that casting margot robbie to say these lines is a terrible idea’",2023-07-21 02:08:51
"“allans have been in the real word before no one’s noticed nsync they’re all allans even that one

edit turns out it was a timberlake joke whoops",2023-07-21 02:38:58
"late to the party but when barbie said “she thinks im a fascist i dont control the railways or the flow of commerce”

my sides in orbit and i was the only one laughing in the theater",2023-07-24 23:50:58
the whole im just a ken song wardance off is surely an oscar winning performance,2023-07-21 13:13:25
the kens riding on their “horses” back to the dream houses had me rolling,2023-07-22 00:55:24
"i enjoyed it definitely not a movie kids will fully understand in the humor department or the history of the barbies margot robbie does a great job in the role 

also ken is not just beach",2023-07-21 20:50:13
michael cera as alan is probably the greatest casting decision in any movie in years,2023-07-22 17:04:53
the kens caring about zsjl and getting excited to show barbie the godfather had me crying,2023-07-21 02:11:34
i love the little  ed easter egg of the one ken just missing his barbie as a platonic friend  i know it could be read as him being  but it was just nice seeing him like “i just miss the friendship”,2023-07-21 07:30:58
"if anyone has the lyrics to that opening song i’m going to need them right now “k is for death” 

also given the trailer gave away that “come up for the night” interchange i didn’t expect to laugh but robbie’s deadpan chipper delivery of  “i don’t want you there” cracked me up",2023-07-21 02:39:28
i highly recommend watching the barbie episode of netflix’s “the toys that made us” after watching this a hood history of the barbie franchise and its origins and of course all of the tax evasion and bonus cocaine parties,2023-07-21 03:18:15
the “i am kenough” fuzzy hoodie goes unbelievably hard,2023-07-25 00:22:56
"im not beautiful

narrator margot robbie was the wrong casting to make this point

everybody in the cinema erupted at that line

ryan goslings back must be in pain from carrying this film his comic timing is incredible as is his absolute commitment to the over the top tone the ken song and dance was amazing",2023-07-21 18:12:51
"i think someone could write a whole essay about the scene when barbie told that elderly woman on the bench that she is beautiful

barbie had been looking at her new imperfections and saw them as elements that devalue her as a person or doll yet she is able to look at this woman who has qualities that barbie would consider flaws if applied to her and sincerely see her as a beautiful person it shows that even when barbie hates herself she is able to appreciate those around her we see her compassion and appreciation for others which contrasts with her personal insecurity

we also get to see her taking in the real world and it’s imperfections some people are having the time of their lives and others are have the worst day of their life people in the same place aren’t all going to be collectively happy no matter what because each person has their own complicated and imperfect life it’s a pivotal moment in barbie’s character development as a compassionate person and gradual growth into a more confident individual throughout the movie

it’s also just such a warm heartfelt and wholesome moment which i always like to see done in a sweet but not cheesy way",2023-07-21 04:15:59
if you had told me a year ago that andrew tate would be the villain of the barbie movie id have beached you off,2023-07-21 14:11:40
"watched it in australia when it came out and as soon as we pulled into the parking lot it was crowds of people wearing pink 

“watching oppenheimer for the cool visual effects and barbie for the deep philosophical meaning” meme ended up being true 


i loved it and i think it’s the perfect movie to go on a date on",2023-07-21 02:32:32
“ken is me”,2023-07-21 02:14:05
ive been thinking a lot about ken saying sublime after barbie asks to be his casual gf what a well realised gag,2023-07-25 02:17:51
everyone is talking about ken but let’s not forget about my boy allen he just wants to get out,2023-07-21 03:31:40
throughout the film i felt like they were going to reveal that the ceo was an escaped ken he had manic ken energy and knew how to get to barbie world despite seemingly never having been there curious if that was an abandoned plot thread did anyone else have that sense or am i alone,2023-07-21 16:45:18
i am kenough,2023-07-22 01:17:35
"this is so minor in the scheme of other things they got away with but using the mattel logo to censor issa rae’s  genuinely tickled me

definitely didn’t think that the biggest product placement in the movie would be a chevy commercial 

didn’t see ken becoming a villain coming at all  

push by matchbox twenty was so perfect my   

michael cera as allan got some of my biggest laughs “all ken’s clothes fit me” as a battle cry as he started taking out the group of kens cracked me up  

was that “si se puede” line a little nod to america ferrera’s role in gotta kick it up sure do hope so  

cried a few tears “i don’t wanna be something that’s made i wanna do the imagining”  

also that final gag—hilarious but also fitting with the themes of autonomy",2023-07-21 02:20:42
"oh i dont have a  and he does not have a 

thats ok",2023-07-29 22:22:05
"

 push was the official ken anthem because ryan gosling has been sitting on a first rate matchbox 20 impression for 25 years and no you cannot convince me otherwise
 if someone doesnt make the tiedyed i am kenough hoodie available for purchase immediately it will be a crime same goes for depression barbie because ive never felt so seen she will also be the perfect last minute lazy cosplay idea shes always wearing sweatpants come halloween or comic convention time 
 loved helen mirren as the narrator pointing out that margot robbie was way too beautiful an actress to believably have an existential crisis over no longer being pretty enough for real though margot literally and figuratively glowed the entire time she was onscreen 
 shoutout to greta gerwig for calling out justin timberlakes big just allan energy lets be real weve all sensed it on a spiritual level 
 america ferrera was the perfect person to deliver that monologue about what it means to be a woman it would have been cheesy or clichéd in a lesser performers hands but she really made you feel the rage and exhaustion behind every contradiction 
 speaking of performers who elevated the material how the  did margot robbie just make me cry in the same movie as an im just ken dance battle her connection with ruth and genuine desire to be human got me good somehow 
 shoutout to that one ken in the battle scene whose weapon of choice was  twisters 
 as soon as i found out the patriarchy wasnt mainly about horses i kinda lost interest had me dying ryan played the lovable himbo so well even his heel turn was 75 costume driven 
 issa rae getting the one mattel bleeped out swear in the movie just felt right dont come for president barbie or shell put you in your place  
 the cut to credits joke was flawless im here to see my gynecologist is 1010 no notes talk about throwing barbie into the deep end",2023-07-21 23:38:00
the michael cera scene where he fights all the construction workers building the wall vertically reminds me of scott pilgrim saves the world you don’t see cera in fight scenes all the time or anything good scene,2023-07-21 16:34:52
i’ll take a high level high paying job with influence please,2023-07-30 04:31:07
"my thoughts

1 the film equivalent of a big handful of confetti a lot happening a little everywhere but super fun if you just sit back and enjoy it
2 the lizzo songnarration that changed into a ditty about existential dread was hilarious
3 michael cera is just michael ceraing but it works really well here
4 i now want to see if they can figure out a sequel just to get more ryan gosling as ken
5 people cant you put your phone down for two  hours and just watch the  film geez",2023-07-21 20:17:20
low key one of the realest  funniest things for me was the scene where kens hilariously and selfindulgently played guitar at barbies it brought back cringey collegeage flashbacks to when i would sit there and awkwardly try my hardest to swoon… i didn’t realize it was such a universal experience ,2023-07-25 22:28:04
low key my favorite line is barbie crying and asking how can i be a fascist i dont control the railways or flow of commerce,2023-08-09 20:25:41
it was a bit awkward to watch this with my gf and when the depressed barbie ad with her features and hobbies came up i started joking haha thats you but then the next thing was also her and the next one as well and the next one,2023-07-22 02:49:28
havent seen it mentioned but the introduction to the real world mattel with the call between the fbi dude and i already forgot his name was funny youd think that the fbi guy would be working in a grey cubicle devoid of any personality but it is the opposite his side is personalized and has a bunch of knick knacks on his walls and desk while the dude working at a toy company is working in a boring grey cubicle,2023-07-26 02:38:41
“white savior barbie” ,2023-07-23 14:42:25
one of the scenes at the end with barbie and ruth in the white room with the lights flickering softly into different colours as she had an existential crisis reminded me of the ending of 2001 a space odyssey when he sees the star child wonder if that was intentional,2023-07-23 14:33:57
"when ferrera’s monologue began all i thought was how this is a terrible application of an amazing monologue… and then helen pointed it out about margot legit looking like barbie absolutely dead 

this was an absolutely fantastic movie i can’t believe how much i actually laughed during this even the credits were  hilarious i loved this movie it was as if the lego movie and elf had a pseudosequel this was amazing",2023-07-21 02:08:12
matchbox 20 didn’t deserve those strays ,2023-07-21 03:54:23
that scene where barbie was holding ruth’s hand and the videos started to play in the end made me tear up,2023-07-21 23:44:48
the joke where the narrator says margot robbie was the wrong person to cast to make the point that barbie was  was hilarious,2023-07-23 19:57:19
any time allan was on screen i chuckled also the part when ken goes running into barbie’s dream house upset and the camera cuts to allan just crying for him idk why but i lost it,2023-07-23 22:31:04
"i was worried for the first 15 or so minutes because it was the trailer just longer it picked up nicely from there

i felt personally attacked when ken was talking financial stuff with barbie made me feel for what my wife has to listen to

the joke about the justice league schneider snyder cut killed the ken musical number was great story was fun the mattel execs subplot didnt really add much solid 810",2023-07-21 02:20:40
i wanted two cameos in this movie and got them both earring magic ken and tanner the dog i got them both i am satisfied,2023-07-21 22:46:39
my favorite part of the movie was the absurdity in the way characters traveled between the real world and barbieland the fact that it had to be in a specific sequence of vehicles and it always startedended in venice beach very funny running gag,2023-07-25 23:07:14
"as an asianamerican man i was so happy to see simu liu get to play such a prominent role and be portrayed as handsome and a legitimate peer to ryan  gosling all without any of his identity being tied to his race no kungfu jokes no tongueincheek remarks no mocked accents just a handsome man getting to be a handsome man on screen

edit i apologize if a man being like “yay a man” regardless of race comes across as ignorant i was just excited to see it because there have really been very few instances of asian men being portrayed as sexyhandsome in mainstream us media especially with their race not being a legitimate part of their character",2023-07-23 04:05:27
i felt like everyone in the cast was just having fun with their roles and crushed it i also thought the daughter was great as well,2023-07-21 13:24:57
that pride and prejudice joke did not have to hit that hard,2023-07-23 08:04:56
when allan says no one notices when he goes to the real world its happened before all of nsync yes even him,2023-07-23 05:11:23
"you know i really loved this movie 

my country is very religious and patriarchal and i seldom see western feminist movies bc they arent really available here 

i was on the edge of my seat all the time and cheering for barbie and ken haha 

i felt so seen and empowered by the movie and i laughed a lot as well all the cast was lovable 

i really indentified with stereotipical barbie and ken thru this movie with barbie bc she wasnt astronaut barbie nobel prize barbie etc she was just the basic barbie that everyone thinks is very basic i am very basic person as well with mostly homemaking ambitions and thats all

when she broke down and said she s waiting for the more leadership orientated barbie to save the day i felt so seen lol smth i wonder how i can survive without my leadership orientated barbie in my life but the movie teaches the nice lesson to be in control more as well

my new mantra from now on is im just ken and thats enough and im great doing stuff lol  

both ken and barbie had amazing roles in the movie and made me feel stuff haha taught me life lessons",2023-07-24 09:21:53
so… greta gerwig randomly popped into our auditorium nyc before the film started to say hi and thank us for being there pretty  cool,2023-07-22 01:25:39
i was not expecting to see magic earring ken,2023-07-21 03:39:36
when barbie started having death thoughts i thought oh they made a movie about how its the end for barbie as a toy i was right the stereotypical barbie became human and left the stage for ordinary barbie,2023-07-22 21:17:52
i want to comment on something i havent seen many other comments on i know its easy to see ken as just the patriarchy villain but i actually think they did a better job at handling it than that hes pretty obviously an innocent trying to find his identity in a world he has zero experience in and his adoption of the patriarchy didnt really feel malicious to me so much as him trying on an identity to see if it felt right i felt like they made it obvious that he wasnt really a villain and more looking for a way to form his own identity in parallel to barbie having her own journey to do so only difference was she had a guide in real people and ken never really did he seems to let go of it pretty easily at the end and i think they were making an interesting statement about the ease with which someone with little experience can get suckered in to a darker world view the toxicity of internet culture in particular whats geared towards young men comes to mind and i thought they did a really good job presenting it this way,2023-07-22 04:00:15
i am very disappointed that rachel leigh cook wasnt the barbie who was wearing glasses to distract the ken,2023-07-21 23:19:19
ryan gosling killed it but i think i got the hardest laugh when he was rollerblading and gets checked out by the  guys and loves it my whole theater was cackling,2023-07-23 00:25:16
the mattel execs felt like a random addition to this movie and seemed too goofy for the “real world”,2023-07-21 02:15:49
the most fun ive had watching a movie margot is sublime and ryan gosling made me cry laughing during the group dance scene cant wait to rewatch it,2023-07-21 02:13:24
"i really like it and enjoyed just how weird and meta it got

the only thing i found strange was will ferrells character behaving more like a cartoon character than the barbies and kens especially since they were supposed to be real human beings",2023-07-23 02:44:15
"this movie is far more profound than it has any right to be

im shocked that mattel  warner bros greenlit this film and im so happy greta gerwig got her way some jokes just need to be seen to be believed

i need that i am kenough hoodie",2023-07-21 02:12:02
the ad for depression barbie was so good ,2023-07-21 05:02:15
i died when it was revealed the kens’ favorite band was matchbox 20 literally died,2023-07-22 00:11:33

“irrepressible thoughts of death barbie”

when they get to the real world where ken feels so powerful and sees all the images of men and its just so silly and over the top then barbie has this gentle sequence of noticing all the people around her and you can feel this sense of calm fear sadness etc it made me cry i dont know if anyone else felt this way but it just perfectly described the disconnect between men and women to me sometimes in my relationships with men i feel this way too like our worlds are different,2023-07-21 02:19:53

enjoyable movie will ferrels character was bizarre and didnt really fit favourite moment was barbie in the real world sitting on the bench just watching people telling the old woman she was beautiful and the funniest moment was definitely novelist barbie describing living in kens patriarchy as like being in a weird dream where i was really invested in zach snyders cut of the justice league because  that atrocious movie lol,2023-08-03 01:55:03
this movie had a bold choice near the end kens request for more justices is denied and he’s given a small crumb with male judges in the lower courts it showed that there has been progress but there are some  prevailing attitudes and behaviors towards kens in barbie land just like with the patriarchy in the real world and how there is a lot of progress to be made but certain things are better i bet it made a lot of people in the audience uncomfortable great move greta gerwig,2023-08-26 07:08:53

i was kind of confused about how the barbies took back their world towards the end i know no one really knows how to fix the patriarchy so i don’t expect a movie to offer a solution but i couldn’t tell if the barbies’ plan was commentary on a reallife solution or if it was something that would only work in barbie world

i liked it i really like the message for men that they’re enough i find a lot of the gender discourse in the manosphere is men getting mad at women for doing things they feel only men should be doing and are feeling insecure because they’re not sure who they are if they’re men aren’t needed to do those things the message is you don’t need to define yourself based on what women do men are enough,2023-07-23 03:17:12

the scene where the barbies are taking barbieland back by tricking the kens has got to be one of the best scenes in the movie theres many people i know who brag about the things the movie made fun of either playing their crush a song they made on the guitar watching mafia films together or helping their sos on unnecessary things disguised as glorified mansplaining it was hilarious watching it play out in real time and barbies using that behaviour to their own advantage,2023-07-21 02:12:47

ive seen lots written on the film about hyperreality simulacrum etc they even make a matrix joke on the subject but has anyone considered the movie as a sort of modern inverse morality play the inciting action for the whole film is not about equality or gender but about death which ultimately sends her on this pilgrimage she goes from a paradise it turns to  she restores it to paradise but ultimately chooses mortality after encountering her creator and choosing a life of pain and suffering so she can grow she doesnt even have a name shes literally an everywoman before seeing it yesterday i would have never thought to ask whether pilgrims progress was an inspiration for a barbie movie but here we are,2023-08-30 16:48:43

"i loved the movie and am eagerly awaiting the longexpected culture war it will spark a few fb friends already lambasting it for woke propaganda

one observation i havent seen made much is regards to ken a few critics have accused the film of pulling its punches with regards to ken in the end

how i saw it was that ken wasnt a representation of tatepetersenredpill leaders so much as a representation of the naive 12 year old boys who dont know enough about the world to not fall for it

spoilers below
kens arc concludes with having to realize that his purpose and sense of selfworth should not revolve around his access to women this feels like something applicable to the incel movement whete their entire social worldview is rooted on whether or not women will sleep with them i think that the film didnt so much pull its punches on the kens so much as falter a little on driving home the point that they need to work on themselves before they can earn what they feel entitled to

"it felt like there were two parts of this movie and the division happens at some point during the ken takeover i wont rehash them in much depth but i agree with all the comments about heavyhandedness and aimlessness the second half is mostly air also aside from kate mckinnon and michael cera the supporting cast was pretty useless could have been played by anyone the characters were empty and pointless wow i just called will ferrell useless

however the first half was freaking hilarious and very creative i love how the movie embraced barbie surrealism i enjoyed barbie drinking fake liquid and ken smashing into the plastic ocean waves i laughed a ton  some of my favorite moments included gen zers calling barbie a fascist i totally know gen zers who would do this ken talking to the mom and her daughter at the school about barbie being kidnapped ken and barbie in cowboy costumes the fringe all the weird discontinued barbies had me howling especially pregnant barbie michael ceras character felt like it sprang from a joke in the writers room about how funny it would be to awkwardly insert michael cera into this movie and it worked

but it’s not an “antimen” film it’s an anti alphamaletate film i can definitely resonate much more with that message than what 4chan’s and the shapiro’s of the world had led me to believe that “this is a film about men being slaves and rising up only to become slaves again at the end because all men are evil and  and weak compared to women”

i enjoyed it the visuals are marvelous it’s modestly funny and the acting from the lead characters was excellent might be my favorite performance from ryan gosling and that’s saying a lot",2023-08-10 10:46:01
"just saw the movie last night i enjoyed it margot robbie and ryan gosling were great  they did a good job really all of the cast were great in their roles and with what they were given the movie was more meta than i was expecting it to be and i thought it was wellexecuted more than it wasnt however overall i thought the movie was halfbaked twothirdsbaked some fraction of not fully baked i dont know  i get the intent behind it i just thought it wasnt executed as tightly or cleverly as it could have been

i think back to enchanted which to me has a very similar premise and very similar messaging but i thought was done much better with more fun and more heart than barbie even the ridiculous moments like the spontaneous musical numbers felt more natural in enchanted than the ridiculous moments in barbie

but man margot robbie is spot on casting though",2023-08-13 18:35:13
"just saw the movie tonight in a mostly empty theater overall enjoyed it but there were parts that didnt land also that nsync slander what what i did enjoy were when billie eilishs song came on during the movie and the montage of the human experiences came on i started welling up that was a heartrending moment and probably my favorite one

the parody commercial of a depressed barbie eating a family sized bag of starbursts and binge watching pride and prejudice 

i also enjoyed the cerebral stream of consciousness moments juxtaposed with how pink and cartoonish everything was presented haha

"overall i liked it it was very funny you really ended up caring for and connecting with barbie and ken because of margot and ryan they were hysterically funny at times rarely do i laugh out loud to movies but this one got me several times


i felt like the movie was supposed to be 30 minutes longer but was forced to be cut down the pacing in most of the movie and particularly the first half was terrible everything went by too fast the movie didnt have time to breathe which hurt some of the potential comedy and made many of the emotional moments later feel unearned and forced


when barbie sat on the bench and told the old woman she was beautiful it wasnt as sweet a moment as it could have been because the pacing was terrible just before the movie jumped ultrafast between events and suddenly it slowed to a halt out of nowhere this makes the moment feel tacked on and unnatural the pacing was a consistent problem in the movie


the mother and daughter characters i dont even remember their names also didnt have enough time to breathe barbie and ken who were not even fully human felt way more human to me than the mother and daughter because they had more time to breathe so to speak

when the mother had her monologue about patriarchy it could have felt way more satisfying than it did i wished i felt the way about the monologue as i did with taraji p hensons in hidden figures or laura derns in marriage story or frances mcdormands in three billboards outside ebbing missouri monologues out of frustration and anger can be so  satisfying the message of the monologue was fantastic but because the character was so underdeveloped and everything so rushed it was more eyerolling than satisfying it was cringeinducing coming from that character

all media should try to show and not tell and this movie failed here the movie had already shown its message  the executives at mattel are all male and they have created a fake version of woman and imposed that ideal on real women and girls they literally try to force barbie into a box representing this ideal and she refuses its way more satisfying as an audience member to figure out the message ourselves rather then being told it explicitly she didnt need the patriarchy monologue to be that explicit and unnaturally forced it could have been satisfying like the monologues i posted earlier but this one failed for me

the daughter was also extremely underdeveloped it was like she was written by a 50 year old who tried to make a parody of annoyed gen z teenager no teenager actually acts like that why did she suddenly bring up the genocide of american indigenous people no teenager actually says thats appropriating when their father speaks spanish the annoyed teenager can be pulled off much better like in bo burnhams eight grade which featured the annoyed teenager as a real human being with thoughts and emotions this one felt like a megaphone not a character

the positives

 insanely funny most of the time

 margot robbie was a developed threedimensional hilarious main character who you felt tremendous empathy for

 ryan gosling has never been more funny and charismatic in a movie ever this was oscar nomination worthy

 overall fantastic message and im overjoyed it didnt try to defend barbies as being feminist actually from the first few minutes it mocked the idea that barbies are empowering for women and girls barbies are topdown manufactured ideals of femininity and femininity is not what being a womangirl is its a masquerade imposed on them topdown the movie understood this

 opening scene was incredible closing scene was hilarious leaving you with an overall good impression


the negatives


 felt way too rushed and cut down

 the mom and daughter characters were awfully underdeveloped making them more cringeworthy than relatable

 some of the humor with the mattel executives fell completely flat as they too were underdeveloped some of the jokes felt like they would be funny if you knew the characters but we never got time to know them


most of the problems may be fixed if the movie was 30 minutes longer and all the side characters got time to breathe

i’m an old guy who watched the whole movie with a grin of bemused amazement that never went away i freaking loved it  afterward i tried to think of a thumbnail summary  the best i could come up with was a cross between toy story and fellini’s city of women  for those who aren’t familiar with the latter check out the trailer and i think you’ll recognize a scene or two  ,2023-08-11 17:15:49

"im a grown  man who doesnt have anything pink in his wardrobe never cared for anything to do with barbie or its fan culture i went with some friends expecting a cringefest i had heard all the stuff about how it was the wokest movie ever and trashed men so i was bracing for the worst


i cant remember the last time i left a cinema feeling as happy as i did leaving this one


it was super fun throughout the designs of the sets and characters are a perfect 10 the acting was incredible i so badly want a ken spinoff cuz gosling killed it the music and dance performances are awesome


in regards to the themes of the film i found the ending to be so touching 


people say the movie trashes men but i found ken deciding he was kenough to be heartwarming theres 2 big struggles we face today as men feeling like we need a girl to love us to have any meaning in life and then feeling like we need to be more manly and dominant to be true men and gosling managed to make you feel those struggles whilst simultaneously being hilarious and charming whilst doing it theres no cliche happy ending where the kens immediately get perfect equality cuz that is something that takes a long time as we see in real life and thats ok to me cuz its acknowledged that they will follow the path of women did in real life 


and a similar thing is done for barbies character where she rejects the idea that she needs to be a trailblazer for women after seeing that the fantasy world of barbieland really wasnt a saviour for women and avoids the stereotypical trope of most movies where the girl falls in love with the guy for a cliche happy ending whilst still apologising for how she treated ken before she could have had a life of immortality with systematic privilege but learned that its not right and being the flawed humans we are is beautiful people deserve to be acknowledged but are not entitled to love and the ending gag is just perfect funny and also shows the beauty of normalcy both the male and female main characters end the movie in a similar way even if with different literal outcomes


the patriarchy stuff was absolutely hilarious in its execution and i feel bad for anyone who couldnt enjoy it the fact that they show that ken couldnt get a job in the real world out of the virtue of being a man cuz he lacked skills showed that the movie is not literally saying today is a patriarchal oppression but redpillers gonna do what they do i have conservative views on quite a few topics and am first to call out liberal agendas but this movie was not it to me i feel like anyone can appreciate it regardless on political leaning if you dont take everything at face value i also feel like they use the little girl character as a satire of gen z liberals who just want to hate everything so its not like the movie was an f u to conservatives 
i feel like this movie has something for everybody of any sexagepolitical leaning etc and we just need to stop taking ourselves too seriously 
 

this is a movie that you can take a lot from but to meits about how we dont need to live life having a higher calling from our  or to dedicate it to chasing a member of the opposite we just need to be ourselves

"my take  the long bits about gender roles were interesting but not the real plot 

the real plot is “barbie becomes fascinated by death and sets herself on the road to someday die” 

barbie is still “irrepressible thoughts of death” barbie 

she met an old woman having never encountered agingdeath and thought that’s beautiful 

she met a ghost and said make me like you 

she made herself mortal when given the chance so that someday she’d inevitably die 

if we cut to barbie three years from now in the real world maybe she’ll have a lotta skull tattoos green and black hair and a lip ring 

like weird barbie stereotypical barbie has permanently changed  

she will now always be irrepressible thoughts of death barbie",2023-07-30 14:01:11

"first half was good and had several funny moments but they lost the plot in the second half  instead of focusing in on how neither the real world patriarchy or barbieland matriarchy was ideal but a compromise that respects everyone is better they just kind of muddled through the ending with some long winded preaching  

if the mattel executive never appeared at the end it would have made no difference but they where there and got a bunch of screen time for some reason

most jokes landed with the audience in my screening but  that snyder cut mention made me and the other 7 dudes audibly laugh the hardest,2023-07-25 21:20:23
"just saw the film today and plan on going again next week ryan gosling stole the show as ken and really made me feel for his character  he was easily my favorite part of the film he was able to make jokes that werent even that funny work due to his charisma and comedic timing plus his emotional scenes at the end were so well done margot did a very good job as barbie but i feel we didnt get to spend more time with her although ill admit her final scene with ruth was very touching 
the mother daughter duo fell flat for me as well as the mattel execs who in all honesty didnt need to be in the film since they didnt really do anything substantial
 
its a visually stunning film and i really love the set design of barbieland as well as the different barbies  kens but the script needed to be tightened up in places",2023-08-03 20:38:18
is it weird to go see barbie alone i 27m wanna go see it but my friend group does not i’ve seen movies alone before but this one is making me feel weird to go see it alone,2023-08-05 12:18:45

im adopting that to my weekly lexicon",2023-08-07 23:27:59
i genuinely have a crush on michael cera and it was so funny seeing him in this movie being shy and awkward in some scenes and also suddenly beating up the big evil construction workers in the other scene,2023-08-08 02:50:40
cant believe i just saw a movie where ken is an oppressed minority who discovers the patriarchy  awesome,2023-08-12 14:16:54
anyone else laugh really hard at the shining moment not a reference i was expecting at all,2023-08-12 15:39:50
"saw it for a second time last night i was still a wreck by the end anyone with mommy issues knows what i mean

i also didnt appreciate the initial wave of user reviews that were upsetcritical about ken becoming an incelmisogynist i think it perfectly captures how many young boys perceive the world through the lens of being a highvalue male after feeling that they only exist for the gaze of a woman in their adolescent years especially now with dickheads like andrew tate spoonfeeding them rat poison i think it could have been delved into more but i appreciated the line from margot robbie about finding out who you are without being attached to another person by proxy of removing the its x and y and replacing it with its x and its y just really a fan of selfempowerment to help people make better relationships without being codependent on one another for validation

will ferrell is also hilarious comic relief as a parody of woke brands by woke i mean the lets slap a rainbow on the logo for june and then keep donating to antilgbt groups version of woke pretty much exemplified by the ending where he rejects normal barbie until he hears that it will print money for mattel",2023-08-16 17:39:04
"this movie hit a sweet spot for me in terms of blending goofy campy dumb humor with more clever snappier jokes not every specific bit landed with me but overall i like its full commitment to the absurdity of the world this is silly and kinda ridiculous so lets just freakin go for it and embrace that inherent goofiness i find that type of unapologetic boldness pretty endearing

i havent really waded into all the discourse about the politics of this movie  is it feminist is it feminist in the proper way is it woke is it not woke enough is it sufficiently subversive is it secretly capitalist propaganda not that those questions are irrelevant to be clear the social commentary in this movie is of course upfront and unsubtle but i didnt go in expecting like an andrea dworkin barbie or a barbie recitation of the  manifesto or anything similarly outright confrontational nor was i expecting to have my worldview forever altered by the searingly insightful social critique of a pg13 summer blockbuster i wanted some good laughs and some pleasantly basic prowomen messaging and thats what i got so im satisfied there

as many others have highlighted gosling is superb i knew he had good comedic chops from the nice guys but i think theres a difference between being willing to look silly doing shane black fauxlowbrowbutactuallyhighbrow dialogue and willing to look silly in something as outlandish and garish and campy as barbie it really feels like hes having an absolute blast playing ken he and robbie both feel so committed to their characters and even though there are times when the movie winks at the audience a bit im thinking of a specific 4thwall breaking bit of meta narration that i dont want to spoil it doesnt feel like either of the two leads are winking in their performances  haha isnt it just so silly that im in a movie like this their commitment really sells the movies heart

and speaking of heart america ferrera take a bow she always oozes this sort of relatable sincerity and her role really adds to the emotional depth of the film overall i do wish the movie had spent a bit more time setting up the dynamic between her and her daughter their arc felt cute and heartwarming but didnt really move me because i didnt ever really truly sense the tension between them it was there in the dialogue but i didnt feel it but that shortcoming falls more on gerwig than ferrera i feel so thats not really a knock on the latters performance

overall this was a really fun theater experience and im glad barbie is having the success its having even though hollywood will undoubtedly learn all the wrong lessons from it its not a genius masterpiece and its not a worldupending feminist treatise and its far far from perfectand thats okay i think its big and bold and just tries   some of it works some if it definitely doesnt but the energy and momentum is palpable obviously this movies style wont be for everyone but i do feel its appeal is pretty broad my second favorite movie of the year after dungeons  dragons honor among thieves",2023-08-17 02:15:36
"not really sure what mattel ceo was doing other than showing off will ferrell there was no point to that subplot

maybe to introduce ruth",2023-12-31 06:45:00
im honestly surprised to see so many critical takes on this movie it was definitely feminist messaging but what exactly would you expect from a barbie movie that being said i think people are really missing the fact that this movie isnt saying women should be in control of everything but that we as a society need to do a better job with true equality the music the dances the fight scenes were genuinely well done and hilarious the over the top and literal acting was a fun choice for a movie where the characters are meant to speak and think the way a toy would i dont know i really enjoyed it thought it was fun and a very unique film but i guess people are very sensitive these days if they have have a certain perception about a message whether or not that perception is accurate,2024-01-04 11:28:18
loved having a ton of people wear pink in the restaurant i was having dinner at it was comical seeing all the pink and knowing where we were all going next,2023-07-21 13:22:09
"im a guy who didnt grow up with barbie but america ferreras character fangirling out over all the barbies and accessories was the second best part of the movie 

it was charming and showed how people love something even if that something isnt something ive ever thought about",2023-07-21 20:10:03
" what time it is
 you… respect me

i’m the only one who laughed at this scene in the theater",2023-07-25 01:43:34
an underrated joke in this movie was when the barbies were “tricking” the kens and one of the barbie traps was saying “i just have all of my money in a savings account” i snort laughed,2023-07-25 03:22:25
i loved the line about ken bringing patriarchy back to barbieland like the colonists bringing smallpox to the natives they had no immunity lol,2023-07-30 03:10:57
"this was so ridiculous and over the top i  loved every second of it

yes the plot is a simplification of the actual issue of feminism vs patriarchy but it’s a movie made to entertain first over anything else i loved the movie the sets the acting and the message but what do i know i’m just ken",2023-08-02 19:39:28
"okay i finally saw barbie after weeks of booked out cinemas in australia im really glad i did 

 firstly im a huge greta gerwig fan and while i dont think barbie is her best movie it certainly proves that shes a master of capturing and understanding the human condition 

 im a guy and i dont understand all the drama online about other men saying its misandristic the takeout for me as a guy was that men are raised in a world where we dont have to think twice about our place everythings set up for us to succeed that leads a lot of men to follow whats expected of them which can be unfulfilling and leave a lot of acting in a way that doesnt accord with our values we dont have to do whats expected of a man  we can forge our own path i found it empowering and reassuring not offensive 

 i really feel for greta gerwig because its clear her vision was somewhat neutered by mattel i get it barbies one of the worlds most protected brands so there wouldve been some concessions to make the film happen it definitely had no right being as good as it was but it also felt like it was just missing that oomph to make it great 

 i cried a lot more than i thought i would it was really touching in parts i really related to alan being the misfit kid who loved hanging with girls but was always lumped in with boys i really liked that he felt like a nod to the inbetween kids who never really felt like they fit anywhere 

 people who say it was a weak girlboss version of feminism missed the point imo it was supposed to be a love letter to women that acknowledges the whole of being a woman today i dont think anybody expects barbie to inspire a movement but i think these messages and portrayals of women are important as a check on reality  particularly for young women who are still learning about it",2023-08-26 09:57:50
"finally saw this after hearing nothing but great things  i will say the actors are brilliant barbieland is weird and compelling and looks fantastic but i thought the screenplay in the second and third acts was so lazy and literalminded it made me want to pull my hair out

it’s like the filmmakers forgot that there are ways to convey complex ideas in a film without relying on expository monologue directly explaining everything for the audience or they didn’t trust that the audience would understand or catch on to satire unless it was explicitly explained

whatever happened to “show don’t tell”",2023-12-23 06:15:14
the whole movie is such a lovely testament to what it means to be a woman i feel like i have a thousand words i could say but none of them seem to be enough but i can say thank you barbie i want to give you a big hug,2023-07-22 02:01:57
that movie had no business making me cry that close to the end,2023-07-22 02:48:55
that line “i don’t have a high level job does that make me a woman”  everyone gasped i didn’t expect them to say things like that but it doesn’t feel out of place glad i watched it,2023-07-22 03:32:46
i fully expected the kens song to begin with “anyways here’s wonderwall” and i think i would’ve not been able to stop laughing,2023-07-23 22:20:17
i love how mattel is gonna make bank from a movie partially about how barbie is a massive simplification and women face a multitude of challenges of which none of which are addressed by the toycompany,2023-07-24 00:23:21
the visual gag of ken dramatically putting on a pair of sunglasses on top of another pair of sunglasses got a roaring belly laugh out of me,2023-08-05 02:39:04
"i liked the movie barbie brings up points about toxic masculinity toxic femininity toxic positivity and benevolent sexism not every night has to be boys or girls night equality is essential in society 

the movie explains how men and women are treated differently in society how women have to fight to be taken seriously and how hurtful toxic masculinity and toxic femininity are

the moral of the movie is that everything has to have a balance barbie had an existential crisis and i too had it this movie inspired me to get out there and chase my dreams",2023-10-20 00:18:57
a movie about feminism where ken was the most entertaining and relatable character in the show,2023-11-11 04:20:04
i really liked it i think it stumbles a little bit here and there but is a really good time ryan gosling completely steals the movie but margot robbie is great as always,2023-07-21 02:14:38
literally the most fun i’ve had at a movie in years it was straight through one of the most attention driving movies i’ve seen it was 2 hours that flew by,2023-07-21 13:12:32
"i don’t get why men take away that this movie is just menbad i saw it as ken having the same existential crisis as barbie and filling it with his mojo dojo casa house and hypermasculinity which as someone who grew with a brother is exactly what i saw my brother go through in adolescence his crisis made him push away every woman in his life and he was “edgy” i actually sympathized so much for ken specially because he thought his only worth was having a hot woman which is what a lot of men feel pressured to i felt that the message was very clear men you are enough or kenough that hoodie will be sold out in seconds and women are also enough how is that idea antimen at all 

i loved this movie and can’t wait to rewatch sure there’s themes that i think it could go deeper into and this movie isn’t any new ideas but it was so touching and so well done i think the old woman at the park moment though beautiful felt a little unearned but i’m still glad it was done because my generation is so terrified of aging the mother line made me tear up immediately that scene was amazing",2023-07-21 15:59:06
its really funny seeing the difference between the reviews here on male dominated reddit vs the reactions of young girls on tik tok youd think they both saw completely different movies,2023-07-22 01:49:35
bruh barbie literally told ken what tyler durden told us 24 years ago ,2023-07-21 07:46:04
i’m hoping i’m not imagining it but did anyone else catch the lines during america’s monologue that seemed to be from barbie as the princess and the pauper the song where julian teaches erika how to be a princess,2023-07-22 00:43:31
if my feet were always like this i’d never wear heels,2023-07-22 06:54:00
i might be overthinking this but i think there’s a deeper layer to the nsync are all escaped allans joke since stereotypical ken is ryan gosling “even that one” might be justin timberlake who was on mickey mouse club with ryan gosling,2023-07-23 04:30:56

some reaction in the cinema during the pride and prejudice joke  gold,2023-07-24 12:32:45
i really liked it but its script didnt seem to know how it wanted to wrap up  i think the kens also dont ever get a fulfilling ending like if the kens are the women equivalent for barbieland then why use patriarchal tactics making them hate each other and then changing the literal government while theyre fighting l and then tell them the only thing they need is to discover themselves i much like the real world its solid advice that ignore shtbereal issue barbielandthe patriarchy thats making the kens upset,2023-07-24 14:14:05

this movie was fantastic i wasn’t expecting it to be that funny the one liners were so unexpected and hilarious my husband went with me and while he didn’t leave the theater with some tears like i did he understood the message,2023-07-29 22:22:01
"the first time i saw this i thought it was a little unsubtle the way a lot of the core message of the movie was just straight up said out loud

the second time i watched it i kind of understood that it was not for me and that its message is the kind of thing that you just need to hear said out loud directly and plainly",2023-07-31 21:04:47
"anyone else think mattel missed a chance to make money by not insisting that the kens and barbies rule together in the end and ending with both barbie houses and mojo dojo’s in the sky line
they could have started selling mojo dojo houses for toddler boys with a whole lot of accessories like horses and motorbikes and whatever else",2023-08-01 10:15:07
what a ride the opening scene mirroring 2001 space odyssey was sublime,2023-08-04 02:17:26
"just saw it overall i liked it started out a bit cringe which is to be expected when theyre acting like dolls but once you get used to it it makes for an interesting and fun experience 

definitely think the man hating reviews are overly harsh yeah theres of course quips at men and the patriarchy but the ending message of the movie was that individualism is beautiful and no one is better or worse than anyone else because of  characteristics you cant control and greta made sure that was evident of the kens too making their uniqueness just as important as the barbies",2023-08-04 07:13:41
 movie was fine but i saw a lot of littler kids 56 looking pretty glassy eyed as i left the crowded theatre  the parents were all gabbing excitedly while their kids looked like they had been conned into going to the dentist,2023-08-05 10:15:25
"just saw it today loved it i agree the will ferrel parts were weird and unnecessary 
i can also understand why conservative trolls feel so threatened by it its not for the weak minded
its a bright fun silly little movie for anyone who had a barbie and treated it like gold or played with it too hard its also a good message for both boys and girls to not let your identity get lost in another person be barbie and be ken",2023-08-17 00:31:51
"i loved this movie and think it may be toward the top of my list as a great film i didnt know what i expected going in but i was not expecting that in the best way possible it had the worldbuilding creativity of the lego movie the set design style of wes anderson the metaness of community and the social commentary of south park as with the pop culture around the barbie doll it intelligently not panderingly utilizes pop culture references including the actors themselves specific people utilized in specific parts for great commentary jokes and presence it was a fun and relatively straightforward story that managed to make some great social history commentary about the us post ww2 while also exploring the philosophies around what make us human all while being compasionate and positive towards the groups and types of people it explores

while its not really a kids movie its an entertaining watch and they can still pick up on some core themes like nobodies perfect we can all get sad and insecure the grass isnt always greener and empathy treat others the way you want to be treated i can definitely see some of this movie going over peoples heads to varying degrees and in regards to various themes so much was going on im unsure if some stuff that i thought was commentary is me reading too much into a scene or line but thats ok because this moving had so much depth and so many themes to explore

if i was pressed for complaints i would say most of the themes were outright stated but with plenty consistency to back them up and more than a few of the jokes were meh but that only stood out by virtue of how good some other one off and running jokes were

overall im ecstatic i experienced this unexpected delight today",2023-08-19 02:15:31
saw this with my girlfriend she wanted to see this bc of ryan gosling and well that made two of us we went into it blind not having read anything about the film it was entertaining funny smart and silly of course it has its flaws but well worth the price of admission  not sure where all the backlash is coming from though perhaps just another sign of the times watching barbie as a catholic latino who grew up on 80s action films and still enjoys herculean muscular action i never once thought this film is some ultrafeministic antimen social commentary on the horrors of western patriarchal society or whatever these people are saying    people need to stop reading into things too much and turning everything into a political statement,2023-08-22 05:07:45
"i am late to the party but i finally saw this today and i really loved it so much my favorite moment from the film came near the end when ruth tells barbie “mothers stand still so daughters can look back and see how far they’ve gone” it’s such a beautiful thought i cried in the theater and i really wasn’t expecting that at all from this movie

also i was so impressed with the performances of margot and ryan they both nailed their roles was ryan’s ken based on jake paul anyone else get that vibe",2023-08-28 03:34:45
"even though the movie didnt say anything new or unique about society i think it did an amazing job in how it made those points kens storyline is an amazing parable of the pipeline to becoming an incelmisogynist the scene where barbie and ken reacted differently to being gawked at on the beach was deft

also i think greta gerwig is currently the best director in cinema lady bird  little women  barbie is up there with some of the best stretches for any director",2023-09-06 15:26:28
finally got around to watching this it actually lived up to the hype looked great the cast chews the scenery in the best possible way and the social commentary was actually surprisingly nuanced which some are incorrectly interpreting as inconsistency the criticisms about the plot ring true  will farrells character in particular is under developed  not relevant  but it doesn’t detract from the experience much the plot is just a vehicle for the character development of barbie and ken which is itself a vehicle for gerwigs commentary in modern feminism and toxic masculinity and ultimately it’s good enough to achieve its goals,2023-09-17 14:02:08
"i went in neutral had heard there were funny scenes but not much else
as a 29m i really enjoyed the film it was uplifting and fun didnt put anyone down but also showed how biased our world can be 

every ideal was just pulled from reality and many folks who didnt like the movie seemingly cant accept that they really do portray reality at its usual male centred bias i find it a great eye opener and fluid way to get into discussing womens rights along with human rights in general

810 for me its just a giant advertisement for barbies but does have great undertones",2023-09-19 15:32:25
wel i think it was a good time but i definitely dont think its that deep of a movie or a masterpiece or anything but im glad i watch it the cast is incredible and i thought it was very funny most of the time 7510,2023-09-27 08:28:31
"i just came here to say that a delightful woman i

kenradio playing push — and the subsequent guitar circle of toxic kens playing matchbox twenty at their girlfriends — sent my theatre into an uproar

the recurring joke that horses were somehow key to introducing the patriarchy was hilarious too

i’ll play the guitar at you lmaoo,2023-09-14 08:54:27
i liked the movie and i get the point they were trying to make and the message they were sending but i dont think this is a big step for feminism i can see the parellel and i relate to a lot of the points they made but nothing was accomplished other than making the comparison the barbies dont give the kens a voice when they just went through a whole movie about how women in the real world dont have a voice when the kens ask to be represented in government they are immediately shot down and told its too big of a responsibility for them feminism isnt about women and only women are in power or make all the decisions its literally just asking to be seen as equal to be a part of the conversation and not just as a notetakersecretary everything went back to normal at the end in their respective worlds if you are someone who cant relate to being left out of the conversation who cant relate to not being considered you would miss the point which is why i think a lot of men didnt like the movie,2024-01-08 21:04:35
"came for barbie stayed for ken 

gosling was absolutely phenomenal",2023-07-21 03:15:58
"the only part of the film i didn’t find hilarious was will ferrell’s character it almost felt as if all of his lines were improvised on the spot and none of his jokes landed with me i also get the sense that his character was specially targeted to appeal to the more mature masculine demographic i am a young 20’s  male

did anyone else feel this",2023-07-22 00:26:19

bro the scenes where the kens were getting distracted killed me the ken explaining the godfather and the ken talking about money was too onthenose because i do that  the same exact way,2023-07-23 00:09:15
really enjoyed it loved the humor and set design especially matchbox 20 instead of wonderwall was the correct choice wonderwall is too low hanging fruit at this point i think the biggest thing is im not really sure why the mattel dudes went to barbieland they pretty much just yeeted from the story at that point onwards and then didnt even really seem to do much at the ending,2023-07-25 00:40:34
a very pretty movie filled with very pretty people with an interesting plot it hits on fauxfeminism actual feminism the radicalization of disengaged men and redemption its a really great movie,2023-07-29 21:00:58
alan was a highlight for me of the movie for sure michael cera was the perfect choice and i haven’t seen anyone talk about kate mckinnon as weird barbie she was  hysterical with the constant splits,2023-07-31 14:56:29
"the movie was visually dazzling lots of fun and had a lot of heart but could have been better if it had been more focused they introduced more plotlines than they could resolve which is why they have the characters straight up describe the ending in fact the ending is a testament to how the film starts out so strong only to get weaker as it goes on after being able to beautifully show without telling in the earlier part of the movie like when barbie sees the beauty of an elderly woman or when barbie starts picking up on an aggressive male gaze at the boardwalk they resort to just describing feminism and patriarchy in the latter half of the movie 

with that being said the movie was so visually striking and fun that i adored it despite its flaws",2023-08-03 13:58:07

why do people say that barbie is overwhelmingly a kids movie i was reading some reviews of the movie and i saw some people defending some aspects of the movie saying that it’s supposed to be a kids movie but i disagree i mean yeah barbie is a toy for kids and a kid could watch this movie but i feel like it’s deflecting criticism by saying it’s a “kids” movie i feel like the ideas were made to appeal to older people satirizing barbie rather than solely appealing to children also a decent amount of the jokes messages innuendos etc would not be comprehensible to kids am i missing something or is it intended for adults i don’t think it’s one of those things where they add in some jokes for adults watching with their kids either it’s too common for that,2023-07-26 23:37:27

went into it with quite low expectations but it really surprised me some moments made me audibly laugh and i needed that a lot some parts made me cry 3 times to be exact and some parts were slightly cringey but tolerable it was a very heartwarming and refreshing movie and it completely surpassed my expectations for it being a film about a doll and seriously the kens played their part well

i’m an 18 year old girl and barbie made quite an impact on me it made me think of my own mum in a different light — and other women in general too i’d love to watch it again soon d",2023-08-06 07:30:41

"i really loved ryan gosling and margot robbie in this movie  those two absolutely stole the show in my opinion they just played their roles amazingly  i actually think that barbie felt a little underdeveloped for where she ended up as  i just really didnt like the mom and daughter  the daughters first line made me eyeroll and the mom had some sweet moments but her saving by talkinh about the real world and the whole patriarchy plot felt bleh  i dont hate these ideas at all and in a barbie movie could be explored really thouroughly but it just felt forced and too on the nose to where it felt kind of pretensious  you could automatically read where the mom and daughter were gonna end up the moment you meet them and they just seemed so predictable and dont capitalize in their moments to make me feel for them by seeming pretensious  theres no subtlety at all and it hurts because barbies development is tied to them  barbie was actually amazing in this  the scene where she was sitting on the bench when she was in the kitchen and her final couple scence were amazing but it got sidelined for a dumb plot

despite being harsh again margot robbie and ryan gosling are amazing actors  the set design is dropdesd gorgeous and genius  it was actually pretty funny at moments and the concept is cool  also i feel like allen shouldve bonded with that one desk guy  like idk what was the point of allen in the end  he was really just there for no reason and the idea that he could represent the struggling class of people was right there",2023-07-23 05:06:22
greatest chevrolet commercial ever made,2023-07-26 09:05:37
i enjoyed the movie  i thought some of the messaging seemed inconsistent but what im wondering about is the cosmology of barbieland  millions of stereotypical barbies have been sold  margot robbies barbie starts to see effects from the person playing with her in the real world  does that mean that there are actually millions of barbielands each with their own margot robbie each corresponding to a doll in the real world,2023-07-29 23:25:07

"the film is a propaganda piece that makes fun of the feminist and womens equality movement   


the barbies have a mundane and monotonous society that oppresses an entire half of their population then ken visits the real world brings ideas he found there back to the barbies liberates the other kens from their subjugated lives then ultimately loses to barbie because they were tricked into fighting each other in order to miss out on an important constitutional vote when the barbies restore their oppressive system they force the kens to have a menial and powerless lower court judge position refusing to give them equality it literally makes it out that a society created and ruled by women would be horrible

why would women think this film is empowering is beyond me",2024-01-28 05:53:38

y’all not enough can be said about how fun this movie was so instead all i’ll say is the theater between barbie and oppenheimer had no parking left so people were lining curbs and parking in nearby parking lots these movies are both gonna be huge,2023-07-22 03:22:08

"can we talk about how the ending in which barbie had a trippy scene with her creator and gets transformed into a human was weirdly similar to the ending of 2001 space odyssey where the main character travels trough weird colors basically meets  and gets transformed into a giant space baby

when two kens kiss ryan gosling on his cheeks during the dance scene after he twirls them around and he giggles and looks so happy and bashful  my favourite part of the whole movie d it looked like it was his genuine reaction and he was trying to suppress it,2023-07-27 10:10:14

"something i dont think ive seen anyone else mention is how patriarchy aside we men are just all little boys inside in that if not for society  maturity most of us would be happy doing what we think is cool 

ken had 3 watches puts on sunglasses on top of sunglasses he names his house mojo dojo casa house  rather than their faces he puts 4 horses on mt rushmore ive seen the dumb amount of fun men have when theyre doing random  that doesnt really amount to anything but just sounds fun to do when they get together  i feel that goslings ken definitely showcased that",2023-07-31 13:12:20

"i didnt have high hopes for this movie but i just came out of the cinema and ive got to say this movie is so smart on so many levels its really all about what it means to be human its about our fantasies and projections its about societal expectations and peer pressure its about mortality and transience there are so many levels to it 

the reference to 2001 a space odyssey at the beginning sets the movie up in that way and the rest of the movie keeps delivering on that 

i was so happy to see rhea perlman it didnt know shed be in it the scenes with her kind of blew my mind i kept thinking about carla from cheers 

i lost it when ken says i won a nobel prize in horses i needed that laugh so bad 

the fact that the movie in part functions as a big advertisement for mattel bothers me but thats certainly not all that the movie is

the pink everywhere and the pop music and the dancing that stuff is not my aesthetic at all i loved this movie despite all of that

its just a smart movie about the human condition ill be thinking about it for a long time",2023-08-14 00:47:06
"i expected more from a greta gerwig movie

i thought that it would be more insightful and progressive but it was a lot simpler and just a fairly basic predictable movie",2023-10-18 23:20:37
i did not like this movie it was way too advertised and glorified the actual movie was kinda boring and the plot was dumb i feel like this movie in my opinion is way too overrated,2023-12-03 06:34:58
"i finally saw it now that its free to stream i have to say im glad i didnt pay to rent it 

there were definitely fun moments like the ken song and barbieken in la shout out to the depressed barbie montage with the bbc pride and prejudice miniseries i felt that in my soul but overall i thought it was just ok it just had an angriermore depressed vibe than i was expecting  i found myself feeling more empathy for ken than barbie and i dont think thats what this movie intended he was kind of a  but he just wanted to be noticed and loved 

also i was very curious as to how ken was able to brainwash all the barbies i was hoping wed get to see what happened with ken once hed returned to barbieland",2023-12-19 01:17:45
to be honest i got bored of the patriarchy when i realized it wasnt about horses was probably my favorite  line ,2023-07-21 18:06:33
"i figured barbie would be a fun watch but i didn’t expect to love it as much as i did  it perfectly toed the line between making fun of barbie and honoring barbie  in order to poke fun at something you need to know it inside and out and the writers did their homework  all the specific dollsoutfits how barbies bend brushes that don’t actually brush their hair those little white twist ties holding them in the boxthey got every little specific detail right
 

i thought it was so clever that in the end the barbie world remains matriarchal but throws a few concessions to the kens mirroring the real world where the world remains patriarchal but has essentially thrown a few concessions to women  


i also appreciated the acknowledgement robbie was playing “stereotypical” barbie and that there were lots of different women represented as barbies in barbieworld  as robbie was crying about feeling bad and unpretty i was about to roll my eyes before mirren cuts in with the perfect 4th wall break about how robbie isn’t the ideal casting choice to deliver this line  perfect  similar to when the girls at lunch are just like “you are an unrealistic standard  i mean just look at you”  it just felt like every time the writers were about to fall in a trap they wrote themselves out of it  even having the mother being the one in need of barbie rather than the daughter was brilliant


and of course gosling  gosling was hilarious  please keep casting gosling in comedies  barbie crazy  love the nice guys…excellent  the scene of him running around ca discovering the patriarchy  hilarious",2023-07-21 02:37:28
i love that gosling sings matchbox twenty just like i do,2023-07-21 12:28:39

"okay so everyone and their mother has thoughts on barbie so instead of talking about how awesome of a movie it is generally i want to focus on this notion that its antimen

sure they definitely poke fun at masculine stereotypes but lest we forget the entire movie also calls out the impossible feminine standards set by barbie herself it is dissecting the very concept of gender and its implications on society men are in a constant war to dominate each other while women are being held to extreme standards set by both men and other women its a hyperbolic and satirical take on gender conflict

but the end has perhaps one of the best be yourself lessons ever because both barbie and ken realize theyre more than the roles set out for them they manage to find purpose and agency where before they were just acting out a play

barbie is a person 

ken is kenough

being yourself matters more than whatever society thinks of you

"barbieland is our girlhood — when we are naive about the world and honestly believe we can be “whatever we want to be”  many girls are zapped into the “real world” when we encounter the male gaze as soon as we approach puberty  i was 12 when i started getting harassed by grown men at the bus stop  yes violent threats were commonplace 

barbieland is a matriarchy but the kens are not objectified nor pushed into servitude — they just coexist with the barbies but are still accessories to the barbies with no real agency or identity of their own 

transitioning to the real world is like the coming of age for many girls and boys barbie instantly feels objectified with “an undercurrent of violence” but ken is discovering he simply for being a man is at the top of the power pyramid 

when ken comes back he institutes a learned patriarchy in a zero sum manner it’s not enough to just run off with the kens and start their own society but they do so at the expense of the barbies they take their homes their cars and push them into a hierarchical servitude 

when barbie comes back and teams up with the other barbies to correct the patriarchy she implores ken to find meaning as ken not just as an accessory to barbie she acknowledges the matriarchy wasn’t fair either  she wants him to live out his own purpose to have agency — even after everything he did  ken isn’t evil and the barbies aren’t manhaters but the kens fell victim to patriarchy too as men 

when ruth barbie’s mom takes barbie’s hand and walks off to have a private conversation with her this scene to me symbolizes the special relationship mothers can have with their daughters 

we as mothers know the hurt that is our society and how it treats women especially women who haven’t been “broken” by the patriarchy yet — but we cannot bear ourselves to be complete cynics to our young daughters we do not abandon the idea of the utopia in the hopes that one day our daughters way down the line might finally reap the seeds we have been planting for millennia 

the montage of women at the end represent the countless women who have come before us bore the even harsher base realities of patriarchy yet still collectively have kept the sisterhood alive 

the very last scene is made to be like typical close out scenes — aspirational and gearing you up for a real feel good ending 

barbie chose to live in the real world despite a guaranteed troubled existence she chose to “have ideas” and make a difference rather than continue living life as an object many women have this radicalizing moment themselves in their own lives — dare i say when we get “woke” to patriarchy and the   glass ceiling 

she becomes the ordinary woman heading to her gynecologist appointment — a completely mundane activity 

she’s just a woman and that is just fine",2023-08-07 03:17:17

"just saw it today and  i enjoyed it think the only weak point for me was that the will ferrell character could have been played by a nameless suit and present in less scenes

i laughed at so many of the jokes and the cast was fantastic probably my favourite gosling performance and just makes me wish for him to do more musicals im just ken is absolutely iconic i would honestly be shocked if they dont make a broadway show of this film the entire premise fits the stage so well and they have a banger song already also was nice to see simu liu in this if they made zoolander now hed definitely have a role in it i think",2023-09-13 21:00:07
i really liked the tongue in cheek dystopia i think they pulled off the idea pretty well tons of funny little gags amazing set design and costumes i got the message they were sending but i didnt find it landed all that well and it lost steam past the midpoint also found it very strange that the mattel people also acted so toy like despite living in the real world,2024-01-03 09:59:25
"this movie is definitely showing me that not a lot of people have the ability to laugh at themselves

the entire montage of ken’s doing things to try and impress the barbie’ so close to home that i was crying laughing the ken who was breaking down why the godfather is a masterpiece felt like looking in a mirror",2023-07-25 00:59:32
i desperately need the jellyfish necklace that author barbie was wearing,2023-07-22 02:01:36
really liked the barbie movie although the message they wanted to send got quite a bit muddled in my view still an absurdist delight with a lot meta commentary that rarely becomes overbearing at least for me also don’t know what the  matt gaetz’s wife was whining about the movie actually makes it a point to highlight how men can also be effected by the new paradigm of “female empowerment” and made to feel insignificant and the importance of celebrating their unique qualities and talents as well granted it wasn’t the most fleshed out commentary with ken but i mean it was there more than i can see for other “female lead” movies,2023-07-23 02:37:01
barbie  oppenheimer  don’t worry darling,2023-07-23 12:51:01
did the whole barbenheimer thing and while i enjoyed both movies why do i feel like out of the two movies barbie was the more nuanced in terms of the messaging the surface level feminist message was clear as day and lacked some depth which is definitely to be expected given at the end of the day it still is the barbie movie but i feel like they did a good job exploring some of the more subtle nuances of the patriarchy and gender roles in society which i thought was pretty cool both movies probably get 910s from me personally though,2023-07-24 05:41:52

"i finally went to see it last night and i thought it was one of the most unique blockbuster films i’ve ever seen it feels like there are a lot of different things the film tries to balance and most of the time it does a decent job at it

it’s one of the most interesting films to deconstruct in recent memory because i can truly see how a person could view this as one of the best films of the year but another person could see it as one of the worst",2023-08-07 12:10:18

i can’t tell if it’s because a lot of people are seeing it for the 2nd time or if the jokes have been spoiled on tiktok for newcomers either way made me remember why new comedies are so fun to go to in the theater",2023-08-08 02:38:44

"i loved barbie i think its getting oversimplified into something antiman i dont think it was at all 

it was unapologetically feminist but it ripped into inequality both ways people are empathizing with ken and thats intentional they wouldnt have made him sympathetic if that wasnt the point 

not to mention the inclusion of allan at all was there to illustrate not all men subscribe to patriarchal views

did it spend a lot of time ribbing patriarchal structures 100 did it also point out that matriarchy is hypocritical and misandry isnt the answer yes pretty overtly",2023-07-26 02:10:35
"the barbie movie really blew away my expectations from the start i knew there would be darker and lighter themes but the trailers and initial parts of the film made it seem like it would be about barbie the perfect fantasy superheroineoffemininity helping a struggling girl with her problems but the movie then does a 180 turnaround and says  that and focuses on the two normal humans helping barbie with her problems   
  
barbies ultrafeminist matriarcal utopia ideal is torn down harder than the baby dolls were satirically at the start of the movie where they declared and then gender role problems were solved forever yay in a move that brought to mind that infamous pepsi is the solution to all conflict commercial   
  
firstly by reality where its harshly criticized that her impossible standards feel like just another way society pressures women to meet expectations that cannot be met   
  
but then also by ken who we see has his feelings dismissed as unimportant and who doesnt know how to have selfconfidence without tying it to someone else hes surprisingly interesting to me in how hes framed as the antagonist but you can clearly see hes just someone who felt rejected and disrespected and unimportant only to find all these books in the real world about patriarchy and how if you just do that youll get all the respect and importance and women you could ever desire   
  
so he does turning barbie land into dudebro land and flipping the entire hierarchy upsidedown the barbies fighting to take things back by underhanded emotional manipulation of their fragile masculinity   
  
it works but the scene after is why it works yes weve played with the idea of barbie and deconstructing its interaction with gender roles with all the subtlety of a plastic hammer but whats the resolution ken is crying on barbies bed venting to her about how he felt disrespected unappreciated and felt the need to constantly fight for her attention because he didnt know who he was without her and she listens and apologizes for how she made him feel   
  
because this movie isnt about a plastic perfect personification of feminism going to the real world and fixing a depressed womans body issues this movie isnt about barbie and her fellow girlbosses overthrowing the patriarchy and restoring barbieland to how its supposed to be  
  
its a movie about people who feel disrespected and underappreciated about people who see ideas about who they should be and try to cram themselves into that mold because then they will get the love or attention or respect they crave more than anything in the world its not about trying to be perfect but recognizing that we can be better not with hair extensions or makeup or working out and acting macho but with telling someone you look nice today or your feelings are valid being there for each other but also for ourselves",2023-07-26 17:40:20
"what made the whole story click together for me

i loved the movie on the first watch because of all the onthenose validating moments on the second i wanted to understand all the intentional elements like many people i saw the individual pieces but couldnt make sense of the whole picture it took half the walk home to get to where i am now i empathize with some comments saying things felt too spelled out and disjointed what ended up pulling it together for me was what will ferrells character emphasised that barbieland at its core is what fuels the hopes and dreams of young girls it isnt a reflection of a better world or a world run by women just a young girls internal world like many of ours spearheaded by barbie

something i battled with was why was it ok the barbies to overthrow kens back for a system that favors one side way more when thats theoretically just the problem of patriarchy in reverse but it makes sense with barbieland being the home of young girls minds and dreams needing to be maintained waking the barbies from brainwashing supported young girls dreams centering their personal missions not their kens it made the touch of maid outfits so appropriate

and when the kens took over it was only a manly surface decoration over the pink dream houses it was a girls internal world smothered by the image of men it isn’t foundationally a boys world or neutral land it’s stolen land which is why the barbies were justified in taking it back hence the smallpox reference the barbies taking back barbieland wasnt for just their own comfort but to defend the real world girls selfimage feuled by mattel’s toys the established barbie image is far from perfect as the movie insinuates but it was definitely essential that the ideas of powerful girly women not be completely eradicated by romantisised patriarchy in the world of young girls

ken’s version of patriarchy looked so goofy and couldnt work in the real world because its what a girl’s mind thinks having patriarchy work for them looks like the idea that an easy romantic life waits for girls if theyre dumber skimpier obedient and following confident cowboy men the kens and barbies both lived so absurdly happy in either version because barbieland is founded on young girls imagining their lives as harmoniously perfect the tempting ideas of patriarchy can fit right into that the issue as a whole only started to break down with the exposure and acceptance of being sad weird and imperfect via barbies journey outcast barbies and the humans patriarchy was just another vessel for barbieland to see the flaws of blindly following perfection triggered by the point of monologue it starts the whole discussion for change and acknowledges the flaws of barbieland including treatment of ken and other babies

oh and kens turn on barbie really is really a show of how our perception of men when we are young can betray us once we go into the real world

this was an adhd barf hope people can relate to this its how everything from the movie came together for me these were some of my connections but after reframing it in this way made many small details fall into place and now i think this story is incredibly well thought out and is a personal love of mine

in hindsight brabieland being the materialization of girlhood was constantly iterated by how barbie was linked to gloria the toys changing in the real world and will ferrells obsession with keeping the balance but i guess that just didnt click for me as i was watching it made sense of why the kens were as nonessencial as they were why they had to lose their power the role of gloria and the outcasts and why babrieland had to change in the end now i really get all those saying “it isnt for you” because it only tackles men through the perspective of vulnerable fantasy girlhood in fact it barely addresses real world men and the fleeting moments that do are quite humanising",2023-08-06 03:09:22

while i loved the monologue there were some bits after that where i felt like they were hitting me over the head with the message when at the start it was wonderfully interwoven and comically done kens character arc was more eventful and interesting than barbies when you really boil it down and yet his revelations at the end were just dismissed while barbies ending urgh i know people will disagree with me here so im waiting for the downvotes but having her choose to go to the real world felt really wrong 

i loved when she and ken went there he was having a great time and she was trying to describe strange feelings  automatic feelings  that shed never had before like anxiety fear  etc interestingly my husband didnt get this at all and i had to explain how mostall women genuinely do feel like that most of the time he looked a bit shocked then the daughter telling her everyone hates barbie and what she represents that would have been me btw i hated barbie when i was young for all the reasons she says its clear the real world is the real world we know  a hard place for women but at the end when she says shed like to go live in the real world its never really explained why she would want to and then ruth says she cant in good conscience let her go without showing her what its really like before filling her head with female perfection  all laughter and sunshine and happy families thats not what its really like ruth conned her given the subversive nature of the rest of the film i expected ruth to show her what it was really like  periods pregnancy abortion issues lower wages abuse sexism healthcare menopause  and for barbie to say you know what no thanks ill stay where i am and keep improving barbieland like the scene with weird barbie who i loved and the shoes the fact it ended with her in a gyns office just felt like a bad joke and i didnt know if it was meant to be a bad joke  haha barbie you think the real world is so great welcome to the  that is being a woman 

i think the film was trying to show that a matriarchy can be just as bad as a patriarchy and it did that really well at the beginning but not well at the end i suspect that was intentional but it ended up being messy and vague 

and lastly i knew nothing about the history of barbie before seeing this film but i read a couple of articles beforehand and had a newfound respect for the doll because other dolls were babies to made girls want to be mothers like the film hilariously points out and barbie never had kids because shes supposed to be whatever she wants to be while i never realised  before and which i really liked but then glorias big idea was to make an everyday barbie who was a mum and ruth showed barbie happy family type images why not show happy women doing other things their own things isnt that what barbie was supposed to be i found that message pretty disappointing

what i will say though ryan gosling was having a blast making that movie",2023-08-07 13:33:37
"pros nostalgia great aesthetic good acting

cons weird clunky storyline unclear overall message superfluous characters and side plots that did not make sense

i wanted to love this movie and at the beginning when they were introducing barbie world i thought i would i’m just confused at the rave reviews it’s getting for me it was a bit of a disappointment",2023-09-14 14:31:47

"greta gerwig we simply do not deserve you 

im so happy to say that after having huge expectations for this movie that i was still blown away by how hilarious it is and how deeply connected to the human experience it feels 

i loved the dream world of barbie and every single performance going on there usually when a movie like this goes to the real world thats when it starts to go downhill but not barbie robbie perfectly embodies the abstract concept of the stereotypical barbie but when her consciousness gets flipped on and she goes to the real world she has some incredible scenes i loved how when her and ken first arrive shes met with anxiety and seemingly violent aggression whereas ken picks up right away that this world was made for him and he feels absolutely none of that 

its moments like that that make barbie truly one of the most interesting and intelligent social commentaries weve gotten in such a big budget the thematic implications of this movie are insane and it doesnt feel like theyre brought up and brushed aside but rather that gerwig is using the beautiful artifice of barbie to really dig into them its kind of wild that mattel even let her go this hard not just on the themes of social expectation but also kind of calling them out for being run by businessmen will ferrell being the funniest hes been in years here

this movie is so much more than a brilliant exploration of feminism and feminiminity its about the whole human experience its about the difference between what young girls and young boys read about the world and their place in it its about our connection to our toys and what plastic models can mean to developing minds its about male insecurity and how men are so starved for validation that someone asking them what time it is makes them feel like a king its about how men and women interact with each other and how society is so demanding that they pair up its about the changing ideas of what feminism or progressivism means now vs then its about patriarchy and business ethics and seemingly every feeling that we as people have on a day to day basis its about everything

the plot is exactly what it needs to be to convey all these things when the motherdaughter plotline got involved i thought maybe this was going to be more tropey than i thought but it really continued to surprise me at every turn they werent there to distract the movie or shove in a kid character them and barbie each represented different evolutions of feminism

americas speech at the end about how criticized women are and how much is expected of them to walk this perfect line between independence and femininity was insanely well written and acted if this movie just had that to say it would have been great but there was so much more to this really something for everybody here this isnt just for girls or women but for anybody who experiences the mess of feelings and desires that it is to be human 

i just  loved this it had me thinking the entire time but also getting some of the biggest laughs this year in moments like when every ken was singing push by matchbox 20 or every single hilarious thing gosling did and said this is an easy 910 and it could go higher on rewatches this will absolutely be my new comfort movie when it comes out on blu ray

do you know how many times ive wanted to stand up in the boardroom and just say lets all tickle each other

when i realized patriarchy wasnt all about horses i kind of lost interest in it

so quotable

"when the authoritarian power structure fractured the minority groups to literally fistfight among themselves while they undemocratically changed the constitution  

solid 45  i want to see the version without matells permission  ferrell famously did a version of one for them one for you in lettermans last week maybe and i kept thinking about it in terms of gerwig  i can make any movie i want now  she winks at the audience the whole time and the biggest punches were the most subtle  

i mean at the end of the movie the girls all win the status quo is returned and barbie frowns  the harry potter reference is obvious but its pulling from a big well  it made me think of carlin as rufus and neverending story as well  perlman is perfect casting  

anyway maybe im an idiot and the only problem with authoritarian power structures is the gender involved but i really did not read the film that way",2023-08-07 21:42:42

"so ive read a lot of comments about how the barbies should have done better and given equal opportunity to the kens and you know what no

when the dialogue happened where they werent given a a seat on the supreme court i felt a tinge of this isnt right they should do better and do the right thing i even thought but the kens are so simple minded they couldnt possibly handle that and then i realized this is how men have viewed women forever so yes the kens should get a seat just as women in the real world should get a full seat but but we havent weve started to but we havent and the barbie world is a reflection of the real world in inverse so when the men in our world shape up the barbies will 

as for the people saying the barbies should lead by example theres a saying from the bible people like to quote do unto others that frankly i think gets hammered into women more than men at least on gendered issues cause historically men havent followed it where women are concerned and why should the barbies start change their society is relatively new compared to the real world oppression of women youre just expecting us to be polite and civil like you have basically enslaved us to be for thousands of years its on men to start change now i dont think thats unfair

as for the people not liking how the barbies manipulated the kens into fighting each other tough   they brainwashed enslaved and made the barbies homeless with no rights alls fair in that scenario yes its bad to manipulate a romantic partner that way but if thats the stakes have at er

otherwise i enjoyed the movie and literally laughed more than i ever had in a theatre",2023-08-29 06:29:12
"am i being sexist or does the matriarchy of barbieland treat the kens as bad if not worse than the real world treats women i am genuinely asking

i will make this clear i am a male i do not want to start something awful and i do not want to be perceived as some hateful bigot i like the movie it was fun and had a lot of great points about the unfair double standards women have to weave through in the patriarchal society we live in but theres a line in the movie that just leaves a bad taste in my mouth

when barbie returns to barbieland with the mom and her daughter she shows her around the dreamhouses and says that every barbie lives in one of the dreamhouses but when the mom asks where the kens stay barbie has no idea that got me thinking what do the kens even do

no seriously what are they allowed to do what are they allowed to own they dont have houses they dont have cars they dont even have real jobs the only exception being lifeguard ken to my memory they just do things that most people would only have as either a hobby or athletic career the only thing that they do to contribute to the barbies is just stand aside and look nice

i know how all this sounds and i know that as a man i have no ground to stand on for a film about feminism but they play up barbie land as being something better than reality when all honesty it just looks like the genderband version of what we have today or more accurately what we had 50 years ago a world where one  controls the world and the other is just seen as an accessory it just seems kind of hypocritical when one of the first lines of the movie was praising barbie for bringing about gender equality",2023-08-31 02:41:19

"i think that this is the first time a massive tentpole movie has been directed at adult women  there are other very female movies like legally blonde and there are disney princess movies aimed at little girls but this is the first event on par with superhero movies aimed at grown women  female driven comic book movies can be great but they still come from a male world  barbie was created by a woman and her audience has generally been little girls  the weird joy of seeing barbie you played with as a child onscreen only exists for those who played with them  i wasnt even super into barbie as a kid but i legit squealed seeing a few specific ones onscreen 

greta gerwig is a woman who grew up in america and thus inevitably played with barbies  that is how you get the very real weird barbie  it is also how you get barbie floating out of her house  that is how girls play  and no no one thinks about where ken lives or what he does when he is not squiring barbie around  maybe young boys will become more drawn to ken and he will develop his own less toxic masculine world but as it stands now he is a supporting character

greta gerwig is also a mother who made a whole movie about difficult teenage girls  a lot of other filmmakers would have made the central human character sasha but gloria is the central human here  shes the one who calls barbie to the real world and her struggles help the barbies snap out of patriarchy  centering a woman rather than a girl really changes the tone of the movie

greta gerwig is also an elder millennial and you get a lot of references to that with depression watching pride and prejudice and the kens singing matchbox twenty at the barbies  

there is a critique of maleness here and i understand how that makes some guys uncomfortable  but i genuinely laughed when they distracted ken by asking him to explain the godfather because that is a real thing

it is not the be all end all of feminist representation  it is simplistic in a lot of ways  as upinkpugita pointed out it is easy for barbie to choose the real world when that means being a beautiful privileged woman instead of working in a sweatshop in the developing world  the movie is very american  but putting the word patriarchy at the center of a tentpole movie is still bold",2023-07-24 01:40:33
"
my second comment on the film now that the internet is still raging on about this movie and its evilness or something


the movie isnt antimen or antiwomen its anti modern day societys expectations for both and the message everyone should get from it is that being yourself is all you need to have value 


ken isnt being used as a prop to direct manhate on his two arcs in chasing barbies approval and then the patriarchy are used to mock how ridiculous societys pressures on modern men are men are increasingly shamed and mocked for having no value if they are single these days and this movie addresses this in comedic fashion by mocking the ridiculous things they do and the lack of selfrespect the kens have for themselves in blindly chasing a woman for no apparent reason beyond its their programming and then the patriarchy stuff mocks the growing sentiment that men these days need to be more alpha and dominant by showing how utterly  it is in an entertaining manner 


similarlythe growing sentiment that women dont need men cuz girl power which ends up directing hate towards men is mocked with the oppressive matriarchy of barbieworld the heroes winning in the end doesnt feel remotely heroic cuz of how its the exact same as the kendom and only now decided to make some progress to reduce inequality and the pressures barbie faces in the movie first with her physical imperfections and then with uber progressive daughter mock other pressures women face nowadays one that they need to look perfect at all times and the other that individual women have an unfeasible holy mission to solve the injustices and inequalities of the world or else they betray their  former is mocked with the hilarious quip about how margot robbie isnt a good choice for talking about how  she is and the latter with the bit where the daughter blurts out that barbie is a white saviour and calling her a fascist to show that people will never be satisfied and look to find hate and problems in anything 


both ken and barbie end the movie happy and with the discovery that just being themselves is what makes them happy 


its rare that we get a movie that gives positive messages for both guys and girls whilst tackling specific modern issues let alone a big and successful one which is also super fun like this one people are too deadset in their ways by finding ways to be miserable and offended by this film which just shows that they are refusing to let go of their ideology in this weird cultural war thats waged today people just need to have fun and be themselves",2023-07-27 18:05:44

"theres such an energy around this movie not just on screen but around it too its so much fun going to a theatre and people are dressed up in pink having a good time films are back baby and i love when people can rally about a movie that is actually good tm c 

and this is actually good for real 

one part elf one part pleasantville throw in some lego movie and then sprinkle some pink on it and weve got a good  time really silly and self aware and brave in a lot of ways its not afraid to make fun of itself and kudos to mattel for being a brand brave enough to face their criticisms head on even if overall its a commercial for the doll and the new direction theyre heading towards i think it has an incredible message about female empowerment and living life on your own terms not the way our male centric society decides you too but also its speaking to men and its trying to bridge the gap between our genders and foster some understanding for everyone i think some people will see this as vessel to make fun of men but these people are dumb lol its okay be poked fun of guys just like its still okay to like horses theyre very manly very cool i found the whole concept of  ken going to the real world and seeing how much men control and getting a bit power hungry because of that so smart its a really clever plot device to bring some conflict into the movie 

from a filmmaking standpoint i was most impressed with the art direction obviously the sets and costumes are incredible and im sure were a labour of love just give the movie all the oscars in that regard huge achievement and just nailed the look of a larger than life barbie world i was also impressed with the music lot of jams and the movie is like pretty much a musical at times and a good one at that 

i think the whole cast was great michael cera as alan killed margot robbie was exceptional in the title role but gosling steals the show here his character couldve been really over the top and not in a good wayits a really fine line and gosling just handles it perfectly an iconic comedic performance and one that will just shut up any doubter that he wasnt right for this role the dude kills it and im so proud hes canadian it is a little ironic that a film about barbie and female empowerment is a little overshadowed at times by his performance i feel a little conflicted about this but you cant deny that hes probably the best thing about this movie that just ken song rips 

i think the movie is at its best when its slowed down and introspective when we see barbie take a moment to just experience life and her new feelings its very beautiful the movie doesnt work for me in the moments its trying to be a chevrolet commercial yes you read that right the most forced product placement in a movie about a product i also understand the mother and daughters purpose in the plot of the film but i just felt them tacked on and unneeded and the daughter  was not a particularly good actress painful to say the mattel executives too felt like an after thought and not very important or funny sorry will ferrell  

lots to talk about and ill get even more from subsequent viewings i think this movie really speaks to women and i love that people are so stoked on this and i had a blast too while not an exactly original ip it is an original story and the studios need to see that good unique films get people excited lets  gooooo",2023-07-22 02:21:19

i think a major key to understanding this movie is that barbieland is not “the way things should be” barbieland is almost a revenge fantasy created by ruth handler’s character and the girls who played with the barbies and kens it’s a reaction to the patriarchy,2023-07-24 14:04:59
"really enjoyed it super funny kate mckinnon and michael cera were great side characters script had so many little oneoff jokes that were amazing guys explaining scarface set designs and choreography were also incredible i had a smile on my face for almost the whole movie

my main critiques would be that some parts did feel very onthenose especially that speech about the plight of women it felt very forced like they were trying to spoonfeed the social commentary that had already been conveyed in more creative ways throughout

the ending also fell a little flat for me  i wasnt convinced why barbie needed to leave the restored barbieland and live in the realworld my guess is that they are setting it up for a sequel",2023-07-24 15:29:07
"overall i think the movie was good with some heavyhanded themes and messages but that doesnt diminish the movie at all   
i think the ending would have been far better if it had stuck to one concise message instead it jumped around to a message about ken being his own person then toxic masculinity then it cut to the mattel ceo and he said something i forgot what he said to be honest since he really added nothing to the scene to president barbie saying that the world needs to change then to president barbie saying that the kens still arent going to be given any positions of power in the movie and finally to barbie wanting to become human i personally just think that instead of addressing 5 to 6 messages halfheartedly the movie should have stuck to 1 or 2 that it could have addressed fully and thoroughly 

i also think its very weird that barbie is so invested in saving the barbie world from the patriarchy but then goes into the real world where there is a far more oppressive and serious patriarchy maybe if there was a line about her wanting to go to the real world to empower women it would have made more sense ",2023-07-24 20:56:41

one of the things i appreciate the most is on the meta level the sense of sisterhood sparked by the movie starting from the people dressing in pink to reminiscing the happiness we felt when we were little girls and played with barbie each of us sharing childhood memories our favorite barbie the family members who bought them for us and the deep conversations we had with the other girls about femininity our struggles yes and the unfairness but also the things we love and enjoy about being ordinary barbies

"i think there’s layered themes to this movie that need unpacking almost like all the different worlds barbie has to pass through before entering into the real world though all the themes are just conveying a singular message it is only when we stop defining ourselves by others ill intent or well intent that we can allow ourselves to live these definitions become a box that suffocates us what is explored in this movie are all the “others” that exist in a modern societies 

the most powerful one the last one addressed in the movie the firsts being matriarchy feminism and patriarchy is how we are being defined by our parents the dad represented by the ceo and the mom represented by ruth while the dad somewhat simplistic but well intended by just wanting their daughter to fall in love as their ending…it is until we are released by that can barbie live that was the dads idea and definition of barbie the mom represented by ruth is to allow barbie be who she is something more than an idea and it is only when she wants to outgrow that that she becomes human

"liked it but kind of gets muddled in the last third the barbies seem just as happy being maids as they are holding office which makes them seem dumber than gerwig intended glorias deprogramming speech is a weird one because the barbies have no real frame of reference for what shes talking about the struggle she talks about is her struggle in her world but it doesnt mean anything to them unless you think about barbieland or this version of it being glorias creation

x200b

i think my favourite scene is where barbie first gets to the real world and sits on the bench robbie does a great job of showing barbie experiencing all this emotion for the first time from seeing the couple laughing to seeing someone just looking sad and telling that old lady that shes beautiful despite it being called barbie it doesnt really give her that much to work with you can argue gosling has the clearer arc but the few grace notes she gets she kills it",2023-09-21 17:25:50
film shows that superficial knowledge of patriarchy leads people to  actions i like that but i think most of womens problems wich we hear when margo and others try to help zombified girls are mens problems too almost all stuff except motherhood concerns all modern people also idea that human is important in itself is very infantile you have to do a lot to be important,2023-10-08 22:29:57
i just saw movie with my wife im like mid 30s so this isnt my movie at all and it was fine i guess silly movie but i duno i was quite emotional near the end thinking about my daughters and how tough its going to be for them i dunno,2023-10-14 07:01:42
i liked it a lot im surprised that there is controversy around it but i guess people just didnt like that ken didnt get the girl in the end and took some things too literally,2023-11-24 12:27:02
"watched the movie last night and my personal takeaway is that the internet simply has not been normal about it it’s a good movie with gorgeous coloring and some very welldone emotional moments the old woman at the bus stop the entire motherdaughter arc the ending with ruth is it corny and onthenose well yes is it some pinnacle of feminist thought no i didn’t love america’s speech when i first saw it but it makes sense in context because her character is very sympathetic imo i wasn’t all that floored by ryan’s acting and thought margot was much more memorable some of the outrage about how it’s a slight against feminism not to nominate her or greta is uh interesting the tiktoks i’ve seen reinforce my belief that this generation really struggles with critical media analysis without using online buzzwords ultimately i think it’s a good movie about girlhood and the fact that such a corny pastel wonderland got made and then became the biggest film of the year is a great statement for girls to hear 

a lot of people have criticized it for providing a simplistic definition of feminism which uh yes were you seriously expecting capitalist critique and intersectionality from a movie about a doll not every piece of feminist media has to include the maximum amount of nuance the script was filled with selfaware jokes about how problematic the character of barbie inherently is for example the kid called barbie a white savior only to be corrected that’s about the most intersectionality you can expect from a movie about barbie i just don’t think that is relevant critique at all when the movie never claimed to reflect the experience of every woman at the end of the movie america suggests a barbie doll that will represent the average woman who is content with her life but still struggles daytoday that’s basically who the movie is directed towards there is room in pop culture for a movie like that which does not delve into the struggles of every marginalized group barbie covers only one aspect of the female experience and that’s okay 

finally mattel’s storyline is indeed halfbaked but the movie’s selfawareness kind of makes up for it they still mock mattel until the very end is it ironic that this movie is also essentially a commercial for mattel’s products well yes expecting capitalist critique beyond lighthearted satire is also asinine you’d be surprised by how few offline people would want to see capitalism criticized anyway all in all that part of the story could’ve been done better or excluded altogether because i don’t think the selfaware jokes landed that well here

"i am so much disappointed with the ending of that movie it had a good promise but last 20 minutes ruined everything  


i believed that ken patriarchy was a parody of all sigma male  andrew tate fans mindset it seemed logical to show that when barbies do not care about kens then the kens rebel and express ultramale behaviors like that sigma male bs when kens gave up on patriarchy i hoped the movie would end with conclusion that ken doesnt need to be overly masculine to be seen worthy and barbie doesnt need to be perfect to be a barbie but instead it showed that kens after ending patriarchy again became trash and 2nd class citizens while barbies have all the control and margot robbie barbie would not love or care about ken ryan gosling  no matter how hard he tries  


now ken has as much power as woman in real world  what the  is that even supposed to mean the movie seemed like a suggestion to end gender war and gender stereotypes but instead added more gasoline to the fire  i dont know what world director had in mind but i live in country where both genders could vote since country was created in 1918 country that was a soviet satelite where everyone was equal to law where woman and man were both viewed as equal workers i work in a place where boss is woman in the office i am surrounded by women and they earn as much as me or even more they are free to take days off anytime their kids feel sick and i have to stay late and meet the deadlines when workforce is reduced since im male i am also expected by the law to carry heavier packages and fight in the wars   


and dont talk about men being 99 of ceos without having rich connections me  young male and you young female both have 0 chances of becoming ceo of big company its not war men vs women it should be war poor vs rich and powerful  


since kens were rulers only during ken patriarchy and returned to being 2nd class citizens after ending their male kingdom then this film suggests that if men want to be respected and rule in their households they need to be sigma assholes good job movie suggests making things even worse   


and what the  means that barbie became a real woman and went to a gynecologist like whats the point of that scene is that supposed to  all mtf trans",2024-01-28 17:48:02
all i can say was this movie was a treat as someone who grew up with barbies loves the actors especially ryan gosling and loves other outside references i couldn’t have asked for a better time watching the movie how good this movie depends on how much you can relate to it went with a group of friends and i don’t think some of the people got the references one of the guys didn’t know what cellulite was so that joke went over however the other half of my group were crying laughing throughout the movie especially during depression barbie i will admit the plot was pretty shallow in some areas but honestly i didn’t go expecting the plot to be wow i expected comedy and feel good movie and that’s what i got,2023-07-23 02:01:48
my favorite part was probably the first 10 minutes of just living in the ideal barbieland  seemed like a fun time hanging out with friends all day party all night,2023-07-23 02:43:58
i loved the matrix reference,2023-07-23 03:17:05
can anyone explain what that montage of real life footage at the end when barbie closed her eyes was supposed to be about just barbie imagining being a real woman and choosing it,2023-07-23 04:47:21

i haven’t seen the movie but as someone who still has her original 1962 barbie with the bouffant hair i wanted ponytail barbie i was just curious if midge allan skipper scooter and ricky are in the film because they’re all in my closet in the aging plastic barbie suitcase talk about touchstones of my childhood,2023-07-24 14:56:38

it was super heartwarming when ruth appeared at the end to talk to barbie 

loved it when they got back to barbieland and ken replaced barbie mount rushmore with a bunch of horses",2023-07-26 16:27:08

i think the movie was ok it was certainly not for me but that’s okay  i did enjoy mattel not being shown in the best of light,2023-08-06 04:59:12
does anyone know why there are absolutely no horses in barbies world its a well known prop and ken seems so obsessed with horses was it too expensive or what,2023-08-15 18:45:45
did anyone else get a  with all of the 80s shorts the kens were sporting,2023-08-17 23:43:56
much funnier than i expected it to be pretty fun movie i dont think it needs to be taken as seriously as people want it to be just have fun and chill even if it does focus on a message its still a pretty simple movie focused more on the comedy people gotta relax a bit,2023-08-23 08:29:35
i have a question during the ken war when the execs are walking across the beach one of them definitely gets shot in the shoulder to which will ferrel says that there are no real weapons there im curious what this is a reference to my best guess is that its a jab at gi joe but did mattel ever release a branded ken that had a gun what was that reference for,2023-08-28 22:28:17
"watched it last night and while im def not the target audience i mostly enjoyed it i have an aversion to will ferrell he ruins everything for me 

i still cant believe that greta is the friendcoworkerroommate in no strings attached from c list actor to a list director thats impressive",2023-09-09 05:22:25
"the set and costume design was fantastic it was visually fun to watch i agree the story and message were all over the place it was never fully established what caused barbie’s 50 role in the rift though it suggested it was maybe that she was only stereotypical barbie and perhaps deep down that wasn’t enough for her this was not made very clear though and this seems like a plot point rather than something that can remain ambiguous meanwhile commentary on various aspects of society was hammered into the audience through monologue and pithy aphorisms like “mothers stand still so their daughters can look back” yada yada i still have no idea how that was relevant or what it means in the context of this barbie movie 

the other big issue is that margot robbie as barbie outacted every other character she seemed more nuanced and human than even the human characters maybe this was purposeful but it’s probably a lot of the reason why a lot of men got upset at the depiction of kens and men as ridiculous truly every single character in this film was ridiculous… except for barbie she was the only one who acted out depth that and maybe the ghost of handler but to be honest i don’t really understand the point of handler as the creator of barbie she always knew barbie would surprise her why i wanted more explanation for lines like this and less explanation of the cognitive dissonance etc",2023-09-17 03:18:47
the opening scene looked exactly like one of the barbie commercials from the 1990s,2023-09-26 02:48:10
"i liked this movie there were a lot of layers and cultural references in particular i liked the framing around 2001 space odyssey it was an adept way to show how barbies were conceived of as a feminist response to baby dolls something most people dont know because similar to how monopoly was created as a critique of capitalism and the cotton gin was invented to end slavery ironically and for a lot of reasons thats not exactly how things went  


on a subtler level that scene was an adept call to action for any woman who has spent her life passively consuming the work of great male directors its a funny and jarring reminder of how absent any genuine female pov has been in the history of cinema if you are a woman or nonwhite and a film buff you learn a lot about the white male brain from watching the cannon as it developed over the last hundred years so much that its hard to know exactly what to do with it all  


that said it wasnt my favorite movie of the year i havent seen it yet but pretty sure thats going to be poor things",2024-03-03 23:46:46
am i the only one that feels like the motherdaughter plotline had major plot holes where did the pent up aggression start they never talked about it besides that conversation at the end but even then i don’t think that was enough i honestly thought it was a single mom thing but then they show the dad out of nowhere idk just kinda feel like they could’ve done more with that because just the flashbacks had me tearing up,2023-07-22 05:37:29
ryan gosling stole the movie from margot robbie in the same way that charlize theron stole mad max fury road from tom hardy,2023-07-22 05:53:02
"i actually saw this movie two times in separate theaters today its definitely not what i was expecting i loved the cast character design set design cinematography etc i also like both of the major topics the film discusses the patriarchy and personal identity heres some of the points i especially liked

 the acknowledgment that stereotypical barbie is not an achievable appearance and is incredibly unrealistic
 the fact that a group of men were behind the doll meant to empower women
 barbie feeling violated and threatened in the real world while ken felt powerful and strong
 the movie didnt end with barbie dating ken i loved that
 i also loved how barbie said no to ken and stood by it
 i also love that the movie ended with telling men to also find their own sense of identity in the patriarchy and that theyre more than what sexism tells them to be
 the beach off thing is funny

all in all i had a good time good way to  a couple or four hours",2023-07-23 04:02:21

"margot robbie really surprised me with her performance in this movie she balanced comedy and the surprisingly poignant moments of the film really really well 

even when she was calling herself  it’s obvious she isn’t and the movie even points it out for us which was hilarious but i really believed she felt that way 

great movie surpassed all my expectations and i was one of the people that had high hopes for it already",2023-07-23 07:41:21
i was waiting for the kens to start a podcast,2023-07-23 11:08:28
"i think ill remember how much fun this movie was to see in theaters for a long time people were dressed up and everyone was laughing a lot especially in the second half

i know its not intersectional enough for some people but i think thats okay most movies arent feminist at all or are straight up anti feminist and dont get this kind of drive by criticism its a movie about a toy

anyways was a great movie just an absolute blast to see may see it again next weekend",2023-07-24 03:17:13

"it’s funny how everyone is saying barbie has always been able to do all these jobs and ken was just an accessory while barbie had the important jobs and that was meant to empower girls 
actually if you look at the timeline of barbie and ken dolls  there was president ken and first lady barbie before there was president barbie there was pilot ken and flight attendant barbie before there was pilot barbie there was doctor ken and nurse barbie before doctor was a barbie

it doesn’t really matter for the movie but it’s just funny to see people so passionate about mattel’s revisionist history that barbie was some trailblazer when actually so many of her jobs just fell into the stereotypical women jobs while an accompanying ken doll was made with the man job",2023-07-27 05:38:11
"at first i thought america ferreras speech was a little bit preachy and such a generalization but then after the movie my wife told me it spoke to her on a personal level so hey if it touches of the lives and speaks for the target audience then who am i to argue

the pretentious film nerd voice in my head doesnt want this to be my favorite movie of the year and a movie like past lives is probably more thoughtful and touching but man this is by far the best time ive had watching a movie all year the dance number at the end full on had me in tears,2023-07-24 00:24:24
"let me know if i am overthinking a lot of people are calling the movie as man hating but i came out thinking it had a really good message the kens were all competing against each other in this toxic struggle that i feel like a lot of men struggle with societal expectations often pushes men to want to be better than other men its like a constant struggle to need to get validation by competing against other guys it seems men more often than women struggle with finding importance in their life and feeling valued part of that is feeling the need to find a beautiful woman to feel validation thats something i felt as well then you have barbie tell ken he isnt defined by his girlfriend he is defined by who he is same with the choreography dance of the ken battle it was hilarious but at same time i feel like the message was obvious there is no need to keep trying to compete against each other be happy with who you are and have a brotherhood akin to what a lot of women have in how they support each other  
  
  
  
yet i see the opposite take from a lot of guys am i misreading the movie or was that not the obvious theme in regards to the kens",2023-07-22 20:36:47
was really amazed at how well gosling played ken as having literal elevator music playing behind his eyes  no thoughts whatsoever and then proceeded to walk outside being like meh it’s all fictionalized anyway and then this dude who came to watch the movie with me turned to me and was like so…is she pregnant who did she  ken and i was like what and he’s like why’d she go to gynac then and i had to explain to this adult man that women go to the gynac all the time and not just when they’re pregnant so yeah men are really…that gosling’s portrayal isn’t far off ,2023-08-11 20:06:52
i thought it was pretty good kinda fell apart in the last act just a bit but i still ended up liking it thought there were some funny parts in the movie too funniest part was the weird barbies dog walking around going bark woof then poops repeat,2023-07-23 03:13:03

did ken ever get to ride a horse  i had a barbie horse as a kid and was hoping he would get a horse by the end of the movie,2023-07-25 00:19:06
everyone joked that gosling’s ken is going to be another addition to the literally me canon and while there is such a character in this film it’s not ken  it’s allen and at one point in the story the main barbie,2023-07-31 00:14:27
"at the start of the movie ryan reminded me of chris from parks and rec near the end he reminded me of johnny lawrence from karate kidcobra kai 

also when he walked away from barbie having a girls night he did a little aw shucks arm pump and it was hilarious",2023-07-31 17:51:22

"i like how stereotypical barbie is an analogy for how to reflect on life

she starts out living life tiptoeing all the time with everything appearing to be perfect and it does appear so because she conforms to societal expectations on what stereotypical barbie is supposed to be shes supposed to be what the normal or average joe is

and this is of course very tiring

while partying she suddenly becomes conscious of death just like how the average person occasionally becomes aware of their mortality they are forced to make a choice  whether to brush it aside as a joke which barbie did and the rest accepted it or to act on this realization

but knowing this changes barbie as all people who reflect on death are changed by it she notices her blemishes she no longer can live life tiptoeing all the time like everyone else she cannot go back to living life as stereotypical barbie

she then meets weird barbie who is often criticized for being weird  and she is very different from all the barbies she does not conform has her own views and is not trapped by societal expectations  the exact opposite of stereotypical barbie but barbie is only here because she has no choice weird barbie gives her a choice to help her feel better  but she just wants to forget having a choice and live in barbie land perfectly forever and ever barbie obviously chooses to want to remain ignorant but that doesnt work because she actually has to go to the real world but this is the start of her self actualization  actually confronting the real world

she then has a complete breakdown over being torn apart by sasha and then she meets her creator when confronted by her feelings of self doubt as to whether she is enough eventually even her dreamland is torn apart by ken for whom shatters her ideal homeland that she loves so much she is forced to face reality and fight to preserve what is precious for her and she succeeds  turning the patriarchy on itself in an admittedly simple way but pokes fun on what the conventional patriarchy is

when her homeland is finally restored  breaking the barbies free of the brainwashing and allowing them to restore the ideal world to what they think it should be  she has a choice she is changed entirely from the experience she had in the real world and she can choose to continue living in barbie world a dreamland where everything is perfect and there is nothing she needs to think about or go to the real world where everything is confusing imperfect filled with change and difficult to navigate

and of course barbie being changed can no longer go back to being just a stereotypical barbie she wants to know whether she can be or know her purpose  for which her creator says she wasnt designed with purpose because her ending isnt written  but instead warns her that to take the next step is to be irrevocably changed

and the way to that change is to close her eyes and feel she literally becomes aware and for the first time she breathes it is an analogy that for ourselves to become aware and to start to live life is to bring ourselves to feel and be aware of our very breath the one change that allows us to continue living from moment to moment she becomes alive for the first time and chooses to accept everything that comes with it with the changes and difficulty it brings

she no longer lives in barbie world and the bridge between both worlds is sealed forever and the very first thing she does is to accept and live  with some fear and trepidation while being supported by her real world family  as a woman by seeing a gynaecologist perhaps it was intended to be a final joke since barbies dont have vaginas and needs to settle that aspect to live in the real world but to me it appeared to be accepting and embracing a fundamental aspect of herself  that despite having always been a woman by design as a doll actively embracing that identity and owning it is another thing altogether she actively chooses who she is

and to embrace who you are is when you truly begin to live whether you choose to go to the real world like barbie did or let things go back to how they normally are ken is kenough

perhaps as a commentary on various things it is shallow it pokes fun at itself from time to time and doesnt shame people for choosing to live in the dreamworld eg when sashas mom actively embraces barbie and her quirky side and snaps back at sasha saying that she just wants to be happy for once in that aspect it is quite real to me in that these are very human responses

but to me i appreciate the message that no matter how stereotypical each of us may be we always have the capacity to reflect and choose differently and in so doing truly live life",2023-08-06 14:03:26

ryan gosling absolutely killed it and margot was the perfect casting choice",2023-08-16 02:41:49
"considering this is still active i think the biggest problem with the barbie movie is it never really explains why the patriarchy is bad or if anything how it truly works

right now people are saying patriarchy is evil because sexism but if you ask people how its sexist seems like most answers will be based around evil reasons which means society was built around evil reasons

i feel its misleading when simply the patriarchy is just unnecessary",2023-10-23 20:40:40
i only played with bratz as a kid will i understand this movie,2023-10-25 05:37:31
maybe an unpopular opinion but i thought this was just ok i really wanted to love it i thought margot robbie and ryan gosling were both excellent and i dont have a lot negative to say about it but it never really got to be more than the sum of its admittedly impressive parts for me the message was extremely on the nose and i just wish it was a little funnier i think this movie is gonna work for a lot of people but i was just a little underwhelmed given the talent involved i think i was a victim of high expectations,2023-07-21 02:40:17
"gotta love how even 50 white males had their voices heard in this movie with will ferrall talking about how he can’t express his feelings in board meetings 

with how mean spirited “woke” what does that word even mean anymore movies can feel towards certain groupsi’m looking at you disney this film was really inclusive and gave of a feeling that we’re all in this together 

didn’t feel like a women vs men or had any “ white incels” moments just a fun good hearted movie that shows how the patriarchy  us all over 

hope people can see this but looking at ben shapiro  co it seems like they’ll spew their typical anti woke bs",2023-07-30 10:49:45
"adult male here loved it it was so weird and dumb at times but dumb fun and then poignant and uncomfortable at times because there was a message in the movie that’s not really for me and that’s okay 

but it is for my 12yearold daughter who i saw it with it’s for my friends who were also there who cried during the part where i was uncomfortable 

and then it was dumb fun again the ken fight was just a thing of  beauty",2023-07-22 01:58:36
"i cant believe there are people zoning in on president barbie denying ken an immediate higher position and calling that hypocritical all while ignoring kens actual real empowerment the entire point of the resolution here is supposed to be a flip on the way tokenism works in the real world its common to make a woman ceo and call it a day and tell them to stop complaining literally happens earlier when the exec brings up the two women ceos but theres rarely ever actual empowerment thats encouraged which is about identity

compare that to the movie and its the exact opposite because theyre urging that ken figure out his identity seperate from barbie which is what actual empowerment is but thats not how it works irl because a big part of patriarchy relies on defining what the idea and role of a woman should be according to men women are not encouraged and in a lot of places not even allowed to figure out their identity separate from men

if you watch this movie and think the message is men  bad or that its about female superiority then idk man it just reinforces the entire point of the movie which is that patriarchal systems of thinking negatively affect both men and women and is a net negative to the world its also true that it affects women to a larger degree due to them not having as much power",2023-07-22 13:45:09
i genuinely cannot believe i came out of my double screen today wondering which film i liked better barbenheimmer is so legit its unbelievable,2023-07-23 05:49:56
it’s interesting reading these comments and comparing peoples movie experiences to what i had i went with my mom younger brother and boyfriend so a mix of ages and perspectives and we all loved it i’m seeing many men angry in the comments here but my boyfriend pointed out that there was a lot of great notes for men in the film too and as much as it discussed women’s perspectives on being “perfect” it did bring up what men are currently going through particularly the line and i am sorry if i misquote from barbie saying “you are not defined by me or by the job you do” to ken i think there are many men in todays society that look up to these men like jordan peterson andrew tate etc and define their existence on “find a wife be a man make money” but at the end of the day they don’t know who they are and the point is that their value is more than just your status who you’re married to or what society tells you defines you,2023-07-23 13:00:07

i have never felt more called out as a man than i was at the mansplaining the godfather scene,2023-07-24 03:32:14
"i went in expecting it to be a movie crapping on men based on a bunch of biased takes on the movie from many sources instead did quite the opposite bringing forth both issues of genders and i like how ken and barbie both flipped through the antagonist and protagonist of each other throughout the film the irony of the song push being played was great that mightve gotten lost on some people unfamiliar with matchbox 20 personally i really liked the ending sequence with ken breaking down and crying saying its okay to cry and be open with his emotions and especially the whole i am enough scene realizing he doesnt need barbie nor does she need him partially playing on the fact that ken always was a side character an afterthought of the whole barbie franchise for people years ago but also as a statement to many men and women who put all their self worth based on their partnership or lack thereof didnt think id actually tear up at a movie like barbie but that whole segment struck a chord with me 

i also appreciate the fact that it called out how barbies in the past along with media as a whole has really affected how a lot of women felt growing up and how difficult it is to deal with body issues in a world where women have to be skinny but not too skinny you have to be xyz as one of the barbies mentioned and how self conscious women have become due to the unrealistic expectations of media and the stereotypical barbie
all in all it was a pretty good movie with positive messages for both genders to take away from was wholesome enough to keep me captivated at what will happen next definitely a lot of humorous moments that got me to chuckle along with my friends and the people in the theater the you are enough theme was great and i dont care what other biased sources complain about how problematic this movie is because it isnt and anyone who says that completely missed all the underlying themes of the movie solid 810 for me",2023-08-08 07:12:39
"it started out really promising but then towards the end four separate plotlines got mushed together into a whole blurry mess barbie on what it means to be human kens patriarchy saga the whole motherdaughter story and whatever will ferrell was doing  


by far the most interesting of these plotlines is kens story and i feel like if the filmmakers had focused on this it couldve been a great satirical comedy on how the oppressed kens reclaim their self identity and gain mutual respect with the barbies turning the whole gender norm on its head i get why they couldnt do that  the irony of having barbies movie be ultimately about ken would fly over most peoples heads   but because of that they sacrificed coherence and ultimately made the film lose both its steam and focus i was expecting to love this film based on both its visuals and the directors prior work but it ended up being one of my biggest disappointments of the year",2023-08-16 03:24:58

"listen i get that ken was supposed to be playing the toxic masculinity villain…but he was by far the best part of the movie to me every scene he was in was just comedy gold 

i also kinda felt bad for the kens at the end again i get the point barbieland is just starting to move towards equality between the barbies and the kens they are essentially at a point that parallels the period when women were starting to get rights in our world but come on the kens deserve to have a representative too come on president barbie all kens are homeless",2023-07-22 03:15:03

"something about barbie sitting with the old lady at the bench really got to me

barbie calling her beautiful and the old lady responding with “i know” was such a fun moment with so much emotional substance underneath

i felt like barbie at that moment recognized this is a real woman who has changed and has lived a full life it’s just a stark contrast to barbie who is destined to never change who practically relives the same day everyday someone who fears changes because it goes against what she is cellulite her feet falling flat “i’m supposed to be stereotypical barbie” etc

and barbie recognizes this contrast but for the first time ever she doesn’t despise the effects of change she recognizes how much of a privilege it is to grow and be a person so she ultimately whispers a small “you’re so beautiful” at the grandma 

overall movie was great but this quiet moment really made my heart feel warm",2023-07-24 05:47:24
"i have never felt more seen by a movie

"the mantage montage about halfway through the movie was the greatest minute of cinema ever put to film it was absolutely epic

to be clear im quite positive i was being made fun of but i literally dont care its awesome to be a man and man things are cool im glad they put that in there for us  owners lol",2023-07-25 00:25:24
"im a 31 year old man i absolutely loved this movie i really enjoyed that it wasnt just about women empowerment because its more than that even just a little bit about ken learning to be enough for himself is a great message because a lot of people in general feel that theyre not fulfilled if theyre not in a relationship as someone that is currently separated with their spouse this really spoke to me

edited to add as it might seem like i dont like the women empowerment i think its a fantastic movie for women of all ages to watch and realize they can be what they want to be im just glad it also added a sprinkle of something for ken because i think that its a real problem that people every day face in thinking they have to be in a relationship or have the perfect job youre kenough",2023-07-26 02:30:42
i feel like they really perfected ken’s story line barbie is a great movie for guys to watch for the ladies i don’t know barbie’s storyline was really confusing and i didn’t love one of the main plot points being her apologizing to the guy who just ruined her house,2023-08-04 14:49:20
"its good some of the jokes didnt land the entire mattel sideplot could be cut and some scenes became very preachy nearly to the point of parody

but its one of the more unique films ive seen it was a good old fun time also ryan gosling is by far the best part of this film he absolutely stole the show in every scene he was in i would not mind a sequel called ken focusing on him

the girl calling barbie a fascist is foreshadowing as the barbies use disenfranchisement to claim victory over their political opponents,2023-08-10 05:54:25
"i think this movie is kind of suffering with how overhyped it is because i was expecting a masterpiece like everything everywhere all at once but this movie is just okay i think the jokes were pretty funny but the pacing just seemed fast at times 

i feel like my biggest gripe with the film is that barbie and ken spent so little time in the real world ken discovers patriarchy and barbie discovers how hard being a woman is so quickly and it just feels rushed i think the movie wouldve benefitted greatly having fewer barbie world scenes and more real world scenes 

my other problem is the lack of focus on gloria and sashas relationship sure we saw them sort of grow in having a relationship but it wasnt enough and i think the movie missed out on showing how barbie has really impacted generations of women who grew up playing the dolls and how gloria and sasha played with the dolls as kids

as for the controversial feminism aspect of the film i think i will be even more controversial in saying that i dont think the feminist discourse in the film went far enough barbie has been created in pretty much every race and ethnicity so i felt it was kind of a loss to not discuss much of intersectionality in feminism and recognize that the discrimination women face is often compounded by their race ethnicity cultural background etc but i suppose this wouldnt have been included in the film because the girl boss feminism featured was already getting enough sensitive peoples feelings hurt 

also the mattel squad of bumbling idiots was really unnecessary pretty much every scene featuring them couldve been cut from the film in my opinion 

in conclusion i wish i hadnt heard about all the hype surrounding the barbie movie because it set my expectations to really lofty ideals that the movie didnt meet i would watch again for the jokes and the acting but the plot leaves so much to be desired",2023-08-15 14:09:53
i sadly didnt enjoy the movie at all it truly felt like the writers thought that the movie was going to be critical about modernday society but it wasnt it felt much more like a 2 h commercial for the barbie doll which has been long forgotten by most parents who were gently reminded that this product still exists and that it stands for female empowerment its just sad to see that so many people felt like the movie discussed this topic well when in reality it was just a shallow wannabe movie,2023-09-11 21:40:56
 with will farrell  he contributed nothing seems to be ad libbing weirdly pulls you out of the film whenever he is on screen,2023-09-12 19:00:02
"i liked a lot of this movie its well made the music the set pieces the edit is all great however the heavy handed girls have it harder than boys is there when it doesnt need to be it basically ends that men will not get a say in barbieland so long as women dont get a say in the real world but half the real world supreme court justices are women the vice president is a woman women are increasingly dominating corporate executive positions in many companies including my own it really misses the were all in this together no matter the gender part its not a war  my point is emphasized by the fact that his was the biggest movie of the year 

now i think theyre just constantly on the edge of saying that with ken but they really just dont ever deliver on it they portray things like doing duolingo managing finances and expressing passion for old movies as some sort of irredemable sin 

more than half of people in college are women and now there is basically a crisis where men arent going to school and becoming polarized to the point where their identity has become trumpism lets not act like men have no emotions or social intelligence and should just be subservient because a jaded woman says so the real world moms monologue on this was just a take on humans not just women the movie was clearly written by a woman in the same vain that female characters in movies written by men are way off its just reversing the roles 

but like i said at the beginning its still well made and fun made me laugh more than any other movie this year maybe this movie is more for the world rather than for california kids like myself",2023-12-24 08:06:54
"overall enjoyed the movie the first 30 minutes was solid and the transition into the second act was also a great time margot and ryan truly stole the show the set designs the campy nature mixed with some emotional gravitas most of the dialogue choreography and songs and the fun nature of barbieland and their references to toy life

my major con was that the messages near the end felt a bit too vindictive i felt the first half of the story did a good job of conveying the struggles of a woman the culture shock of the real world being male dominated in ways that were taken for granted like the construction worker crew and how ken in reverse noticed men making decisions or in places of influence although barbie had the clearest arc i felt ken had the most dynamic potential for character with the kens being kind of purposeless and forgotten and sort of accessories to barbie early in the movie but by the end when the barbies try to retake barbieland it felt all that nuance was thrown away and menkens were simplified and denigrated and we sort of return to where we started at the beginning the kens still don’t have a place and although she emphasized “ken is you” it was rather shallow and she did it in a way that was kind of harsh without any real compassion after having just gone through that trauma herself so idk i felt the movie conveyed this idea that for women to feel safeliberatedheardvalued that it’s a zero sum game with one gender needing predominant power as opposed to building both up and learning to value the other strengths and weaknesses alike empowering maleness and femaleness and how thag can build each other up

also i felt the finale was noticeably horribly paced compared to the first half they attempted to rapidly resolve the teen girlmom and it felt way too fast inorganic with how nasty she was the ceos kind of got forgotten and really shouldn’t have even come to barbieland as they added nothing and they attempted to give barbie like 3 different character resolutions it just felt like too much and the movie really dragged and kept hammering the same points with telling as opposed to showing by the end which i felt the movie was doing very well in the beginning",2023-07-21 18:35:37
"spoilers don’t read if you didn’t watch

i feel like ken’s point of view is so much deeper than just sidekick i felt like it was supposed to represent how women felt prior to the feminist movement — never owning anything feeling like your spouses accessory no sense of identity and self worth outside of your partner and their accomplishments making yourself seem perfect the idea of your own gender pitting itself against each other for attention there’s a reason ken complains about not owning a barbie dream house and says to barbie he wanted it to be their house even the random dance number with ken’s — i can’t tell you how many classic 50’s films that have a random dance break with only women 

barbie land as a matriarchy was also extremely unfair i felt the whole point of the movie is trying to find a more harmonious blend and balance for gender roles and also trying to give men an understanding of what it’s actually like for women no wonder so many men hate barbie land welcome to the real world lol

ken and the other kens making a kendom really reminded me of 70s feminist movement the ken’s finally gain autonomy at the end kind of like how the real world woman social revolution outcome and the narrator makes it clear that barbie land is still matriarchal that the ken’s will have to work their way upcreate change like with the district court judge instead of supreme court judge statement that’s where women are today in society — still fighting for change

the thing that gets me too is ken’s doll plays on the already mass marketed and available toys for men prior to the feminist movement the cowboy and boxer theme was everywhere all little girls had were baby dolls — boys had cowboy toys etc boys could see themselves in anything ken in the patriarchal world can see himself in anything and any job he wants that’s trying to explain to the viewer that barbie land is so important for younger girls because they can see themselves as having limitless potential 

barbie isn’t about hating men — it’s about recognizing that she was a huge cultural shift where little girls suddenly had a toy that showed they could be anything barbie owned her own things before many women could get their own credit card

it’s actually incredible how a lot of men just don’t understand this movie and it’s disappointing because i felt like ken might have drove the point home 

my grandmother couldn’t have a credit card or property for most of her life — and she was addressed as her husbands name we are not as far removed from serious systemic sexism that people like to think we are we clearly still live in a patriarchal society and some women have to bust their  to get to where they want to be — but they do it to help the girls after them",2023-07-23 16:48:36

"favorite moment in the movie  barbie talking about how she feels and looks  and the narrator says what barbie is saying is true and relatable but dont hire someone like margot robbie to play that person i was laughing

x200b

the movie was great but i have some questions like the ceo knew the ghost of ruth was in the building the entire time like thats just normal also what happened to the other barbie that went to key west also where do the kens live i had thought they lived with barbies also can anyone just go in and out of barbieland 

also i dont see ken as the villain of the movie i feel as thought mettel was gonna be the enemies but it was removed because again what happened to the barbie that went to key west also you are a major big company thats making millions and you dont care something off but besides that i liked it",2023-07-22 01:15:17

the plot fell apart for me though i dont get why barbie had to become human to fully selfactualize it looked like all the barbies were beginning that journey too and why did they do the kens so dirty they just wanted to be acknowledged and respected too 

visually its so cute though and i loved the packed theater of everyone in pink",2023-07-22 08:07:53

"i have been excited about this movie ever since i realized that greta gerwig was directing it ryan gosling as ken was just the cherry on the ice cream sundae 

the opening scene was killer and perfect then as barbies world was set up i started to get a little nervous was this movie going to be too fullblown barbie not what i expected with gerwig at the helm and then barbies existential crisis began perfect 

i thought that the movie was great cinematic and fun just like i had hoped ive been a fan of gerwigs dance choreography style ever since i saw her performance with the arcade fire for the youtube music awards and it was so fun to see a couple of those moves in one of the dance sequences for this film 

one of my favorite sequences was when barbie was being chased in the maze of cubicles sign me up for silly stylized chaos i used to watch musicals when i was younger and gerwig is definitely reminding me that i need to revisit the genre 

ryan gosling was so much fun to watch as ken the way that he sang and played guitar for barbie was just over the top in such a relatable way not to mention his performance of the ken song he really did find his kenergy 

i can see how this movie might not be for everybody i love gerwigs work but she definitely is part of the indie crowd and she wanted to make a barbie film not a barbie movie barbie thinking about death and humanity its not a kids movie which is a little confusing but for me it was just what i hoped for i was surprised at how emotional watching this movie was for me honestly didnt expect that 

side note i watched this  interview and gerwig talks about some of the films that inspired her its a fun watch",2023-07-22 14:08:52

i feel barbie like greta gerwigs neon genesis evangelion without mechas it begins with barbie having an existential crisis the conflict is resolved with a lot of meta and philosophy and concludes with her omedetto shinji moment with all of barbieland waving goodbye to her there are moments so contemplative that i didnt get the impression that i was watching a typical pop movie it is a rare product,2023-07-22 21:44:49
i loved the first 20 minutes or so but later on the plotline got muddled like it didnt know whether to do the whole enchanted fantasycharactergoestotherealworld or toy story forgottentoyfindingthemselves thing there was no clear message the motherdaughter bond storyline felt empty and forced plus they make the barbie world seem like a reverse gender version of the real world but then bring up stuff like the supreme court in barbie world being all female when thats not true in the real world so the parallels dont even work unless you exaggerate the sexism of the real world mattels board of directors is half female so i dont get why they exaggerate that the real world is more sexist than it is because that muddles the social commentary,2023-07-23 03:04:56

it genuinely went for some pretty surreal scenes and nailed them it definitely wasnt perfect but this is the most ambitious and well realized ip movie ive seen,2023-07-24 01:01:40
"i loved the ending for margot robbie barbie and the beauty of her choosing to be a human was just perfect also the contradiction monologue was great and i related a lot to it it was an amazing representation of how complicated it is to be a woman and i loved getting to see that on the big screen also i loved allan because he was just so perfect and fun

i also liked how everyone in barbieland wanted to move on and not forget everything they went through i think it was a good reminder that struggle and difficulty is something to inspire you and keep you from making the same mistakes 

the only thing i wish is that the barbies and kens were equal at the end maybe that’s what they were trying to say when president barbie told them they could have positions in lower court also i’m still wondering where the kens sleep lol 

i also wish that at the end the barbies valued the kens more but i looooved how margot robbie barbie helped ken understand that he needed to find identity outside of her i thought that was such a good message

overall i really liked and enjoyed the movie and would like to see it again i think it’s a good movie to get people talking and barbie was a perfect way to do that also it was beyond fun to dress up and make going to the movie such a fun event",2023-07-24 20:44:46
that had no right to be as good as it was the plot was a bit all over the place but oddly that didnt get in the way of a good meaningful film puts into question other tie in films gosling stole the show,2023-07-24 21:48:31
the movie was great i really missed fun movies like this i wish it was longer i also was surprised by the plot found myself liking it more than i expected and i certainly didn’t expect the whole ruth thing,2023-07-25 02:14:47
"thought it was a very good movie where lots of the bits worked and some didnt

it feels strange to say considering the message of the movie but i thought anytime the kens were on screen the movie was significantly better i thought the movie was 1015 minutes too long because it felt like it really tried to add on the emotional elements with ruth at the end but they just didnt sit with me not sure why barbie needed to become human unless its to set up a sequal 

gosling was incredible robbie was divine kate mackinnon was pretty funny as well the theme is definitely on the nose and sometimes felt a little too much so but again that would depend on the viewer loved the im just ken dance number",2023-07-25 14:35:27
"something i have not seen mentioned much is the final montage it had me crying like a baby 
despite all the struggles humans go through all the difficulties in our daily lifes trying to overcome expectations both by society and imposed by us trying to find ourselves and the meaning in our lives by the end it is all worth it 
barbie also sees that even though she had all these horrible new emotions and feelings she is willing to try and succeed in our world
it is a beautiful take on humanity more than feminism or womens rights",2023-07-26 21:45:52
 this movie was hilarious all the way through i havent laughed this hard in a long time,2023-07-27 04:54:19
i really liked the movie one thing i’m confused by though is why did the kens get a lower position of power than barbies i thought this was all gonna end up being a both barbie and ken government with the message being “no one should be denied a place because of their gender ken or barbie” they won’t let a ken have a seat at the table and the narrator makes it worse saying kens will work their way up to have as much power as women in the real world i thought we established that the world was run by men and a horrible place for women am i looking too far into thingscompletely missing the point,2023-07-27 05:27:54
ryan gosling putting on 2 sunglasses is already became a meme lol,2023-07-28 13:06:34
i already posted my main thoughts but does anyone else think that the godfather was a weird choice for the movie that the kens love i get that it’s always been seen as the definitive “man” movie but it doesn’t make much sense for what we know about the kens otherwise for one they love horses and godfather’s most famous scene involves a decapitated horse beyond that though with the way the kens like to oneup and outmacho each other along with the movie’s obvious themes of capitalism and men’s place in the corporate world wouldn’t fight club have made way more sense that’s definitely the movie that those kens would obsess over and misinterpret,2023-07-28 17:37:07
was anyone else on the edge of their seat waiting for the movie to return to barbieland after ken returns with those books i couldn’t wait and the movie totally delivered,2023-07-29 18:01:26

someone check in on allan,2023-07-30 20:06:53
very funny movie i felt the main message boiled down to “existing is hard” maybe “existing as a women is hard” as it was aimed primarily to women though as a guy i found myself sort of understanding ken a bit there was a lot of themes feminism patriarchy gender equality toxic masculinity consumerism but they felt more of avenues for humor than anything substantial to say on any one topic,2023-07-31 02:41:55

"saw it today with my two grown daughters beautiful set and cute scenes but a serious undertone that overtook me i cried and cried and i am not exactly sure why i played with baribies as a young girl i had the house the corvette the plane the camper all of it i am not sure it shaped who i became to be or not because i was also a tom boy 

i think the film missed an opportunity to extend and explain a little more about americas speech its we women who project all those expectations on ourselves its not just the patriarchy  i keep myself down i hate myself in clothes i am not thin enough its me im the problem 

excellent fun and deeper film than one might think",2023-08-06 23:54:48

this is the closest to a 1010 movie ive ever seen my last favourite movie was your name but i admitted it had some weak points mostly the ending which was too long and slow for my taste heres all i didnt like from barbie

i felt like there were too many horses jokes although some of them were hilarious

i didnt get why when they threw clothing items from barbies house they stopped and showed the article i guess its a joke but i dont see how its funny

i found it a bit cringey when the little girl is telling her mother that she likes her weird and dark drawings

thats all the complaints i can think of aside from that i loved everything the jokes landed i understood the characters the casting and acting was amazing the design of everything was great the pacing felt appropriate the original soundtrack was bop after bop the choreographies were spectacular and of course i loved the message and i felt very personally all of barbies struggles even the ones related to the fact that shes a woman even though im a cishet man maybe  makes me more empathetic

just five minutes in i understood why american conservatives were so upset with the movie the feminism was evident and its a good thing i found it so funny when they were presenting barbieland as the perfect female fantasy showing mostly childish things and suddenly there was a barbie giving a speech about how being more emotional doesnt make you worse for any serious job and its even a good thing this kind of direct messages were everywhere like when ken and barbie are walking in the real world with everyone staring at them and ken clearly states that he isnt feeling any kind of danger while barbie does feel threatened

except for the mattel workers and in a lesser way the mother and daughter i felt like the real world was completely realistic the sexism wasnt as exaggerated as some say it isnt hard to find someone who actually acts like each sexist person they interact with the fact that they find so many in so little time is unlikely but completely possible

i dont remember exactly every scene i cried with but i can tell you that at least every time they played the instrumental of billie eilishs song i cried with the scene of the old woman whom barbie calls beautiful with both of the creators scenes the mothers first speech basically everytime barbie was crying on screen and weirdly at the end of kens musical number that key change really got to me i consider myself a nihilist so i accept death as part of life and i understand theres nothing else beyond it but i had never felt like death was such a human thing as when barbie was giving up her perfect immortal life  im crying again

anyway im scared of watching this movie again sober and realizing it wasnt as good as i think it is im pretty sure i wouldnt have cried nearly as much if i hadnt been high but at least ill never forget what i felt it was almost lifechanging",2023-08-24 10:44:54
i am still living in delusion that barbie made 14 billion at box office,2023-09-12 16:02:27
"the lessons about humanity compassion noticing the other person what its like to be a woman and a man and how both sexes have their own struggles and their pain deserve to be noticed acknowledged and praised the final scene where barbie both metaphorically and literally grows up and decides to become human was tearjerking definitely the top highlight of this movie

but  if most of the good stuff just gets drowned in the approach of telling instead of showing kens patriarchal rules that came from the place of wanting to be respected for who hethey are was a good story telling every second sentence how patriarchy is bad was not there are moments where this really original and refreshing movie becomes some sort of lecture which is quite possibly the most boring way to show things exposition by info dumps rarely ends well for the consumer it makes the whole experience really shallow

and i get that overall this movie was partially a satire of many modern things but christ those mattel executives were just ugh completely unfunny and unnecessary they brought nothing but annoyance even if the idea behind them was laughing at capitalism as a whole and pointing out consumptionism i think there couldve been a better way of showing that or definitely the more funny way

overall a solid 7 the first 23 of the movie is a real mixed bag of good and bad the last third made up for the movies shortcomings barbies conversation with ruth the wardanceoff scene or just everything with that mothers presence in the barbie world was on top",2023-09-24 16:52:45

as soon as i walked out of the theatre i realized just how much the movie surprised me it was meta and comedic but without removing its multifaceted messages it was also eyeopening as a young man it may seem quite  but the movie made me question a lot of my double standards and presented a worldview of healthy relationships empowerment and true independence i think what sets this movie apart from the most obvious wokeism cash grabs is that it stays true to its themes and finds ways to present them masterfully it doesnt take itself seriously but knows its saying things that people need to hear so it doesnt drown them out i feel genuinely enlightened by my experience and the messages the movie leveled toward its male audience were powerfully mature this movie is simply strange to me i have no idea how it was made but i am glad i got the chance to see it,2023-07-22 22:15:21

"heres an article i found to be interesting thoughts



for those who cant access it

a confession upfront i probably would never have seen barbie had it not come out the same weekend as oppenheimer thereby allowing me to do the full “barbenheimer” last thursday night my review of oppenheimer has already appeared of the barbehneimer experience itself i will say little more other than that it was exhausting

but exhaustion is not why it has taken a few days for me to assess barbie fully it is rather that barbie is far less straightforward than oppenheimer with multiple interpretive and thematic layers oppenheimer is not an uncomplicated film but barbie is itself a highly sophisticated one  and one that many conservatives are almost certainly getting wrong

the story of barbie is deceptively simple a barbie margot robbie as stereotypical barbie suddenly finds her idyllic life in barbieland the separate realm in which the barbie dolls realworld people play with are represented anthropomorphically disrupted by thoughts of death and other deviations from perfect barbiedom a visit to weird barbie kate mckinnon thus labeled because she has been marred by being played with a little too hard sends her on a journey to our world to find the owner at the root of her discontent and a ken ryan gosling in a ploy for barbies attention without which he can barely function ends up a stowaway while there barbie and ken experience a reversal of sorts barbie discovers that she has not in fact empowered the world and ken appears to discover the glories of the patriarchy that dominates our reality shenanigans and further trips back and forth between barbieland and our world ensue

the emerging conservative take on barbie seems to be that it is a shallow manhating and repulsive screed an assessment that probably owes a great deal to the fact that barbieland is an ostensible feminist utopia in which all kens are subservient to all barbies
in the wall street journal former national review critic kyle smith wrote that as bubbly as the film appears its script is like a grumpierthanaverage womens studies seminar upon leaving the movie ben shapiro of the daily wire tweeted that all you need to know about it is that it unironically uses the word patriarchy more than 10 times with some time to collect his thoughts shapiro then took to youtube with a video titled ben shapiro destroys the barbie movie for 43 minutes and the critical drinker a rightleaning and perspicacious youtube film critic savaged barbie calling it the greatest lie ever told

before rebutting the substance of these cases its important to describe some of the technical nonthematic things barbie excels at in the hands of writerdirector greta gerwig with her husband noah baumbach cowriting barbie has an utterly consistent and relentless aesthetic vision all that pink paint so much that it may have affected the global supply went to good use in creating barbieland it is a remarkably silly place where houses have no walls water isnt real and characters fake eating drinking surfing doctoring and other activities its so silly that i found it overwhelming even revolting initially but eventually it won me over

at the center of barbieland is robbies stereotypical barbie the notion of portraying a liveaction doll is not wholly without precedent in film history but it is fairly absurd yet robbie sells it totally even better is goslings ken his commitment to this earnest goofy desperate and vain character is scenestealing and might have stolen the movie itself were it not up to something more complex than it appears

if barbie were simply the feminist screed some of its critics are taking it for it would be a failure  an interesting pretty failure to be sure but a failure all the same if this assessment were correct then the fact that ken upon returning to barbieland makes it into a patriarchy to which all of its barbies instantly submit would represent an inadvertently more compelling and potent satire than the vision barbie appears to offer in its stead a kind of shallow yasqueening comes to reign again in barbieland by the movies conclusion with the kens only slightly better off and the barbies still in charge after robbies barbie with the help of some reallife humans breaks their patriarchal false consciousness

but this interpretation fails to account for so much that it is surely mistaken for one the real world is not represented as quite the patriarchy ken with his superficial barbieland brain makes it out to be after an initial montage mantage that marks his realization of the patriarchy ken is rebuffed in all of his attempts to join the male hierarchy that purportedly dominates the world he must return to barbieland to institute it what he institutes there is so shallow that it collapses almost as quickly as it is set up meanwhile though robbies barbie restores female dominance in barbieland she chooses not to stay there electing instead to become fully human what it all appears to suggest is that barbieland is not merely a superficial construct but an entirely satirical one a kind of postfeminist satire of what feminists imagine a perfect world looking like and of what they imagine male dominance is like plato had a city in speech gerwig has given us a city in plastic

the scenes in reality and involving humans are of much greater import than those set in barbieland it is two humans mother gloria america ferrera and daughter sasha ariana greenblatt who anchor the film this is familiar territory for gerwig whose ladybird has a similarly complicated motherdaughter relationship it is glorias revelation of and reveling in the complications of real life that help to bring her daughter away from the crass cynicism in which she had been mired and it is this embrace of reality in all of its complications transcending facile theorizing that the film endorses one sees this in glorias latemovie monologue and in the realization by mattels corporate board that a reality barbie would sell like hotcakes it is especially evident in stereotypical barbies decision to become human a clever bookend to the 2001 a space odyssey reference that opens the film with all its concomitant messiness


this is a bold claim and one not without problems of its own one male human character in our world might seem to counter the idea that barbie means to complicate our appraisal of reality with his assertion that a patriarchy still exists but weve just gotten better at hiding it it also requires accepting entire portions of the movie  helen mirrens arch narration almost everything that happens in barbieland  as satirical and it places upon the slender plastic shoulders of a toy doll many layers of irony and complexity perhaps more than they can reasonably bear but detractors have a harder case to make they must ignore among other things what happens to robbies barbie and what the human world actually looks like and perhaps most daunting they must ignore the past work of gerwig who showed in ladybird especially that she is far from some kind of straightforwardly vanguard feminist figure


i had to overcome my own hesitation to arrive at this view masculine pride makes it far easier for me to recommend oppenheimer than to esoterically interpret barbie positively it is to be clear not really a movie about men but it does not hate them it is something far different and far more interesting than that conservatives who think otherwise might not be thinking big enough",2023-08-07 01:47:35
even better on 2nd viewing will probably go 3rd time before it leaves theaters cause my girl n i had such a good time,2023-08-11 07:20:26
"gerwig gets off on being meta every man will be able to relate to ken cause hes ryan gosling and every man wants to be ryan gosling and like alot of man his actions are heavily influenced by how hot a girl is and how were willing to debase ourselves in the name of love

ken is a  a incelhes been friend zoned he got advice from the wrong man and leaned heavy into being alpha and only in the end does he gain self respect and fully self awareness he went from ken to kenaough",2023-09-11 01:42:16
i’m sorry but all the fragile men in the comments crying about how this movie made men look “weak” is genuinely  funny,2023-07-22 01:19:34
i loved a lot of elements in it the humor is great the tone is perfect and ryan gosling is a gift to mankind but i’m kinda let down by the absolute lack of a plot the mattel execs the mother daughter dynamic barbie having to go find her real world user felt like ideas that needed a lot more rewrites before making their way into a greta gerwig film i think the ending is great and really sticks the landing but the middle was really disappointing to me i get that the film was made to be a blockbuster and appeal to the “general audience” but i felt a certain repetitiveness to the point the movie was trying to make,2023-07-21 10:11:27
"i did enjoy barbie but i feel like they lost their own point a few times and the ending was messy

i might need to watch this again to actually form a more thought out opinion",2023-07-21 18:47:29
"there was a good premise and i really enjoyed robbie and gosling but overall found it a missed opportunity because i thought its message was too heavy handed… 

i’d have preferred the end to be warmer and point out that the barbies and kens are better as team that runs things together

as it is i’d give it no more than 610 personally",2023-07-23 08:13:17
"i’ve known it for awhile now but barbenheimer really cemented the fact that so many people do 0 research on the movies they go to see and then proceed to complain that it wasn’t “family friendly” or that it was “too political”  with oppenheimer people were complaining about “too much dialogue and not enough action”

taking your kids to a pg13 movie and then complaining about adult humor and themes is insanity

never ceases to amaze me how dumb the average person is

barbie rocked oppenheimer rocked",2023-07-23 18:55:45
alright gentlemen in the room how many of you teared up a few times this movie has no right to be as good or meaningful as it is,2023-07-24 01:15:55
"

i think what personally got to me was that i was excited about the feminism aspect but it fell short the speeches were just awfully scripted the message was cloudy too it felt jarringly like a 2013 tumblr post almost like a parody of itself like the speech would have been groundbreaking two decades ago but today it felt weirdly commercial 

very much tell not show with all the speeches they couldnt devote time to representing what she was saying in the movie no time given to developing the deteriorating motherdaughter relationship that was shown to be the cause of the entire plot no time to show her struggling with her job and being a mother or the restricive body standards finacial inequality balancing being emotional and direct all of these were stated in the speech and ignored the rest of the movie but they had time for a whole unnecessary plotline with goofy mattel men and a 10 minute ken musical number 

instead misogyny was shown as girls should wear booby clothes and serve men beer as if thats even slightly the what the patriarchy is they couldve had the women be encouraged to wear that but then be slutshamed for giving in they couldve had women want to be a server and be ashamed of it 

the solution was presented as women just need to realize whats wrong and believe in themselves and everythings solved misogyny eradicated yippee it all felt so hollow  it feels like they solved their cheap version of inequality and we should be grateful for it because at least the real world isnt as bad  but its worse way more pervasive and subtle and soul crushing 

i feel so sad that i feel this way because i am so easy to please when it comes to movies especially cinema blockbusters i just wanted to like it",2023-07-26 15:56:40
"again the movie is not woke it is not woke

feminism yes but do you got a problem with it

"i went to see barbie in the theaters everything was absolutely perfect except the plot i adored the characters the costumes were excellent the music was amazing and the set was phenomenal

but although i loved these aspects of the movie i didnt like the movie 

i felt like the movie didnt focus on the right theme when stereotypical barbie first met the sasha sasha made a statement about how barbie was an unrealistic expectation of what girls should be aka blonde skinny perfect complexion stereotypical barbie then tells her that barbie wasnt supposed to be an unrealistic expectation but an inspiration that girls could be anything i absolutely loved the idea of changing the stigmatism around barbie by reinforcing that she is an inspiration of what a girl could be hence all the different barbie skin colors hair colors professions etc and not a perfect idea of what a girl should be

but then the movies message started to change with focus being on ken and his misunderstanding of what a man should be and what a woman should be making the movie about patriarchy v matriarchy the focus slipped away from barbie and idea that barbie is a doll that instills inspiration into young girls and simply became a men vs women movie

i also felt there were many cheap references about the objetification of women in the real world although i understood the writers used these allusions to estabish the idea that stereotypical barbie was now in the imperfect harsh real world i felt like the writers should have focused more on showing all the imperfections of the real world including that women are objectified in the real world but also including a homeless person here or a stray dog theremaybe even a couple yelling at each other this way instead of simply showing that the real world was harder for women it would reinforce the idea that stereotypical barbie had left her utopia for the harsh reality of the real world 


to make a long story short i felt that barbie should have focused more on the purpose and symbol of the barbie doll with a subplot that dealt with barbie v ken and kens purpose instead of focusing the movie on a men vs women plot i would have enjoyed it a lot more

are there others out there that agree",2023-09-07 02:03:56
"i want to start off by saying that i enjoyed the barbie movie i did the barbenheimer double feature and that day is definitely one of the highlights of my summer it was fun and chaotic and really refreshing to see after being drained with all the connected cinematic universes but some of the plot and messaging of the movie just felt weird and i was wondering if anyone else felt the way i did watching the movie  
  
the things i did like were  
  
the designs it was absolutely amazing how they were able to replicate the barbie dreamhouse the costume design is great and it really felt like the dolls came to life  
  
the acting was phenomenal especially margot robbies and ryan goslings personally goslings ken really carried the movie in my eyes not to discredit robbie as her acting was equally as impressive and i really felt the scenes where barbie was experiencing true emotions for the first time  
  
as a cinephile the movies references were a nice touch not in a way that said were cultured we have movie references but it actually added to the plot the 2001 space odyssey reference said that barbie evolved toys the same way the monoliths evolved the monkeys and the humans  
  
the appearance of the actual barbera was a nice edition  
  
when ruth said  i created barbie so all my daughters could look back and see how far weve come i felt that it was only a sentence but it was so powerful my theater didnt give a big reaction to it but it didnt need one it was powerful enough on its own  
  
kens character arc was really well done learning that he is kenough and doesnt need a womans validation and to just be himself was nice his journey of selfdiscovery was nice to watch  
  
the songs were great in the movie im personally not a fan of ice spice but i legitimately think the barbie world remix was good  
  
alan was comedy gold in the movie even though it was random i loved the fight scene between him and the kens  
  
the cartoony physics made the movie more lighthearted  
  
but there are some things that i didnt like about the movie  
  
the mattel board consisting of all men was weird considering since half of the mattel board is women and the head of barbie has always been a woman to people who dont bother researching about mattel it just makes them look bad  
  
americas speech i thought was pretty good you have to be bossy but not too bossy otherwise you come off as rude she made a lot of points and all of them were valid you could feel frustration through the screen i thought it was missed opportunity to not bring up so much of the male frustration i know its a barbie movie but half the movie was about ken so i think they shouldve talked about it a bit more a lot of men are confused and lost its a reason why influencers like andrew tate are so famous right now they have the ability to take control of vulnerable men and warp their viewpoints i think if they talked about male frustration a little more it could create an interesting conversation  
  
as much as the movie loves to talk about the patriarchy they never say anything about barbieland being a matriarchy they call out all the toxic men in the real world which they should  harassment and inequality are topics that should be taken seriously and shouldnt be ignored but they kind off brush off mistreating the kens the kens have no houses no jobs are given no real personality outside of being attractive and their happiness depends on if the barbies engage in conversation with them at the end barbie just says sorry for ignoring you but things basically go back to how they were you would think after all the things the barbies and kens went through they would reject both the patriarchy and matriarchy and embrace a new system that benefits the both of them  
  
the concept that the barbies were brainwashed and needed to be deprogramed felt wrong because there is nothing wrong with being a traditional girlfriend or a housewife or a stayathome mom it can be legitimately difficult and theres nothing wrong with having those types of traditional relationships as long as theyre not abusive or toxic feminism should be about respecting women as individual beings who have their own aspirations and dreams if a woman dreams about being a housewife why not let them be one  
  
it felt really wrong that it was encouraged to emotionally manipulate and gaslight the kens and it was treated as something powerful  
  
i understand that ken wouldnt be the type of person to have social anxiety but to say no man has social anxiety really  
  
and there were some things in the movie that were just a straight up missed opportunity like when americas daughter talked about how barbie gives girls poor body image i was actually waiting for it to be brought up later because in 2016 a study was conducted that said girls ages 68 were dissatisfied with their own bodies after just 5 minutes of playing with a barbie doll and another study which is now famous black children were brought into a room they were told to choose with doll they preferred between a white and a black doll all of the kids said they preferred the white doll because it looked more like them and the black dolls were bad i think this shows that things like toys and television can impact the way children perceive beauty i thought the movie would be this up later and say hey you dont have to look like barbie but we can aspire to be just as hardworking as barbie  but it was just used as a throwaway line in roasting session  
  
i saw someone on the internet describe barbie this way and i have to agree they said it felt like brainstorming turned into a movie the movie kind of felt half baked and i feel like all it has done is perpetuate a gender debate on the internet instead of a conversation men and women both struggle just in different areas of life women are more likely to be sexually harassed and discredited and men are more likely to deal with depression and suicidal thoughts instead of competing with each other about who has it harder we should be open to talking about these issues without antagonizing the other  thats how our problems will be solved  
  
again i want to state that i liked barbie it was a fun movie and nice change of pace from what general audiences typically watch if you disagree with anything i said i would love to hear what you have to say  because as i said earlier i feel like its important to have conversations about these types of things

"fun and silly movie with heavyhanded political themes 

i particularly like the acknowledgment that barbieland is a matriarchy and that kens obsession with patriarchy stemmed from finding selfworth given his whole existence was to be a side piece to barbie and that men largely have nothing there the little bit at the end with them trying to find a spot in the government so they could have a voice and after the entire film they were still like nah lol was pretty amusing and it was nice that they pretty much outright stated that the barbies were fighting to make kens go back to being second class citizens

i know none of that was largely the point of the movie but it would have felt wrong if they didnt bring that up at all which they did in hindsight the entire ken society was probably just a reflection of how women were treated which was probably the point",2023-07-24 06:58:59
"just saw it today and surprisingly loved it  

gosling and robbie play off each other perfectly the mom and daughter characters were actually quite relatable kate mckinnon’s weird barbie stole every scene and most importantly the humour and political messages are well balanced so the movie doesn’t swing too hard into unfocused comedy or heavyhanded preaching

plus the cherry on top the sets costume design and especially the choreography for the dance sequences were very well done

i went into this movie completely blind yesterday i overall enjoyed it the comedy felt a little too rand0m and forced to me still let out a little giggle her and there just wasnt my jam did relate a lot to the message tho which is about the only thing besides ryan gosling i really enjoyed in the movie,2023-09-20 18:26:22
the film revolved around womens issues but also addressed things we all face it dove into the pressures that some men face if youre mad at this film there is a high chance you are part of the problem,2023-07-22 01:41:20
"it was awesome im not proud to say that as a guy it made me uncomfortable but then i decided to work through that and ask why i felt uncomfortable im not proud to say i related to ken when he was being toxic and felt like the movie was a wake up call for me embarrassing it took a kids movie to explain it to me but i figure all i can do is capitalize on it

trying to get my guy friends to see it now",2023-07-24 05:42:16
a group of teenaged boys started acting up trying to disrupt things and then straight up walked out in the middle of america ferrara’s monologue which ironically is an even better piece of satire than anything the movie did which is a high bar to clear,2023-07-27 21:22:12
"ok so i saw it and loved it but some parts did fall flat for me 
1 the moms speech about the duality of womanhood it felt like it was far too general to be relatable as a woman myself i could relate to a few things but not the entire thing i am sure lots of men could relate to it as well it was so general i don’t think it was uniquely feminine also i don’t know why she was telling the barbies all of this why would these nonhuman barbie’s who have never experienced real patriarchy understand this speech i would’ve liked it more if it had been a bit more personal to her own experience instead it felt like a buzz feed list she was rattling off 
2 i think it’s pretty clear ken didn’t bring the patriarchy to barbieland he brought what he thought was patriarchy but it was actually a sort of innocent misunderstood idea of masculinity he basically brought with him the idea that horses and beer are awesome and he even has that line where he says “once i realized the patriarchy didn’t have anything to do with horses i lost interest” so i don’t understand why the barbie’s are brainwashed as if the kens brought a diabolical plague it also lends to my first comment i don’t see how the mom’s speech would be helpful to them when the barbies haven’t actually experienced any of the paradoxes she’s talking about 
3 i disagree with the people who think it’s anti man i actually thought the scene where ken has that montage moment and sees all these great moments in history that had to with men is a positivemasculinity moment nothing he saw was bad it was all wholesome guy stuff and i think it was clear from the movie that the way ken is treated in barbieland is sad and not the ideal
4 one of the most touching moments to me was when barbie talks with ruth at the table in my mind ruth is basically barbie’s mom in that scene we saw how amidst all the chaos and confusion barbie has she finds comfort and peace in having tea with her mom and when ruth says “you look different” and barbie says “usually i look perfect” and ruth says “i think you look just right” i thought that was so beautiful and i totally cried 
5 i wish they would’ve delved into the mom’s depression a bit more the mom playing with barbie to deal with depression and anxiety amidst her everchanging life and distance from her daughter is a really interesting plot point but they didn’t flesh it out a whole lot it gets brushed aside and i guess resolved without any real work being done 

i have lots of thoughts floating around but these are the ones that are at the top of my brain so overall i really enjoyed the movie i think in some ways it was trying to do too much and that’s where my criticism comes from",2023-07-31 22:04:32

it was so fun seeing all the different barbies  barbie accessories and pointing out which ones i had i was especially excited to see the pooping dog bc that one was one of my favorites lol,2023-07-22 03:37:51
i’ve been ranting all night but  i’m still annoyed by all the inconsiderate assholes in my theater why do people pay to sit on their phones for the entire movie why do these parents let their kids run around like it’s a playground and use everyone else as their babysitter and you can’t say anything because you don’t want to get recorded honestly i’m really considering not going to any big releases any more end rant,2023-07-22 03:47:04

the genius of using a spice girls song in the montage of weird barbie being created when they like barbie have received criticism of their own for their type of feminism,2023-07-22 18:02:16
"oof i think barbieheimer was a bad idea for me it soured my opinion on this movie a bit i still liked but i feel like i didnt like it as much as i should have im too old to spend that long at the movie theater and oppenheimer was such a sprawling beast of a movie it left me shellshocked i feel like i was too tired and emotionally not in the right headspace to really get into the barbiesphere

im seeing it again next weekend with my sister just barbie by itself i think ill really enjoy the experience a lot more robbie and especially goslings acting was superb and i think the pacing will seem a little more even and the jokes will land a little better

i think you should definitely see barbie just maybe not an all day matinee experience unless youre young or have very high movie endurance lol",2023-07-22 23:32:57
"i was shocked by the ending of this movie my mom and i saw it together and we were a sobbing mess at the end

i loved the whole movie so much but the ending totally got to us i had tears in my eyes for a good 20 minutes after it ended the music and imagery were so beautiful and touching",2023-07-23 03:11:47

funny  satircal
visually beautiful

great soundtrack
that billie eilish scene  beautiful
funny perfect ending reminded me of the ending of bodies bodies bodies with the charlie xcx song

it felt like a weird 90s movie
i loved that it was so weird  camp",2023-07-23 05:15:54
"fairly brilliant film in my opinion weve been hit with a glut of metanarrative films over the past few years and theyre rarely done this well 

i do like that one of the main narratives of this film is that the patriarchy isnt really good for anyone its not great for ken and its not certainly not great for the allens of the world that dont necessarily fit in to the ken archetype",2023-07-23 18:10:16
i was pretty much laughing the whole time,2023-07-24 11:29:36
what a fun movie great soundtrack all around at first my only complaint was the messages couldve been more subtle but then my friends made me realize that lots of kids are also watching and it helps to make the message come across more obvious and really highlight the gender discrimination that exists in our society to kids,2023-07-30 22:33:36
the mattel stuff was funny but didnt really need to happen the movie was still good though i enjoyed it,2023-08-10 15:08:24
i think this movie was very playful but also smart and sophisticated with the way it handled its subject matter it felt like i was watching the human psyche being adapted on screen perfectly encapsulated by the sensitive topics driving barbie and ken i also just loved how the movie was made from the cinematography to the production design fun time,2023-12-18 08:47:43

"i liked it the sets the jokes ryan  gosling  

only issue was i felt the touching moments were a bit bland and long 

it was a bit awkward being the only guy without a girlfrend in a theater of what i assume were tween22 year old girls",2023-07-21 05:18:12
already plenty of people rightfully praising this movie so just wanted to add that my boyfriend and i did the unofficial “barbenheimer” double feature and the auditorium we saw barbie in was right next to the imax meaning all those memes about the barbie audience feeling nuclear explosions next door were in fact accurate added an extra level of humor to the whole thing ,2023-07-21 17:42:35
"i dont know what but i kinda hoped they would do more with midge especially since she got her own promotional poster it seems odd that all she said the entire movie was hi barbie and why wasnt she living in the weird barbie house with all the other discontinued dolls is it just because shes not a barbie herself

otherwise absolutely loved this movie lived up to the hype for me the whole theatre was in fits at note to the filmmakers margot robbie is the wrong person to cast to make this point",2023-07-21 19:23:21
"not sure how the humour would be seen overseas  i’m from australia where snl is seen as both representative of usa humour but also seen as one of the lamest forms of comedy tbh

i was in a packed theatre for barbie  some of the jokes were a hoot and really well done and very smart eg depression barbie narrator speaking over barbie’s insecurities barbie acting stiff like a doll a lot of other jokes felt flat and to a quiet audience here interesting to see if the praise for the comedy is a us only phenomenon",2023-07-21 20:40:59
"i think there were too much ideas and plot lines that made the film a bit messy and unfocused i am not sure if it was done on purpose 

i personally think this film is sad i didn’t feel happy  or delighted after the film for me personally it shows that both worlds are not perfect  they are perfect either just for kensmen or just for barbieswomen kens didn’t know other way then just become basically barbies excluding them and at the end it’s all staying the same in both worlds with a little hope however but still both worlds remained imperfect and seemingly unchanged still no balance found 

like in the past women were seen as with no interests other then to please men same goes with kens ken was exited that he can read about horses and linked it to patriarchy because he wasn’t allowed to have any interests in the barbieland 

i disagree that this film is antimale you expect that ceo is a bad guy but he’s just ok he’s just doing his job and has some good motives when kens fought they ended up supporting each other yet i would love to see how the patriarchy affects men in negative way as well basically also being perfect on the top not expressing emotions loneliness etc and also to show that some barbies would gladly be with kens it did show it at end but briefly it was not enough for me that being a powerful woman doesn’t exclude being with the man if she wants it and that being a powerful ken is totally okay too but at least it showed that if you’re a man and are not on the top it’s okay too 

alan was a great guy because he was the only person who was balanced he was happy where he is was just minding his own business and when everything went wrong he was just done with everything he was the only guy who was supporting barbie while still being kenough 

but i wanted to escape reality with this film but  there’s no fairytale just bitter reality",2023-07-21 21:52:32
"im seeing people calling ken a villain but was he really that i saw it more like he was living a life where the world was completely ruled by women and men were secondary  but then he understood that it hadnt to be like that so he tried to inverse it the problem was that instead of learning from his experience and making everyone the same he made it the completely inverse where men ruled and women were secondary then again the barbies do the exact same as ken did taking the complete control of barbieland i know barbies took control teaching the other barbies but then instead of trying to use that knowledge to try to talk it and reach a conclusion they use it to trick the kens and make only the barbies vote kens didnt even use force to get barbieland they just learnt from the blonde ken and used that to control barbieland but since at that time the barbies couldnt argue with that they won so at the end the kens will live in the original barbieland but now with some more rights what i think is that neither the barbies or kens were villains they were just trying to fight for the best for themselves but they never learnt from their situation so they got stuck in the same problem over and over

at least thats what i think what do you guys think",2023-07-22 00:39:26

"i loved the first part of the movie but honestly the whole ken plot line just lost me near the middle and end everything felt so spelled out for me especially the speech
i feel like it would have made more sense if barbie took ferrera to barbieland as it is with the female president and female nobel winners and for ferrera to still feel inadequate or even more inadequate i feel like it would have pinned down the point they were trying to make about the “normal barbie” who doesn’t need to be everything to be amazing 

like barbie thought she would fix ferreras complex feelings of grief and plainness by showing her all of these really successful images of barbie like “hey women can be everything and anything isn’t this super uplifting” and for ferrera to respond how i think most women in that state of feeling like they’re failing at being perfect and plastic which is even more depressed and inadequate i thought it was gonna be more metaphorical to how women feel looking at social media with influencers instead it became about ken and fixing all these perfect women in barbieland and didn’t really feel impactful on the real world although that’s just my opinion but i guess as someone who relates more to ferrera than barbie it felt like her storyline ended kind of incomplete

i mean i think it was impactful for a lot of women which is important i did hear some people crying in ferreras speech i personally cried during the part where barbie is sitting on the bench with the old lady but yeah i just didn’t love the ending i know everyone else did",2023-07-23 18:29:49
"absolutely loved it from beginning to end and so did the rest of the theater from the vibe the humor was great loved the overall vibe and design of the movie and it had a nice positive message in general the narration and fourth wall breaks were neat whats not to like 

i also appreciated that mattell more or less poked fun at itself as the bad guys and acknowledges that both product and company are not without some level of fault nice touch that they included a bit of history with ruth handler not even shying away from her mastectomy and legal issues

all in all definitely worth a rewatch",2023-07-23 20:30:10
"took my wife and two daughters to go see it yesterday and i absolutely loved it some of that messaging my kiddos won’t totally get but they’re old enough that’ll it’ll have some lasting impact

this was so much more introspective and thoughtful than the previews would have you believe my fiance absolutely loved it and i thought it was pretty  good too it was also cool to be at a theater for a big new release and see crowds of women of all ages dressed up and excited for it like me and my nerd friends do for comic book stuff very cool,2023-07-23 23:56:16

ken was the highlight every scene with him was fantastic",2023-07-31 00:29:46
"what was the movies thesis

not to oversimplify but i felt that barbieland is introduced as a world with flipped gender roles barbies control everything and ken do nothing but try to get barbies attention then they declare that patriarchy is bad and then it ends with barbies undermining the kens to reestablish their matriarchy the only difference is that now ken has intrinsic self worth though no real role home or representation in society and stereotypical barbie completes her maturity by converting from a barbie to a human so whats the point patriarchy is fine only if women have intrinsic self worth",2023-08-01 06:55:31

"it was a pretty funny movie but by the end i didnt get the message it was trying to convey and will ferrell was totally unnecessary to the plot it felt like the kens had been oppressed in the barbie land society but that was just shrugged off and everything returned to status quo

however i will respect this movie for taking a lot of risks like making a kids franchise pg13 depicting  harassment and directly calling out the ceos of the brand it was about regardless of the message taking a glorified toy commercial and doing something interesting with it is a win imo",2023-08-18 23:04:24
"this is was a  clever movie 

it was three movies one for women to validate their experiences and one for men one has probably come the closest ive ever seen to giving a sense of the inequities that women face the number of people who felt uncomfortable when the kens were offered a lesser role in the barbieland government proved the point for sure 

the one thing i kinda thought was forced was americas brief speech about all the contradictions women face in a society it just felt wedged in and and turned into a convenient plot device like they ran out of ideas on how to incorporate the messaging it was a really important message that kinda didnt get its time to sink in before jumping to the next major plot point",2023-08-27 18:42:44
i really liked the start of it but it turned to all montages and musical acts i wish they made it more seriously,2023-10-02 19:35:07
disappointing i don’t know what the movie is trying to convey it seems it wants to talk about something very insightful and important yet what it has presented is just chaotic and blurry,2023-10-19 03:30:07
"just finally watched it i get that the whole idea of barbie is catered towards girls female empowerment etc and thats fine but i feel like the underlying message of the move is so representative of what i dislike about the extreme feminist movement

at the start of the movie women are in total control of barbie land obviously when the kens take over it is seen as bad and we need to get back to the original arrangement where barbies rule everything obviously patriarchy is a bad thing but the idea that matriarchy is the solution is just the exact same problem but reversed this is what led the kens to rebel when ryan gosling comes back after having tasted male empowerment in the real world he wants that because he has zero power in barbie land when the barbies take back control a few of the kens even ask for a seat in the supreme court or whatever ie asking for equality and the president just flat out denies them they ultimately settle for lower court positions i think

the takeawaylessons learned from the ken perspective is that ken is his own individual and he need not be defined by the and ken stereotype in which his sole purpose in life is to be merely an afterthoughtsidekick to barbie and thats a great message but it gets overshadowed by the other message which is that a righteous and just society is one where women are in control thats delusional there should be gender equality but that concept never even comes up unless i missed it at the end

and i’m sorry the idea that barbie’s had a huge impact on expanding kids’ imagination is   the company did the opposite by chasing dollars and sales by making different barbies for every situation imaginable which stifles kids’ imaginations not promotes it when you have a new commercial every month shoving a new barbie theme down kids’ throats just so they buy another barbie  come on mattel  let’s be real",2023-12-21 02:00:09

“we mothers stand still so our daughters can look back to see how far theyve come”

im not a native english speaker but i see many people on twitter saying it basically means the mother stops everything to live though her daughter is this what it actually means or is it open to interpretation

because i thought it was sort of a double entendre on the feminist cause ruth created barbie to inspire little girls to be what they really want to be and now her daughter barbie doesnt want to just inspire but actually help on the field

i felt like it meant that past to a certain point the first generation of women fighting for gender equality needs to let the next one do it as they will be outgrown by their own cause they might not understand this new generations take on their fight but it is probably because they did their part and have achieved progress

the opening sequence when the girls smashed their dolls was great  the expression on some of their faces 
im sure i missed many of the references to other films  but picked up on 2001 and matrix",2023-08-23 12:33:55
i don’t like it bc where the  is raquelle,2023-09-04 20:43:51
i think it was good but i think white feminists would enjoy it more tbh im black so i feel like my womanhood is just not the same as a white womans womanhood ya know there’s still issues but the degrees vary on race a lot tbh i’m confused how everyone is saying this movie changed their life as if it’s not things that we haven’t already known and also saying this is the first movie to address womens issues in depth is just silly as well i don’t think anything in the movie was said that was groundbreaking,2023-07-21 14:50:45
"as much as i hate to say this i left the theater feeling a bit disappointed overall i did like it but there are some things i would have changed plotwise that i feel would have greatly improved and cleared up the message of the movie see below

pros   
 the acting   
 the amazing barbieland sets  
 superb costuming   
 the “plot twist” that it was the mother’s memories not the daughter’s  
 ken realizing he is kenough without barbie  
 the inclusion of weird barbie we all had her  
 humor and mattel’s selfdeprecating humor  


  
cons   
 no plot got to be explored or resolved the way it deserved because there were too many to tackle matriarchy vs patriarchy mattel executives barbie wanting to be human mom and daughter conflict  
 the ending multiple aspects of it  
 sasha’s the tween girl character was insufferable for me personally too intense and cold bullying barbie and calling her a fascist at age 12

things i would have changed about the plot

1 focus primarily on the plot of barbie wanting to be human and matriarchy vs patriarchy as the secondary plot the movie ends with barbie wanting to be human but we only got one scene at the beginning of the movie where she takes in real world’s humanness in fact in the middle part of the movie all she wants is things to go back to how they were before she visited real world because everything was perfect her humanness is never mentioned again until the last 5 minutes of the movie in my opinion this should have been the primary plot of the film and could have been explored so deeply using the theme “barbie even though she is perfect sees how imperfectly perfect humans are and wants to feel what they feel despite it being messy sometimes” this also would have gone handinhand with the mom’s speech about the trials of being a woman and her suggestion of an ordinary woman barbie because women are not perfect despite the standards set but there is beauty in the messrealness  just like barbie realizes and decides she wants randomly in the last 5 minutes
2 i wish they ended the movie with the barbies and kens realizing that matriarchy and patriarchy are both not ideal because either barbies or kens will always feel lessthan and under appreciated in this day and age why are we not promoting more togetherness there was a great opportunity at the end for president barbie to give kens a valuable role in government but it is quickly shot down then there were comments from barbies along the lines of “they have to start somewhere” and “they will have as much power as women do in the real world” i get the point they were trying to make but still think it was a huge missed opportunity to promote men and women both seeing each other as valuable and having innate worth within society
3 in the last scene of the movie i was expecting barbie to be interviewing for a job or something her being at a gynecologist was funny but i would have also loved for us to see her earning a high position on mattel’s board and introducing ordinary woman barbie or something along those lines  after all she did say she doesn’t want to be the idea she wants to be the one creating the ideas also the point of barbie is that women can do anything and wear pink heels and be divinely feminine while doing it at the end of the film in the real world she is wearing beige and birkenstocks what a statement it would have been to see her being a girlboss in the real world while still totally owning her love of pink especially since at the beginning of the movie she is against the birkenstocks that weird barbie wants her to try
4 lastly the whole movie is about how the patriarchal real world is awful compared to barbieland then when barbieland is turned into a patriarchal society by the kens the barbies hate it and devise a plan to overthrow it and they succeed but at the end does barbie just forget everything she fought for in barbieland when she turns into a human and essentially enters the manrun world she worked so hard to fix at the end it would have been great to have barbie indicate that another reason she wants to turn human is to help real world women gain more equality and respect like she thought had already been accomplished at the beginning of the movie so that real world is more like the barbieland in my rewritten plot since the barbies and kens respect and value each other as equals
5 one more note i would have given the kens a bit more substance than beach it was humorous but almost saying that barbies are in charge simply because the kens have infant brains with no thoughts whatsoever in reality though we should be portraying the message that barbies are in charge because of their intelligence leadership skills etc instead of ken’s lack thereof

things i felt were unnecessary to the plot

1 the mattel executives should have gotten less screen time or should have helped move the plot forward in some way there was really no purpose for them despite chasing barbie around and once they got to barbieland they were also pretty useless maybe they could have helped the barbies and kens work out their issues since they literally created them
2 the mother and daughter conflict honestly didn’t add much to the story for me there wasnt any development there and like i said before and it could just be me the daughter’s character was too much and so disrespectful it would have been the same story if they didn’t have such a bad relationship and the mom started playing with barbie again just because she was mourning the loss of her daughter’s childhood as she transitions into a young woman this “mourning the loss of the childhood” could have also been the explanation of barbie’s death thoughts

again i did like the movie but think it could have been better and more meaningful i love reading everyone elses thoughts on it too",2023-07-24 16:23:27
"i saw it last night and loved it 

my only note is that at the end she introduced herself as barbara handler the last name of the creator of the doll and full name of the daughter she was named after…but barbie’s full name has always been barbara millicent roberts i thought it would have been a better nod to use the roberts last name",2023-07-21 18:18:04
really into the way greta gerwig references classic cinema the opening space odyssey reference is obvious but i also picked up a fight club reference with the fur coat ken was wearing were there other ones that you guys caught,2023-07-21 20:18:01
“you gotta tell them you’ve never seen the godfather” was hilarious watching it with my husband since he begged me to watch the godfather when he found out i haven’t seen it hahahah,2023-07-22 05:19:39
it needed an extra twenty or thirty minutes the entire human subplot was so bare bones that we hardly got to know them or spend time with them the daughter changed her tune in the snap of a finger and barbie although she selfactualizes never found her personality it was like the entire movie was her realizing she wanted to become a human but yet we never saw her become a person who barbie is i still don’t feel like i know meanwhile ken is the one character fully fleshed out his entire arc worked but it overtook barbie’s own arc and i think the movie suffers because of it with some extra runtime a few more jokes some actual time with the mom and daughter and a bit of personality building for barbie i think this could’ve been perfect instead of just really good but no one would ever green light a 25 hour barbie movie,2023-07-22 06:33:43
"this movie was the best kind of ridiculous

i had a smile on my face for pretty much nearly all of it

the overthetopness of barbieland and its characters just captivated me some great humor and i was thoroughly entertained

great day at the cinema",2023-07-22 21:58:49
"i liked the movie a lot i loved what it attempted to accomplish but the execution felt a bit clumsy

they  up by making ken the more active protagonist of the story ken has a very clear want whereas barbie never even really even accepts her call to action ken wants something easy to understand and more easily relateable its incredibly dangerous to give a completely powerless character in society the drive to increase their status throw in a few music and dance numbers and the audience is going to get on board

barbie is set up as an antagonist wants to maintain the status quo or at the very least her wants are much less clear than kens she wants to rid herself of the societal anxiety that comes with simply existing as a woman while that makes a good point it is held onto until near the end of the movie and is used more as a reveal than her driving force",2023-07-23 06:10:19
this is a small thing but my favorite joke was  after she realized she cant be mad at barbie dolls anymore  the daughter immediately pivoted to claiming that her dad trying to learn a second language is appropriation she just had to take up a cause didnt matter how little sense it made,2023-07-23 17:09:19
there were such great moments but i feel like the film as a whole had no cohesive flow i can’t quite pinpoint what made me feel like i couldn’t connect and why i didn’t take away a strong message,2023-07-23 22:44:07
instantly iconic last line,2023-07-23 22:57:47
while i mostly really liked this movie there was scene towards the end that put a little bit of bad taste in my mouth i felt it was weird that when ken was crying it was played for laughs especially contrasted with how sincerely barbies’ crying scene was it felt like it undermined a lot of the films message about gender roles and emotional vulnerability,2023-07-24 16:23:03
i dont think this movie was necessarily just about sexism and ive seen a lot of people saying this movie is antimen i think it does a good job of showing you that patriarchy is bad for everyone barbie obviously had it rough when she goes into the real world and sees that its not the same as barbie land and has a crisis when she learns of all the things women have to go through and how hard we have it being sexually assaulted and objectified within minutes of arriving in the real world and then being arrested for defending herself when that one guy slaps her  even the police at the station were objectifying her and brushing off her very real and very upsetting experience that nearly every single woman will have gone through at some point in their life and somehow theyre blamed for wearing something too revealing or leading a man on or being too  meanwhile ken lands in the real world and is immediately given the respect hes been missing in barbie land and so hes brainwashed into thinking the patriarchy is the best thing ever and just goes along with it even though he doesnt really understand it it made me think of little boys who were raised by a mans man who go on to have the same values as their fathers even if they dont really understand why,2023-07-27 10:08:35
people in the comments arent realising that painting gender relations as a zerosum game is a hyperbole and satire and feminists dont see the world like that but for some women it can feel like that it is not a war between men and women,2023-07-31 18:00:30
"so i just got back from barbie 2023 my most anticipated movie of the year and i didnt just like iti loved it i love this movie i dont even know how to describe it in words without spoiling it its one of those movies tou just have to see for yourself to believe not only because its extremely funny and also the flawless set design of barbieland but also the film goes surprisingly heavy and existential in its themes and i think men need to see this movies as well because i see people online claim this movie is antimen that is dishonest and a lie in every sense of the word 

if anything the film is progender equality as the film basically deals with womanhood and how truly hard it is to be a woman in this world and why they should be treated as equals and the film hits the point hard allowing the dramatic moments to hit even harder its also antitoxic masculinity and shows that men shouldnt be acting like sexist jerks as that doesnt make look strong or cool at all so yeah anyone who says the film is antimen is wrong and like i said the film handles its actual themes of progender equality and antitoxic masculinity brilliantly and i love how this film gets heavy even when it didnt need too 

but make no mistake the film is still a comedy and man oh man does comedy land extremely well i am into very weird humor and this film is exactly that and i love it it had made laughing quite a few times one sequence in particular involving will ferrells character was probably the funniest in the whole movie however i will not spoil it also the performance were great as well overall fantastic movie that everyone needs to go and see 1010",2023-08-15 19:40:09
"watched it with the gf it was one of those the internet wont stop talking about it type of movies for us and aside from a few moments we both thought it was just whatever

decent first half kinda plodding second half almost felt like a chore to finish overall neither of us hated it just wouldnt have seen it without all the buzz i guess",2023-09-14 00:19:41
"helen mirren note to the filmmakers margot robbie is the wrong person to cast if you want to make this point

who then isnt one of the ideas of the movie that beauty standards  and everyone is beautiful youre implying theres a way to cast someone as non beautiful bad line considering the context",2023-10-06 17:56:42
"it wasnt as good as i thought it was going to be 

i missed out on the movie goer experience busy with work but it looked like it made such an impact on so many people online that i was really gearing myself up for a cry fest

it felt like a kids movie lol which like  duh its barbie but the way so many people out there were just piling on accolades  i guess i thought itd be more complex than it was 

its probably because most films dont have the characters just straight out say this is what i mean but it felt very odd to have every character be as cartoonishly stereotypical as possible

it was a cute little movie and has a lot of nostalgia attached to it but i dont think it should have garnered the title of highest grossing film of 2023 tbh",2023-12-17 16:14:46
surprise scott pilgrim moment,2023-07-21 09:59:12
"gonna be a lot of confused and scared kids comin out of this movie lmaoooo

loved it not at all what the trailers made it out to be its just an awesome movie that happens to be about barbie",2023-07-21 21:03:43
fun fact literally 0 characters address that any of the discontinued toys exist apart from real world character,2023-07-22 04:10:00
i’m just really glad i saw this at the century city mall,2023-07-22 18:31:00
that last line though,2023-07-23 00:44:29
loved it 1010 just for the shining reference my theater didn’t quite laugh at it not sure if they weren’t aware or it wasn’t too funny but i  died,2023-07-23 19:38:42
it very much felt like a black mirror episode oddly enough lol,2023-07-25 05:14:46
"i knew this movie would be talking about some deep stuff but the beginning felt like a pyschological horror the fragile utopian society barbie just casually bringing up thinking of death it feels like shes been experiencing this for awhile and we just saw a part of it  
honestly im just amazed how many shots it took with mattel and mattel just allowed it

but some of those jokes were insane like depression barbie and issa rae barbie calling ken a  they shouldve used their one fbomb pass but whatever

ik theres a lot of parents complaining about it not being for kids but like have you seen kids nowadays the jokes they make and the things they say are completely typical for them i also think its important for anyone to see of any age or gender sexualization waits for no one many little girls who watched that movie have dealt with objectification educating them to stick up for themselves and not conform to a world not made for them is good also little boys can learn from ken that not every attraction they feel from a girl is mutual and they arent owed anything and building up empathy towards their female peers 

another thing is how this and nimona another kids movie i watched reccently like yesterday and this movie could have ended their stories at the 1 hr mark like a lesser movie would the percieved problem is solved and everyone gets their happily ever after and stretching that out to reach the 1 hr 30 min mark but they instead dig deeper barbie could have just helped out gloria learned that she doesnt need to be perfect roll credits no its barbie also starts to have an exstitential crisis ken has his own exstiential crisis which leads to him attempting to establish the patriarchy barbie encourages ken to be his own person and barbie becomes her own person 

also the movie ending where she meets her gynecologist is so  funny i cant",2023-07-26 04:54:36
maybe… it’s barbie and it’s ken,2023-07-26 21:50:25
i went in completely without any expectation or ideas i purposely kept away from commentary on the movie and i was expecting something lighthearted silly and shallow its far from that the audience and i cheered at some of the scenes it was great such a well thought out and meaningful movie about equality and what it means to be human loved it will watch again and id love to read the script for some scenes,2023-08-08 19:17:53
my pet peeve about something that happens in tv or movies are when its super obvious when cast members arent filming together for a scene i do understand why in movies like this with a huge cast filled with well known actresses and actors but the director and cast should be good enough to not make it obvious but it was so obvious in this movie and it bothers me a lot,2023-11-20 06:59:30
"just watched the movie yesterday and i dont get the big deal  
i thought the movie was funny at some times and selfaware enough not to be cringe  
the story was mid at best nothing in the real world actually mattered and the ceo character was pretty weak if im going to be harsh id say the fact that they needed to get some middleaged woman and her daughter take her back to barbie land and get her to explain everything because the character of barbie was too  to come to any conclusions on their own everyone also talks about the crazy hard feminist messaging but all i saw were some pretty surface level takes cat calling is bad women should be ceo women should be president and sometimes even that was pretty questionable like when they showed us how men were more prone to aggression but then the kens fought for 5 minutes sang about there feelings and became friends again like they couldnt just overthrow the government the day after at the end of the movie i thought now will come the time when the women take a stand and decide not to go back to the matriarchy because they understood that it was unethical but instead they just went back to matriarchy for 90 giving us the message that women and men are actually just as bad as the other will always choose to get on top instead of equality and cant be held accountable for anything im not trying to say that the movie was secretly made by women  hating hollywood stars i just think it was made by a cringe corporation who wanted to make wide claims on politics without standing on anything and it shows mate is shown as a woman loving corporation who is the worst written antagonist ever i also read that a lot of women cried at the end of the movie because barbie had a mother daughter talk with the old lady and it feels so cringe it basically said hey barbie im your mo now even though you dont know me and have never made even the slightest effort to be in your life once but i want to tell you that i love you and you can become a human now bye forever  
tldr its an oke movie with some laughs everyone who thinks this is even close to extreme feminism does not know what feminism is about",2024-01-19 12:50:23
"i personally didn’t like it i’m a woman who grew up with barbie and i was disappointed 

at the beginning of the movie i thought it was super fun and interesting the set and world was great while i loved seeing barbie and the world but as a character i actually immediately related to ken especially when they went to the real world and someone asked him the time and he was so happy to be seen as important enough to be asked what time it is i had a moment where my teacher asked me to help him move some boxes with some other students usually they always ask the guys but i’m being treated the same i know it’s small but when you’re treated less than based on your gender it’s important to you 

so i knew that ken would go overboard and that hopefully the message would be no one should be treated as less than to make the other persons life better and that kens and barbie’s would both be happy but that’s not what happened 

kens moment where he cries that he is nothing without barbie is seen for laughs which makes me sad i’ve seen so many women be raised with that idea and be so lost with themselves when they realize they don’t need to think and act that way that making it for a joke just because it’s a male character upset me 

i also had a problem with the negatives of barbie being said in a small speech but then they never really explained it resolved in any way they just shifted the focus to stopping the kens without acknowledging hey yeah barbie can have flaws and be negative to women too 

i loved that they tried to explain the patriarchy i have no problem with social commentary or political stuff in movies and i’m all for explaining how women are put down but this movie kind of ruins it’s own points with the way they treat the kens 

especially at the end when they ask to have at least one spot on the supreme court and the president says no they can have a smaller less important role then the narrator says the kens would “figure it out” and would eventually get more power but just enough that women have in the real world the way it’s said implies kens deserve less power because they’re incompetent which is a point men have been saying about women for ages… just because it’s said about men does not make the point less sexist or wrong your gender has nothing to do with how you handle power and being a leader this also implies that for women in the real world it never gets better for them

there are also other smaller things politically i thought could be handled better as well as general movie things such as pacing and some characters being useless but that was my main issue with the movie i really wanted to like it more than i did since i love barbie and grew up with it but i was disappointed",2023-07-22 06:48:53
"am i the only one who was kind of dissapointed with the movie it was a bit immature for adults but too mature for kids tbh for me it was a bit overhyped and kind of boring
sorry",2023-07-21 13:39:22
"people complain about this movie being heavyhanded

and yet there are post in this thread about thinking that the movies message was real life should be a matriarchy",2023-07-23 16:27:24
this should be the most obvious production design oscar win of all time truly incredible what they did with barbieland,2023-07-23 18:53:03
ill be honestit was kind of a weird movie to me it was a fun ride but like someone else had posted there were times in the movie it felt preachy and out of place there were funny scenes and the set was wonderful but some things went on too long like when they got too talkative and serious they need scenes like that i get itbut they did not need to be so long i love sending a message but the america ferrera speech could have been cut a bit it went on too long to where the funness of the movie kinda stalled and she had one weird speech i forget what it was about but it was after they found out the kens were taking over barbieland and the barbies were brainwashed she said something weird and out of place and too serious but i forget what it was her daughter was a little too much a brat and then in typical cheesy fashion all of a sudden she falls hardcore into it lets save barbie mom lets do this for you i love you mom type behavior after being so angsty it seemed not genuine she could have played that down a bit and the daughters speech to barbie while she was with her friends was pretty cheesy too and the speech with ruth and barbie at the end i get they had to include an emotional punch but that just took the sails right out of the hype of how the movie had been going there was dancing and chaos going then that quiet one on one speech slowed everything down and they still had another scene to go the speech  talk between ruth and barbie went on entirely too long to where i was like wow what a buzzkill they could have made that more simple and shorter if all those things were cut out of the movie this movie would be fun and funny and cute and not guilty of trying so hard to be progressive i think progressive is good but i cringe when its performative,2023-07-31 08:57:03
"i absolutely loved this movie i was a bit put off by the opening sequence but after 5 to 10 minutes of weirdness i leaned into the whole absurdist vibe and started to really enjoy myself the overthetop hyperfeminine perfection of barbieland the tongue in cheek narration and musical score the sheer goofiiness of the kens that capture the just guys being dudes attitude in the best way ive ever seen on television yeah the plot doesnt make sense but who cares its no more absurd than the latest marvel  and is a perfectly acceptable excuse to tell a funny story about female emancipation

i thought the monologue that everyone loves to quote was a bit preachy and over the top it is not literally impossible to be a woman and only served as a disservice to the films message and the ruth  barbie conversation about how to be human was a bit dragged out which sort of left me feeling that the real movie ended about 10 minutes before the credits rolled but other than that i thoroughly enjoyed myself",2023-07-31 14:04:59
"overall pretty good but way too preachy 

the constant pointing things out was unnecessary and implies they think the audience is too  to figure out very common in hollywood nowadays kids even pick up on subtlety so it really just pulls you out of the movie killing the suspension of disbelief

so a few scenes talking about the patriarchy  barbie notsosubtly talking about being an object  ken’s arc  gloria’s speech way too much 

but with the plot it just amplified things then with things like saying nonchalantly that the husband will be fine with no concern for him as gloria  her daughter go to a different world  it just gave off this vibe…

it was good for ken’s plot because they addressed it but with gloria’s speech about how she has to do all this and that and worrying constantly yet we see her unconcerned about her husband when they go into a strange place with no idea when they’ll return…it just felt a little…hypocritical

i feel like a little editing could’ve fixed that

i wish they put more focus on the script mainly with making a couple scenes more subtle and especially with the mattel board 

with that said the acting was really good from everyone set design was fantastic the intro was really funny  fun

ryan was hilarious 
imo his parts were the best parts of the movie several scenes i noticed he did little details like shake his fists for a few seconds when he was struggling with what he felt or he did this little tilt of his head which made him seem more doll like just amazing
 
great choreography of the dance  musical numbers…and of course the fight scene was great there were a ton of things going on at once my friend noticed things i didn’t  vice versa like a ken giving cpr to a stickhorse lol

so really good movie but i think people forget that if you go too hard with inserting life lessons  preaching it kills the fun 

not to mention turns people who are sick of being talked down to off from watching the movie 

and here it probably would’ve taken a few minor changes to take a pretty good movie to make a flawless one",2023-09-25 01:27:38
"unironically this film totally got what it means to be a woman in a world where every imperfection is used against you 

barbie is about discovering your place your identity in a world that wants to put you in a box it’s about the conundrums and contradictions of femininity and the aching feeling of being judged to impossible standards 

its about the complexity of consciousness and the relationships we build with simple thoughts and actions that can last a wonderful lifetime and that is what it means to be human in a world that’s always changing

and a line that really stood out to me was “mothers stand still so daughters can look back and see how far they’ve comel” like  what a line 

it was genuinely so amazing to see everyone all dressed up in pink and being excited for the movie i saw my classmates all show in barbie hats pink shorts and pink shirts they’re all also guys so it was cool of them to do that i saw people in pink cowboy hats and i just saw all of us being happy",2023-07-21 03:45:38
"i haven’t seen anyone really touch on this but to those frustrated by the ending and a lack of actual representation for the kens i think the frustration is supposed to be the point men don’t really feel the effects of the sloowwwww churn of progress for women the suffrage movement was in the 20s and according to forbes “it wasnt until 1974 when the equal credit opportunity act passed that women in the us were granted the right to open a bank account on their own technically women won the right to open a bank account in the 1960s but many banks still refused to let women do so without a signature from their husbands”

so you go through allllllllll this hard work and seemingly monumental effort and at the end of it you’ve only moved an inch and it’s good you moved that inch but  is there a long way to go  and i don’t think barbie is saying that is okay it’s just saying this is how it’s been and firmly places this  experience into the shoes of the men watching who may understand but never really placed themselves in that position beforeokay i mean there is a whole conversation of marginalized groups like lgbtq and racial groups who do understand and experience this so it isn’t a 1 to 1 but this is talking on the strict gender binary that barbie is presenting",2023-07-24 05:18:29
"ive been thinking more and idk i just dont love how they portrayed gender relations as some zero sum game even if it was done tongue and cheek it was just kind of off to me



like i feel like they dove head first into the kind of stereotypes that feminists have had to work hard to shake off saying that gender relations have been solved when the only thing that has been solved is that now men are the ones oppressed just seems weird most real feminists would say that men are oppressed by patriarchy as well and that the goal of equality is a society where its not barbies house or kens house but one where everyone has a house yet the movie ends where it began with ken back to just being homeless i guess and with the barbies just not caring as if the only state the movie can imagine is one where one gender has to have dominance over the other



also this is only kind of related but for some reason the jokes with that dad character just seemed so mean spirited to me like hey look at this   trying hard to learn a second language so he can communicate with his wife and daughter in their native language what a  lets laugh at him just seemed like a weird thing to make fun of a character over",2023-07-31 03:16:41
"i really enjoyed it i watched opening night and was so disappointed i didnt wear pink 

but i am just curious if anyone who has already watched the film recall that one scene when the narrator said something about margot robbie its like when barbie was crying telling herself that shes   i didnt quite get it since the audience laughed but i didnt hear it very well if anyone recalls what the narrator said i want to knoww ",2023-07-21 23:43:19
i hope there’s a special place in  for people who let their kids run around and scream in the theater it never ceases to amaze me how inconsiderate people really are,2023-07-22 03:05:29
"this was way funnier than i thought it would be and i was psyched for this movie to begin with i think i will watch it again in theaters i liked it that much i want to make notes of all the jokes i like because i cant remember them all there are just so many

this movie perfectly mixed in the drama with the comedy too some moments hit pretty deep and had my theater crying the part with barbie at the bus stop with the old lady was absolutely beautiful 

everyone did a wonderful job acting in this this was perfected casted and everyone was perfect 

 the music was perfect was that lizzo singing the wake up song that was so funny and catchy i liked sooooo many of the songs in this 

my respect for greta gerwig has grown even more i have genuinely loved every movie she touches and this might be my favorite i cant wait to see more from her",2023-07-22 05:15:41
the i’m just ken song and dance number is so good who knew ryan gosling had such pipes,2023-07-22 05:34:28
"getting margot as barbie felt perfect especially the commentator picking at it i honestly can’t imagine if amy schumer was barbie instead 

i enjoyed it and had some good laughs so many good ken cosplay ideas for halloween this year plus an i am kenough hoodie would be amazing 

i’m curious though what parts did people cry at because i didn’t really find anything to be super sad 

overall i’d say 810 it’s a super easy watch fun soundtrack and has tons of memorable moments",2023-07-22 05:41:58
"so one thing i havent seen mentioned much is the  soundtrack to this movie

it was absolutely fantastic from beginning to end every scene seemed to have the perfect music playing underneath it and they really used music as a form of storytelling not just background audio",2023-07-22 06:21:05

"in most movies the lgbt representation is usually included in a way that can easily be removed from the final product so that the studio can still sell the movie in markets that are even less accepting than the us

i really appreciate that doctor barbie played enough of a role in this movie that she cant just be cut out",2023-07-24 16:05:55
the one thing i didn’t enjoy as much was the ending that whole part with ruth felt like a big commercial ad to me with all those happy families and kids playing all the rest was really good and very fun ryan gosling stole the show this is getting a production design oscar for sure,2023-07-25 13:29:10
weird barbie ftw,2023-07-26 04:06:41
"i liked this movie on the surface  its cute funny enough to have laugh moments throughout and altogether not too deep i didnt go in to the cinema expecting it to be something totally amazing tbf 

to start with there were a number of things that i felt were not very fleshed out

 like the motherdaughter relationship which could have had more of an emotional aspect to the film instead of being very brief and forgettable

  america ferreras depression is also mentioned but not delved into and why her issues affected barbie so severely in barbieland they just go right over americas drawings having to do with death which sounded pretty dark

 unfortunately those things are just never developed once they all leave the real world  america ferrera and barbie are supposed to be just fine without totally addressing the depression and flat feet america and her daughter also just end getting along fine with no explanation or anything to show why they did
 
 re the teenage daughter its surprising she somehow comes round to the idea of stereotypical barbie despite feeling the complete opposite for fascist barbie just shortly before

 and further the status of the kens at the end still left without their own homes and still struggling since they are not totally equal to the barbies 

 i would have enjoyed seeing barbie staying in barbieland to work on making the barbies and kens equal  but maybe that is what a sequel will be about it would be interesting to see barbie living in the real world learning to adjust to life as a real woman now having a  whilst helping to make things equal in barbieland",2023-08-02 04:55:41
in my friend group people either said they hated it or they liked it cause its important but not that they necessarily enjoyed it only one of em said they loved it but their reasoning was the same when i saw it in the theater nobody was laughing im still scratching my head over how it did so well cant all have been the marketing,2023-08-10 14:20:36
"my wife and i went to see barbie again this weekend and to our renewed joy it was just as much fun as the first time probably more so because i wasnt laughing so hard that i missed as many lines  
  
when barbie sits down at the bus stop takes a moment to look at the real world and start to digest what shes seeing she looks over at the old woman and recognizes her beauty  
  
i loved this because its true that older people are beautiful but it also reflects that even barbieland they are aware of age and death in the real world which could partially explain barbies recent thoughts about dying  
  
you are so beautiful  
  
i know  
  
this moment of acknowledgment recognition and connection just captivated me and i really really wanted them to exchange just a few more lines something small but very zen that would be a succinct but powerful expression of the themes of the film and barbies journey  
  
but perhaps gerwig and baumbach thought that might be too much  
  
what do you think  
  
was less actually more here",2023-09-14 16:57:06
"best part for me was the kenough shirt at the end  otherwise i didnt laugh much 

  it was super ham  by literally explaining its many moral commentaries  i did like the message about finding value in yourself regardless of gender again  explained by barbie

overall pretty disappointed",2023-09-19 11:57:10
"probably an unpopular opinion but i’m actually a little disappointed with the dialogue in this movie it have very surfacelevel takes on feminism which i understand to appeal to a larger audience but it was very cringe  

eta i’m not saying feminism itself is cringe but it’s like greta tried to take every obstacle women have faced to shove it into a story or america’s monologue i did think it had some funny parts but i wish the writing was better",2023-07-22 16:23:57

i really liked the movie but i feel like it could have been better and more streamlined less plot points would have made the message easier for some to understand and just a tighter movie in general it was trying to do too many things when just sticking to its core character and message would have been fine and more meaningful overall i give the movie an 8 out of 10 gg did a phenomenal job directing and the performances were fantastic,2023-07-23 05:14:46

"i think it was the stupidest movie i saw in my life a movie needs to at least have a story or some message or even if it doesnt it has to be entertaining at least i feel like barbie gave nothing and this is why i think what i think

  
message 

idk what the movie was trying to tell me i mean the entire barbie land was first ruled by women only and then suddenly the men took over and then men took over so they started calling it patriarchy entertainment the set was the only thing that was a little entertaining but that is it i understand that they were trying to portray that barbies are supposed  to be perfect but that is not how it should be in real world the movie would have been actually good and time worthy if they would have stuck to this point only rather than adding unnecessary feminism into it",2024-03-07 07:58:08
"i hate that i didn’t love this movie i was so excited for it i’m a woman that played with barbies as a little girl  a feminist that loves nothing more than a rich story about female empowerment i just did not enjoy this movie beyond the first 2030 or so minutes the messaging felt so heavy handed like to me there was nothing subtle or nuanced about this movie 

the way they approached certain topics fell so flat for me over  over they referenced “the patriarchy” but i’m not sure that young 13 year old girls  boys using 13 since the movie is technically pg13 are going to walk away from this movie really understanding what that means  how living in a patriarchal society impacts their lives  their futures they talked a lot about it without actually saying anything at all 

i think barbie experiencing the real world would have been a better focus for the movie having her experience the world as we know it  how it often feels to be a woman in our world i thought they were going in that direction when she interacted with those construction workers but that didn’t really go anywhere  show ken also experiencing that same world as a contrast 

have her really bond with that mother  daughter  connect with them  learn about their different experiences as a young girl  woman navigating the world they were such a wasted plot point when she chose to be human i was like why she was in the real world for like an hour what did she experience that made it so appealing maybe one thing she realized she’s missing is true connection with others maybe she wants to help make the world a better place for that teenage girl she’d grown to love that would have been a beautiful journey for her  a way to discuss feminism with some nuance 

i’ve seen a couple people comparing this movie to legally blonde  saying legally blonde did it better i’d agree legally blonde was colorful  sparkly  feminine but also empowering  it’s messaging was subtle but impactful i was actually only 9 years old when legally blonde came out but i saw it in theaters  i still remember walking out of that theater thinking “wow…i could go to harvard one day too i could be a lawyer i could be anything”

so yeah i didn’t enjoy it i laughed a few times it was beautiful to look at  i thought the acting was fine but i was disappointed  thought there was a lot of wasted potential i understand the genderswapping barbie land was a matriarchy  became a patriarchy i get it just did not enjoy it i did enjoy alan though that gimmick was a trip 

tldr it wasn’t for me 610",2023-07-23 23:27:51
"i felt like such an allan at my screening lost among a sea of barbies who dont give a  about me

anyway this movie was  amazing its an existential crisis marauding as kids fare but its original and completely subversive i definitely was not expecting it to go places it did and taking the concept all the way to its logical conclusion margot and ryan were both fantastic in the roles reminded me a little bit of toy story and a little bit of elf i thought the scenes with the mother and daughter were also pretty touching and of course the fact that ken become toxic after only a short visit to the real world thats definitely some heavy content for a product carrying the barbie brand oh yeah and the songs were pretty catchy too

i guess i connected to it in a weird way based on how  everything is in this world its funny because i was thinking back to the latest episode of its always sunny last night dennis takes a mental health day and in some ways this was the perfect parallel both of them ended in a kind of transcendental dreamlike wonder i dont know i guess im pretty  up definitely wasnt expecting barbie to be one of my favorite films of 2023 but here we are also the first greta gerwig film i thoroughly enjoyed

that being said i think this barbenheimer thing was a bust for me i much preferred my own double feature from earlier this year evil dead risebeau is afraid",2023-07-21 09:10:54
it was solid not as good as i thought it would be nor was it bad like i see from some reviews on this thread the set designspieces ryan gosling’s performance as ken and the scene with barbie and the older woman really stood out for me 7510,2023-07-21 10:45:04

"for a movie so unabashedly about feminism in almost every way its insanely ironic that the ryan gosling and all the ken scenes steal the freakin show and are pretty much all i remember about the movie its almost like margotbarbie took a back seat in her own movie for most of it or simply just had the most plain scenes it didnt help they didnt let her have any character or personality which is ofcourse the point to a degree but for everyone around her to be way more fascinating just seems like a strange oversight coming from greta gerwig im just imagining all the creative executive meetings and hammering out the script about how barbie needs more agency control and that these things need to lead to on the nose commentary about society that they just simply forgot to give the character any memorable moments outside of the opening sequence i liked it alot and found it to be very funny but theres quite a lot of flaws will ferrel went all the way to barbieland to donothing and the resolution of this movie was like 30 whole minutes it was over for quite awhile but then we got a montage forreasons simu was fantastic i hope we get to see more of him in the sequel also wish we got more of dua lipa and john cena but this movie is gonna be a hit so hopefully we just get more of everything on the next one major props to set design vfx costume and cinematography this movie was a feast for the eyes

"hello internet ive come to provide my thoughts to the dicussion because thats what reddit is a place where everyone deserves to see and hear all our thoughts on everything yay  


first i have to say on opening night this was hands down on of the best theater experiences ive ever had everyone was dressed in pink or outlandishly in barbie themed costume everyone showed up on time and went to the bathroom prior to the movie beginning there was no whispered conversations about nonsense or bright glows of cell phones i didnt even hear a cough or see anyone go down the stairs to leave for a break during the movie in fact nearly everyone stayed through the credits we truly joined in on the laughter the emotions and the music together and it was that the movies were meant to be seen  that actorsdirectors keep thanking us for   


second id like to begin with my questions how many flippin types of barbies are there also is margot robbie the combination of all stereotypical barbies or just one stereotypical barbie in a singular barbieland of potentially infinite barbielands what type of barbie was kate mckinnons weird barbie prior to the weirdening i did have a criticism on the mattel board featuring will ferrells ceo im not really sure what their point was and if they were meant to serve as anything more than filler it seems to me at least that there was a lot more written and intended there but given that mattel was involved it got edited out in fact a lot of the consumerism got underplayed which was an interesting choice it just seemed like an underutilization of what couldve been a fun exploration or plot line  


third    
barbieland is just as messed up as century city barbieland is not intended to be written as some sort of utopian dream land we should all aspire to its shown as a land of a childs imagination where there are no complexities and the world just works because it does while there are probably dozens of barbies and kens in barbieland i believe theres only one actual barbie and one ken its not a whole world of women running every corner of government and economy but one girl believing she can do any job in her world of play and do any career that mattel sells a costume for it isnt a sea of kens just feeling useless on the beach its just one doll waiting until that girl is ready to play the happily ever after scene

i dont think ken ever understood the patriarchy i think he just saw a world where kens had stories of their own however he could never execute this because he still needed to be given his story failing to realize that barbies are also most likely not freethinkers relying on the owner at play so he filled that void with masculine consumerism machoism and an attempted coup wait theres a hole in the logic if theyre not freethinkers how are they able to crossover and go on this adventure i dont know its a freakin movie also i feel its more of a compulsion than decisions as she just follows where the vision tells her and then other players engage in the decision making going forward really while shes in crisis mode constantly until fed inspiration

i dont know what this barbie constitution looks like i hope one day nick cage will steal it for us all to see however a government and society that makes an entire group of people a second class subject to life long servitude is not a government we should really support ahem i think what a lot of the folks in this thread here dont realize is thats the whole point i think maybe a lot of folks only are getting upset about it now because they are seeing themselves in the characters being subjected to the mistreatment which goes to show how surprisingly effective this movie is its not idolizing the barbie government it is quite literally saying hey lets stop trying to politicize and govern genders specifically and separately  also maybe lets try including more people into the fold i think the point of issa raes president saying no to a supreme court position but yes to a lower court position is one in part to my many barbies one girl theory and two and example of how slow moving human society is to progress and no one has been allowed to jump bars that quickly regardless of when people suddenly take notice of them  


third and a half   
i might be a  piece of plastic but those are my simple thoughts leaving the movie theater about a movie that stars kate mckinnon doing the splits we dont need to take it as seriously as far east foreign trade policy if you disagree   


fourth 

i thought it was worth pointing out because i see it as progress that might have gone unnoticed ryan goslings ken flirts with doctor barbie in this movie who is played by openly trans actress hari nef doctor barbie isnt trans doctor barbie there isnt a 20 minute segment about her being trans in fact theres no mention of it at all she is simply a barbie thats a doctor i find it very refreshing that stories are hiring lgbtqia folks and not needing to center the reason around their being lgbtqia their characters can just participate in life and society without being tokenized or traumatized",2023-07-23 00:17:20
"i really enjoyed this movie it was silly but not absurd funny but not cheap the acting was great the set designs and costumes were perfection the writing was deft 

however i have a question did we all just watch a twohour ad for mattel i know they sort of portrayed themselves as greedy corporate overlords but they weren’t the bad guys in the end and now i see that they are already capitalizing with merch sales it doesn’t ruin the movie for me in the least but it does leave me with a bit of a bad taste in my mouth",2023-07-23 17:07:49
"part of this is probably due to the fact that it was caught in development  since 2009 but i think a lot of peoples issues with this film can be explained by the fact this is basically two movies smashed together into one 

the first movie is about margots character having an existential crisis visiting the real world and learning its not like she imagined and helping sasha and her mother reconnect while also finding out who she is ending with her wanting to become human herself 

the second movie is about the inequality between barbieskens how its basically the inverse of women and men in real life and one ken learning about how men are treated in real life and overthrowing barbie land with those ideals forcing the barbies and kens to confront the issues with their society and giving a satirical reflection of sexism irl 

both deal with major philosophical themes but i think the movie struggles a bit to fully flesh out and neatly tie up the two storylines within the constraints of a 2 hour runtime because of that we get a lot of half baked plotlines the mattel execs alan kind of just being there and the resolution of the movie isnt as satisfying as it could be the kens are basically back to square one with being oppressed by the barbies matriarchy 

i really enjoyed this film a lot i love the absurd elements the surreal humor the focus on existential and philosophical themes the set design was absolutely gorgeous and i love that it was all practical effects and set pieces too but i think it could have benefitted from going all in on one of the two plot points outline above rather than trying to fit them both in a two hour move much like margots barbie in the film i think this movie was struggling to figure out who it really was and never quite got there",2023-07-23 17:11:42

"barbie movie thought dump

the kens need feminism  
  
theres an obvious feminism discussion going on through the film a main plot point is barbie going to the real world and facing the patriarchy which is name dropped as a major plot force throughout the movie to understand how it is used though you have to first look at barbie land  
  
barbie land is a magical place where a plaster pink idea of women supremacy reigns supreeme note not feminism but supremacy the kens exist as eye candy with no real purpose and the barbies go through a laundry list of these ideals like a balance of emotion and rational thought and reaching and achieving any goal they set their mind to while played as a joke if clipped that scene could be used in a dystopian wonderland then generic barbie has intrusive thoughts of death and cellulite and her fantasy is broken  
  
in the real world barbie is forced to acknowledge that her work in barbie land has not mirrored the real world here women are not in charge and have little to no power a point shown through her objectification a man slapping her  in public and a mattel board consisting of only men   
  
when barbie returns to barbie land only to find ken has brought the patriarcy back home and brainwashed the other barbies she is devastated as she wants to go back to being perfect perfect being flawless hair no thoughts of death and no celulite a very superficial definition  
  
after experiencing the poor treatment women face in the real world and being forced to aknowlage this similar treatment to the kens in her world barbie rembers the matrix decision of choosing between heels or flats the way things were or the way things are here the kens are a metaphor for feminism a fight for gender equality   
  
kens journey is meant to mimic the suffrage movement for women to get the right to vote they had to rely on men to pass laws to give them rights there is a level of irony to that statement and this right didnt fix everything it was merely a step in the right general direction   
  
at the end of the movie the kens don’t get a supreme court seat or any position of real power and the marrarator notes “the kens have to start somewhere” the outrage this situation causes some audience members as dense as some may be does put a light on some of the progress equal rights movements have made in gender equality the kens should have more positions of power and better representation in the real world the same goes for women  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
ken is an incel  
  
in the last year i’ve noticed multiple shows and movies particularly comedic ones tackling the topic of incels more often than not the incel is shown as a sterotypically attractive male in his mother’s basement doing nothing but objectifying women and complaining that life isn’t fair this portrayal is  as it paints a one dimentional boogie man that no one can relate to so no one will ever see themselves in the character be willing to critique themselves or promote meaningful change   
  
the barbie movie tackles this topic with a slam dunk by creating a character who is somewhat sympathetic while still being very much in the wrong ken is quite literally created to be barbies boyfriend barbie and ken the twist generic barbie isnt interested in ken she never has been ken has a crisis because his whole purpose is to be barbies boyfriend and he cant fulfill this role the narrator emphasizes this by saying barbie always has a perfect day ken only had a good day when barbie looked at him  
  
there’s a feminist parrallel here and a storyline where barbie goes through a similar journey of self discovery but it’s cool to see this topic tackled from the male perspective in western culture there’s a strong emphasis on a man’s worth being based on his capability to have a partner ken is not excluded from this expectation   
  
ken is a conventionally attractive ripped himbo who is doing everything in his power to get his girlfriend’s attention and getting little to none of it he’s kicked out every night so barbie can have girls night he isn’t included in the big choreo number only jumping in when a different ken taunts him for having a part he’s upset and defeated so when he goes to the real world and sees the roles flip he jumps at the opportunity for power he wants some control and sense of purpose   
  
in practice even with all the power and control ken still can’t force barbie to like him and doesn’t get the one thing he thought he wanted when barbie tells him to find what makes ken ken he begins with the very simple statement of “ken is me” later he is seen wearing a sweater that syas kenough   
  
there’s not a ton of payoff to this story line but it’s not the plot of the movie merely a consequence of having characters other than barbie with hopes and ambition a consequence of good writing if there ever was a sequel delving into ken’s character there would be a deep well to pull from and i suspect horses would be involved   
  
the interesting point is that this light incel characterization of ken is defeated as ken is forced to find purpose outside of romance he needs to find joy in himself by himslef he needs to be ken not some gender flipped other as “barbie’s boyfriend”   
  
  
  
what is barbie  
  
in the barbie movie “barbie  is an abstract concept the beginning of the movie pushes a strong corporate message thart barbie allows girls to see themselves in any role so all their problems are solved then the movie immediately dismantles this idea because of course it’s fictitious bs   
  
throughout the movie generic barbie is forced to experience a more human existence and begins critiquing herself she doesnt feel beautiful shes not as smart as the other more skilled barbies she doesnt doesnt know what her purpose is  
  
this idea is also reflected in ken ken has to learn to be his own person and find purpose outside of having a woman he’s not doctor ken he’s not astronaut ken he’s not beach ken he is ken and that is kenough  
  
these points are cemented in america ferra’s monolouge discussing the complex and contradicting requirements of being a woman it’s an excellent monolouge i encourage everyone to read because at its roots it discusses the struggles of being human never feeling good enough never knowing what you’re meant to do constantly comparing yourself to others the movie is asking you to become the person you want to be find your interests and your desires and wear them unapologetically at the same time without having to directly say it it’s asking you to respect other’s hopes and dreams so that they can do the same to you  
  
at the end of the movie  in the limbo white wall projector realm  barbie states that she doesnt want to be an idea  something that was created  but the thing that creates them humans barbie as a concept helps inspire others but at the end of the day that is all an idea can do an idea is at the whim of the actions of those who create it is influenced and changed by them and has no control over itself an idea itself cannot create when barbie choses to become human she choses to make her own decisions and pave her own path despite the difficulties that come with being in charge of making your own decisions",2023-07-25 14:03:42
"in the spirit of its all about men theme that some reviewers have taken lets a look at some of those aspects in more detail  
  
satire of male superiority the film gives satirical treatment of kens journey from a needy beau to a swaggering macho  his transformation is an exaggeration of stereotypes associated with masculinity and serves to critique the idea of male superiority it should also be seen as a mirror satire of female inferiority and the sterotypes assocaited with that in the real world  
  
mockery of corporate gender politics the depiction of mattels headquarters and ceo subtly critiques corporate attempts to appear diverse and progressive while maintaining a patriarchal system this critique extends the discussion of toxic masculinity into the corporate world demonstrating how such behaviors can permeate different levels of society it was telling that the ceo was verbally all about female empowerment and yet that wasnt followed through with any actual actions despite gender neutral restrooms up the   
  
subversion of male stereotypes the character of allan who is bumbling awkwardly in a sea of hunky kens serves to subvert the stereotype of the hypermasculine male further challenging toxic masculinity allan is in many ways the unexpected hero fighting for the mother and daughter he doesnt have muscles but just allen is enough and barbie would probably be better off with allen allen is an everyman who doesnt attempt to fit into to the hyper masculine world of beach ken however his heroic efforts go under appreciated   
  
the struggle for male identity  kens existential struggle is examined showcasing his dependency on barbie for identity affirmation his journey towards selfdiscovery and selfdefinition is a key aspect of dismantling toxic masculinity as it stresses the importance of individuality and emotional authenticity over conformity to traditional masculine roles  
  
in sumamry the film is kenough of a satire of toxic masculinity that i laughed all the way through it its not anti men there are positive male role models too not least the self discovery of ken   
  
its almost perfect a masterpeice",2023-07-26 08:58:53
"this movie was a lot of fun and it told its story in a unique and thoughtful way gave it like a 910

ive been looking around at commentary and im starting to think its biggest failing is simply falling victim to the cultural climate we are in dont worry keep reading barbie takes a modern perspective and uses it to apply analysis and critique of a magical realism barbie world if we take it at that it really is a superb film 

but when i look at commentary for the movie im consistently seeing two complaints on the opposite ends of a spectrum 1 the film did not do enough to seriously unpack patriarchy and misogyny and critique them in a meaningful and impactful way or 2 the film did too much to unpack patriarchy and misogyny  and critique them in a meaningful or disingenuous and impactful way

i think people have unwittingly gotten caught up in the narrative that this film was gonna change the world and lead to the next wave of new feminist theory if you just let it be a fun yet intelligently written movie there is so much less to be disappointed with

just let barbie be barbie yall",2023-07-26 17:06:55
i haven’t seen anyone mention how “sasha” and her friends were basically the bratz i loved that little detail,2023-07-27 04:41:35
the movie had some good messages funny jokes and entertaining sequences the script should have been given another look at the story level it felt like there were some conflicts that werent even introduced until the very end and character arcs without setup or payoffs its kind of disappointing because it feels like theres a very good movie buried somewhere underneath the mess,2023-07-30 06:53:08
si se puede,2023-07-30 13:28:15
okay im not gonna go into detail but they shouldve gave sasha and her mom more screentime it didnt show how they solved the conflict with their relationship it somehow felt rushed everything from half to finish felt rushed,2023-08-07 14:28:47
"this movie is great on all levels the writing directing casting costumes acting etc all worked for me

i felt personally seen when the ken was explaining how cds work when barbie said she keeps her money in a savings account it is a recreation of the all the conversations i have with my wife about financial investments lol",2023-08-09 06:09:57
am i the only one that thought the music was bad  i liked the idea of most of the songs the various messages or even when they were just saying what happens but as songs they werent good  2 minutes outside of the theater and i couldnt tell you a single lyric from any of the songs that werent push,2023-08-10 03:38:51
"just saw this with a crowd likely much different than most posting here a nonus crowd where people in general dont really audibly react to things very much also no one wearing pink in sight not a bad movie but without an involved crowd it hit a bit flat overall i honestly think the barbenheimer of it all and the cinema viewing experience with fervent crowds is greatly benefiting the movie without that i think itd be regarded as better than youd ever expect from a barbietoy movie to be and overall a decent comedy with a plot thats otherwise a bit of mess but nothing you must rush to the theaters for 

spoilers here forward

i also just find the end result of the kens in barbieland a little odd given the overall themes and messages of the movie maybe i was expecting something too much and just reading into things but it felt like there were numerous setups for some sort of oh the real world isnt the equality heaven we thought which has made me think about our own barbieland and realize that the kens are a bit of second class citizens generally just our accessories and we should be supporting them to be more type of turn like theres the oh i dont know where kens live line which i thought would be a setup for something and while it likely is meant to tie into kens line of i hoped this would be our house thing later it kind of was just a throw away line when the barbies are gung ho to make barbieland basically exactly how it was to start with i was waiting for barbie to have the excuse me actually i think moment in the end theres a little bit of it with the whole helping ken realize that kens can have an identity exclusive of their barbies and should be able to be fulfilled without a barbie but something just felt a bit missing imo like basically the underclass rises up after finding out about an alternative possibility then is squashed back down to where they were in society with a slight caveat of well let you start being involved in some minor positions

in the end the movie is just ultimately about barbie coming to realizations about life and helping her ken realize a life without her and likely delving into such a plot was outside of what gerwig wanted to focus onbut i feel that plot easily could have been fit in if the mattel board of executives just werent in the movie as other than getting will ferrels name for marketing idk what they really added you even have the teenager to be like uh im all for women in power but this society is kinda messed up idk maybe thatd be too stereotypical of a plot but i think it would have led to more of an actual endingleaving point for barbie rather than everything going more or less back to normal and then her just leaving because the world she fought to restore she doesnt really enjoy anymore",2023-08-17 12:40:20
this movie was good but not great the pace is unbearable at times which sucks because there are some really funny and engaging moments the kens literally stole the movie from the boring barbie’s which is hilarious  its like they made two movies and squished them together i wanted to like it more but this movie will not be rewatchable,2023-09-25 11:43:39
i hate glorias nagging speech and her ripping the seam of the worlds toys are toys obviously they are different from real life and i hate the ending i do absolutely love the visuals though,2023-09-25 15:21:23

edit i would like to mention that i did watch barbies life in the dream house prior to this but thats the only barbie related thing i had watched prior to this film",2023-12-17 02:58:13

"super surprising how meta the movie was  didnt expect a mother fker or beach each other off  or even the space odyssey reference super funny and was really for everyone i was sitting next to like the stereotypical image of a rough and tough  merican country man and he was giggling throughout the whole thing    


only beef is that the transition to the gloves off alright lets address some things part of the movie was just super bam  i would have preferred a slower transition into it but then the movie would have to be super long  i guess ill just have to wait for the snyder cut

the guy who played ken did a great job and worked well the guy who played ken and the chemistry between them and the guy who played ken just made a good trio  i thought the guy who played ken was a bit stiff but ill blame the director for giving the guy who played ken more lines than the guy who played ken

im a man but i was impressed by the fashion of everyone in barbie land and it kept me occupied during the entire film

the characters are out right silly in the most entertaining way and they really didnt let you have a dull moment in the movie

im taking a break before going back to see oppenheimer but im seriously considering rewatching barbie",2023-07-24 23:00:44

in a movie called barbie where the main character is barbie…ken was the mvp of the movie gosling was the mvp,2023-09-05 00:15:38
"i liked the movie i think it was well written

my complaint however is they are too focused on the whole patriarchy concept in the dialog i think the best storiesmovies show not tell i think there was more potential in showing how it affects women in some scenes rather than explicitly stating it repeatedly i think that would have made the message stronger obviously if they mentioned it a couple times that is not a problem but halfway through the plot thats all they talk about

if you dont think so let me know i dont know anything about making movies or writing them so take this with a grain of salt 

overall i think it was a fantastic movie",2023-09-23 15:59:44
"one of the underlying concepts of the storyline in this movie was cool i found that there were a lot of similarities with the matrix where barbie gets essentially unplugged from a perfect world and chooses to live a life in the real world

i wished that the depiction of the real world in this movie was more realistic the polarization of the conceptually perfect world and reality would have been better pronounced which i think wouldve been cool

the scenes where barbie becomes more human were really wholesome and emotional i loved that

it was better than i thought",2023-09-24 04:39:24

"maybe a bit ham  but 

amazing production design 

ryan gosling steals the show with his simping  

it’s not anti male like him and barbie not being together they also show another ken and barbie together so not sure why idiots are getting riled up 

i do think it could’ve been less expository towards the end 

the movie is also selfaware",2023-07-21 20:30:51
greta gerwig is 3 for 3 man what a  talent,2023-07-22 02:37:14
"i’m sure this will get buried but

as a relatively unextraordinary woman who is neither a president nor a mother nor a president who is also a mother i felt seen by gloria’s ordinary barbie idea as well as barbie’s struggle to live up to expectations i loved how barbie didn’t feel the need to compare herself to others until she was exposed to the real world the line about needing to be extraordinary but also not too extraordinary really resonated with me

on the other hand as someone who’s been working on a novel series for years i related with ruth handler as well and absolutely loved the scene with her talking to barbie it’s a little different since they’re characters in a book but i feel like if i were to meet my girls irl somehow i’d say something similar to them

anyway great movie banger songs great jokes great acting all around special mention to helen mirren as the narrator  she was perfect and of course ryan gosling as ken and a really nice conclusion for barbie’s arc",2023-07-22 10:09:12

this movie was awesome but i noticed feet get a suspiciously large amount of discussion and screentime was tarantino involved or something,2023-07-24 00:40:21
"i loved this movie so much and it’s so interesting how people have their differing perspectives on some of the role reversing that happened in barbieland 

a lot of people are teasing the filmmaker about making the kens “unlikable” but people still liked the kens i don’t think greta’s point at all was to make the kens unlikeable the kens are very much naive and don’t desire to have power over the women in barbieland but just to be paid attention to and valued to the extent that the barbies are valued it’s the same feeling that women feel in the real world and the basis of feminism except reversed 

sure the barbies can be mean towards the kens but it never even goes so far to the extent that real women are treated like in the real world they just lack attentionappreciation and in the end barbie apologizes for her behavior and assures ken that he doesn’t need hypermasculinity or the patriarchy to be his own person she assures him that he can find himself the song penned by billie eilish “what was i made for” applies to many characters in barbie but especially both to barbie and ken they’re uncertain of their place in the world and who they are 

even the mattel employees aren’t evil they all come to an equal understanding and allow barbie to live in the real world and keep barbieland the way the folks want it to be 

so i still don’t understand how people interpreted this movie as “manhating” or “propaganda”",2023-07-25 19:16:10
"i ended up seeing this movie twice  i think its fair to say that the messaging is a little confused

heres what i mean  barbieland is at first portrayed as a total matriarchy  barbies rule  kens have no personality outside of their relationship to barbies

the movie then has barbie say that women in barbieland are treated how men are in the real world

but the movie also goes out of its way to show us that the real world while still patriarchal is more complicated  ken cant just go get any job he wants because hes a man  he has to go to barbieland to actually create that level of patriarchy

but i find it weird then when the kens at the end ask for a supreme court justice and are told no you cant  because in the real world 49 justices on the supreme court are women  its not a great example to use if youre trying to suggest a parallel between barbieland and reality  the presidency would have been a more fitting example

i definitely get the point as to why the barbies retain more power in the end  its like the barbies and ken have a nice moment where they all realize they should be equal but then the barbies still retain most of the power which is kind of the result of early feminism in the us

that point makes sense but i just think its still hard to pin down exactly what the film is saying about patriarchy in reality  it seems to simultaneously claim reality is comically patriarchal while also trying to say its a bit more nuanced and i think that leaves its messages muddled

i still really like the rest of the movie i think the production design performances jokes score all work  but im just not sure on its message",2023-07-25 19:38:23
"its not nearly as funny as i expected it would be its a entertaining cute movie very good acting for most actors the production design and costumes are rad and some of the gender commentary is engaging but the movie is too rushed and its overly preachy and too obvious i mean america ferrara and the daughter just show up and were supposed to care about them 

ryan gosling is the mvp but i do think margot robbie is just as good and i dont think they could have found a better choice for barbie she looks like barbie 

i dont get why kate mckinnon and michael cera got so much praise mckinnon is pretty much playing the tired snl persona and ceras awkward allan is a one joke character i liked issa rae kingsley ben adir simu liu and nicola coughlan more",2023-07-26 16:02:07
this was pretty  good it plays like an independent artsy statement film which is kind of wild considering it’s literally produced in part by mattel i loved the messages about the effects of patriarchy on men and women and the idea that men can start defining manhood apart from their relationship and impact on women i don’t see how anyone could hate that we all need to be free from these antiquated norms that limit who we can be one of the speeches about the contradictions of being a woman was taken nearly verbatim from one of my favorite tiktokers i hope they give her credit anyway ryan gosling stole the show i hope he wins something and margot was really amazing in her naunced performance i’d give this a 85 out of 10,2023-07-29 09:59:22
"finally watched it last night… liked it overall but i felt the second half kind of fell off somewhat the first half wasn’t exactly subtle by any means but the social  gender commentary was clever and fun and i enjoyed the performances 

in the second half i felt like they started to try to really beat audiences over their head with the messaging and all the relative subtlety was thrown out the window to be clear i’m not an incel who hates the message i just don’t necessarily love films where the messaging is written explicitly into expository dialogue to the point where it’s being spoon fed to us like we’re idiots the whole monologue that america ferrara had towards the end about women’s obstacles in a patriarchal society just felt sooo heavyhanded… it grounded the film to a total halt and took me out of the narrative i felt like all the goodwill the first half of the movie had generated start to sour somewhat as a result of these secondhalf choices as it just began to feel like wow this film doesn’t trust us enough to understand what they were getting at early in the film and now they’re literally just spelling it out and clobbering us with it 

having said that i still enjoyed it overall margot robbie was perfect in the role and her acting has gotten so strong in the past decade since wolf of wall street i liked her in that film too but i think she’s spoken in interviews of hiring dialect coaches etc and you can really trace her refining her craft with some of her recent projects and i wouldn’t be surprised if she gets an oscar nom here there were some emotional moments where i found myself quite moved such as the scene on the park bench with the older lady and i think it’s a testament to her skills as an actress to be able to make us care about a barbie doll as the character could have been written so differently and been much more of a onetrick “fish out of water” pony having said that i wouldn’t have minded more of the film taking place in the real world and seeing some more of their antics in modern society 

ryan gosling was hilarious and stole the show in a comedic sense but i liked that margot had the dramatic moments to counter the silliness but that scene at the school where he’s talking to the mom for example was cracking me up and when he shows off all his wrist watches later 

i’m sure there will be sequels and spin offs and a mattelverse but i’d probably rather they just leave it alone as a good single shot story everything wrapped up nicely and continuing it and recapturing the zeitgeist magic will probably be tough",2023-12-17 16:02:27

okay film margot robbie is perfectly casted as barbie and she did a fantastic job with what’s given but the plot is a mixed bag movie to me dropped off midway through the ending is very anticlimactic and felt rushed humor was here  there it worked sometimes and other times it fell flat,2023-07-21 22:42:49
when america ferrera first appeared on screen my cousin next to me whispered “si se puede” to me we  lost it when she said it at the end of the film,2023-07-22 05:15:28
my favourite part was ken twirling the air when he bashed against the wave exactly how kids play also barbie’s nail colour was so spot on the details are incredible,2023-07-22 06:26:11
"i really loved it a few aspects felt a little half baked or like they got edited out a lot of the will farrelcubicle guymattel stuff but this is a very good movie that i can see appealing to most anyone it’s a type of movie that feels geared towards both kids and adults like most classics  jurassic park back to the future etc that has often gone away   


its not as funny as some movies and it’s not quite as good of an exploration on feminism  the lives of women as something like gerwig’s little women but that’s kind of what you get when youre balancing both   


now if you don’t mind me i have a sudden and unexplained urge to buy a chevrolet suv",2023-07-22 14:25:48
i have to say it was a bold decision by the filmmakers to include imperial japanese officer barbie during the part where they show the discontinued barbies complete with katana and rising sun headband accessories,2023-07-22 15:31:00
"i can’t help but feel underwhelmed by this movie i found it all over the place

"i know theres a lot of debate over what is and isnt camp and that some would argue that something that is knowingly camp cant be camp

but  that has there ever been a better camp move 

seriously 

im thinking the original hairspray might come close but as much as i love that movie i think gerwig just elevated the genre  

but seriously is there any other camp movie thats this poignant

edit i kinda thought of another one the original the blob can be considered campy and it tried to have some kind of social message still not as good though",2023-07-23 01:35:02

i really liked it perfect stinger of an ending effortlessly  gliding between serious deep and silly margot robbie was amazing i just thought the real world mattel setting should have been a little more real to contrast with barbie world,2023-07-24 02:32:40
thought the movie was great good comedy and a self aware film i wasn’t expecting from something with the barbie name as a male i thought the america ferrera was impactful and well put listening to it in my head there were some moments i believe both genders have experienced but as she kept going there were things that i had never even considered or crossed my mind also seeing it with the gf i thought the mansplaining portion was hilarious because i’ve definitely done the whole godfather and trying to explain the stock market and investments to her overall really enjoyed my time and would see it again,2023-07-24 05:04:24
shower thought this morning kens arc is a beatforbeat recreation of fight club hes even wearing tylers coat at the climax the moral is the same the resolution is the same and kens antagonist is both more and less literally himself brilliant move by greta gerwig,2023-07-25 19:12:14
"no ones gonna read my comment but oh well  

ive learned that gerwig simply does not do subtlety and that worked pretty well for barbies overthetop world and story i really liked this movie the overt feminism and the reversal of making ken sympathetic in the face of a matriarchy equally as unfair as our realworld patriarchy was an interesting spin and im just ken was such a ride i thought it was great how soft the kens masculinity was holding hands and being emotionally supportive of each other so sweet and allan representing the reallife men who support equality and dont subscribe to toxic masculinity was a nice touch

i liked the bittersweet ending with kens being limited to aspiring to the power that realworld women hold ouch but id have liked for the main ken to have had just a bit more of a wrapup like barbie got congrats on the genitals girl  

another minor complaint i had is that gerwig has a way of rushing and hamfisting motherdaughter relationships which was my main issue with ladybird too as authentic as the relationship is meant to feel especially since gerwig has stated that ladybird was inspired by her own experiences it just lacks nuance the cliche rift of angsty teen girl vs her mom somehow even in ladybird it felt too bland and there was even less meat on those bones in barbie i found myself not being drawn into the tension between the mother and daughter in barbie at all it was fine as a b plot i guess and tied into the positive feminine representation meh the dolls ironically felt much more real their struggles and personalities more compelling and their conclusions more satisfying  

mattel being so cartoonish kinda worked but i thought it dampened the contrast between the supposedly harsh real world and barbies plastic dreamland i guess its fine if the intended audience is little kids but i think it wouldve benefited from the real world holding more weight kind of like disneys enchanted but i guess thats really not what they were going for here  

anyway barbie was fun it made me laugh several times and it hit some solid emotional beats im definitely gonna watch it again",2023-07-26 05:46:27
i enjoyed the movie it really brought out my inner little girl and enjoyed the feminine empowerment i also was happy with how they did not cast all really young twentysomethings as the barbies and kens,2023-07-30 15:20:35
i thought it was a cute fun movie pretty on the nose a lot of the time but i think it was supposed to be overthetop in general so i just took it for what it was nearly cried at the ending part with billie’s song the movie did speak a bit to my fears of death and not really knowing what my purpose even is in life lol definitely felt for barbie and ken the main ones it was also super fun to see all of the  education people interacting with one another in a different universe,2023-08-02 05:42:35
"i didnt leave feeling wow
d

good ideas it looked great but it felt like something was missing everyone else seems to love it but i am not seeing what was so great about it it was like a magnificent dessert that wasnt cold enough and was melting",2023-08-07 07:42:08
"i know the film wouldn’t have been made without it but the mattel inclusion held this film back it really lost the story at one point because of it but greta did a phenomenal job at making a film that excelled despite this hinderance and we really saw her range here the scene with barbie sat on the bench in the park was so beautiful along with the ending but we also saw her satirical comedy chops at show  i loved the depressed barbie commercial obviously ryan gosling steals the movie with his perfect comedic timing and his ott performance i think the beachoffdance scene was the stand out 

i really didn’t expect to shed a tear watching this i’ve still got oppenheimer to watch but to the people saving barbie for second are going to get a big surprise if they want to end their night on a happy note what was essentially a children’s film held a final message that they won’t appreciate until long after they’re too old to be playing with barbie",2023-07-21 12:07:20
"that scene where barbie tells the older lady at the bus stop that shes beautiful and she says i know it and barbie just smiles so big at her had me absolutely sobbing wish that badass triumphant vibe kept more consistent through the movie but overall i really enjoyed the watching experience 

hella weird movie cant believe its a summer blockbuster love it",2023-07-21 14:06:16
"this movie came at a vulnerable time for me so it really emotionally affected me when barbie broke down because she didnt feel pretty anymore ive been feeling sorta trapped in my own body and by my own ideas of my appearance and what i should look like so that hit deep i feel like this was a movie i really needed to see right now

besides the sappy  ryan gosling stole the show completely it was such a campy good time and everyone clearly had so much fun making it",2023-07-21 15:13:32
"if i got this correctly the main messages in the movie was satire about patriarchy feminism and self discovery 

kens in barbie world  women in real world right so what was that ken uprising supposed to mean a random feminist uprising that the men the barbies here squash and give them negligible power or is if supposed to be real patriarchy bleeding into barbieworld someone please explain it to me lol

overall i loved it so much it was entertaining and the kens were definitely more memorable than the barbies ken finding out about patriarchy in the real world was the best bit in the movie",2023-07-22 19:12:50
i liked how it showed patriarchy doesnt just mean any man can walk into a hospital or corporation and immediately get a highpaying important job its a real effect but its not that ,2023-07-22 23:48:16
"i may have misinterpreted this but even though this movie could be considered feminist i actually appreciate the resolution being much more realistic

the barbies could have restructured into a society with equal representation but they did not  this retains the true spirit of human nature once in power people will often do everything they can to retain it woman or man  also change is hard",2023-07-23 15:43:49
it was fine but i dont believe this high reviews at all there was funny moments but the movie moves at such a rapid pace and doesnt take a breath the run time needed to be longer i think lego still did it best with mixing the toys with the real world america ferrera and her daughters story line didnt have any weight besides the fact to exist for barbie to be there the major focus is obviously barbie but it would have been nice for the humans to have a more meaningful plot,2023-07-23 17:32:38
"i feel bad saying this because i love greta margot america and basically everyone in this movie and i love what the message behind the movie but i actually didn’t love the barbie movie i really wanted to dressed head to toe in pink watched lots of the marketing material and was generally just really excited i was prepared to laugh out loud and also ball my eyes out however i was disappointed i felt it was a case of style over substance and overall felt a little disjointed i felt things were quite forced i would have loved the theme of mother  daughter relationships to have been explored further and more details on the connection between barbie  america america’s monologue was great but felt again quite surface level 

i don’t know i just left feeling a bit disappointed with it was i alone in this did i completely miss the point",2023-07-24 07:17:20
i dont disagree with the message of the movie but  do i feel like this movie has way less to say than it thinks it does every idea this movie has about patriarchy the male gaze female objectification toxic masculinity etc is presented in the first scene on the beach in la yet the movie still spends the next hour constantly repeating the same thing over and over and over it never adds any new wrinkles or works its ideas into the story in an interesting way it just beats you over the head again and again by the time we got to the mothers monologue i couldnt help but roll my eyes its almost as if the writers got up out of their chair and said no you actually arent smart enough to understand the themes weve been extremely unsubtle about so were literally just gonna tell you what they are you  movie watcher,2023-07-25 07:31:01
"it was mid spoilers

i wanted the storyline to be something a bit more exciting while still keeping the morale of the story for example barbie became depressed or loss a loved one etc the climax was honestly anticlimatic and there was no true turning point in the movie that gave it that wow factor everything was predictablenonreactive on top of that the morale of the story was kind of uncleardistractive like i know it teaches us about equality and the male dominant world however they also sprinkled in bits of barbie destroyed kids images of themselves and barbie thinks about death and barbie doesnt feel like she has a purpose all of which didnt fit the morale of the story and never really got resolvedexplained

the fact that she became a human confused me the most like okay she wants to become the creator not the idea so what am i dense or does that have nothing to do with the previous conflicts ive mentioned what does becoming human have to do with equality or women never feeling like theyre enough or thinking about death

ultimately they touched on too many things at once thus making the morale of the story a little uncleardistractive they introduced too many morales that they couldnt fully addressfinish it was not really happy nor deeply depressive it was a weird middle where they wanted to portray deep messages but were limited due to the pg nature of the movie i dont think it worked out",2023-07-28 02:57:01
"i saw this the other day and… i don’t know i liked a lot of it but it felt like every statement the movie tried to make was undermined by something else and it just made it feel confused and like the production pulled it in too many directions

maybe the most confusing part is what greta gerwig’s actual take on barbie is the movie continuously flips from painting her as a legitimate feminist icon and using will ferrell’s character undoubtedly the worst part of the movie to say that she’s just the corporate idea of feminism designed by men it feels like it tries too hard to appeal to both the people that have genuine affection for barbie and those that say she took feminism in the wrong direction which is an interesting balance but the movie never felt like it drew a final conclusion about it 

i’m also really bothered by the final line in the movie why cast a trans actress to play a barbie in barbieland if you’re going to end the movie with a weird throwaway line about how “real” women visit the gynecologist i highly doubt that gerwig meant anything transphobic by the ending but it really stuck out in a movie where they bring positive attention multiple times to the fact that the barbieland residents have no genitalia 

overall i think the movie tried to do a bit too much and its tone and ambitions don’t really match up in any satisfying way i’d probably give it a 35 overall and i was really hoping to love it given my adoration for greta’s previous work it just feels like too many ideas were thrown in without consideration for how they’d play off of each other not a bad movie by any means but i’d be lying if i said i wasn’t pretty disappointed and confused by it",2023-07-28 14:52:21
america ferreras passionate speech yes is very much feminism however unless you are lowconfident or got a deep underlying issue with women calling for equality no it aint really a malehating speech,2023-07-28 16:39:29
i think people who are big mad are overthinking it i thought the movie was surprisingly hilarious and the soundtrack is solid too immediately bought the vinyl and the i am kenough hoodie,2023-07-29 16:35:16
"first half was solid but second half really fell off  the set design and direction were steller and the performances were honestly perfect for the characters however the writing is where this movie really falls behind for one most of the humor in the movie relied on meta jokes which consisted of some social commentary said in a joking cadence which is supposed to be tongue and cheek but ends up feeling lazy the many  monologues in the movie felt preachy and out of place which is disappointing considering greta gerwigs past scripts much of the dialogue fell prone to issues were characters would start giving mini lectures on the themes of the movie feeling like more like a school play  than a multimillion dollar movie made by oscar nominated writers the themes of feminism expressed in the movie also felt superficial and infantile with many moments sharing conflicting messages that run contrary to classic feminist thought the movie was also around 15 minutes too long with the end dragging for quite a while overall i felt this  movie had a lot of potential with great background elements but underperformed with the story

semag oediv ta skcus nahte",2023-07-31 01:06:42
"gf and i just got home and we loved it her experience with it was very personal and was crying during the billie ellish ending sequence

i loved the meta feminist aspect to the film but one thing i also appreciate is the film did go out of its way to make sure there were no real villians especially the kens all ken wanted was to be seen and respected as an equal like women do in the real world and not be treated as just a boyfriend or afterthought he had emotions he was trying to repress and grew frustrated at his situation then when he saw how men acted in our world he only saw how they were treated with respect and decided this how ill be seen and make everyone respect me and it led to a completely misogynistic ken world where really they just wanted to feel in control imof their lives because ken and the other kens werent ever treated as equals they fought back obviously they were in the wrong but ken admits he knew that he just didnt know what else to do and felt no one wanted to listen to him

eventually ken learns the same lesson barbie does in that we can be beyond our expectations and be whoever we want and to not be afraid of our emotions and barbie helps him cone to this conclusion while also apologizing for treating him poorly 

ken wasnt evil he was misunderstood and just wanted to feel seen just like barbie did but because we live in a society where men are told to be strong and silent repress your feelings and emotions we have the equation for toxic masculinity 

this can be applied to andrew tate followers redpillers trumper etc its a clear demonstration of how toxic masculinity is even created and how these monsters of people take advantage of lost and emotionally confused men 

you could write an entire thesis paper on the themes this film covers",2023-08-02 04:33:59
"i just watched this movie and i dont get the hype in an effort to center the motherdaughter characters barbie became an oldschool disney princess and didnt do much outside of cry and run

barbie didnt even get her own song but ken did 

then the movie ends with her apologizing to ken for what not being interested in him i might be misremembering but she was never directly mean to him except for when he kept pushing for a romantic relationship 

also the idea that ruth handler is a feminist icon is kind of laughable she was a capitalist who saw an adult novelty toy for men bild lilli and said to herself i bet little girls want to play with this when her ghost or whatever talks to barbie my eyes almost rolled out of my head 

this isnt feminism its mattel girlpower and the praise and accolades coming in for this one are really baffling me",2023-09-05 15:06:42
"as a new mother that movie crushed me in a wonderful and bittersweet way it felt like something i could only feel as a mother… 

it was also hilarious beach and so well written when she closes her eyes and it’s the montage of all of the cast and crew’s actual family jesus christ i haven’t cried that hard in a long time",2023-09-16 05:00:03
i get what this movie was doingi get the agenda  but my  this movie was boring as  i love the set pieces the set and costume designs i love that all the barbies are based on real barbiesthat growing up skipper tripped me out when barbie wore the gold jumpsuit at the party it reminded me of the barbie i had in 1981  i loved america ferreras speech about women and the ridiculous standards and expectations placed on us i liked barbie speaking to the creator other than that i expected it to be funnier whittier and  more clever and was gravely disappointed,2023-11-18 22:02:18
"this movie was quite odd all in all i really liked the humor the prologue already had me laughing out loud and the performances the dance numbers were very good

in terms of the movie’s message i think it’s a bit of a mixed bag on the one hand the movie points out the fact that barbie in many ways commercializes unrealistic standards of beauty and accomplishments and it criticizes commercialization of mental health on the other hand the movie is itself obviously an ad pointing out all the different barbie products through the ages and giving random bits of trivia about the company like the fact that barbie was named after the inventor’s daughter that sounded like it could have come straight from a barbie website

on the one hand the central conflict somewhat acknowledges the struggles of incely men and urges ken to find his own path on the other hand it sends really wonky messaging regarding how the men were treated eg no one ever tried to deindoctrinate the men of kendom the only reason why the vote worked was due to tricking the men into not voting

i think this is a bit of a missed opportunity because i liked the way it portrayed womens struggles and it would be possible to write a movie that shows why the patriarchy is bad for both men and women for women it’s obvious for men the problems lie in extremely high pressure to be sexually successful to support a family on their own no tolerance for their emotions and no mercy for those men not adhering to the ideal but instead the movie doesn’t really make a convincing argument why the kens should also oppose patriarchy which i as a man certainly think they should

i guess a fantasy dream land is kind of a weird place to make political commentary on anyway since there is no scarcity of resources no actual consequences from authoritarian leadership such as cut abortion rights no domestic violence or anything like that the idea of restoring the women to their autonomy by deprogramming them was kind of laughable anyway since they didn’t have any autonomy in the first place they were literally caricature dolls that partied all day and never worried about anything profound so the movie didn’t really make me feel like the conflict mattered or made sense

it was a fun watch but i’ll probably forget about it soon",2023-07-21 21:04:23
"absolutely love how the film showed not only how patriarchy is bad for women but also for men ken doesn’t really want to put women down and act the way he does but he just feels he should do it because he sees others doing it and he’s empty on the inside this is a great movie not just for little  girls but also for young boys and even grown men

margot robbie and ryan gosling are great in this my fellow usc alum will ferrell is funny as always and the comedy just clicked a great watch

review",2023-07-22 05:48:23
"so my bias is that i’m an adult woman who loved barbie as a kid had a feminist mother who didn’t want me to love barbie as a kid went through the “not like other girls” internalized misogyny phase as a tween and circled back to embracing my femininity including an interest in barbie and knowing quite a bit about barbie lore as an adult 


this movie was so great 


i saw it in a local theatre that had a costume contest beforehand it was such a happy sight to see almost an entire theatre men and women smiling and wearing pink immaculate vibes 


perhaps given that it dilutes a bit of the laughter relative to a more general audience in a more conventional venue but the comedy genuinely seemed to land throughout and i personally laughed a lot as well as someone who knew about gaffes such as pregnant midge and earring magic ken going in i probably got more out of some of the jokes than the uninitiated but i also don’t think it was so esoteric as to be inaccessible 


i think this movie works because greta gerwig clearly loves barbie and has also grappled with the problems barbie represents the introduction to barbieland was very true to the way my friends and i played with barbie dolls as kids and i felt that same recognition from other women in the audience the tween character’s takedown of barbie was very true to the anger i felt at that age starting to be sexualized because my body was developing while simultaneously being bullied for my acne resenting movie stars and fictional representations of women such as barbie who were perfectlooking and who i perceived not having to struggle with selfimage 


it’s funny to me how the crux of most of the criticism i’ve seen so far centers on america ferrera’s monologue about the loselose situations women are expected to contend with because it so mirrors the discourse some critics are saying it’s too onthenose with its feminism while others are saying it didn’t do enough some are saying the treatment of ken is misandrist some are saying it didn’t go far enough and it needed to provide realworld solutions to empower women more to me ken was quite a likable character and it made sense to me that when he saw how much better he was treated in the real world he would want to hold onto that because that’s kind of how i felt watching barbieland in the beginning i would love to know what it’s like to have a female president and allfemale supreme court i would love to move through the world without being sexualized i felt that barbie did realize her privilege in barbieland and i liked the compromise she made with ken but i can see from some of the reviews that didn’t work for everybody 


lastly people are already predicting that the success of barbie is going to lead to a lot of lesserquality toycentric movies and that probably will prove true in that vein i find myself comparing barbie to the lego movie because i think these are the two that work and they represent the standard any others should be judged by both were made by people who had a lot of passion about them and a strong vision for them the meta elements each one used to represent how children played with each toy were tailored to the subject of their respective movies and i liked that the plots were not interchangeable in this regard of course people of all ages enjoy legos but i think the age of the child in the lego movie was chosen well you get the sense his imagination has not been hindered by adolescence yet but he was mature enough to communicate with his father about wanting a closer bond likewise i noticed barbie really didn’t include any very little girls apart from the 2001 gag and they chose to focus on a tween who had already outgrown barbie dolls and her mother who missed playing with them together in my opinion this was smart not only because it’s a pg13 movie and not really targeted at children but also because the way women are socialized i think a lot of us do go through distinct phases of enthusiastically adhering to stereotypical femininity in childhood rejecting femininity in adolescence and finding balance in adulthood that can only be achieved with the benefit of hindsight and the effort of selfreflection",2023-07-22 11:51:54
"this was a very fun movie and i really enjoyed it however it didnt really leave an emotional impact for me i felt like they were attempting to do way too much in terms of social commentary that it got in the way of the storyline there were plot points that i feel like were either underdeveloped or just dropped entirely 

for example the relationship between mother daughter felt underdeveloped why is there conflict between them what was the mother going through that it lead to her drawing barbie with thoughts of death i dont really understand their motivations as characters because we barely spend time with them we get a little flashback through barbie and thats it so when the climax came and she was making a big speech it didnt feel earned because i barely knew anything about her i dont even remember her name it also did not make any sense that her speech was what cured the brainwashing because the barbies wouldnt really relate to what shes saying because they havent experienced the real world at the beginning barbie did not even understand the concept of catcalling

the mattel storyline led nowhere as well there was literally no reason for them to go to barbieland it felt like they wanted to do social commentary on capitalism but also werent able to fully commit to making mattel the villain so why include it in the first place what was this super bad thing that was going to happen if barbie stayed in the real word which led to the chase scene they also mentioned it happening before with skipper that led to bad consequences but never mentioned it again however in the end it was suddenly totally fine for barbie to be in the real world maybe because she was a human now but it was still kind of confusing 

i also felt like her decision to be human at the end wasnt setup properly when she was in barbieland she never showed discontentment about her life in fact when weird barbie was making her choose matrix style shed rather not know this wouldve been fine if she experienced something that warrants her changing her perspective but there was literally nothing good that happened to her in the real world there was no motivation for her to be human although the idea was that barbie and by extension the viewers can be whatever they want is good i think it couldve been better if there was motivation behind her decision

i also felt bad for the kens as they were essentially at the same place they started

i know that not every movie should be analyzed scene by scene and you should just enjoy the movie for what it is these are just some of my thoughts i still enjoyed the movie overall",2023-07-22 20:53:13
going against the grain here i actually loved barbie i feel like it appealed to women and girls of all ages which i loved as far as people complaining about how “basic” some of the feminist themes were it’s a movie about a toy it doesn’t exactly have a target audience of feminist scholars i think it was witty original and really captured the overall essence of womanhood pretty well margot robbie was perfect as barbie and kate mckinnon was great as “weird barbie” too,2023-07-23 23:50:41
i am a 34 year old dude and i loved the movie its razor sharp and takes no prisioners amazing movie by gerwig,2023-07-24 02:04:25
"i would just like to say that i think people calling the film antiman are completely wrong and genuinely fail to understand the basic content of this movie 

kens are not human men the only human men portrayed in this movie other than the dad who is adorable but not part of the plot are a satire of the reality of the inequality misogyny and discrimination in the corporations that profit off women 

heres a question for anyone who thinks the film is promoting misandry do you even believe that women face discrimination in the real world that we have it harder than men 

do you know or believe anything about the reality of being a woman under patriarchy 

are you even able to imagine not being treated like a man",2023-07-26 21:15:37
"i’m getting annoyed at everyone asking why the barbie movie has “so much hype”

since the beginning of big boxoffice mega movies the vast majority of these movies have been targeted towards men especially those based off of ip i’m thinking star wars indiana jones jurassic park lotr transformers etc now comes a huge movie that is about women focuses specifically on female nostalgia is directed by a female is aesthetically eye catching and unabashedly feminine besides looking fun funny and well done which other people have noted in comments the appeal and “hype” apparently seems to shock and baffle many people on and off this platform women make up more than half of the population i think we’re seeing the result of a mega movie made specifically for women and by women who have been vastly underserved in the big budget movie industry",2023-07-27 05:15:35
"just saw it today and it was okay honestly more of a wasted opportunity than anything else i just felt like the movie like stereotypical barbie herself didnt really know what it wanted to say the feminist message wasnt anything new though i did enjoy america ferrieras monologue i liked ryan gosling as ken so much more than i thought i was going to simu liu was also pretty delightful at the same time i felt like the movie was missing a very big chunk surrounding what exactly happened when ken came back to barbieland and the ken narrative in general honestly weve all seen feminist critiques or reclamations of barbie the doll and the concept it was revolutionary to me when i was a teen girl in the 00s not so much anymore in the age of 4thwave feminism

what the movie had a great chance to do and didnt is to show that the core of feminism is about equality and equity for both men and women and that trying to have a society where any one group of people hold all the power is morally wrong no matter who is in that group the movie made the mistake that most people that try to portray a matriarchy did in that it just swapped the labels but kept the contents the same and in doing so tiptoed right over the point ryan goslings ken was compelling to me because he was such a good opportunity to show how men can become alienated and isolated from a society that assigns them to gender roles that are just as restrictive as those for women will ferrels character would have been such a perfect way to showcase how powerful men enforce negative patriarchal ideals on other men around them while paying lip service to feminism and how easily a disillusioned and isolated man can miss the nuance and just blame women for his feelings of inadequacy it would also have been nice to see how ken was able to influence the other men and how some of the barbies might have fallen for it because that absolutely happens in real life 

the pieces were all there but the point still ended up somehow just being that its okay to not know what you want and to not want to date a guy because everyone around you thinks its what youre supposed to want which once again is something that would have been a revolutionary concept in the 00s and is now a pretty banal and basic conclusion i feel like there was absolutely a good movie in there but all the actual salient points got left on the cutting room floor in favor of making a toothless cash grab for a corporation that knows you want to hear it critique consumerism but also doesnt want you to actually come away with the thought that you shouldnt buy their dolls

also just as an aside i actually hated the narration i liked the selfaware songs a lot but the narration was just not good and actually kinda  me off the scene when barbie is crying because shes just been exposed to selfconsciousness for the first time and the narrator just chimes in to mock the actress for being too pretty to have selfimage issues was just gross to me is that really the point you want to make with your feminist movie that only  women are allowed to experience self doubt and beautiful women need to just shut the  and be glad theyre pretty really",2023-08-09 03:02:47
"i saw it today after seeings snippets and social hype since the release it was just okay i thought i was gonna be wowed by the way people talked about it the first half was great but i felt the message was a little too chaotic and trying really hard to be deep 

i actually listened and watched billi elishes music video and song prior to the movie her work was actually way better than the movie i have to say her 3 min video was so powerful and made me cry i got it almost instantly barbie on the other hand was really into using the stereotypical feminist jargon and said patriarchy way too much i’m a feminist but i just didn’t really think half the movie was needed to drive home the point

to me the ken scenes were boring i didn’t care for the music it was like suddenly a musical the mattel ceo scenes were funny the first time but their repeated interactions weren’t needed 

what i felt was missing was the connection to the mother daughter duo understanding their issues and their struggles greenblatt is a beautiful young actress but her cast as the teen daughter was not my favorite choice i wish they had chosen a teen girl that is a bit more…average looking to drive home some of the themes on vanity and coming of age she looks like a hollywood actress…not an avg 14 year old it pulled me from the story tbh especially when she made the speech to barbie about insecurity 

i was anticipating the ending having seen the trailer and the social media clips however it wasn’t as fleshed out as i thought it seems they pulled a storyline directly from lois lowrys “the giver” added feminism and called it a day yet there was a depth of the story that was insinuated but missing from barbie the take my hands bit wasn’t as powerful as i thought and i’m a sucker for sappy scenes i didn’t cry like everyone predicted i would i honestly still don’t understand what all these women are referring to when they say the movie healed them 

i think it was fun and the costume and set designer should win the awards here margot robbie was also a fabulous barbie but the story fell flat had been just a fun barbie story without the depth i think it would been okay too but i felt they were trying  to make a point for too many topics that it was a bit chaotic 

not terrible but i still think billie ellishs take on barbie was way better just my opinion though i’d probably watch again",2023-08-09 12:20:16
"the movie felt like it was trying to be everything at once a social commentary a feel good film a parody of itself it just didn’t work and so many scenes felt out of place

like the daughter suddenly went from hating barbie to yeah i’ll go on an adventure with you in the space of two scenes and at the end we’re supposed to believe the mom and the daughter are best friends again we saw one scene where she dismissed her mom by getting out of the car that was it 

i saw a spoiler about alan attacking people didn’t know the context but from then on assumed he was some sort of twist villain instead he wants to leave and then suddenly is fine with it all ok 

will ferrel’s character was well played but added nothing to the plot you could remove all the ceosfbi subplot and the movie stays exactly the same

i really don’t get what the message was meant to be",2023-08-12 10:54:49
"i wrote this as a comment to someone regarding the contradiction in the message of this movie and was told to post it separately doing so with some edits so it makes sense


in the real world what ken experiences is being respected for simply being who he is which is what the barbies experience in barbieland all the time barbies in barbieland are respected and better simply because they are barbies ie men in the real world however ken getting treated better automatically for being a man is wrong but it is somehow not wrong that barbies are automatically treated better in barbieland for being a barbie thats one contradiction among many this movie creates the movie starts with the kens in barbieland being an allegory for women in the real world they are struggling to find a place respect and autonomy in a world run by the other gender yes ken is given respect in the real world for who he is as a man just as barbies even stereotypical barbie who has no skills is automatically given respect in barbie world ken is just now experiencing what barbies have experienced their whole lives respect and validation he feels better for how he is treated in the real world thats because the barbies have made him feel less than his whole life but barbie good ken bad barbies quest is presented as one of a fight for equality and self exploration but the kens fight for equality makes them the antagonists all of this would make sense if in the end vote barbie who has experienced inequality said hey wait things shouldnt go back to exactly how they were because our world is one sided  just the reverse side of the same coin and the kens deserve a place and respect then the barbies and kens collectively moved towards eauality however in the end of the movie the kens are put back in their place with just slightly more allowences than they had before how is that possibly a justified ending how does that not contradict the message of the unfairness and inequality the movies conclusion is more focused on revenge rather than understanding and equality the barbies dont want equality they want their own land to remain their own and the men to just occupy it but thats for some reason fine and applauded but somehow the same thing in the real world with reversed genders is wrong remember the guy ken runs into who says we still run things but just hide it better now and we as an audience are supposed to be disgusted but thats literally what the barbies do at the end tell the kens to just be ken but then hold all the power they give a cabinet position to weird barbie as a sorry we bullied you but the kens are denied their request for one ken on the supreme court the barbies needed to be above that but they simply practice the same power hungry shallow vindictive nature we are meant to hate in the real world if the point is that women are still treated unfairly in our world so kens will be treated unfairly in barbieland and things just practically go back to how they were what is the point of this movie what is the message barbies can unfair too to show inequality sucks this is not the first movie to do that the audience for this movie already agrees that inequality is bad yet somehow they left the movie being okay with inequality in barbieland towards kens it would be fine if the movie was clever and highlighting its audiences own hypocrisy and vengeful nature but its not people are leaving the movie thinking the barbies are good and that everything was wrapped up nicely and all is good in barbieland which is astounding",2023-07-22 18:44:01

but… somehow a lot of it felt cringe to me too on the nose speeches i was mostly expecting fun camp from the marketing and we got a lot of hallmarkesque emotional elements that felt like a buzzkill it’s probably good that some people seeing it are asking questions about patriarchy if they weren’t aware already but it wasn’t for me or the other women i saw it with i’m bummed thirsty for the type of movie i thought it would be",2023-07-24 03:05:54

while i enjoyed the film i feel that overall the writing was a letdown for me the third act was the weakest one and unfortunately it’s the one that’s most important to the message it felt incredibly heavy handed at times especially with the américa ferrera scene with it being so heavy handed and on the nose about the patriarchy i can’t help but think about the actual reality they put a spotlight on but don’t seem to really have an answer for at the end of the day the ceo of mattel and wb are still men and they’re the ones profiting off this and will continue to sell their products and continue adding to the issue,2023-07-21 03:11:33
i enjoyed it i thought from the trailer it was going to head in a different direction more barbie and ken head out for a mission in the real world i’m not sure i totally vibed with the storyline they chose but i still enjoyed it enough,2023-07-21 10:21:50

"im curious what everyone thinks of the ending where barbie realizes shes no longer perfect and that shes also not the smart barbie or the leadership oriented barbie she realizes she is not extraordinary in any way did you feel like they got a resolution or a message across or was the message that to be a woman is impossible because you cant do anything right and you cant possibly wear all these different hats being a mom and president or being a bikini model and supreme court justice they just kind of threw in america ferreras suggestion that i think rang true for most women what about being average what about a barbie whos not extraordinary in any way no matter who you are or what you do  majority of life is carrying out mundane rituals of bodily maintenance showering eating going to the doctor hence why those are the first things to go when barbie land crumbles and also the last jab of a joke 

i think america ferreras speal about it being impossible to be a woman hit the nail on the head but i think the montage of home videos sort of made me lose the message children are pure potential barbie is pure potential 

in the emotional scene with ruth where barbie asks to be human and ruth explains she never needed permission she has full autonomy to be who she wants to be and barbie grapples with how confusing it is to know what you want its hard to have autonomy and make your own decision hence why the barbies so easily go from being a neurosurgeon to serving the kens food and loving being an accessory to the kens because making your own decisions having your own money career ambitions property is hard and quite frankly us humans are perhaps not meant to do it alone it wouldve been interesting to see them explore relationship dynamics and attachment within the patriarchy and feminist world that was clashing like this narrative that women need to be girl bosses and prove they can do it all  like live alone or support a family when in reality i dont think humans were meant to be alone we were meant to pair bond maybe thats why they emphasized the mother and daughter dynamic so much made me think of how much i hated my mom when i was a tween and now i think the world of her and remind her all the time how obsessed i am with her i think these were all universal human experiences especially for women there is no real thoughts here just spitballing stream of consciousness but would love to hear others thoughts 

through writing this i was able to flesh out some ideas that are still forming i honestly like the movie even more now after analyzing it further and cant wait to go see it again",2023-07-21 23:25:21
greta gerwig’s world built like a  in the beginning and did a great job there i don’t disagree with her message about the patriarchy i was surprised that this was less of a comedy and more of a dramedy so my expectations maybe weren’t set at an accurate point in all i don’t feel like the story was coherent after the conflict point after the kens all fight the last act felt rushed to get to an ending it was a higher thinking movie than i originally anticipated but we asked for originality from hollywood and gerwig delivered an original barbie story so kudos to that it definitely broke up the mcu’s storytelling formula and barbie is probably that palate cleanser accesible to everyone,2023-07-22 06:24:51
gosling stealing the show feels almost antithetical to the premise but the clincher for me is the ending why would barbie decide to live in the real world after seeing the reality of the patriarchy wanting to create rather than be the product kinda subverts the plot all she ever wanted was for things to be the same suddenly she doesn’t know where she fits otherwise real fun with unexpected emotional depths reminded me of elf and cat in the hat,2023-07-23 05:36:47
movie was great love the jokes loved the references and a lot of the different messages from the movie its a very self aware movie and it highlights issues that so many different people can relate to they even highlighted some of mens issues which is rare for anyone to do these days and without there being accusations of misogyny definitely surpassed my expectations and didnt think that it would have as much dept and be so heartwarming,2023-07-23 23:16:09
i’ve thought about this movie all day and want to go see it again asap lol,2023-07-24 01:52:52
just how funny gosling is is obscuring i think a rather fascinating and thorny commentary gerwig is making on incels with him he’s created by a complete neglect from the women around him and that neglect is treated by the film’s resolution as a bad thing no ken is not entitled to a romantic relationship with anyone…but he is entitled to attention everyone deserves that,2023-07-24 12:17:40
corporations and artists in complete synergy so funny so unbelievably original filled to the brim with heart drew tears from my eyes like water from a well sumptuous photography and great casting but ryan gosling is just on another level lord he is so  funny in this margo essentially becomes his straight man and plays off him beautifully margos best in her heightened emotional scenes terrific cryer will ferrel also shines at times maybe too frequently the movie veers into the didactic eyerolling category with the messaging but honestly what did you expect,2023-07-28 01:52:17
the one positive that i will say about this movie is that ryan and margot have really  great onscreen chemistry,2023-08-02 03:41:32

"can i take a moment to give special props to my guy kingsley benadir who had three moments that absolutely killed the first being the silly dance he did while hypemanning ken the second his scream of pain at the explosion of ken stars and lastly his booming declaration that the kens only fought because they didnt understand themselves 

especially excited to see it because he was such a highlight of one night in miami and has been shafted on disney plus secret invasion all summer go off king

"the movie was fantastic

i’d love to hear from menboys who didn’t have sisters or daughters who played with barbies it was so nostalgic for me but i didn’t have brothers,2023-07-25 04:32:28
i never had barbies but i absolutely loved the joy of this movie,2023-07-30 18:24:32
am i missing something here or isnt barbieland just a representation of how humans are playing with them in the real world isnt that why theres no water in the shower she floats down to her car or why ken flies when hitting a plastic wave,2023-08-02 20:43:19
i laughed so much but have one gripe…i wasn’t convinced of barbie’s decision to leave fixed barbieland and back go to live in literal  as a human you end up choosing everything you were trying to escape so what made choosing my world worth it for you over your utopia like tell me that answer please so i can feel better about being stuck here,2023-08-06 22:23:25
did anyone think the movie would end with barbies and kens splitting the power in barbie land,2023-08-07 16:27:51

"just saw it it was about what i expected and i enjoyed it barbieland was quite the set piece and the integration of various barbie products felt seamless and natural i especially liked the films score especially while they were in barbieland and how the music sort of responded to whatever was happening even in the lyrics the costume design felt very onbrand i adored the characters overthetop personalities and acting especially on the kens the lead ken was a pleasure to watch stereotypical barbie was likewise the right amount of melodrama and radiance for the character though appropriately geared more towards drama than some of the wackier elements of the film 

my only sticking point was mattels depiction and its board of directors i suppose no director or writer could get away with making them look explicitly bad per se can you get away with making a movie about an existing ip while simultaneously villainizing their parent company im skeptical so the ceo ultimately had to at least present himself as redeemable and will ferrell was very par for the course in this role",2023-09-24 03:32:49

"watched it last night because me and some friends had time to  

i actually kinda liked it i was nervous it would be a little too silly and sometimes it was but the whole thing worked in the end robbie and gosling do the heavy lifting here if i’m being honest with some strong stuff from ferrera as well some genuinely funny stuff the whole push thing was easily the best some stuff reallly didn’t land with me though zsjl isn’t something people talk about in real life mostly everything with will ferrell the ruth handler tax evader stuff but i liked it nonetheless",2023-08-25 17:26:47
the set designs were really impressive and i found it funny i just could use less in your face preaching about the patriarchy from privileged white women like greta gerwig she’s an ivy league grad for ffs at least make the lecturing more subtle ,2024-02-28 03:53:36
"i had an amazing time for the first 20 minutes or so when they went into the real world i only enjoyed scenes with goslings ken and the movie took longer to wrap up than i would have liked but thats a very common issue for me

"choose your fighter 


on further reflection id say the movie really reminded me of uss callister that one really excellently written and good episode of black mirror that was also fundamentally carrying a pretty nasty message about how you shouldnt feel like you have to be nice to socially awkward weird nerds

this gave me the same kinds of vibes as that but it was done even more skillfully such that even though theres a lot of humiliating men for the sake of it and i feel like i should be annoyed about that i still kind of laughed along with it so kudos to greta gerwig

part of it is that there was just enough nuance and kindness even if it was a very very partial and grudgingly given like can getting a chance to make something of himself even if hes still clearly an idiot and doesnt actually achieve anything by the end of the movie

so i did indeed see barbie and oppenheimer together and im just saying that
theres a scene in oppenheimer where hes pouring his heart out about his guilt to emily blunt and shes pretending to be sympathetic and then loses patience with him that would literally fit in that scene in barbie movie where the kens are pouring out their hearts to the barbies physicist ken also he literally had jean tetlock be his long distance low commitment casual girlfriend he loves going on random self important tangents and quoting things people call him a dilletante womanizer and insecure neurotic theres even an early scene in the movie where hes pursuing jean before he became a bigshot physicist and she rejects him and he sulks off just saying the dude would have fit right in kendom",2023-07-23 13:07:16
"i really enjoyed the movie and found it absolutely hilarious  it was gratifying to see a world where roles were reversed an escapist fantasy and have that world be contrasted with the real world that is accurately depicted as one that can be uncomfortable and terrifying for women i must add that i went into the movie without expecting a barbie movie to teach me about feminism if anything it tackles the subject matter with breadth matriarchy patriarchy toxic masculinity empowerment but not as much depth and you know what thats perfectly fine the film was a visual treat the actors really leaned into their campy roles margot was the barbie we never knew we needed america was so earnest and ryan was hilarious and it was good fun overall

if i were to be critical i would pick on the characterisation and development of gloria though america did a fantastic job  our introduction to gloria is through these irrepressible thoughts of death that infect barbie yet we never get a proper exploration of glorias mental state nor do we see how being in barbieland helped gloria psychologically since the movie ends with barbies ending not glorias had this been done the monologue would have been even more impactful after all gloria is the heart of the film as the key human character im also not 100 sure why glorias drawing of irrepressible thoughts of death barbie a new creation per se impacted stereotypical barbie in the first place is it because gloria as a mattel employee was basing a new creation off an old model and causing changes to sb in addition are we meant to assume that margots sb only has a link to a single human being ie gloria given mass production wouldnt it mean that stereotypical barbie is being played with by thousands of kids or is it that every version of sb has 1 human connection and were just looking at margots version of sb of course these werent pressing questions but they did occur to me upon reflection

that being said i still absolutely loved it and would watch the film again in the cinemas if asked i can imagine barbie joining the ranks of princess diaries mean girls and the devil wears prada as pop culture favourites for time to come",2023-07-24 17:32:29
"some folks think that whiplash 2014 is black swan 2010 for dudes

"i loved this movie it was so much fun ryan gosling is fantastic i knew he was funny because in all his interviews he is always a blast but this was on another level i think this movie was kens movie up until the last 5 minutes

the first part is an absolute blast so funny the middle is the weak part then in the end it is good again

i really have not seen all these woke and anti men messages all the time they spoke about patriarchy it was to make a joke and i dont need barbie to know that this is a mens world sure there is an underlying message but for me it was about accepting ourselves even if we are not perfect some people just want to be mad at everything",2023-07-25 21:03:50
"movie combo  bartrix barbie x matrix 

many people got into the hype of oppenheimer and barbie but i have another combo to offer 
i highly recommend watching barbie and then rewatching the 1999 matrix 
to celebrate warners 100 years anniversary they had special showing of famous and critically claimed movie and the week i went to watched barbie matrix was showing i regret nothing  watching matrix in theatre right after barbie was amazing both of those movies comment on our reality 

one does it with an absurd chaotic and colourful atmosphere while the other is an absurd chaotic and dark action movie 

aside from the iconic pills moment both share many other aspects like using the same scheme of parallel world even though inside the matrix the world is not perfect like barbieland the world outside the matrix is so much worse 

some argue that the weird barbie is like morpheus indeed both of them were touched by the real world and both revealed to the protagonist that their idea of their world is far from the truth 

also lets go back to the pills choice for a moment in matrix neo does not seem to hesitate to take the red pill whereas barbie doesnt want to know the harsh reality she wants to go back to her bliss ignorance and that right there is so interesting and reveals a hard fact about humans although many of us like to believe that we would gladly take the truth in reality many would rather stay in their ignorance and deny the hard reality especially if said truth will negatively impact their comfort and im seeing it with the hate from men towards feminism 

not convinced yet mattel executives are like the smiths they even run a but like them they do it in a more absurd and comical way but they kinda do the way their arms swings while their body stay still ",2023-07-27 09:57:54
"i thought the movie did the big things really well the juxtaposition between barbieland and the real world was on point and really got the message of the movie across “hey what if women ruled everything and men were seen as just objects  well flip the roles and you have the real world” 

i think towards the end the movie they started to spoon feed this to the audience a little too much i’m just not a fan of monologues and i don’t know why the barbie creator was in there she didn’t say anything that the movie wasn’t already saying

robbie and gosling were great i can’t imagine anybody else who are more “barbie and ken” the funny moments in movie pretty much all landed especially the scenes with the kens 

overall a really entertaining movie",2023-07-28 11:16:14
"this was one of the more spectacle heavy movies i’ve seen from hollywood in a long time and i enjoyed it for that the sets were great and the choreography was fun

however it seemed like there were some issues behind the scenes when it came to what story this production wanted to tell i strongly suspect there were a lot of ideas and perspectives about the themes of feminism female agency adolescence matriarchy vs patriarchy etc that were suggested by writersproducersdirectors — some of which weren’t compatible with one another or even contradicted each other — but were nonetheless all incorporated into the film in some way the message was a mess and the overall story and character continuity suffered for it",2023-08-07 05:41:12

"im not really understanding the high praise im seeing so far 

this movie felt like it was all over the place in terms of the tone and the story it wanted to tell and many of the jokes were flat in delivery it went on some weird existential romp that felt unearned and there werent really any emotional payoffs the subplots with will ferrell and america ferrera felt very shoehorned in with no real point the daughter was annoying the entire film and honestly gosling seemed to be the only consistent bright spot as robbie put in a pretty bland performance overall and that monologue it felt like a bad snl sketch that kept going on and on before commercial break super weird and didnt feel genuine or earned at all 

this is nowhere near either lady bird or little women in terms of quality for me and im rather disappointed after looking forward to this for a while now terrible screenplay and a sloppy mess for most of its runtime i cant really see myself ever recommending this to anyone",2023-07-21 08:09:54
"it really makes me sad to say but i genuinely disliked this movie 


yes it does have positives margot and ryan were well cast sets are good some jokes were funny etc


however here are some issues i had

 the movie pretends to be smarter than it is while actively contradicting itself margots barbie has an existential crisis because she feels she is not beautiful or smart she feels average because she isnt an astronaut doctor etc but she learns its ok if shes not because shes herself stereotypical barbie is just a normal barbie then what idea does farerra pitch at the very end that is so great that farrell hates until he learns itll be profitable average barbie the thing that exists and we spent a whole movie on stereotypical barbie shes not an astronaut or a president shes just barbie she is a blank canvas for kids imaginations basically what farrera had a doll that reflected her turmoil farrera didnt need depression barbie or any specifically targeted one she just projects onto the barbie she has which is what kids do so why is it presented as some genius idea that she just came up with it already exists i think they have a line about having the barbie look average after having a whole speech about women being criticized for their appearances with diverse barbies everywhere are they suggesting there is one standard of avergae is a barbie that looks like margot not average how can you ask for an average barbie while also trying to argue there should be no standard

 the movie starts with margot questioning death this is not resolved ruth a ghost which actively contradicts this fear shows barbie what the world is like but despite ruth saying she wants barbie to see reality every single image she is presented is a positive at no point does barbie confront her mortality yet she chooses to be human she also has no reason to live in the real world she constantly mentions how uncomfortable she felt there she enjoys the emotions that come with being human but she has those now whether she lives in barbieland or not why would she actively choose a world that makes her feel ill at ease rather than stay in barbieland where others are changing and she has friends ken now has emotions and the barbies are becoming more aware so why leave

 barbie sees a woman on a bench who is old and immediately calls her beautiful this is before she even starts on her journey of selfdiscovery she has a breakdown later of not being beautiful despite seeing that beauty is not what she perceived it to be this is completely done out of order why does a barbie who screams at seeing cellulite just minutes before see an old woman and just call her beautiful why was this not a scene later in the movie when she comes back into the real world and has a new perspective on beauty standards it makes no sense within that point in the story

 ken goes into the real world and learns about patriarchy but sees that the real world doesnt actually work like that kens have no jobs or positions of power in barbieland but women have jobs in the real world he runs into a doctor but he arbitrarily asks to see the real doctor ie a man because he just learned of patriarchy despite having lived a life where women are doctors he goes around and asks to do surgery but learns that he cant do that just because hes a man he needs credentials so how is he still believing in patriarchy and trying to push it in barbieland when most of what he has experienced condradicts it 

 ken is so inconsistent he wants barbies approval but ditches her in the real world for patriarchy

 the morality is off and the message isnt about creating a more unified equal world when the movie started i thought it was going to have some great parallels especially when ken calls out the inequality kens face in barbieland they dont have homes dont have any power and dont get respect he is filled with joy just by the someone asking him the time that is a result of how barbies have made kens feel then barbie goes to the real world and sees how life can be unfair when they get back ken kicks her out of the house and says something along of the lines of doesnt feel good does it lesson learned right nope barbie apologizes to ken but it still ends with them not wanting to give the kens anything other than the bare minimum the kens ask for one position on the supreme court so they feel represented and are turned down and offered a lower position and told that they might get it some day why why is the message to be vindictive and exclusionary rather than empathetic and collaborative so no lesson was learned from anything this doesnt even reflect the real world where we have both men and women on the supreme court if the argument is that well women werent allowed to for a long time does that somehow justifies these barbies actions the message is power and revenge versus working together towards a better future its also revenge in a world where the kens until this recent uprising as a result of how they were treated had done nothing to deserve being treated this way the barbies except margot are acting on knowledge of a real world they have never experienced they only know a world where they hold 100 of the power and kens are accessories once again ken calls this out when he says to barbie that it doesnt feel good being treated like a ken does it the kens are told to be themselves at the end but are not actually given anything in the world weird barbie is offered a cabinet position with the president as a whoops sorry we bullied you but not a single ken is offered a position of power once again it seems morally wrong to have that be the conclusion of the movie shouldnt we be moving past these us versus them ideas 

 the speech farrera makes is so ham  the barbies in that world have no frame of reference for what shes talking about they live in a world they control and where everything is perfect why is their brainwashing never explained by the way broken by her speech they have never experienced those things also farerra makes comments about how women are constantly judged for their interests looks and actions yet shortly after the movie mocks the kens for having passions such as wanting to talk about the godfather or music her speech mentions womens weights and not having one standard yet later she proposes an average barbie the movie makers did not know what their message was and it shows

 there is no consistentcy in how the movie is visually told the barbies are inconsistent in when they act like dolls and when they act like people they walk on tip toe but they wave like people margot stops acting like a doll except when she falls over in that one scene the cars flip and we get a 2d dust cloud but we dont get that same artistic style when ken gets pushed back by the wave or any other moment of impact every scene seems individualized with no overarching stylistic connections or vision compare this something like the matrix where agent smith and the other agents always have stiff and robotic movements you notice it in the way they run turn their heads nod etc this movies picks and chooses based on what they need from the scene versus building a world that is consistent

 farrera is a good artist but it doesnt matter the daughter doesnt like her mom because teenage angst they both just make up with no actual conversation other than the daughter saying her mom isnt a terrible artist farreras husband speaks spanish to margot for some reason yeah he was practicing it but why would he say it to margot why cant he just be a normal guy

 i remember this being an issue when the movie us came out but i find it to be the same issue in this the onetoone between the two worlds is not explained and makes no sense there appear to be no repeat barbies in barbieland so is margots barbie specifically linked to farrera or every child that owns a stereotypical barbie because if its the latter are we to believe that only one barbie in the history of barbies kate mckinnon has been played with so hard that she became weird they mention others breaking in passing but never mention what happens to them also margots barbie breaks because farrera is sad her daughter doesnt like her and shes having an existential crisis so kids playing with barbies as they experience grief loss anxities etc just have had no effect especially when one barbie there reflects thousands of kids except once 

 presenting consumerism as funny they wanted barbies realization to come from ruth handler so bad that they wrote off handler committing tax fraud as a joke if this was walt disney people would be lambasting it for the sheer corporate whitewashing that wouldnt be unwarranted so why does handler get a pass barbie even takes her last name as her own at the end it makes sense to honor the creator but also doesnt seem right to present a corporate felon as barbies guiding angel also the wb discovery building is predominately displayed behind the mattel building then farrera is driving a brand new chevy and also every car chasing her is a chevy that scene was practically a car commercial and there are numerous people in this thread alone wanting a i am kenough sweater this movie is not breaking down consumerism but perpetuating it this is not a well what did you expect from a movie about barbie thing that would be fine if they didnt have whole scenes in the movie to paint it as some critical breakdown of consumercorporate culture ie the scene where barbie first meets farreras daughter every negative comment about that is met with well mattel probably made them do that but any positive is met with greta is a genius 


it makes me sab because i wanted to like it",2023-07-22 10:51:18
"honestly surprised mattel allowed a movie like this to be made i would never have expected a barbie movie like this to have been made this went past my expectations in every way i just loved it it was much funnier than i expected and also serious enough when it needed to be the serious moments hit well i kinda teared up at one point and it didnt feel too cheesy or anything i loved that they brought in the actual creator of barbie as a character i knew it was supposed to be her the first time they showed her but i didnt expect them to acknowledge it and give her character a more extended role at the end i figured it would just kinda be a cameo 

margot robbie and ryan gosling were born to play barbie and ken i feel both of them were perfect casting despite that one fourth wall break about margot robbie being cast in her role the entire cast was great but those two were just phenomenal america ferrera also felt genuine enough in her delivery to make her monologue work

my entire theatre was full and the vibe seemed like everyone was loving the movie too hope this is finally the summer blockbuster this years been missing but also idk how word of mouth will be i feel like this movie might be very different from what a general person might expect from a movie named barbie also it is very overt about its themes which might put some audiences off",2023-07-21 02:16:38
"unironically a masterpiece the message of the movie leitmotiv is immaculate and on point its such a refreshing and positive message in an age where the us vs them mentality is running rampant all over the world and everyone and their mothers can feel pressured to be or act a certain way to get those likes reactions or positive comments

mattel made a lot of bold moves on this one from being the villains themselves to the way they presented barbie and her existencial crisis to the way they developed ken to even the actual ending where they dont end up together and barbz ends up becoming human there were a lot of ballsy decisions taken and i applaud every single one of them it was so refreshing to see a company be this self aware playful and being able to poke fun at itself ive been in advertising meetings and i can tell ya this is not an easy pitch  kudos to whoever made the decisions or convinced others to accept this tone

margot robbie is iconic i really think this could get an oscar shout and ryan gosling was no slouch either it felt like every performance every scene played out exactly as it should the director should also be commended  it everyone should the dance numbers the different sets and settings the colors the costumes the different types of humor they used the performances the soundtrack and even the deeper message of it all hit just the right spot

its not often i finish watching a movie and think 1010 not a single point taken but this was it  i did not expect a barbie movie to hit the way this did iconic fun and with an incredible message thats extremely relevant to current times

you knocked it out of the park barbie masterpiece ",2023-07-31 15:19:22
i expected to like this movie in an ironic way like that i’d come out and say “better than oppenheimer federico fellini walked so greta gerwig could run”… that was unironically better than oppenheimer federico fellini walked so greta gerwig could run i’m a big fan of the josie and the pussycats movie i feel like it’s an underrated gem this is everything that works there cranked up to 11 several corporate types had to sign off on this being made and that astounds me ryan gosling for best actor and i’m not even kidding,2023-07-21 02:09:51
i didn’t like it lol i feel like i’m the only one… some scenes were pretty funny and i liked the toy details the set objects in barbieland etc but otherwise… i thought it was boring the characters fell flat the teen girl was annoying did nothing for my soul it felt very girls vs boys when it could’ve empowered everyone the kens were a missed opportunity in the us boys are falling behind in terms of higher education i like the concept of barbie turning human but wish she had more flaws i wish she struggled more in the real world… like it should show realistically how time consuming it would be to look perfect like that daily and how expensive women have a lot more challenges than just dealing with cellulite lol…,2023-07-22 08:35:09

"was pretty good few changes i think might have made sense

1 i think it would have been better if barbies treated kens bad in the beginning of the movie maybe ignore them or just kinda mean but not rude to them i think that would added more characters to kens revolution and it would make barbie and ken speech later more meaningful  

2 glorias speech at the end relied on the real world too much  no men treated glora bad in the movie only person who interacted with her was real nice to her and her husband seems cool too while it was meaningful it didnt feel that personal 

also oddly enough all kens and allen did great and that was the highlight of the movie for me especially the musical at the end",2023-08-29 02:43:30

cant believe no one has pointed out that the necessary singing of closer i am to fine is before leaving or entering barbie land is hilarious,2023-10-07 06:30:38
"it was an ok movie   i smirked a few times but didnt laugh aloud 

what makes me want to give this movie a 5 or a 6 is more like when i think about how other relatively mundane kids plaything movies developed vast and complex worlds and compelling plots  like im old enough to remember thinking it was the stupidest move possible for hollywood to make a movie out of a disneyland ride or legos or even the board game battleship and theyre simply not even in the same league as barbie theyre so far advanced   its like the ultimate thing about this movie is that feminism is pretty boring almost like this was a religious movie telling us nothing new about worn out tropes  in terms of kids plaything exploitation movies id put barbie at about the same level as the transformers movies only with less odds of a sequel",2023-11-17 20:46:03
"the movie was weird to me i liked it but still weird

the movie was supposed to set forth an aspiration of gender equality in both barbieland and the real world but all that sentiment came secondary in focus to the fact pushed incessantly that a menrun world whether the real life “patriarchy” or the kendom is the embodiment of evil and instead of pushing for equality the barbies insisted on resubjugating the kens they also remove the concept of kens and barbies pairing up seemingly leaving all but margot robbie’s character without any sort of meaning or meaningful relationship in life

overall i felt like you could take a couple of different competing takeaways from the movie in the real world there is a fight going on against a maledominated “patriarchy” from which women must be liberated and take power yet when the kens do the same thing when they are even more repressed in barbieland they are vilified and their work must be undone to restore barbieland that premise is never seriously questioned therefore it follows logically that… men in the real world should stop women’s efforts to gain their own rights and power or should men just be subjected in both worlds obviously that’s not the intent of the movie but the morality that it insisted on prescribing leads to implications that its creators otherwise wouldn’t support

i didn’t feel like the movie needed to make any broad statements other than that women can do anything can look different from one another etc and that there’s no one blueprint for a woman or anyone i thought that was nice enough everything else felt forced and as others have said like a freshman’s gender studies paper not to mention all the outofplace anticapitalist rhetoric and weirdly calling barbie a “fascist”",2023-07-22 05:12:32
men feeling offended and uncomfortable because of a barbie movie just proves its point through and through great movie,2023-07-23 03:55:08
i can already tell discourse around this film is going to be so toxic from every side but man the movie where women are multifaceted beautiful capable smart and complex and men are total idiots 100 of the time with 0 redeeming qualities is not the giant equality w the film wants you to see it as,2023-07-21 07:36:14
to all you “antiwoke” folks the male lead learns that he doesn’t have to simp for girls anymore and he can be his own man isn’t that your fantasy of what a male character should be you should be happy yeah,2023-07-23 01:06:52
"im confused
i went in expecting something amazing and it was really just meh

i did enjoy the attention to detail the performances especially ryan goslings were very well done but the script was just so meh
 
im trying to understand if there was something more to it that i didnt understand like i got the commentary and kens issues and the parallel of real world and barbieland but like was that it

there were quite a few moments that felt so random i felt like the script was a mess the dialogues either didnt make any sense or they were so inyourface and basic there were no layers if that makes any sense it felt like they were just shouting random things they had heard from feminists hoping it sounds progressive and smart i am a feminist im not saying its bad that they did that just that there was absolutely no nuance to the dialogue

i did tear up 23 times but they also felt random i just walked out of the movie right now and i cant even remember why i teared up

btw what was the scene where the corporate guys were running after barbie i get that it was a commentary on how men are not necessarily the most competent just because they are men but it fell so flat

i dont know maybe i just dont get this kind of humour

edit i forgot to say it reminded me of that movie downsizing where they just touched on every single issue and the genre changed a hundred times and it was just so messy that",2023-07-28 06:34:54
"tbh i feel like people are trying desperately to assign this movie a central message when in reality doesnt really have a clear one yes it is feminist but that still leaves much room for interpterion as feminism itself can umbrella  many other ideologies under it and still be feminist for example some feminists believe that we should live separate of our gendered counterparts and females live amongst females and males live amongst males while other feminists believe the exact opposite so this movie with its main goal being a feminist and empowering movie for woman honestly feels like an absolute mess of feminist ideologiesperspectives that are never fully explored or explained it felt like a fever dream clips of whatever gerwig though would be impactful personally even has an afab person i did not connect to this movie whatsoever moreover i rarely feel the need to bend to societal expectations of gender i never thought i was powerless or upset with men and i feel that a lot of the emotions they tried to associate with the female experience are actually just simply the human one the speech that the mother gave felt extremely patronising and she tries to connect the feelings of not being good enough to woman exclusively when again those feelings are just the consequences of being in a hierarchical  society  am i saying that women face no oppression and that my personal experience is the only one valid no of course not  but by trying to make a movie that appeals to all kinds of feminists and woman ends up saying little to nothing

furthermore with the reviews ive seen no one can come to a single conclusion about what this  film is even about is about barbie becoming her own woman and learning to feel is it about girls reclaiming power and believing in their own femineity is it about men learning to take a step back for women is it saying that men deserve to be put into their place for benefiting from patriarchy i honestly have no clue myself and when i stepped out of the theatre i was left with a massive headache trying to figure out what it even meant even the first thought that came to my head was wow that sure was an absolute nothing burger of a movie and i actually do enjoy media with ambiguous narratives or complex messaging legit perfect blue is my favorite movie however with the barbie movie it didnt feel intentional on gerwigs part it felt disorganised and confused because with every interpretation for the barbie movies message can be contradicted by the moviefor example barbie the character was meant to explain the female experience no but ken represents the woman in barbie land barbie is about accepting your feelings as a woman then why is barbie a useless sad sack at the second half of the movie what was she even supposed to feel is she sad that she has cellulite now not every woman cares about their appearance like that barbie and ken need to separate from themselves and find who they are just like men and woman should main girl barbie is the only one that does this and the kens are still dependant on the barbies they are just kenough now yet they still dont leave the oppressive regime of the barbies like what is this movie trying to comment on about the female experience that it just sucks that we need to rely on each other but also need to be sperate of each other what are you trying to say barbie that we need everything and nothing thats the female experience

im sorry but i disagree i dont think this movie adds anything to the conversation just repeats and echos whatever is in the cultural zeitgeist of today the female experience or any experience for that matter cannot be defined by a single movie my female experience will be vastly different to my moms to my cousins any other female commenter who reads this post i dont feel hopeless actually i feel more enraged that this is how i am expected to feel about my circumstances as a woman that i have to bend my ideology and perspective to fit into whatever this movie wants to say about my life and role in society that i have to relate to barbie or ken or whoever character was meant to represent the females in society this movie is just an arthouse version of a corporate movie to make mattel seem progressive but by making barbie seem to be the very first fashion doll for girls is already erasing so much female history i am not going to explain it all but there are multiple doll makers before barbie and an excelent video that explains it is mjtanners how mattel rewrote history to put barbie on top anyway i just dont like this movie its lack of actual concrete message and how it panders to capitalistic fodder

i can also name 3 other projects that capture the female experience much better than barbie could

perfect blue very graphic but very real depiction of how woman are treated in the industry and in society and even if you arent a woman you can still relate to the mcs experiences of being watched and judged for existing

madoka magica can be read as a metaphor for how girls are expected to mature and take up jobs that mistreat them and blames them for their own personhood leading to mental illness

"heavy spoilers


overall really good the message of how hard it is to be a woman was kind of beat to death but i enjoyed how they still made it fun with that block hit hammer message going on as long as it did near the end of the movie the female barbies barbies owner the executive board they were all interesting to see

seeing barbie have emotions for the first time and have difficulty knowing what they were was refreshing since in the beginning everything was perfect a little too perfect if you ask me very good

my favorite part was ken singing push and having an emotional breakdown because barbie didnt want him his constant smolder and his overall desire for barbie to want him back was intriguing because we found out that his identity is tied to his relationship with barbie

 i like how in the end he and all the other kens realized that they are not extensions of barbie they are ken the way they made barbieland more equal was amazing since they realized they didnt want to recreate the inequality of the real world

very good exciting movie kens cringiness just made it better music was great very funny

my  did this fell flat at my viewing i felt like i was the only one getting some of the jokes and enjoyed the surrealtity and absurdity of it,2023-07-23 14:40:19
"literally just got home from seeing it so its still all very fresh i will say that i enjoyed it to a degree that outweighs any of the issues i had with it the amount of care and detail that was put into every aspect of it is commendable and just off of that alone i think it counts as a job well done

i think the worst possible thing they could have done with this film was left it in the hands of a person who didnt care about doing anything unique with it there was a real opportunity here to make it into something original surprising and meaningful and i think gerwig along with the whole cast and crew really succeeded with that and because its a movie about a massive cultural icon like barbie it could have easily been sloppy and vapid and still made a lot of money and had people enjoying it but they went the extra mile with it and made something of actual value too i think i just walked out really appreciating its existence more than anything

the main things i had issues with were the overall tone and meaning of the film i found myself on a personal rollercoaster ride in terms of how it had me feeling from scene to scene i just found it a little hard to get into the groove of it or something im also not a person who enjoys things that are too on the nose in terms of messages being delivered in art i just felt the movie could have benefited from being a little less selfaware  because it did kinda ruin the vibe of certain moments for me it was an obvious reflection of the issues women face in our world and i think that was a great choice and very appropriate i just personally enjoy reading between the lines a bit more

i also found that with how much was blatantly given to the audience in terms of the films message i somehow walked away not really knowing what the message was is it about the importance of equality or that women should run everything 

anyway its still fresh and i think i could definitely benefit from another viewing of it i also feel like all of its imperfections added a certain beauty to it as a whole and the fact that its sparking so much discussion is maybe half the point",2023-07-26 06:31:59

"spoiler alert 
  
   
i don’t know why but i feel sad and disappointed that barbie became a human at the end that the whole movie was about saying “you’re enough” but she didn’t feel perfect in the perfect utopia created just for her — why would the real world be any better 
  
and also it felt a bit meh like the whole kendom thing was annoying and i wish it was more just a movie about barbie discovering the real world the ups and downs and then having this crisis about which she wants to choose   
    
i see some people missing some of the more subtle feminist takes like “hurrr why after ken cried they say the ken’s can’t have a spot on the supreme court but only a minor role as a magistrate judge first” — read up on feminist history pre 1950’s even i know it was bad in the 50’s too and even now but i’m talking about before we could be independent of a husband like having a bank account not being allowed certain careers etc and yes i know some  countries still have very restrictive practices for women please don’t pick at me for choosing an arbitrary decade that’s how it’s been for women “no you can’t study medicine but you can become a nurse” “okay now women are doctors but you’re not going to be strong enough to become an ortho surgeon… stick to dermatology general practice and psychiatry…” also you hear comments like that even this day and age some med specialties are still an old boys club  
  
margot robbie is literally gorgeous and perfection — can’t imagine a better barbie  
   
i worry for young children being taken the message might be completely lost on themtoo boring  
   
a “barbie discovering the real world” type movie would definitely have been able to appeal to kids with more kiddy jokes and adults with some more subtle jokes i’m imagining a lot of funny “toilet humour” scenes coughing her plastic lungs out on a bong or something lol but i’m sure mattel had a lottttt of strict rules in the way their product could be portrayed which might also explain some peoples questions regarding the script 
  
btw for what it’s worth i’m a late 20’s female just so i don’t get any incel comments etc for not being amazingly blown away by the film like i  was so excited and pumped for and hoping to be   
  
also i’m sad there will be no more promo being done now it’s released duh because margot’s stylist was absolutely killing if with all vintage barbie outfits he had her in  
  
also is just me or were most of the jokes in the trailer or made to feel more important than they really were like the choreographed dance to dua’s song like i thought we would get to see way more “all the barbies dancing” scenes  
  
lastly i know most people — myself included — have enjoyed some new original cinema being made and not just a something something movie the third being made except shrek all those movies smash but would anyone else be keen for a barbie 2 where maybe she does live in the real world experiences it all crazy night club scenes boring job scenes the joys of having genitals scenes living with sachs’s family experiencing lovegriefangerhappiness as she goes along whatever and then deciding she wants to go back to being a barbie idk shy it’s bothered me so much she’s become a human",2023-07-28 17:33:38

"im seeing a lot of people disliking the resolution to the barbieland conflict how it all goes back to the status quo and kens are still under the matriarchy

thats kinda the point right i saw it as a rather crude message 

yes the kens have this moment when they realize they can be whatever they wanna be and their existence should not be dictated by their relationship to those in power its a cheesy sequence when they come to believe anything is possible only for things to go back to exactly the way they were when it comes down to it

kinda like how a woman would feel walking out of the theatre

the movie tries very hard to be clever but keeps nothing from the viewer the message is rather obvious its a lot of wasted potential for me i liked it i had fun during the movie but somewhere in the middle i realised that it really wont go anywhere great casting though nice easter eggs and some jokes mostly women could get i liked the little things but the movie as a whole  oddly bland,2023-07-21 22:10:53
"making a barbie film on a surface level seems like an incredibly simplistic idea after all there are dozens of animated renditions of the same old stories 

but what if you wanted to go further with the idea what if you wanted to question what barbie really was barbie dares to ask “what is the impact of this plastic doll” greta gerwig took on this tough idea and truly went for it 

as most reviews of this movie start off i am not the target audience i’m an 18 year old guy what do i know about the modern woman’s experience or barbie dolls or anything really  the movie did have a tagline “if you love barbie if you hate barbie this is for you” well what if you’re indifferent to barbie

“barbie” truly shines in its set design barbieland is incredibly interesting to look at it crafts a plastic world the logical conclusion of a real world dollhouse even the pool isn’t real water and it’s fun to see the two leads interact with the world in spite of its stillness 

margot robbie plays “stereotypical barbie” and who else would you cast the movie even pokes fun at this idea margot robbie is the human barbie and she really leans into it in this movie she moves and acts like a barbie doll down to the way she runs and floats down from her dream house 

but the gem of this film is ryan gosling playing ken he goes all out this is an all star performance ryan gosling is ken his expressions are hilarious he is seamlessly able to make soso jokes hilarious his venture into and out of the patriarch idea is masterfully handled it’s balanced enough to get laughs and make people think without ruining the positive tone of the movie

a common criticism i’ve been seeing of “barbie” is mattel’s role in the movie will ferrel’s character and the board of executives in general are somewhat of a pointless inclusion this is mostly true they don’t really move the plot along they don’t do much but in spite of this they still manage to have some very comedic scenes in my opinion the movie is better for their inclusion the “scooby doo” esque chase in the mattel building is total cartoonish fun and a joy to watch play out on screen  and the inclusion of mattel does give a pathway to the emotional core of the story where barbie meets ruth within the offices 

there are some flaws with this movie however the messaging is very heavy handed this often works in the movies favor after all who sees “barbie” for its subtlety but it’s also often a detriment to the movie it can occasionally come off as preachy and often causes issues with the tone of the movie that being said there is a very sweet and funny scene near the end between ken and barbie where you truly feel some improvement for him as a character 

some of the jokes also just don’t really land in the movie there were jokes that just left the theater in silence and this was a common issue in the film i’d say half or less of the jokes truly landed 

but despite these missteps i do think the world is a better place with greta gerwig’s “barbie” there’s a nice heart inside this movie and a lesson that plenty of people need to hear its not afraid to poke fun at itself and it’s not afraid to go for it when it feels the need to it’s a vibrant positive and fun movie the world deserves more “barbie”s p",2023-07-22 20:55:39
"people are taking this way too seriously the film is great it takes its themes and has a lot of fun with them and then brings them back around towards the end and starts to acknowledge some of the mens world veiw too it seems people are only focusing on the setup and not the resolution of these themesthen the ghost of barbies creator says people make up these terms like the patriarchy to deal with the stugles of every day life which was great her character was great and really represented how extreme people take things over something nice like a toy for girls thats meant to inspire 

margot robbie was awesome and showed a range of poignant emotions",2023-07-22 21:58:21
sorry to betray ryan gosling but i think they should have saved ken and patriarchy stuff for a sequel and just kept it about barbie and the nature of toys makebelieve and growing up  the movie was 100 minutes they needed to pick one plot and stick to it  as it stands the movie stretched itself too thin trying to be too many things and it just lost me,2023-07-23 14:48:42

they criticize mattel for having mostly males in charge but its made by mattel is mattel actually changing their policy or do they think if they lampshade it its fine

they even go as far as make a point about how hollywood actresses are unrealistically beautiful but they still cast a hollywood beautiful actress

the ending is barbie becomes a real girl whats the message there

i feel like they pointed out a lot of problems in society and the company but it doesnt really go anywhere with it ultimately i guess because it cant you can make a satirical barbie movie to try to push for change within mattel but mattel itself cant make a satirical movie pushing for it to change itself and then not change",2023-07-25 16:34:12

my first point of scepticism is the ending if feminism is about equality between the sexes and this movie wants to be a clear proponent of feminism why end it with the barbies in control once again i feel like the movie has disingenuous intentions to the viewer here where it starts off trying to take an ethical stance and advocate for the correct behaviours but then flips it all on its head where the happily ever after scenario ends up being one of the sexes over another division between the sexes shouldnt even be a thing here  we are all human and our differences and disagreements are solved through understanding not spitefulness its not because guys are in control in the real world we will be in control here it should be because guys are in control in the real world we will show them we can do better here and build a society equal for all

second thing was the way barbies emotionally manipulated the kens against each other as much as kens were clearly acting wrong in their patriarchical society as indicated in the movie plenty of times it felt as if the retaliation by the barbies was also wrong   exploiting their feelings of love to achieve their end goal however absolutely zero reference was given that this behaviour was incorrect in retrospect my concern is that younger people see this and start thinking that its ok to play these kinds of games to get what they want from others in the end what barbie did telling ken how she truly felt about him after he was also honest about his feelings is the proper way to go about things but i take issue that the exploitation of the kens was passed off in a neutral to positive light and hasnt been criticized more

i had several other facepalms throughout the movie that were less important eg the fact that ruth in wanting to preparewarn barbie for the difficulties that lie ahead in her new life as a human shows her images of laughing people and pure joy no suffering or pain whatsoever felt like the writers lost a good opportunity to tell the audience that life cannot be all rainbows and sunshines all the time and you just have to endure and persevere sometimes maybe these arent worth mentioning that much though

overall felt like the movie had potential to be something great but ended up confused in its messages i did appreciate barbies and kens identity crises and how they navigated through them eventually helping each other and building a true bond that transcends  but looking at the movie as a whole feels like it does more harm than good and it kinda annoys me",2023-08-21 00:11:42
me and my sister were laughing so hard when the opening was basically a parody of the ape sequence in 2001a space odyssey,2023-07-21 12:27:46
"i have to admit that i was a little confused all the time on the other hand the movie wasnt supposed to be any logical all the songs felt a bit unattached to me but i guess they had their purposes some scenes were funny but not as funny as what i thought after reading some reviews the movie wasnt boring but seeing it once was enough for me

someone here pointed out that barbie felt a bit like lego movie i had the same feeling especially after seeing will ferrel as ceo

i found it cool that the characters were based on real barbie dolls also the actors did a great job",2023-07-21 19:32:00
i really wanted to love this movie but it was too chaotic for example why did the ceos go into barbieland in the end a bunch of scenes were rushed andor unnecessary and the overall message and separate quotes from the movie didnt bring anything new to the table i was hoping for a more profound dialogue or character arcs but it was all very repetitive and childish which was probably what they were going for im still trying to process everything in my mind but in my opinion the high points of the movie were the acting production and visuals not the script and directing,2023-07-21 20:30:59
my theater literally cheered after america’s monologue first time i ever experienced a theater cheering,2023-07-22 02:40:17
this movie is some of the hardest i’ve laughed in a theater my whole audience was losing it throughout most of the film ryan gosling as ken definitely stole the show,2023-07-22 22:10:37
just came out of barbie as we exited i heard a guy say to his friend i cant imagine oppenheimer being better than that bunch of people laughed and honestly i had the same sentiment,2023-07-23 01:55:37
"i enjoyed the subtlenotsosubtle aspect of the radicalised kens reducing their barbies to noncommittal committed relationships and the barbies expected to just go along with it something i see my fellow women go through a lot making do with absolute scraps from  men when it was barbieland the barbies just dont look at kens in a romantic sense but when its kendom they are cornered into a bare minimum relationship while being relegated to second place accessory in all areas of life  greta 

i also felt that the glaring gap in mens modern societal identity was highlighted when the only way ken can really find himself is to just be himself i dont know if this is entirely the answer for every guy but i think its a worth considering you are you you dont have to completely leave yourself behind to fit societys toxic idea of masculinity to be a real man something about how barbie leaves barbieland behind and gains autonomy and ken stays because he found himself outside of the romanticsocietal expectations of men

i really loved the moment where barbie was shown everything being a girl and a woman is then just says yes 

i could honestly go for this winning best picture or at least getting nominated its an extremely well made film",2023-07-23 04:39:35
"as a man this movie aligned with my ideals far more than i expected  i know greta gertwig has a lot of feminist ideals but i didnt expect warner and mattel to let her and the writers get away with a lot of what was in the movie i never would have expected patriarchy to be so aggressively attacked but im absolutely here for it 

great movie with a great message soundtrack was dope too",2023-07-23 19:12:00
"overall i didn’t think the movie was that good 

enjoyed a lot of parts of it for sure but there were too many half baked ideas that didn’t really get enough nurturing and didn’t come together

the mom daughter stuff was pretty cool but they didn’t really do anything with it and those characters were just there in the 3rd act 

the whole barbie becoming human was meh ruth stuff was meh all of the metel exec stuff was meh

i enjoyed a lot of aspects of the movie but overall the plot was too messy wish they cut out a lot and had more singing and dancing",2023-07-26 00:47:44
"i might get flak for this but this account is anonymous so here goes i loved the movie i found it very funny and touching and the ost is a blast no this isnt what i think ill get flak for lol the big patriarchy speech you hear one of those on tv or in movies from time to time and ill admit sometimes not always as a man i feel like its an attack on me and i feel like its unfair because i dont cat call and if my buddy catcalled he wouldnt be my buddy for long sometimes these speeches feel like theyre unfairly putting something on my shoulders this one didnt feel like that at all i dont know why

of course i didnt understand or really feel a lot of what she was talking about in this speech im not a woman i dont know what its like to be a woman in our world but it was like yeah i dont really get it but that must  im sorry youre going through that

bit rambly but i wanted to say it also love kens arc im just ken and im enough",2023-07-27 07:56:50
i feel like the people who are mad about this ending are flipping hypocritical the kens are literally a satiric reflection of how women are treated in the real world i thought the message was clear from the line in the narration now the kens have the same power as the women in the real world something in the lines of that im just mad people are so angry about this aspect of the film that they dismiss other good aspects this movie has to brings this movie is not perfect but it just pains me seeing people so mad at a part they just misinterpreted,2023-07-28 12:30:43
"i’m a little all over the place about the movie i don’t know if i liked the ending parts of it leaned misandry to me even as a woman i liked parts of their message it’s campy and humorous but idrk how i feel about it 

it’s kinda weird to me that ken is her boyfriend and she doesn’t love him and they’re still barbie and ken i get that that’s the point but it still didn’t make a ton of sense to me dua lipa being there for a full second was  

i agreed with parts of the monologue about how hard it is to be a woman but then at other times i was like “maybe stop trying to make everyone happy” 

again totally don’t get why she chose to be a human",2023-07-30 13:51:18
"am i the only person who thinks that the barbie movies message might have gone in the wrong direction

i went to see the movie with a couple of my friends and firstly holy  it was so colourful just based on the style and humour i would say that it was a good movie but then there is the message

just ignoring the main plot for a second

the entire movie was just barbie not treating ken right ken discovering that other men can treat him better than barbie leaving barbie and then establishing ken land with the completely forced plot of brainwashing then the barbies instead of talking about it comes up with the idea to first give the kens the best of their lives by giving them attention then immediately making them jealous by hanging out with the other kens to make the kens fight the kens obviously make up and dont fight for too long and then afterwords when the main ken explains to barbie that she didnt treat him right and all he wanted was some form of attention and validation she just said go figure it out urself lol

and at the end the barbies all take control over barbie land again and remove the kens power then when the kens go to the barbies after learning their lesson and ask if they can get some spots in the supreme court and police and  the barbies just say no

they actually just made full circle",2023-07-30 19:31:26
"it was a movie with great visuals and genuine laughs but i found the feminist message really muddled some of it rang true to me and some of it really didnt 

it paints gender politics as a zerosum game either men are winning or women are the happy ending is the kens continuing to be oppressed just slightly less i mean i know some of it might be a bit tongueincheek but it didnt quite read right to me 

when the barbies are trying to take back their homes they emotionally manipulate the kens against each other suggesting that women only have power through men and not in their own right really not my idea of an empowering message

i kind of left the theatre thinking is this what people leaving the theatre are going to think feminism is",2023-07-31 00:41:32

i will say this i loved the movie but as a huge comic book fan my favorite line is when they mentioned zack snyder justice league,2023-08-04 16:49:09
fun movie with a great message but felt too much like a commercial at some points there were too many times where it felt the camera really had to show me that the car they were driving was in fact a chevy blazer or that the truck was definitely a hummer ev or that the cars driven by the mattel people were suburbans they had to name drop that beer forgot the name three times and showcase duolingo not to mention that the whole thing was itself an ad for mattel i felt like that was all shoved in my face way too many times so i have to rate it a 7 otherwise it would’ve been a solid 8,2023-08-11 02:37:42
watched it last night and while i found it enjoyable for the most part and there were a few chuckle worthy scenes but i left feeling a little underwhelmed i think the hype got to me theres no question that they put a lot of effort into the aesthetics i get the overall message they were going for  and i think they did a good job but i dont think any of the acting was oscar worthy by any means its not really quotable like say mean girls and i dont see it becoming a classic that will be watched over and over,2023-08-28 08:34:05
"feels super cathartic for a huge blockbuster film like this to nail the feeling of growing up as a girl its the eventual realization that no matter what direction you go in no matter if others perceive you to be feminine or masculine aggressive or passive conventionally attractive or not successful or not the world is going to tear you down and make you feel like youre not enough regardless of how hard you try to fit into a box  choked up at that bench scene where barbie noticed that a woman being able to visibly age and live a full life is something beautiful and admirable 

also love how this posts cast list only lists the barbies would be even funnier if the only oscar nom this got was for a ken best male supporting",2023-07-21 03:14:42
"did nobody find barbie’s plot very problematic

barbie was an excellent film very entertaining great acting great set pieces everything 

however i actually found the plot very problematic and i am surprised no one else feels this way 

no i don’t have an issue with the feminist themes i think it is incredibly problematic however to make the goal of a film’s protagonist to reinstate a power asymmetry

the ken’s are happy at the start of the film but they have no power the land is ran by barbie’s all important jobs are held by barbie’s and ken’s aren’t even allowed in the dream houses at night 

when the ken’s take over it is barbie’s goal to reinstate the barbie regime 

so to reiterate a marginalized group’s rebellion against an oppressive regime is quashed and that is the happy ending even at the end of the movie when the ken’s ask for a supreme court judge they are told no 

i fully expected the return of power to have some ken inclusion although i realize this may undermine the message of the movie

this is not a male  female dynamic that is problematic it is a group based power dynamic which is highly problematic when applied to other groups 

i was personally a little shocked that the goal of the protagonist’s was to reinstate a hegemonic power 

i know some people are calling this movie too ‘woke’ but i think it is actually extremely unwoke in this way",2023-07-29 15:34:23
"i cant believe im about to say this earnestly but barbie is a real w for warner bros discovery toytofilm adaptations and michael cera

this is what has been missing from cinemas youll laugh youll cry youll have a great time this is how satire is supposed to be done reenact a complex idea using simple characters to me this film challenged gender roles using hyperfemininemasculine dolls

but thats just an episode of television the thing that really elevated this film was bringing characters in and out of the real world this type of fourthwall break is usually excessive and blunt but i think it served as a good barometer of what we think the world is like vs what it is actually like

usually not a fan of greta gerwig but i have to give her props with barbie she nailed it 1010",2023-07-21 02:54:27

wow what a movie can make you feel amusement awe guilt excitement and exasperation at once extremely solid performances production value set design pacing and writing i think this is my 3rd favorite movie of the year gerwig and baumbach do it again just like last year with the white noise,2023-07-21 11:41:20

i thought this film was pretty good but im kinda disappointed and bummed out by it greta gerwig is one of my favourite filmmakers and it didnt come remotely close to approaching the level of her other films i know its probably dumb to think that way when its a barbie movie but given that the lego movie also exists and is brilliant i was really hoping she could pull off something on that level and i dont really think it came together as well as it could have,2023-07-21 22:00:27
i did not expect barbie to make me cry lol,2023-07-21 23:30:00
"i thought it was funny that all of the kens were conventionally attractive men with muscular bodies and the barbies were skinny  in wheelchairs 


watching the ken dance dance off scene after the seeing the diversity in the barbie party scene in the beginning really illustrates the point",2023-07-22 13:15:21
i thought the movie was fantastic i’d give it like an 810 the music made me want to dance and the casting was 1010 i did find the ken’s to be the most interesting part of the film which is a bit ironic in a largely feminist movie,2023-07-22 15:53:42
that zack snyder’s jl reference ,2023-07-23 14:47:16
"i enjoyed the movie loved the first half liked the second but my main gripe with it is that at the end of the day the main criticism that people throw at barbies and mattel wasnt deeply explored the beauty standards and body norms set by barbie dolls

sasha the teenager who used to play with the barbie basically fits all those beauty stereotypes it would have felt very different if we had seen a girl who did not fit those body norms making the comments that she did and showing how her life had been impacted by the cultural expectations that toys like barbies set on young girls 

plus when she throws her criticism at barbie that she was a bad influence on girls growing up by setting unrealistic beauty stereotypes what we see is  barbie crying and saying it was never her intention to make anyone feel bad making barbie a real person with feelings sort of acts as a way to make us feel bad about sasha criticising her directly as that is like criticizing an individual woman rather than a object which is a way to make those comments hit differently and feel less pertinent

the rest of the movie is an exploration of the effects of patriarchy and of male toxic masculinity over both men and women but it never directly or deeply addressed the question of how body standards set by barbies affect womens body image and most importantly what should be changed by mattel to prevent that 

fundamentally the whole patriarchy plot and real world vs barbie world just felt like a way to discuss those topics in a very generic way that doesnt address the specificities of how barbie influences young girls and just sort of throws blame at the entire society and at the patriarchy without recognising blame in the brand 

i get that this is a movie made by mattel and obviously they wouldnt want to criticise the product directly but it still feels frustrating as a viewer to see them trying to escape responsability in any serious way

at the end of the day if you go to most shopping malls today to the dolls sections basically all the barbies you will find there are still the stereotypical barbie even in the world of the movie which was obviously trying to be inclusive you look at the barbies in barbieland almost all of them were gorgeous and basically all of them were very thin with only one or two exceptions 

i really wish brands would make real concerted efforts to create truly body positive products rather than shifiting responsibility or simply virtue signaling",2023-07-23 20:21:02
"honestly the more i think about the movie the more realise how the messages arent as simple as it seems and its way more satirical and self aware then anyone sees

this is just my take from the film and its clearly polysemic

but i think the films real thesis is barbie solves misogyny is a dumb idea and its laughing at that

its a film that is fundamentally against itself and the entire idea of corporate feminism that brand is built on multiple times in the film barbieland talks about how barbie has made the world a better place for women which is clearly ironic and a laughable notion the film constantly makes ideas like girl power and patriarchy the butt of the joke all the ideas about gender presented throughout the film besides maybe glorias and ruths points were laughably  because the characters are brainless dolls made for 4 year olds no matter what barbie does people are not happy because that is reality

a normal non self aware barbie film would have ended the film with barbie instantly fixing all issues and instantly granting gender equality and making everyone happy which the film was parodying with its ending but in the real world feminism doesnt work like that the audience is supposed to laugh at the barbies solution not agree with it because in the real world feminism is really hard its complicated and messy and often does seem hypocritical like the barbies are presented and most importantly feminism takes time lots of time huge eras of history and its still not sorted out for everyone its not something you can put a pink bow on and call a day like brands like matel would want you to think

this is a movie that portrays its own studio as a bunch of bumbling fools who want to push feminism above everything else despite not understanding at all which matches so much of modern media

i honestly feel the film is more anticorporate feminism than it is antimen whilst at the same time being a piece of corporate feminism which lots on people on both sides of the feminism debate are failing to see because they are incapable of seeing feminism as something thats not perfect or evil which is why i compare the movie to starship troopers which people thought had a simplistic view on war that it really didnt",2023-07-25 21:47:30
"i feel like a betrayer to all womankind  i did not like the movie  i was super super excited for it because im a girlie girl i love greta gerwig i love margot robbie and i love a good social commentary 

i went into barbie expecting to get a poignant story wrapped up in pretty pink packaging and the packaging sure was pretty the barbies are stunning and the set is gorgeous but the monologue that made everyone cry did not resonate with me at all

maybe its bc im not born in the west but my experience with misogyny is more like im expected to be docile wife as opposed to skinny girlboss to me a life where im expected to be a careerdriven leader seems pretty out of reach in my world i struggle with all of my accomplishments being dismissed as nothing i cant relate to people having high expectations of me or asking me to account for mens mistakes or needing me to be a kind leader bc no one expects me to be anything really",2023-07-28 16:58:34

"i liked the set design for barbieland and a lot of the initial story in barbieland although it felt a bit odd when barbie was in the real world and feeling emotions and seeing human connection was beautiful margot robbies illustrating barbie feeling the emotions was great and ryan gosling performed great with what he was given

i felt the feminist stuff was too loud im 100 not saying there shouldnt have been any feminist messages but show dont tell comes to mind and the opening monologue and glorias speech and the bringing the other barbies back to their senses were screaming  but i believe that was the point

i think the last third was a bit of a mess and lost me when they got back to barbieland it felt like they had a checklist of messages they wanted to tell and squeezed them in at the detriment of the film as a whole


i think the film would have benefitted if the girls and or barbie stayed to help in the real world as barbieland was meant to mirror how the dolls were being played with and i think the film was at its best there",2023-08-04 13:09:58
"maybe this is dumb to say but i feel like because the roles are reversed it reinforces how women are treated in society today like in barbieland there is a group in womens position and everyone is totally ok with that its even made out to be something that isnt bad there is no justice for the group in the shawdow which is women in the real world feminism is wanting women to be equal to men not better i feel like this movie fuels the rage of those intolerant to learn what feminism really is because there are portrayals likw this

this paragraph doesnt fully get my idea thru idk how to explain if you agree please comment",2023-08-19 04:22:51
"loved the movie but there are some issues 

for example what was the purpose of the joke with the dad learning spanish on duolingo  the movie had the opportunity to have one positive male role model a dad who loves his wife and daughter and does the effort to learn spanish instead he is mocked and accused of cultural appropriation 

also the entire plot surrounding will ferrel and his board went nowhere no resolution no character arc

i dont know why but the experience of watching this movie felt the same i got after watching the end of evangelion specially during that final conversation between barbie and her creator it also felt like that scene towards the end of never ending story where bastian and the empress talk after the destruction of fantasia that scene back to barbie got a full row behind me in the theater crying,2023-07-21 13:12:18

nothing seemed that abstract or leftfield to me but maybe im just a  i felt like both conceptually and storylinewise it was similar to a lot of things that have come before which is no bad thing even the execution while not the standard hollywood fare wasnt massively surrealist makes me wonder if it just says more about how bland everything else has become but then id say eeaao was far more nonconventional and that was only a year ago so just genuinely curious why this movie has amazed so many in terms of being out there",2023-07-21 14:18:25

"anyone else think the real world stuff was kinda just bad will ferrell and the ceos were irrelevant i could have done totally without them america ferreras character and her daughter have basically no depth or development in this basically went grr i hate my mom shes cringe to okay i fw my mom with pretty much nothing having had happened aside from them watching barbie find out her world has been invaded by patriarchy they spend a not insignificant amount of time showing a chevrolet commercial just a bizarre choice insanely corporate film littered with lin manuel miranda 2016ass politics where we soapbox about the problems we face while winking at the fact that this is a corporation perpetuating many of these same problems 

ive seen twitter accounts handwaving the depth of the feminist message by saying its meant to be for children or for people who have never engaged with any left leaning feminist thinking i dont know what to make of that this idea that its done poorly or shallowly on purpose its a weird movie for every decision that i liked and really enjoyed it feels like there was one that was absolutely repellant or did not land at all i dont know who this movie is for yet in that i think it loops around to being for anyone it is a mirror with several possible readings and interpretations possible as to what the messaging is meant to be i cannot decide if this is the films greatest strength or its greatest weakness it simultaneously flaunts a myriad of possibility while holding you at arms length laughing that you dare engage critically with a movie about toys  i think its nowhere near lady bird or little women but the more i sit with it the more confused i feel about it both in positive and negative ways the whole viewing experience has become pretty ironic for me in that i came into it expecting a complex portrayal in the vein of lady birdlittle women hidden under barbie aesthetics was met with hamfisted in your face depictions lathered in barbie aesthetics yet find that the messages in their simplicity do not form anything resembling a perfect puzzle they contradict and they twist meanings as you hold them side by side

idk i have it sitting at a 35 rn but i feel like i need to watch it again drop my expectations and maybe just engage with it on its own terms i will say the first 20 minutes and the final 1015 were excellent i just feel like the middle hour connecting those two portions was just weird",2023-07-24 16:03:12
did anyone else totally hate that barbie decided to become human in the end was that implied to even be the big decision she struggled with throughout the film or was it just thrown in at the end i wasn’t expecting that to be the ending and if i was i would’ve rooted for her to stay in barbieland it would’ve contributed to the idea she was enough she could still be stereotypical barbie along with many other things in barbieland idk for pure fantasy i would’ve preferred she stay a doll,2023-07-24 22:58:55
i didnt like it i think there was so much potentially for it to be good but it was kinda all over the place i was confused for a lot of it the funny parts were funny but the story wasnt there for me i will not be seeing it again and im bummed there was so much hype about it,2023-07-25 13:06:55
it felt a bit scatterred to me lot of nice elements but the movie didn’t really gel well as a whole like what was the whole barbie in a box thing  was it worse than just going back to barbieland which she did anyway why did alan turn into a random fighting machine why did america ferrara just go vigilante when all her executive staff was chasing her the toy to human connection is what you get to barbieland by roller blading in venice beach so many things you shouldn’t question so much in a good movie but they did even say in the movie “don’t think about it too much” hah which was def a message to the audience think of movies like elf or the matrix and they don’t have near as many logic questions you just buy it cuz they are good,2023-07-25 14:32:05
is barbie worth seeing just solely for ryan gosling what percentage of the movie is he in,2023-07-25 22:31:05
"this might be controversial but i wish they went harder with the dance scene 

i loved the movie overall and the message and everything but they kept blurring the line between musical and not musical and i kind of wish they fully committed to it being so musical i kept hoping for a bigger wow moment but maybe my expectations were too high let me know if anyone agrees",2023-07-25 22:57:49
"i absolutely loved this movie and would totally watch it again however is it just me who finds it extremely ironic for feminists which is a movement i completely support on tiktok saying that ken made them really angry because if im not wrong ken represented women in the patriarchal society which are what feminists fight to support and the amount of people saying that barbie was the most morally right character when she literally represented the patriarchy just makes me so confused because the way i see it barbie isn’t better than ken and ken isnt better than barbie 


and something else i’d like to add is i dont understand why they go back to the matriarchy at the end because when they said something about not letting kens have a higher up job in society when surely the end goal for barbieland is equality 

idk can someone just explain all of this to me

also sorry if this is worded really badly its midnight where i am and im so tired lol",2023-07-26 22:55:19
"i thought it was an ok movie i felt like if it was a bit longer it wouldve helped explain some of the bits better

it wasnt as thought provoking as i was led to believe

edit

what was the point of the corporate dudes like outside of comedic effect they really didnt doanything",2023-07-27 01:38:21
"watched it last night

loved about 75 of it but i feel like the writing fell apart at the end

i didnt like the scooby doo style chase scenes in the cubicles and the executives being stopped by a turnstyle i felt like they were trying to make the real world more serious compared to the imaginary world and these scenes kinda muddied the waters and erased any threat the executives posed because you knew they were  which might be why they basically wrote them out of the movie after that they were right behind them going into the imaginary world but somehow didnt show up until days after the others did

the kens allen and weird barbie were definitely the highlight of the movie 

overall id say its a 7510",2023-07-27 16:32:04
saw it tonight with my wife im a 42year old man i loved everything about this movie,2023-07-29 02:27:55
"i loved it the kens were almost in the exact same situation as the women in the real world and vice versa except in the real world there are actually three sitting women supreme court justices lol but overall it was pretty realistic also everything is more plastic and fake in the barbie world

the tactics that they used to take the world back from the kens was turning the kens against each other over  competition just like gender flipped a mirror of the real world

the movie promotes racial harmony with sasha cancelling barbie in an early scene but in the end comes around to working together with her it also suggests that the kens wars between men are less important than the gender wars im not sure how realistic that is but it does try to hit home that gender is the real struggle

i love how the message of this movie is women are people women are human and not barbies barbies are just a two dimensional reflection of the real world the reality is that groups with less power get to be less human since their humanity is suppressed or ignored so barbie choosing to become human in the end was the only possible ending that worked for this",2023-07-30 21:28:27
"im probably gonna get downvoted for this but oh well

did anyone else kinda find it hilarious that the beach off sequence  im just ken ended up being the ultimate  bros before hoes 

this coming from a film called barbie made mostly for a female audiencewhere the crucial element of the barbies return is turning kens against each other happens to have guys rise above their squabbles over women i just find it sooo cognitively dissonant in regards to the film and i love it",2023-07-31 11:48:44
"finally got to see barbie last night and managed to avoid all spoilers and most trailers first off im a middle aged dude and a big fan of gerwigs work especially lady bird i prepped for this movie by watching little women american in paris and singing in the rain a movie btw 

overall i thought this movie was a great time and one i could recommend to almost anybody similar to this years spiderverse i thought the selfawareness and gerwigs brand of humor was well suited for this type of project most reviews i read echo this but i think this movie was spot on when it was in barbieland and has an incredible opening act it gets super messy when it enters the real world tho specifically any scenes that involve the board it started to feel like one big commercial for mattel warner brothers and the chevy blazer ev which had me afraid we were entering space jam 2 territory it also didnt help that a good majority of the songs made for this movie were by top 40 artists lizzo khalid dua lipa etc thats not to say licensed music is a bad thing in a movie i just found the execution distracting here at least in the first half of the movie minor complaints aside i thought weird barbie was hilarious and mckinnon crushed it america ferreras monologue was great and is a great summary of the movies theme and both robbie and gosling were absolutely perfect for their roles i think if you were to cut out all of the mattel board stuff and either flesh out the motherdaughter relationship a bit more or just remove the sharing memories with barbie thing this would be a much tighter movie but that didnt stop me from loving it i mean its a popcorn flick with actual effort put into it so credit is due 

if you know what a barbie is i think you should check it out sometime its fun 45 ",2023-08-01 11:52:34
"kens storyline like bro how tf did one dude overthrow the matriarchy in barbieland getting the kens to change is one thing but to get the barbies to go along i still dont get it it was convenient for the plot but it doesnt make sense

margot robbie has a whole existential crisis about what it means to be a woman in the real world america ferrera is reconciling the romantic idea of what barbie meant to her childhood with the reality that other little girls faced when presented with a barbie i thought there was going to be something of a motherdaughter story but that never really fleshed out 

i understood the themes pretty well but it was kinda unfair that so much was cut to make this film 2 hours the result is okay but you can tell that there was more that wanted to be said and shown",2023-08-01 20:41:05
"i think the movie was very good a lot of fun moments but i feel it slightly missed the mark to get into great territory

every scene with margot and ryan was amazing i wished we had even more of those there were a few subplots that i didnt particularly care for the daughter  america part felt underwhelming

also while i do get the female empowerment message of the movie i think it was a little too on the nose done at certain points via just flat out saying it showcasing it through scenes  events wouldve been better imo a case of show dont tell 

finally really wished that humans wouldnt have been able to get to barbieland my hope wouldve been for weird barbie  allan  stereotypical barbie to rescue the other barbies from kendom without other input",2023-08-02 01:48:50
"i went to see the barbie movie last night and really enjoyed it many complex ideas and feelings were portrayed in such a clever way cried a couple of times obviously the heavily emotional parts like barbieruth scene or the scene at the bus stop when barbie starts to soak in the human experience by watching people argue laugh and then turns to the old lady

but also when i saw some of the emotions i’ve experienced being portrayed and described to a whole audience i felt validated it was almost like a hug so many things about being a woman can’t be said or explained because people don’t believe you or think you’re being emotional or you’re blowing it out of proportion like when they arrive at the real world and how barbie feels self conscious how she gets assaulted the comments the police officers say about her etc 

another good one for instance at work if you’re dismissed and have  tried to talk to people about a certain issue and people just go “have you tried talking to the higher ups i’m sure they’ll listen” as a woman yes you try but hardly ever gets to anywhere  they kinda show this in how gloria tries to stop the dude from going in the meeting she knows the rules and is expected to follow them “you can’t go in they are in creative meeting” then the dude just walks in yes they make fun of him and try to dismiss him but is still given a chance to talk made me wonder how many times gloria was even called out for only knocking the door 

anyways i could go on but this morning i realized that a lot of my coworkers went to see it last night too and i am really not looking forward to have a conversation about this movie with them",2023-08-02 12:16:22
america fererra’s monologue  amazing,2023-08-07 08:09:25
it was good a lot messier than i was expecting with all the praise,2023-08-07 18:29:10
it was ok,2023-08-08 06:41:03
"im just going to say it this movie should have been  named ken

its not only that ryan gosling just shined in every scene but i would say that kens character has way much change and growth than barbie",2023-08-29 04:19:13
"to those who didnt get any aha or haha
moments well this movie wasnt made for you not every film is for everyone

ive always been pretty much in the middle between a tomboy and a girlygirl i wasnt allowed to have a barbie growing up my dad was certain it would make me vain and materialistic but i played with them at friends houses still i wear makeup and like to dress nicely but the only pink thing i own is a gifted pair of dangly earrings

my best friend was in town on opening day of the barbie movie we figured it would be light silly girlcentric fun and thought sure why not we located maybe the last two tickets in the county as every other theater was sold out for every showing

well we loved it we played the spotify soundtrack all afternoon we quoted lines from the movie all week i took another friend on her first social outing post surgery then my elderly mom wanted to go so i took her and another friend wanted to see it with me so ive accidentally seen it 4 times each time i notice more details and still love it

its funny uplifting pokes fun at outdated traditions sparks memories of childhood play and innocence and scorches the impossible task of being a perfect woman with truth and humor 

a few of the tropes seemed forced or gratuitous such as gagging at barbies flat feet the white savior barbie comment and ferrells character inexplicably mentioning jewish friends and referring to himself as a mother  twice but these recordscratch moments were thankfully brief and few the eyecandy visuals wellplaced music and the message that women are much more than their looks by far outweigh the negatives in my opinion ryan gosling looked like he had a blast in this role and margo robbie as barbie could not have been better cast it is a sentimental romp with teeth and it clearly resonated with millions",2023-09-06 20:43:19
it wasfine  opening scenes were fun and great eye candy  plot was heavy handed and all over the place  not getting what all the hoopla was about,2023-09-17 04:21:48
this may be a simple take but i think it is accurate i think the main goal of the movie was to promote barbie as well as make money i think they poured a majority of the funding into hiring well known actors and toeing a super controversial line as much as they could while offending nobody and everyone at the same time people thrive on controversy and polarity if you look at the social media you can see the the most promoted videos and topics are the ones with the most comments more comments are driven by polarizing people i think the barbie movie aimed to do just that its a clear promotion of feminism while sprinkling a bit of promens ideas in here and there lines like humans made up the patriarchy and ideas like manipulation from women strike from the opposite angle this portrays the idea that the movie is in fact a satire think about it isnt satire usually pretty obvious at least in more than 2 of any story but then the rest of the movie heavily doubles down on profeminist ideology honestly when i tried to see both of these ideas at the same time i was just confused on one hand it seemed to scream profeminism then on the other hand it screamed satire i know ideas are not mutually exclusive but this seems to be one of the times that they are barbie probably doesnt care at all how you feel about feminism or mens issues they just want you to keep talking about it and fighting so that they can generate more buzz leading to watching the movies they make and investigating the company they have as they say in show business there is no such thing as bad publicity,2023-12-25 07:05:39
i honestly wasn’t a fan plot was all over the place and it felt kind of preachy 410,2023-07-21 03:16:04
"holy  that was great

every joke landed   it was absolutely wonderful writing and acting   the meta of it all wasnt overdone and had easily a top 3 joke in a film littered with great humor

rhea pearlman was a  delight and every moment she was in she and margot had remarkable chemistry  genuinely felt like a mother daughter connection from greta gerwig  who could have possibly seen that coming s

every ken was fantastic but i kept laughing to myself over the  education barbieken pairing  

though of course ryan gosling and simu liu were phenomenally well done rivals and gosling absolutely slayed with his comedic timing singing and just overall wondermentand  the horses

margot robbie was absolutely the right choice for this and not to  on amy schumer but theres no way that version of the movie would have been as good as this  margot hit it out of the park with the full range of emotions and 3even 4 dimensional aspects  got the mannerisms of a barbie doll down during the running scenes especiallyits the little things like that that really elevated this movie plus as i said earlier her chemistry was greatwith everyone  from the random midge to ferrell to aaron  a beaming light of energy   but her best moments were with america ferrera who had maybe her best film role since real women have curves  those two were electric and again gerwig captured the essence of a girl and her doll and the love between them

im sorry to gush but i  adored every second of this movie

alsoive only had allan and the zak snyders justice league joke for only 2 hours but id die for both of them

ohpoor matchbox 20 catching massive strays in this movie 

910 for  sure",2023-07-21 02:32:30
"i enjoyed the movie but do think it was way too heavyhandedpreachy though i did like the monologue from americas character and it stated the contradictions of expectations for women so well

i think personally the better story here would’ve been to focus more on the “perfection” angle of barbie and the standards women strive to fit covering the patriarchy as a whole was too big for this type of film imo and if it would’ve just been about barbie not being “perfect”  and her learning to not just accept that but appreciate it  then i think it would’ve made her choosing to become human more impactfullogical my favorite scene was her telling the old woman on the bench that she was beautiful there are no old women in barbie land no wrinkles etc yet barbie thought she was beautiful to me it’s the first hint that she is different and when she admires everyone in the park you get why maybe she’d want to be “real” too even though everything isn’t “pretty” 100 of the time the ken patriarchy plot was not really worth it to me but that’s just my opinion

for mattel to acknowledge that even while being “empowering” barbie still has to be “pictureperfect” and the way real women try to be that in every facet of our lives would’ve been really cool and the better message here to me",2023-07-25 02:18:36
i feel like i’m in the minority didn’t connect with it but appreciated how well it sold the fantasy,2023-07-21 04:27:04
"the tone of this movie was so all over the place but i suppose that’s the point barbie’s song being indigo girls and ken’s being matchbox 20 was fun margot and ryan were great some just absolute pure cinema moments like the bus stop scene mixed with zany stuff like whispering the message to will ferrell was disjointed to me but overall great somehow pulls this off

it’s weird to have such an lol funny movie along with what it’s saying on a larger scale but for the most part it amazingly works

i was almost crying laughing during the beach off and then actually crying when barbie makes her choice just solid",2023-07-21 22:22:23
"i fkn loved this movie one of the best i’ve seen in a long time 

can anyone type out the whole quote about ken wanting barbie to be his “long distance committed low key girlfriend” or whatever the quote is i’m desperate for the exact quote and cannot find it on google ",2023-07-22 02:15:38
"i wanna be fair i took my niece 36m and tlshe loved it which is all that mattered to me 

i always pictured barbie as the girl that became successful because she dreamed and worked on it  i think the whole mattel plot was completely unnecessary  i also like the mothers speech to an extent  

but im not sure i get the whole concept of where this movie was going  like its anti patriarchy but in ways antifeminism kens didnt wind up getting equality unless i missed something like antifight club but only by what guys see fight club is and missing entirely on male fragility and  thats fine i guess it is barbies movie after all  i did like the costumes and the performances   and like i said she liked it  so its fine",2023-07-22 07:44:30
"that musical number for ken is just unfair i was waiting for barbies big moment but it felt like it never came 

ken gets this big extravagant character defining moment where he works out his conflict with other ken and himself through song 

it was funny it was well made greta didnt disappoint but felt like it was missing something",2023-07-22 13:56:32
"i really loved this movie despite the flaws in the plot 

what i loved about this movie the set and costume design was perfect barbie land was magical the pink was amazing margot robbie imo was the perfect stereotypical barbie and absolutely stunning ryan gosling was truly amazing as ken he was the funniest part of the movie he leaned into the patriarchy jokes so well he did it in such a way that had an undertone of sarcasm which made me feel through the screen like gosling knew how ridiculous his character was if that makes any sense i loved the inclusion of ruth and overall i loved the feminism of this movie 

what i didn’t love about this movie no offense but i thought america ferrera and whoever played her daughter were the weakest part of this movie their acting was not great and was kind of corny imo and their writingstoryline wasn’t even great either i understood the overall message but i thought the plot was just messy at some points it felt like no one really had a purpose it was just barbie suddenly realizing she wanted to become human i really really wanted to like the monologue and the montage of women at the end but i felt like it wasn’t explainedwritten very well so it lost it’s emotional impact 

overall i’m forgiving the at times messy plot because of the way the movie made me feel the happiness i felt in barbieland the nostalgia and the acting from margot and ryan",2023-07-22 22:47:43
"im not the best at catching all the small tidbits in a movie so id like some help if anyone can provide it i am a man

the speech from the mother about what women deal with and how it is used to deprogram the barbies took me out of the movie for the few minutes it was applied not because i dont understand societal pressures on women but because i didnt catch how these pressures were displayed on the mother or even barbie on a societal level im not connecting the dots between barbies issues where shes failing to be the toy shes meant to be and how were suddenly on all the tiny social rules women have to follow nor how those rules would fix the barbies since they all live in a utopia with none of those pressures

did the movie build up to that speech well was it just liked by everyone because they relate to it outside of that section i enjoyed everything about the movie",2023-07-23 01:25:58
just like a man to completely steal the show in a barbie movie,2023-07-23 01:35:33
"i liked it it was funnier than i thought it was going to be i liked barbieland the dance scenes  margot was perfect as barbie and ryan was great and funny as ken i love how the guy says patriarchy still exists they just hide it better and the kens playing the guitar thinking the barbies just love sitting and watching them for 4 hourslol

its a fun funny colourful movie not to be taken too seriously with a great message that kids will see too both boys and girls and explains the problem of patriarchy to kids in an accessible entertaining way",2023-07-23 04:56:24
"ill come off the bat and just say that i had a lot of fun watching barbie although oppenheimer is the better of the two barbie made a better impression on me because of its tone themes and passionate cast you could tell from the introduction that the films entire cast and production team had an amazing time making this film ryan gosling and simu liu are having the time of their lives filming their scenes and they dont attempt to hide it either 

as for margot robbie barbie cements her status as one of hollywoods most gifted modernday character actresses she is the life of this film and its rather uncertain that anyone else could have elevated the starring role like she had there are small scenes where she enhances the emotional impact of the circumstance her character is placed in she will no doubt be seeing a number of nominations this fall and next winter

now lets discuss the story barbie is about the title character going on a journey of selfdiscovery after experiencing a bout of unorthodox symptoms turns out the girl who used to play with her is undergoing a midlife crisis now its up to barbie and a stowaway ken to make things right 

the film presents its story in a linear fashion with two distinct povs in barbie and ken there is a lot of comedy and weird out of time moments both leads face but the crux of the film is how both react to their experiences in the real world barbie develops an existential crisis when she realizes that her femaleled utopia is actually molded by a board of men ken whos being revolves around barbie is changed by the male hierarchical nature of the real world and he returns to barbieland with his newfound ideology in hand the film ends with a direct repudiation of the patriarchy that is conveyed through a speech and a proceeding music video set to a tune thats reminiscent of queens bohemiam rhapsody the story is enrapturing not one scene divests the audience from the film especially when tensions ramp up 

greta gerwig deserves as much adoration for this film as margot robbie her approach to this film is unique fantastical and heartfelt the use of dance numbers contrasted against some emotional moments keeps the film afloat one thing i appreciated that gerwig did is the use of costume changes for the emo zoomer teenager sasha to convey the growing motherdaughter bond between sasha and gloria the history lessons and easter eggs are nice too

overall barbie offers an exciting time in the theater its an excellent film that conveys a message of identity within a gender dominated society ryan and simu are having a blast in this film and the energy the cast gives off enhances the film margot and greta are no doubt the heart and soul of this film respectively and they both succeed in making an enjoyable fun film from a toy and its legacy see this film at least twice

notes welcome to the world of the plastic spoilers beach

 aquas barbie girl is featured as a sample in the ending

 to get this point across they should not have cast margot robbie

"after seeing barbie which i liked well enough i know there will be a sequel and frankly i think they should flip it and explore the maleboy side of things with gi joe and how guys or rather me and my brothers played with toys buy burying them in the mud drowning them in water blowing up the enemies and also explore how those stereotypes effected us

it would be really interesting to see barbie enter another realm of toys different to the one she grew up in and examine how boys and girls handle things playing together and apart

and it starts with the whole concept that boys toys are called action figures and barbie is a doll and how barbie and the dolls have many roles but but with gi joe there and most other action figures there only two roles either hero or villain there is no lawyer gi joe or teacher or dancer or painter or chef etc just army dudes who are good or bad",2023-08-01 18:56:58
i think when presented it seems like a basic film plot and a lot of underlying elements of social constructs however i think taking in account people’s reactions and the press i’d say this movie hit everything it was trying to right on the nail yes kens plot ends with him being “kenough” and finding his own place which is more of a overall narrative to people that they don’t have to live off other people however all the stuff that was done prior to that in which some people are saying was “wrong” for ken to feelhave happen was a great example of how females feel irl i mean “ a world where men aren’t appreciated” imagine how we feel i think this movie hits a lot of point in clever ways that don’t always just involve the film but the outside reactions not to mention the overall humor of being a girl and normalizing them in a funny way within the film,2023-08-02 13:27:52

"the mattel part could have been taken out and the favorability of the movie wouldnt have changed at all

also if the kens are so dumb how were they able to subjugate the barbies how were their election plans foiled if they were smart enough to pull of a coup in the first place and what would stop the kens from doing another coup in the future

that said people are complaining about how the kens are treated as an underclass and while it can be seen that way i thought it was a play on the  stereotype and how women were portrayed in oldschool films for example the james bond movies where sean connery would tell a woman to go away because its time for man talk and then slap her  as she was walked away",2023-07-23 00:01:52

absolutely enjoyed the slight reference to the bratz dolls with sasha and her friends and their “feud” with barbie and how bratz represent teenagers and the depressed barbie ad hit way too close to home   and the amazing references to patriarchy and how easy it can ruin friendships and community between men and women just wow an amazing movie which left so much to think about,2023-07-31 05:05:34
for a movie about barbie…it was good,2023-08-08 22:16:48
"comedy was pretty good and ryan gosling carried hard however the message feels extremely confused here the film very obviously tries to express topics such as feminism patriarchy power and gender roles however i feel like the way these themes are addressed is strange

ken somehow single handedly brainwashed everyone in barbieland with some books which created kens kingdom essentially the male mirror to barbie land the barbies serve a similar role to what the kens originally did they seemed to be pretty happy with what was happening but didnt seem to have free will similar to the kens in the original barbie land

instead of the film actually exploring the issues in a patriarchy it just boils the entire thing down to the kens doing manly stuff like having trucks horses and beers it attempts to make a parallel to how things originally were when the barbies were in charge and every night was girls night but now with kens patriarchy every night is boys night however when the film concludes instead of going for something equal at the end they just opt to go back to the matriarchal version of barbieland with the kens eventually getting more equal if the barbies feel like it just like women in the real world

why do they even do this the whole point of feminism is for women to be equal to men not to create a female dominated society where the kens are goofy muscleheads who cant do anything if barbie land is just the female version of kens kingdom then why does the show portray one as right and the other as wrong why not settle for something equal  i know it is supposed to mirror real life and reverse the gender roles on feminism movements but still i feel like this was unessesary

my other issue was that the film very casually brushes over and glorifies what is essentially emotional manipulation like one of the main plans that happens is for the barbies to lead one ken on then during an intimate moment start texting another ken to make them angry and to manipulate them to fight each other so they dont get to vote the next day and the film fully endorses this and its seen as a good thing to do yay great lesson for the kids to learn

overall i liked the movie but i feel like it would have been better if it was less serious and calmed down on the social aspects this whole movie feels like they started writing a script about barbie entering the real world but then they decided to add  the patriarchy in there as well but they didnt implement it well at all",2023-07-21 15:01:27
am i the only one who hated the movie the jokes were so childish the real world emotions that barbie felt were filmed in such a stereotypical way and they made everything too over the top the whole thing basically was just like oh the patriarchy is bad  no  but it didnt make any efforts to go further than that i just feel like greta ie little women is much better at storytelling than this i dont know maybe im just miserable,2023-07-21 14:41:37
"i felt like the movie was such a missed opportunity to deliver a great message because it failed in its execution  


ryan gosling absolutely stole the show as ken and i found his arc and character much more interesting compared to barbie and wish we had gotten a longer and deeper look into kens psyche and the relationship between barbies and kens also felt the films resolution went by too quickly and couldve been improved with more nuance into the more sinister aspects of patriarchy  


instead the movie got too heavyhanded with the messaging and missed the boat on showing instead of telling that entire speech on patriarchy while absolutely correct will still not land as well as great grewig mightve hoped which ultimately is a problem  


a little more subtlety and nuance wouldve gone a long way into making this a much better film and landing its core message better",2023-07-23 15:00:40
"i found it really average  would give it 610 my friend and i left the theater agreeing that it was fun but we wouldnt go see it again 

i thought it was funny for the most part but im not seeing where or how it touched so many people to see reviews saying they cried or barbie nailed how it felt to be a woman was weird cuz i didnt feel that way at all as a woman i also dont get the praise for america ferreras characteri feel like they didnt flesh her out at all or her daughter they dont explain why shes having thoughts of death and depression they kind of brush it off with her saying shes weird and dark but those sound kind of serious so i thought there would be a story there even her daughter they introduce her as this queen of mean that barbie is warned about but never follow up on that so i guess shes just mean because shes a teenager like the characters have no motivation they are just plot devices so barbie interacts in the human world and so they can help deprogram the other barbies 

then honestly it wasnt super woke i will say it got awkward and too on the nose somewhere in the middle it just became word salad about patriarchy and being a women it made me roll my eyes i think they were already hitting on the point by being funny and just telling the story like earlier in the movie even so i wouldnt describe it as this feminist weapon against men just slightly annoying with the not subtle social commentary then the rest of the movie is just for laughs my favorite character was ken honestly ryan gosling nailed the role and made the movie entertaining margot robbie was great too but again too many on the nose scenes with her",2023-07-24 23:42:29
this probably is not a popular opinion i guess but i was somewhat disappointed with the movie i went in knowing it would be a fun and feminist movie but i couldnt connect with the movie it felt messy the mother daughter duo were just introduced there was no time spent on developing their characters or making them familiar to the audience i honestly dont know what their purpose was when the mom gave that speech it felt very generic and not very genuine idk i had so many questions why was the mother depressed  did the kens put a spell on the barbies how did the speech break the spell  because for barbies all these real world women trouble would be completely foreign i get what they were trying to show i guess but felt it was all over the place ryan gosling stole the show margot was amazing as well but i feel like she shouldve delivered the main dialogue because the americas delivery wasnt very impactful i guess margot couldve delivered the hard hitting emotional dialogues better imo please tell me im not the only one  barbie being gretas movie i was looking forward to it because i really liked her previous 2 movies that i watched which portrayed feminism in a subtle but very powerful way this seemed like a big miss to me but the sets and everything was amazing it was a good fun watch i guess,2023-08-03 08:32:43

"incredibly convoluted

the message of empowering women was so incredibly on the nose and preachy that i started to think it was a satire of a satire perhaps i gave gerwig and baumbach too much credit because even when analyzed two levels deep the message is still so unclear and confusing

gerwig has already written incredibly personal stories that place the viewers into the characters shoes before barbie feels so much more distant compared to characters from lady bird and little women this film has way too much telling and no showing it’s sad because gerwig has already proven that she can make a personal subjective experience with previous films

"i think this movie offers a delightful fantasy experience with its clever satire attention to detail and intriguing outer and inner story arcs while the second act had some flaws and occasional pacing issues overall the movie succeeds in captivating both teen and adult audiences alike the portrayal of barbies selfdiscovery journey and the message of acceptance and empathy resonate well despite a few minor drawbacks the movie manages to keep viewers entertained throughout its a refreshing take on the iconic character reminding us of the importance of embracing lifes complexities and finding beauty in both its highs and lows

there’s one line in the movie that i didn’t catch that i have been thinking about recently that specific line was said by the voiceover which i think was helen mirren  that mentioned something about margot robbie as an actress was it something about the decision of casting robbie as “the perfect barbie” i can’t really tell i think it was in the second act but i might be wrong did any of you guys catch that line",2023-07-24 10:31:42

i just saw the movie and my opinion is that it is the opening paragraph to a very serious subject  women should be taken seriously at work any work be paid equally to men and be treated with respect  educate from the school level up that women and men can do many jobs equally  equal pay for equal jobs  i didnt like the movie much because the characters were too insipid but i applaud it for opening this conversation  now it needs to move on and become a serious subject,2023-12-20 17:03:03

i was dreading the movie maybe cause i’m a guy and i thought it was a complete kids movie and my gf wanted to watch it i ended up loving it more than everyone i went with did anyone else find it absolutely hilarious it highlighted some of the absurdities and tragedies of trying to find your place in society a lot was relatable and funny whether you’re a guy or a girl i’m pretty conservative and i loved it although i felt the ending didn’t add much to the movie,2023-07-23 21:11:04
had its moments but kind of lost focus by the second act there should have been something more with the mother and daughter but there wasnt part of it reminded me of the community episode with gi joe which handled the existential stuff a bit better,2023-07-23 22:50:53

this film wouldn’t have been as good as it is if greta gerwig wasn’t behind it her versatile filmmaking gave her the sensibilities needed to both fulfill and subvert audience expectations the film’s hilarious but it also has a solid message within even if it comes off as preachy at times margot robbie and ryan gosling are just the perfect pair wish that more big companies will let filmmakers give their creative spins on different existing ips,2023-07-29 00:57:56
"im pretty surprised by how bad it was great sets great costume design but ultimately a very compromised and thematically incoherent film ryan gosling may have been the best actor in the movie but his acting was ultimately onenote

i think there are elements of the movie that could have made for something great the subtext of the opening homage to 2001 is that barbie was not only a product of the  revolution but someone who helped usher it in young girls moms are portrayed as playing with baby dolls only to smash them when a giant margot robbie appears beautiful sexy and more free with her body the scene efficiently communicates that the pill allowed barbie to shape beauty standards but also who women could aspire to be the rub of course is that barbie ended up reifying new patriarchal expectations of women that the film ends with her saying im here for my gynecologist shows that the effect of women being able to control their reproductive health is on gerwigs mind the movie unfortunately is just not as interesting when it communicates its ideas through dialogue it cant follow through with what it sets up in that opening minute

i found that the movies pivotal scene—america ferreras speech about the double standards women face—to be poorly acted and written like a tiktoker plagiarizing a twitter thread that was published in those halcyon days when we thought hilary clinton would beat donald trump it was cliched unconvincing and hollow much like the dialogue between ferrera and her daughter my fiancée and i couldnt believe that gerwig wrote such a false motherdaughter relationship when lady bird opened with one of 2010s greatest scenes we were also baffled by the films resolution in barbie land

particularly with a trans actress like hari nef cast one would think that gerwig would be more interested in challenging gender roles the happy ending in barbie land undercuts whatever she tried to say barbie land as a matriarchy is of course supposed to make men reflect on how women can feel boxed in under a patriarchal system but the film happily concludes with women having much more power than men acting just as oppressive as men in the real world were the movie thematically coherent if it actually had something to say beyond platitudes it would show a world where men and women live in a society where things are equal i dont know what that would look like but it would be far more interesting to see what gerwig thinks is possible in a movie with sets as fantastic as this instead of one that is dully like our own

im very disappointed in this movie and gerwigs future work makes me sad for the state of the industry id much rather her make grounded honest films like lady bird with solid budgets than subversive adaptations of corporate ip barbie today netflixs the lion the witch and the wardrobe tomorrow it is a long march through movies that are marketed towards adults but which have all the complexity of tossed off childrens novels",2023-07-21 04:18:39
it was funny and the meta commentary on the product was pretty great the jokes hit pretty hard and the visuals were striking the film was very unique and i appreciate that it was a bit overly political for me but mileage will vary in that regard well made better than average movie and it was better than hasbros summer toy selling film,2023-07-21 11:44:59

"i did not like this at all even as a woman i could not vibe at all with barbie i thought the commentary was very on the nose and incredibly shallow the commentary was very black and white with no moral grayness i have seen so many films that have handled these themes so much better than what was seen in barbie 

honestly i think the main message of the movie was dont be a simp",2023-07-21 04:25:11
"this movie didnt land for me really at all  i loved margot robbie and ryan gosling as barbie and ken  there were a few genuinely funny moments as well  unfortunately i felt that the movie tried to wrap very serious feminism ideals in a bubblegum pink comedic wrapping and it just doesnt mesh well  additionally the main message of this movie seems to be that men are keeping women down and that women can empower themselves by manipulating men  i like to think that im prowomen but this felt like it went a bit too far 

im willing to concede that as a man this movie probably isnt really intended for me so take my criticisms with a grain of salt",2023-07-21 06:51:34

the whole lesson at the end about how you should be a human instead of conforming to societys expectations of a barbie or ken was surprisingly thoughtprovoking 

anyway id recommend this movie it was very funny i loved michael cera as allan",2023-07-23 18:23:05
"there are so many parallels between the barbie movie and the matrix movies

barbie is actually neo

there were other characters that are an homage to morpheus the oracle agent smith cypher the architect just to name a few 

i think particularly one scene that stuck out the most from the matrix was when the oracle points to a sign hanging on the wall that reads “know thyself” in latin and much of the barbie movie seems to center around this theme 

there have been many iterations of the matrix as we know from the conversation between neo and the architect 

the first matrix designed by the architect was perfect but it’s doom was inevitable just like the first iteration of barbieland barbie inevitably becomes depressed barbie and the whole world comes crashing down

the second matrix was based off human history to accurately depict human nature rife human hubris the proposed kenland which also fails

the answer to a subsequent matrix was “stumbled upon by another a more intuitive program… to investigate aspects of the human psyche” where the subjects in the matrix accepted the matrix if they were given a choice

this movie was everything i hoped for perfectly written to both expect tropes and subvert them perfectly cast produced directed acted the effects and all design was on point but i’m struggling to grasp the point other than astute observations of humanity it felt like the movie had a lot to say without tying it all together if someone could enlighten me i’d appreciate it i saw all of the worst of humanity in every aspect of this movie but i saw no solution and maybe that’s the point that everyone is driven by human banalities and have to make the best of there situation and grow along the way,2023-09-22 07:49:16

"greta gerwig’s barbie is the perfect concoction of summer blockbuster and satire which goes through a hilarious tale about a barbie who believes herself and existence to have solved the woes of women but enters the real world to see otherwise the shock and the satire create for a fun filled ride along the way

the most beautiful part about this movie is that it never takes itself seriously there is not a more than two minute sequence that takes itself serious it’s the perfect comedy that acknowledges many of the flaws of the society we have built it’s inequalities consumerism capitalism sexism and more

i truly appreciated that the point of the movie doesn’t end up that patriarchy is bad as someone may expect with how barbie understands the real world the movie moves onto show ken recreating a patriarchal world in barbieland which stems from him feeling oppressed and living in the shadow of barbie there is a necessary discourse laced with the right amount of fun satire through ken’s journey he is always in the shadow and his existence has no meaning without barbie which he deserves to change everyone has that right to be themselves and as a society we should thrive to create a world which is moving towards such equality but as with everything this takes time the movie acknowledges this reality in a beautiful way towards the end saying hopefully the status of ken’s will come equal to that of women in the real world the smart dialogue which packages the satire and the themes of the story truly helps it

the movie deals with the idea of dominance and the film wraps this idea with a story that shows you why we should move away from someone having the upper hand this is all topped off by the literal ending i loved how meta this movie got given to barbie where it shows that we truly can be what we want to be the movie does this all in a tone that at times feels like i am navigating through reli5 rather than in a movie regardless the move has some layered writing with witty dialogues and satire it doesn’t try to change the world but show the world as it is for the most part though the overarching narrative does nudge us towards progress for creating an equal and happy society

the world of the film is beautiful greta gerwig excelled in creating this world of barbieland and how they represented mattel was thoroughly surprised by the level of criticism they got away with giving kind of shocked me the colors popped as much as we wished it too but i was a little worried about whether the hot pinks and bright colors would get too much but surprisingly never had that issue i was  into the world and had fun every second didn’t even remember that i brought snacks to eat the board room design was also really fun and had me laughing at how the board members operated loved will ferrell in that role

the soundtrack of this movie is unexpectedly good i loved every second of the song they broke into in between the ken war they didn’t miss the writing even in song i can’t help but remember the lady behind me in the theater who couldn’t stop laughing i was waiting for the it’s a barbie girl song and was so sad i needed to wait til the credits but happy it finally arrived my mom who listens to little western music came home and asked me to play the songs which is a great sign

honestly need to talk about the performances margot robbie was barbie i can’t say anything more the movie says it well with a note by the narrator honestly calling out the irony considering margot robbie ryan gosling have one of his best performances as ken never even thought this would happen i was surprised by the amount of weight his character had i was mad that i didn’t know michael cera was in the movie and was so happy and loved every second of him as alan makes sense that i wasn’t aware of his presence in the film will ferrell is a legend and he has little screen time but kills it with what he has america ferreira was just great as a mom who is just leading a plain life but wants something representing her as the most common kind of person i loved her venting which brought the kenstruck barbies back to their senses it’s my head canon that it was improv as well so many great performances a sign of a fantastically made film which is all i expect from greta gerwig

overall it is a well made summer film that surprised you with some great satire and fun it was a great movie to watch with my family and have fun together with characters and themes that stay with you",2023-07-24 03:59:21
no one knew what greta gerwig was going to do with barbie and in the end she did everything in the good way best way i can sum up the movie is barbie finds herself movie starts with how youd expect a generic movie would solve this premise fish outta water road trip but sure enough it evolves into something much more emotional,2023-07-24 18:11:54
"i thought there were fun elements to the movie but overall the story and execution were a little off throughout  judging from my theater which was packed i’d say most felt the same also  not a lot of big crowd reactions as i had hoped  

it kind of reminded me of elf just not as well done",2023-07-25 04:26:59

"warning many spoilers

i really really wanted to like this movie im a big fan of barbie and fashion dolls in general i make ooak dolls and theres been so much hype in the doll community about this but i spent most of it just disappointed

first some positives theres so much attention to detail in regards to set accuracy and barbie history the obnoxious neon rollerskates were so perfect the fridge being filled with stickers was so funny the way barbie brushed her hair and teeth was a great visual gag all the costumes and many props are based off real barbie items and some of them are very obscure it was fun looking at all the eye candy 

the barbie and ken lineups were beautifully diverse although people usually picture barbies as blonde nowadays theres a huge range of body types heights and skin colors and it was great seeing that recognized

and there were some genuinely funny moments alans moment in the spotlight the nods to discontinued dolls and the entire concept of weird barbie were great

also wow a lot of the actors were giving 100 and it shows 

however pretty much everything i liked were related to sets costumes and references  mostly cosmetic and im upset about that because dangit i really wanted to like this

so the movie sets up the barbie world as very unrealistic overly idealized and silly as it should be but the real world is equally silly there needed to be a strong contrast between the idealistic perpetually perfect world of barbie and the real world but there isnt aside from colors they did a great job on that the mattel employees are like a parody tickle fights but the barbie world itself is already a parody 

the real people dont really have any logical character growth or motivations the teenaged daughter hates her mom so her mom is thinking about death why and how does it get resolved we never see them even talk it out its just suddenly fixed at the end 

and now the big message this is meant to be a feminist movie the thing is feminism is not about women being above men and taking over everything yes the patriarchy is real and a problem but the problem is simply reversed in barbieland  and even in that idealistic world they cant find a solution that involves equality heck ken is supposed to be funny for feeling dissatisfied that he doesnt have a house hes not allowed to have any career or that his own girlfriend treats him like an inconvenience those are big issues and it makes sense he feels unhappy but none of these issues are solved at the end the barbies just celebrate that they took back the power and the kens have basically nothing again

speaking of ken he just wasnt likeable ryan gosling was giving it his all but the character just went from pathetic to obnoxious and back to pathetic his musical number was great though honestly pixar handled kens character better in toy story 3 he should be barbies unwaveringly dedicated supporter satisfied to do nothing but adore his beautiful girlfriend and she should actually like him she doesnt seem to in this movie 

i think they could have handled the barbie world in a funny satirical way while still respecting and developing the established canon that people enjoy and i think they could have also made powerful commentary on lack of equality in the real world while still having a barbiecentered plot unfortunately this movie didnt accomplish either and im sad about it",2023-07-22 12:54:16
it is interesting to see how people with not a favorable opinion of the movie are getting downvoted into oblivion,2023-07-22 23:16:18
"honest thoughts i think i made a mistake watching this a day after oppenheimer oppenheimer is in a higher tier artistically and was much impactful and made it more difficult to take in barbie

id give barbie a 65

cons
 i found it hard to parse the point or message of the movie felt like there was a couple conflicting lines that were competing for each other
 margot robbie was a bit flat in the movie even when she was supposed to be sentimental and feeling it didnt  necessarily hit although maybe this was by design 
 not sure what several parts of the outside world added to the movie what did will ferrels character actually contribute to the film he was hardly a villain or ferreras daughter beyond a half scene
 brief cameos didnt really add to the movie and the movie was overmarketed which i think is skewing reviews

pros
 set and costumes 1010 great take on the barbie world
 music and sound 1010 the musical scenes were great and i think greta can tackle a full on musical 
 ensemble cast generally did great standouts are weird barbie the 2 main kens and allen
 hysterical moments in between especially in the kendom part 

id recommend watching barbie before oppenheimer and with at least a couple days before watching it id recommend this as part of a cultural event but i dont think itll have much replay value",2023-07-23 16:35:24
"its pretty funny how all of the films supposed subversive stuff is just milquetoast mid 2010s social commentary thats been showcased endlessly in all major media for the past decade meanwhile the only character with an actual arc and the one who gets all the big moments is just ken 

if people think the ridiculous culture war around this movie is bad now just wait for the awards season when gosling is the only one getting any attention",2023-07-23 16:56:03

"this film has been in the works since 2009 and given its time in the works and the brilliant marketing of this movies release i couldnt believe how unfinished and underdeveloped the screenplay felt it felt more like a film centred on a draft rather than a final version there were some scenes and jokes that were brilliant however the screenwriters insisted on taking on too many complex themes at once leaving them unsatisfactority explored and left the plot feeling jumbled in trying to keep up with them at times

the exploration and conclusion of the existentialism theme felt criminally baselevel given how hyped this element of the story was i could perhaps have been more satisifed with the conclusion of this theme had the philosophical assertions been explored to a greater degree but if anything i felt sad for barbie that she felt forced to leave behind an eternity of joyous contentment for an ephemeral life emburdened with struggle its a complicated subject to tackle  i feel screenwriters set themselves up for a near impossible task taking on existentialism as one of the main themes while also heavily leaning into other complex themes like gender struggle and consumerism all while remaining playful and lighthearted this theme didn’t even necessarily need a conclusion acknowledgement throughout the screenplay of it’s impact on humans would have worked better for me than the attempt to consolidate the harsh realities of human existence the film just isn’t ‘deep’ enough to tackle that and that’s fine it’s barbie i don’t expect to leave with any philosophical awakening simply relating and feeling affirmed in my human emotion would have been enough

probably the most fleshedout theme in the whole story was gender struggle barbie felt like the perfect opportunity to explore this theme in a campy and fun and clever way and they achieved this excellently throughout the plot however the writers were evidently not confident in the audiences critical thinking capabilities when it comes to extracting and discussing this messaging from the screenplay without any spoonfed lecturing im a feminist and resonate with much of the struggles portrayed but i couldnt help but feel the movie took itself a bit too seriously in delivery at times when it would have been far more effective to simply playfully explore this powerstruggle i cant help but feel they ruined it by spoonfeeding what was already clearly substantiated by the screenplay alone 

gloria and sashas relationship were grossly underdeveloped sasha was completely unlikeable and seemed to treat her mother and everyone around her like garbage for no explicable reason had we had some insight on her own struggle with mental health teenage angst and struggle navigating the appropriate level of assertiveness for each social situation this could have helped however her backstory is glossed over entirely gloria was more likeable and we get more insight into her struggles than sashas however she also fell a bit flat for me she struggles with complex feelings that the film simply did not have the time to explore and for me the overall lack of emotional intimacy with her as a character made it difficult to feel invested in her arc

mattel and their place in the story also felt like a glaring afterthought for screenwriters aside from acting as a gateway for gloria and barbies eventual reunion and maybe a few comedic jabs at patriarchy and capitalism they served very little to the plot and wasted critical time

even barbieland controversially it seems felt quite underdeveloped as a concept the map was tiny and yet it is implied that every barbieland barbie has a realworld owner are the majority of owned barbies simply not represented in barbieland perhaps i’m being a bit pedantic here…i did really enjoy the the set design and costumes however also found the casting was brilliant i enjoyed ken’s incel arc and his misguided hyperfixation on horses and overall the film was enjoyable but not as iconic and timeless as i had hoped it would be

edited punctuation and grammar",2023-07-24 14:20:56
"thoroughly enjoyed the first act but as the film went on it got worse and worse for my tastes

the premise is wonderful that this idea of a utopian barbieland of plastic feminism is actually dystopian so to actually empower women you need to go to the real world and learn to deal with the fear of change in life depression motherdaughter relationships fear of ageing etc its classical bildungsroman with a very contemporary injection of perspectives all of that was really good and shows how you can be whimsical but still tackle mature themes

but then the film nosedives into disappointment the mother and daughter relationship arc just gets abandoned without proper development the barbies tactic of fixing barbieland is by having them act out the worst type of stereotypically female emotional manipulation on the kens and the endstate of barbieland is just a revert back to the plastic hyperfeminist dystopian dreamland where you wake up and do the same thing every day the only characters that get liberated are stereotypical barbie and very marginally goslingken who no longer has the singular identity of beach but hes still homeless have we not learnt anything after 2 hours of very blatant gender politics exploration

and then that whole pinocchio ending just happens the barbie dreamhouse tv show is so much better than this disappointment",2023-07-26 05:02:28
"im surprised so many people find the movie misandrist in fact it says a lot about how we are still so far from a fair society its only misandrist because it focuses in women and its role as part of a society without any real love story behind them i guess chick flicks are only acceptable if theres some male love interest they fall high heels for pun intended
if anything i think it was more of an attack on how childhood magic is used to manipulate both girls and boys

anyway i found the movie incredibly smart every single frame had some kind of thought or concept behind it it was so layered honestly one of the most brainy movies out there to the point where it could be too much i did not enjoy the packaging for those layers though the action itself and the story was kind of boring",2023-07-26 20:45:17
"this movie was a little too meta for me it makes it hard to tell what the stakes are if you dont have any understanding of whats possible i know i shouldnt take it that seriously but it is about serious topics i also understand everyones problem with the last act the worst part is when the little girl goes what does barbie get as an extremely unnatural way to set up barbie themestating to the audience it reminds me of lines in poorly written musicals where you set up a song by asking a character how he feels 

ryan gosling looks old for this hes only 42 but he does stand out among a crowd of guys in their early 30s it felt to me like his story was a womans view of what masculinity is beer and muscle cars i get but horses are horses supposed to be a man thing they can be but they can just as easily be for girls 

what even is a boyfriend in barbieland ken doesnt get to sleep over and barbie never kisses him how is his relationship with her any different from her relationship to the other kens 

closer to fine vs push i like push a lot but this movie sure doesnt this movie would have been worth seeing just to watch ryan gosling do his rob thomas impression does anybody anyway heres wonderwall push is that a thing i guess its easy enough to play they sang closer to fine like four times in this movie and nobody ever tried to do the low split that was very unsatisfying 

i liked how the opening lizzo song changed lyrics when barbie started going wrong otherwise the original music does not do anything for me especially the ken one  

one direction they could have taken this that they shouldnt have but its funny to think about is the barbies realizing that their jobs are fake doctor barbie doesnt actually heal ken or have any medical knowledge shes just a doctor to show girls in real world they can become a doctor they live in a world where nobody actually needs to do work another thought i had that im sure im not alone in thinking is that nobody acted concerned that a strange pink cowboy woman was walking into a middle school and acting way too friendly with a random student i feel like the reaction would be less barbie is sexist and more this woman is a creep 

my favorite jokes

 all the physical comedy in the first part with barbie drinking from empty cups the fridge being a sticker the pools being solid etc

 ken being exposed to masculinity by going up an escalator in century city and seeing a giant screen display of bill clinton

 the two times in the movie they mention genitalia

 nobody whose feet are shaped this way should wear these

 i have a jewish friend",2023-07-29 09:30:48
"barbie’s trailer and all the promotions were pointing in directions of it bra comedy and a goofy movie with barbie and ken struggling to adapt with the human ways and find there way home


but in reality everything was rushed and no character had any development and even the plot had mo plot it was kinda of a message

the idea behind the movie what i took was that no single authority is good for the society and ppl coz if only one type of ppl govern the ppl that have been left out don’t feel a part of their own land

will ferrell and ryan gosling were the only funny bit in the movie

the movie didn’t need to say women men every 10 seconds coz it was getting annoying 

i really was excited to to see greta being a fan of her work and being one of my favourite directors whose movie i would watch no questions asked was kinda of a disappointment

i would say it was  a 610with margot being 1010 and ryan being 1010 and the plot being 310",2023-08-10 15:25:46
"i can see the real world bits being a drag for some people but i love that ken spent 5 minutes in it and decided the patriarchy was cool thats  hilarious to me and totally makes sense with how sad ken is but its delivered with the perfect amount of wimpiness but a kind of vulnerability or maybe i just love ryan gosling thats a strong possibility

and i think robbie did manage to nail what was needed from barbie in a movie where she kind of has to react to the weirder world around her while also explaining her naive worldview she also nailed the silly bits of literally rolling on the ground too 

and i do love that skipper escaped before the execs know about barbieland and know that the ghost of ruth lives on the 14th floor theres some weird toy story x men in black movie i kind of want to see there 

i would love a mojo dojo casa house for christmas or that ken hoodie im not picky",2023-07-21 04:13:21
"gonna preface this by saying i think ladybird is an excellent film and little women is one of my favorite movies of all time possibly top 5 so i was always planning on watching barbie on premiere night before the crazy marketing or oppenheimer memes even were a thing

it fell a little flat for me i liked the movie overall but its like a 75 for me i think the overall message was great the actors for the most part did a great job with standouts obviously being gosling and robbie their imagination for the sets was outstanding every one looked better than the other music was great greta gerwig directed the  out of every shot and i loved her dialogue as always but it didnt have the it factor of little women for me

america ferreras speech was a nice moment but it doesnt even begin to come close to jos speech about being lonely or lauries proposal or amys speech about marriage being an economic proposition

the mattel subplot really didnt need to be extended to barbieland the scenes with ruth didnt really impact me except the mothers stand still so their daughter can see how far theyve come line

again by no means im saying it was a bad movie it was a very good movie that just fell short of being a great one by not quite striking the balance between pop culture silliness and genuine sentimentality",2023-07-21 04:19:42
i really liked it but…i laughed way harder in jenner lawrence’s no hard feelings—so  funny,2023-07-21 04:40:38
"ryan gosling does a really good rob thomas impression when hes singing that matchbox 20 song its criminal that his version doesnt seem to be on the soundtrack

also i dont really know how i feel about the resolution to the movie basically being to make the kens back into second class citizens theyre basically all canonically homeless like i thought theyd go for a more wow its  to have to be like that type of thing but i guess its less funny to take that angle",2023-07-21 05:26:42

the ending “joke” of barbie really reminded me of the “muh ” south park bit,2023-07-25 07:13:51
"i loved this movie it did a very challenging thing combining genuinely funny surreal and existential moments with having a message about empowerment and identity while also pushing a corporate mythology about a much beloved toy i could have done with less of the last bit but when you’re making a big budget movie with a licensed product you’re beholden to the product’s masters and you have to give a little i actually credit mattel for allowing someone to take such a weird swing

i had a question that i’d like some opinions on when ken sings the “i’m just ken song are we to take it as an expression of someone having selfworth but they feel crushed by a system that keeps them as an appendage the barbies — like if the situation was in the real world this would be a woman singing a song about how she is trapped by the patriarchy and feels like she has so much more to offer the world than superficial things 

or was the song a statement of male power in support of continuing the patriarchal system that ken imported from the real world in the moment is ken asking to be appreciated for who he is or is he boastful and egotistical 

i know that’s crazy to fixate on but i couldn’t get the question out of my head after seeing the movie last night",2023-07-25 17:03:18

having to just imagine a world where kens are treated as unequally as women is so horrible we are going to rage against this movie 

these dudes can’t even tolerate imagining being in a world where they are a secondclass citizen a reality tons of people actually live

and the hilarious thing is that the kens are literally given the exact same amount of equality in this movie as actual women in the real world by definition",2023-07-30 16:21:02
"that movie was a great premise ruined by pretention really funny laughs and some good heart at the end but it was such an aggressively antimale movie at its core i dont mind positive girl power but this was actively antimen ideally it wouldve needed with kendom and barbieland uniting into a symbiotic world but instead decided that all men are bad was the right message to send

idk man i had high hopes but this movie was just not want it was advertised to be",2023-07-21 03:26:02
"i wanted this to be better than it was first 30 minutes was very strong but it kinda falls off past that didnt care for the really long ken musical scene a lot of the feminist messaging was a bit tell dont show and i thought it could have been fleshed out better didnt really feel like barbie herself had a strong character arc her decision in the end didnt really feel like a satisfying resolution

aesthetically fun but under the hood its kind of a less compelling version of legally blonde which i think carries a similar aesthetic but has a more interestingcompelling feminist message",2023-07-23 22:52:57
"is it wrong for me to say  despite all the messages about women empowerment and stuff 

ken absolutely stole the show they were hilarious ryan gosling was having a ton of fun the battle on the beach was hilarious it gave me strong zoolander vibes

it was okay most of the time i am surprised that ryan gosling made the movie more watchable than it was icb mattel is depicted as sort of the good guys at all but yeah not much you can do with a sponsored movie it kinda let me down but i also liked it in parts im not sure pretty mixed reaction bc i genuinely absolutely wanted to love this movie with all my heart,2023-07-22 07:01:46
so many of these comments sound like bots its ridiculous,2023-07-22 07:55:46
when you think about it everything about the plot is driven forward by ken not barbie barbie leaves barbieland because she gets told ken leaves because he wants to barbie returns to keep the status quo ken returns to change it barbie then has a emotional meltdown and other womenbarbies have to take over in the final act of the movie ken even gets the big fightmusical number scene the only moment in the movie barbie shows any agency over her own destiny is when she chooses not to go back into the box and runs away from mattel but that doesnt change the course of the movie either because she still ends up back in barbieland all the same idk i was ready for the biggest girl power movie in 2023 but this felt so unsatisfying,2023-07-22 18:04:39

loved ryan goslings performance he really made the movie for me  margot robbie was born to play this role both physically and personality wise the sets were great and for being a barbie movie which in 90 of chances could have gone really cheesy this was spectacularly done",2023-07-22 20:12:38
"just got out of the theatre what a terrific movie exceeded my expectation by miles heavy yet crucial message for the society at the end as well

ryan gosling was amazing i didnt know he could be like that tbh haha his character is hilarious engaging and the one i enjoy the most

fastpaced yet it doesnt feels rushed blood rushed throughout the movie by how vibrant and festive the atmosphere is ngl the dances the songs and the dialogues are very enjoyable which a surprise since i mostly cringe during dance scene

some characters might feel meh like will farell couldve a better character but all in all doesnt bother me a bit

910 deserves the hype great moral and perfect acting",2023-07-23 10:15:31

"saw with my blonde barbie girlfriend after watching oppenheimer was really fun i dont think its a film that requires a lot of analysis or a lot of viewings to understand everything it was very forward with its point and delivered it really well with comedy

people dont like how the kens were portrayed but half the point at least is that women are presented as 1 dimensional clueless hot things for likeall of western civilization so it kind of blows my mind we cant let them have a couple of movies where they do that to mentheres lots of feminists media ive seen where i agree with the point but they do it so badly and in such an unfunny way that i immediately cringe 

unfortunately thats been most feminist media for mebarbie hit different though because it didnt try to hide and when it did spill it out in your face it wasnt deceptive about it at all and because of the tone of the movie it worked plus it was justfunnythe end of the movie with the older lady was a lil too preachy for me but heck it did fit and im sure a lot of people liked how it made them feel",2023-07-25 12:03:17
"finished the movie and i can say this is the most surprising movie of the year loved the movie 

greta really did a great job in balancing the emotional scenes as well as the comedic ones i was surprised that there were some emotional scenes in the movie but hey not only were they there but they were well done the scene at the bus stop where barbie looks at the old woman was just beautiful the jokes in addition were well written and the scenes were not just filled with  jokes like how we saw in thor lt  was great to see a movie with jokes and fun considering how all the recent movies were all action and stuff 

the cast was perfect margot robbie as barbie was a incredible choice that 4th wall break about her was well done and smart ryan gosling as ken was justperfect he and simu lui killed their role  micheal cera as allan was great he wasnt used too much or too less but the perfect amount 

the plot was well a bit thin but was well executed with good pacing however the ending scene between barbie and the founder could be cut by a min or two in contrast the ken war has to be one of the best comedic musical scenes hollywood has come out with that was just incredible to watch in the big screen the set was just beautiful  

well done and executed on all levels good pacing and great jokes good movie however i can see some people finding it bland or not good

i don’t know i guess after the hype i expected more",2023-08-07 01:01:42
it was alright but nothing special the message was ok but also pretty basic judging by other online reviews the people who need to hear the message the most are the same ones who are going to see the movie and miss the point anyway lol the bright colors were a nice hit of dopamine at least,2023-08-11 18:22:23
"while the plot flounders a bit and i agree that the will ferrellceo thing was superfluous and didnt really add anything i think rather than criticize i would like to credit gerwig for accomplishing more as a director for the feminist movement with this one movie than has been accomplished in 30 years

in summary  what barbie successfully does in my opinion through the great power of social satire is illuminate the fact that men are not even capable of the great subterfuge historically attributed to them  the movie holds a lens up to that fact that in seeking the enemy it is perhaps not men but women themselves who give continue to give away their power by playing into objectification   

robbie and gosling play their roles with just the right balance of humor and cultural awareness  have always loved gosling who has the courage to laugh at himself and all kens and steals the show  rather than laugh and talk about how funny it was and how on point which it absolutely was i hope it reminds women to choose not to conform or be objectified every day  the indicator of great art is that it stimulates discussion",2023-08-16 20:07:26
"finally watched last night slept on it read some reviews and now ive come to the conclusion that this movie was just a money grab a giant advertisement which skewed decisions being made with its creation they had an ending in their mind and worked backwards to make that ending possible 

the real world is just as ridiculous as the barbie world and must be set in some other world besides earth maybe its supposed to be created how a child sees the world at a young age possibly but will ferrell needing a key card for the gate just lost me worst way possible to fill a plot hole 

overall if you put real world realities aside and see that this barbie movie is strictly between barbie and gloria america ferreras character it doesnt have to be a perfect fit for your own perceptions gloria has a dark side which comes out with her drawings of barbie watching the movie through her characters eyes does make this experience a bit more enjoyable 

sure there are feminist and sexist tones throughout but they were so ridiculous that it couldnt be what the movie was really trying to say its a story based on a doll created for women and they had to play the part anything else just wouldnt be true to the doll 

if you see this for what it is which i mentioned before as a giant advertisement you will enjoy the movie way more than if you try to compare it to your own life and perceptions",2023-11-19 19:00:12
loved this movie and didnt expect to laugh that much really appreciated the music singing and dance numbers and sets also whats the actual line something like long distance low maintenance casual girlfriend i died,2023-07-21 09:48:43
"very funny and very thoughtprovoking at the same time lots of visual jokes  i think one needs to watch the movie a second time to get them all i probably issed half of the references to horses

the main characters all have their own story arc even the minor characters were lovingly drawn and i got the impression that a lot of joy and love went into making this movie

not everything ends well but there is hope sometimes perfection does not exist not even in barbieworld 

i loved the scene in the kitchen where barbie meets her creator for the first time without knowing it

i can see it getting an oscar nomination for costume andor production design possibly for gosling as supporting actor maybe for the script as well",2023-07-21 14:55:45
i loved it thought it was hilarious as well as smart and stylish gosling made me laugh harder than any recent movie in memory especially the scene where he serenades her with the guitar ,2023-07-21 17:05:13

i really liked this movie as expected my kind of humor lots of cool ideas and just a great theater experience that said it didnt blow me out of the water id love to give it a 1010 but i dont think i can rank it more than an 810 they couldve really elevated the movie by cutting the whole will ferrell subplot which doesnt really have a big impact on the plot and replacing it with a deeper exploration of the main theme of gender equality the movie didnt fall into the old trap of making progressive statements about a topic while failing to actually integrate the topic into the plot in a coherent and significant way but i did feel it was a little lazy to have the patriarchy just kinda happen and then be resolved mainly through voting and a rousing speech especially considering how important the issue of gender quality was to the main plot,2023-07-25 13:59:15
"actually it isn’t the case that before barbie little girls played only with baby dolls  the vogue doll company sold a family of small dolls including the famous ginny doll she was about 7 years old ginny’s baby sister ginette ginny’s older sister jill a teenager jill’s best friend jan and jill’s brother jeff  jill jan and jeff had adult bodies although of course they lacked genitals  jill and jeff were billed as brother and sister hence not dating and it was sometimes hinted that jan was jeff’s girlfriend his prom date  

the vogue dolls and in particular the ginny doll had beautiful outfits made with attention to detail  

there was also a beautiful miniature adult doll manufactured by the ideal company called the revlon doll  she also came with a brassiere and  girdle and she also had nylon hose  she was essentially a fashion doll having the look of a welldressed young woman of the 1950s  many of the garments made for her were beautifully sewn  i think also that the revlon doll may have also come in a larger version  the miniature doll may have been a prototype for the larger doll  

my aunt gave me a revlon doll when i was about eight years old  my friend had a jill doll and i think a jeff doll too  there was no such doll as the barbie doll at that time  i think that barbie was first developed in 1959  

most dolls at that time were larger than the barbie doll for example a baby doll could be the size of a real baby  i think that small dolls like the vogue dolls the ideal dolls and the mattel dolls were relatively new on the market",2023-09-16 20:13:17
as a woman the barbie movie really didnt do it for me it screams of an overly simplified and whitewashed rainbows and butterflies portrait of feminism thats a far cry from reality in the real world racism and poverty are deeply intertwined with the struggle for gender equality the movie paints the picture that if women just stick together stay strong and have big dreams we can defeat the patriarchy but havent women been doing that already this whole time the fight against sexism looks vastly different for a disabled poor  woman of color vs a financially privileged able bodied white woman the movie has plenty of diversity but paints their struggles as all the same using them as little more than token minorities its quite patronizing but a lot of people will never be ready for that conversation it was cute and all and im always for female empowerment but it is not the feminist masterpiece people are praising it to be for such a woke movie it really wasnt very woke at all,2024-01-24 22:46:18

movie is both serious and unserious obviously you can’t expect zero “preachiness” in a movie centred on young girls going through an existential crisis and realising that the world of their youth is nothing like the real world but i like that they kept a lot of the goofiness that you’d expect from children playing with their dolls,2023-07-21 14:33:45

"barbie mansplaining music ken’s

i liked the scene in barbie where all the kens bore the barbies for hours with their heartfelt earnest guitar songs in order to show how much “depth” they have through their music it reminded me of the scene in la la land where ryan gosling’s character quite unironically mansplains jazz to emma stone do you think greta was having a bit of fun there at ryan’s expense any other hidden cross references you see in barbie",2023-08-06 15:12:21
ow my head hurts from being hit over the head so strongly by the message,2023-07-21 11:20:30
"i was rather disappointed i had higher expectations it did not live up to its potential with that cast it wasnt nearly funny enough ryan gosling overshadowed margot robbie who to be honest was the only reason i went to see it 

i think it went in and out of the double entendres and side humor too frequently it couldnt decide what it wanted to be i had hoped that it would be more like the 90s brady bunch movie which was near perfection it needed to be both lighter and darker

i think the feminist awakening and the male backlash were both a little too heavy i think it was a worthy issue and perspective to take head on but if they had kept it lighter the potential for humor would have been much greater

in one other area id like to compare it with the ghostbusters reboot which was a much better movie than its detractors maligned it as the female perspective was fine the problem was they were completely outclassed by chris hemsworth who owned every scene he was in similarly ryan completely outshone margot in this one and it became the ken movie margot needed to be let loose she need to bring a bit of harley and a bit of evil into the role

those are my main thoughts sorry my writing and expression arent better as i have difficult writing on mobile id give it 2 stars out of 4",2023-07-21 12:49:40
this was the funniest movie ive seen in years gosling had me in stitches,2023-07-21 02:20:22

i also genuinely think mattel giving the goahead to write their company as haha were so evil and capitalist lol and everyone eating it up is unironically so dystopianly evil and capitalist",2023-07-21 07:28:50
all i can say is i never expected a barbie movie out of all movies to make me cry feel like a little girl again experience all the feelings of womanhood and laugh my  off all at the same time this movie to me was a 1010 and both margot and ryan absolutely killed their roles it captured what being a woman feels like perfectly i’m definitely going to watch this movie at least 23 more times,2023-07-21 15:55:50
"my favorite thing about the barbie movie is it makes fun of the kens who can’t just live their lives without defining them based on barbie  
  
meanwhile in the real world there are hordes of fragile and triggered men who are seething uncontrollably about the barbie movie and cannot let it go they ironically are becoming the very kens that the movie was making fun of",2023-07-22 18:01:38
"a good humorous film weighed down by its excessive social commentary i knew it would tackle issues like feminism beauty standards and the patriarchy but i didnt realise how overbearing it would be at times it almost felt condescending dont take me wrong those issues should have been highlighted but a part of me wished we spent a little bit more time with barbie ken and their wacky adventures in the real world before moving onto that i still enjoyed it overall just wished there had been a bit more balancing between the two tones

as i predicted going into gosling was the best part of the film they couldnt have casted a better actor for the role",2023-07-22 19:04:07
not only was the movie extremely fun but it seemed to trigger all the right people an absolute win in my eyes,2023-07-23 00:31:51
"it was a decent movie the jokes were hardhitting and the movie itself was pleasing to the eyes but the message was a bit confusing i understand that the overarching message was something like be who you want to be but you cannot ignore the obvious  yes its mean to men 

i think one can make an argument that the treatment of kens is equivalent to women in real world but then why didnt it talk about matriarchy in the same light as patriarchy in the real world there is a sense of what equal rights and opportunities are about in barbieland kens lived in ignorance of their own rights throughout the movie kens were the butt of the joke and portrayed as just dumb

overall it was a movie i enjoyed but the flaws are obvious 610",2023-07-23 10:59:53
it didn’t live up to the hype for me i love little women and lady bird so much and had high expectations every time the script and plot leaned into the humanness of it all i loved it but then it would pull away and become silly again there should have been more about the motherdaughter and less about barbieland why were sasha and her mom trying to save barbie barbie is a toy and is fictional barbie should have been working to help the real world barbie should have been a vessel to explore motherdaughter relationships and the patriarchygender roles in the real world some of the movie was really funny but a lot of the humor was very meta it felt like you had to be in on the joke in order to get the joke i was so happy when i picked up on america ferrera’s husband saying “si se puede” millennials and anyone that grew up with disney channel would get it some humor went over my head ryan goslingken was the star of the show but is the takeaway of a movie about barbie supposed to be ken i did pick up on a lot of messages about men’s mental health which was thought provoking and unique i felt like the message was beat over my head and yet i still don’t understand the message…… maybe it means it’s a good movie since i’m still thinking about it…,2023-07-23 23:31:13
"i gotta say i was disappointed here is why

1 way too direct they directly state the feminism stuff instead of showing it come on guys use some subtlety mattel wanted it to be blatantly stated i imagine for marketing appearance

2 i venture to say that the barbies on the shelves are far less diverse than the cast most barbies are white i think mattel wanted their product to seem like they value diversity more than they do 

3 the casting of a plus size actress bothered me when in fact barbie does not have a doll that mirrors her body size i think it should but mattel does not make that they have curvy barbie which if translated to the real world probably would have a bmi well within the healthy range but is still like ideal placements for body mass like its all in the hips butt  shes got no belly and no love handles again i think mattel wanted to make it seem like their product reflects plus size body types when they actually never made a doll for that 

4 when i played with barbies i remember we would make them  each other and harm each other i guess they kinda alluded to that with weird barbie but i wouldve liked to see that more i think most little girls are not just having them participate in their careers and whatnot little girls are acting out their messed up inner thoughts with those toys for  exploration and violent urges 

5 the corporate execs were just kinda there again mattel didnt want it to go too far with the corporate dark side 

6 the whole issue with dolls and little girls playing with dolls and how that relates to the patriarchy is that the little girls are not stimulating those complex parts of their brains so even if you play with engineer barbie youre still just playing dolls youre not actively thinking through spatial patterns or building things with your hands that will later help you advance in science and math fields this was not addressed mattel give the kids like a puzzle to solve or something to build with their hands while they play with barbie and then pay me for the idea",2023-07-24 22:04:23
im not sure why some men are all up in arms not every story has to be relatable in my opinion im a guy and although the kens ultimately didnt win i found the movie to be incredibly charming meaningful and worthwhile i understand why people say the message was muddled but to me that represents the female experience perfectly and i thought robbieferrera explained that pretty well was it a 1010 no but i was smiling ear to ear i think the entire time,2023-07-22 16:17:14
" im kind of surprised at the amount of people who enjoyed it dont get me wrong it was fun to watch the acting costumes set and music were all incredible the story on the other hand made no flippin sense i was really disappointed when the movie turned into a boys vs girls i didnt understand why the writers chose to pivot away from the original plot of finding the girl who is sad and helping her to making ken the villain 

where it started to fall apart for me was when barbie finds sasha in the real world sasha makes a valid point that stereotypical barbie is an unrealistic example of a woman and puts too much pressure on little girls but the thing is that barbieland is filled with nonstereotypical barbies and none of the criticisms that sasha mentions are really addressed in the film the film just pivots to barbies vs kens and forgets the motherdaughter relationship it was trying to repair not to mention the ending made no sense

i think the movie would have been better if the focus was on that original problem that barbies dont look like every little girl or boy the film would have been better if at the start of the film every barbie was a stereotypical barbie and after barbie visits the real world experiences the sexism and misogyny and sees the undue pressures her image is causing if she somehow helped sasha accept herself or took her back to barbieland to help her change the stereotypical barbies into unique barbies the same plot of mattel trying to stop barbie could have been left in and in the end mattel could have seen that unique barbieskens were selling better than stereotypical ones thus advertising mattels actual changes to the barbie brand

but thats just me",2023-07-26 01:53:09

"without the ability to be truly critical of barbie this movie does not rise above an ad and the corporate goals made it a bloated mess

in the real world mattel bought a german callgirl doll named lilli made for pervy adult men and rebranded it barbie to cover for a very long controversial history this very mattel funded movie made cartoonish silly billy execs weirder than barbie to take the fall its a very clumsy and pointless other than pr addition  will farrel needs to catch barbie why

without this ad agenda complete with make sure it ends on a pro mattel message this could have been a great exploration of gender roles etc and not require a pile of extra characters and ghost saviors

its better than the usual brandfirst movies a bit weird there are barbie actresses with body types they dont actually sell but disappointing that it is very much in that genre",2023-07-21 22:05:07

"one of the funniest movies ive seen in recent memory

"i loved this movie  at times it’s very on the nose and i feel like people criticize that… but i think there’s a lot of value to that  they were very explicit about contradictions in what women should be because they wanted to be very explicit about those things  it’s deliberate and it’s funny still  i feel confused when people suggest the movie could have been more subtle  i didn’t expect anything about this movie to be subtle and i didn’t need it to be

i love how ken grew from a toxic masculine character to someone who realized he could be whatever he wanted to be too  i wish at the end he was running a ranch with a bunch of horses or something  that dance fight performance was incredible",2023-07-22 11:35:41
"excerpts from my letterboxd review

in journeying to the real world barbie not only wrestles with objectification but learns to stop seeing herself through others eyes as the object finally standing on her own two flat feet

elsewhere the concept of ken as a standin for all the insecure men who treat women as mere extensions of their ego — well its sublime indeed this dressup toybox world is perfect for skewering the performative antics of selfstyled alpha males

as absurd and cerebral as the film gets gerwig finds a wellspring of emotion in the nostalgia of childhood specifically the idea of barbie as the idealised adulthood children think they will grow into the conflict between the pristine utopia of barbie and the painful thisiswater realities of adulthood forms the films beating heart — margot robbie captures the conflict with soul and gentle grace at times calling to mind her angelic version of sharon tate",2023-07-22 14:28:51
pretty good and thoroughly enjoyable but not great imo very funny in places ryan gosling especially was delightful i thought the conclusion that the world needs a barbie doll that addresses the issues women face in the real world such as cellulite and juggling careers with their family life was bizarre considering the purpose of a doll is essentially for children to have imaginative escapist fun which was incidentally the most successful aspect of the film i don’t have children but i can’t imagine that the concept of playing with a doll that is divorced has two children an office job bills to pay and pcos would be particularly entertaining for them overall i had fun but i greatly prefer little women,2023-07-22 19:14:13
"“i don’t want you here” 

barbie to ken after he is overly pushy about staying over she said no more than once ken

genius",2023-07-23 12:58:32
"overall i really enjoyed this movie the barbie nostalgia amazing sets and costumes and the surprising amount of sometimes very harsh self aware humor were great i felt the goal of empowering women and acknowledging where society is failing them was well communicated

america ferreiras speech is awesome an affecting summary of the contradictory roles women that society expects them to perform all while barbie a physical representation of that oppression is breaking down from it as well as the thought that she was built off of it but as the characters mention afterwards by putting these struggles into words we now have an understanding of how insane these expectations are and that we can choose to be free from it

i think where this movie starts to fail is when it comes to ken and men in general his story and arc were really messy imo and it sucks because the movie started to touch on some really interesting ideas here that i wish they had expanded on

1 i dont think they communicated that ken was an incel for barbie til later in the movie i interpreted the every night is girls night as the dolls general obliviousness to  even near the end though i didnt feel like barbie and kens reconciliation felt right barbie apologizes to ken for taking him for granted but she has nothing to apologize for she makes it clear that theyre not together or that shes into him and she should have the right to spend her time the way she likes

the whole scene is actually really counterproductive because women often acquiesce to men irl because they feel bad for letting down a guy who likes them i wish that scene had gone more along the lines of barbie drawing a clear boundary in their relationship and defending her choices while at the same time encouraging him to move on gain confidence in himself and learn more about himself as a person

edit i read some more thoughts on this apology and that its more about how men feel lost or marginalized in a feminist world i agree that sometimes feminism sidelines men and that that sucks and i wish this had come across more clearly in that apology scene

2 the way conflicts were solved was also very toxic the barbies literally emotionally manipulate the kens into fighting one another to foil the election not that any incels are gonna see the barbie movie but this is like pure incel fuel they hate women and think of them as tricksters and its also  to represent the kens as bumbling warobsessed jealous idiots

this is such a huge failure imo because it provides yet another poor example of how to healthily talk about problems between the sexes i would have preferred that the barbies after all getting deprogrammed successfully win over the patriarchy kens respect and that they rebuild barbieland together

the icing on this  cake is when the barbies humorously tell the kens they cant be in the supreme court and will have to start at the lower courts  this excuse oh sure we can be equal but you need to start on the bottom rung is used on women irl and it  blows and no im not advocating that women be instapromoted or hired without the relevant knowledgeexperience for a job but pointing out that women to this day still do not hold many positions of power and are relegated to lower positions

3 mattel pokes fun at itself in some surprisingly subversive ways but by the end of the movie never actually answers for some its more heinous crimes its a funny scene when will ferrel bumbles over how there are no women on the directors board yet we see no resolution to this issue when america ferreira suggests the idea of a regular barbie to help with womens self esteem issues its written off as not being lucrative 

the translation of barbie and kens to women and men also doesnt quite work because ken is an accessory to barbie because thats just what the toy is so unless mattel is intending to make ken dolls just as prolific as barbies the message doesnt really land right

overall i think its a good movie but the discussion around gender roles is still extremely complicated and for how self deprecating it gets at times i wish it could have provided a more honest and healthy example for how to deal with these complexities in the real world",2023-07-23 18:25:38
"the movie was amazing witty meta perfect timing and the most fun i remember having on a movie theater in a long long time 
on a side note i know more than one fully grown adult who didnt understand the movie its almost like a decade of only watching superhero movies made people incapable of understanding and enjoying any movie that doesnt have a clearly good guy a clearly bad guy and a boringly simple plot",2023-07-24 03:47:42
"as a filmmaker and a  pastel princess i was so so so excited for this film campy movies with bright colors outlandish designs and dark humor are always my favorite i was ready for the darkly funny stepford wifepleasantville vibes that the trailer gave and went in full pink regalia with my friends 

  
pros it was really funny in a campy way had an important message and the set  costume design was amazing i want every single outfit and every piece of furniture in my home ken being an insecure incel had me rolling the entire time america ferreras speech also destroyed my heart there were also a lot of really beautiful moments like barbie soaking in her surroundings that i wanted to see more of 

   
cons it felt like everything was just rushed through which made the message and the character arcs feel really surfacelevel i wish they took more time to build up to barbies realization for ex instead of things changing basically overnight having weird things build up little by little to a point where she cant ignore it anymore i  also 100 agree with the feminist message but i wish it was executed in a way that wasnt so spelled out i think showing the contrast between barbieland and america ferreras experiences in the real world wouldve been more impactful or if they showed more of barbie struggling to navigate the real world while ken slowly discovered more about the patriarchy imo it wouldve been better as a twopart movie i feel like only ken got a real character arc and the room to shine as a character

while i did think the script was funny i also dont think the writers knew the type of humor they were going for it seemed like they wanted to do a satiredark comedy but didnt know how to approach serious topics like gender inequality and womens struggles without being onthenose tbh i wish it was written the way addams family values was it was able to blend dark humor campiness and bitingly smart commentary about class and conservatism so well that you didnt even realize it until after

in conclusion is it the witty deep satire that i thought itd be no but i did have fun and will watch again next weekend in a ridiculous pink fluffy tulle gown this is my review that nobody asked for

"as a an adult male i thought this movie was great it poked fun at gender roles and gender in society as extremes in both genders and the overall theme was a place in society as equals and not some extremism feminist movement men bad thing  humor was amazing and clever and the adult jokes were awesome  reminded me of shrek the beach off scene in particular 

i would have liked to see more real world interactions and i’m not sure why they made will ferral character mentally challenged but overall it was great 910

i also think people are taking this movie way to seriously and framing it as some gospel for feminism and young women etc this film was a satire about gender roles in society and have could easily been an snl skit that was rated r stop trying to over analyze and politicize everything and just laugh and enjoy it",2023-07-24 15:28:34
"i loved this movie and loved the way it made certain points

the movie has one clearly obvious scene and one or two other nods to the matrix depending how deep you look in to it ruth as the oracle mattel execs being agents

i think referencing the matrix helps drive the direction of the points they were trying to make about society being blind to systematic oppression just like neo was originally blind to the matrix even though it felt off he had to choose to see it and took the red pill much the same as barbie had to choose to see the real world and how it functions with men dominating most positions of power thats what barbie was blind to not the existence of two worlds but that the flip side of the coin in the real world made her have uncomfortable feelings and that is how ken feels in barbieland 

furthermore after barbies retake power they dont bring things back to normal they give kens some positions of power and barbie says to ken that not every night is girls night this shows that barbie has learned from her experience and empathizes with kens position in barbieland

there are other themes that are important to note as well but systematic oppression taking away a person’s agency is the big one the ending and the specific language used by ruth and barbie solidify that for me they talk about what being a human is not necessarily a woman and what it is that all humans want to create and feel that we have made a meaningful impact on the world

i think barbie having an existential crisis isnt really a theme but more of a symptom of the mothers life living in a world built for and by men and the real existential crises in real people that exist in a world not made for or by them and it makes sense why people would feel that way 

before watching the movie i attributed higher rates of anxiety and depression in women to just the way women work now im considering that maybe its a symptom of a bigger problem and not ‘just the way women are’ theres tons of research on this but i pulled a semi recent meta analysis to bolster my point here 

its sad that we can be blind to these things but its important to constantly try to make it better 

full disclosure im married hetero white cis atheistic college educated and male i have typical male gendered interests i understand why barbie would make men feel uncomfortable but the point is that the problem is still ongoing and it is not in the past and you can’t just bury your head in the sand and ignore problems just because they make you feel bad",2023-07-24 15:37:41
"it was decent i kinda wish kens got a more satisfying resolution 

and before you say “ it’s a barbie movie it’s about barbie” i ask that you watch wreckit ralph a movie about old games obviously geared towards a male audience and older and it has a great resolution for the female side character vanellope she was a great character with problems and her story was about feminism and how she didn’t fit the stereotype of cute girls into girl stuff her story didn’t take anything away from how good the whole movie was this could have been ken

movie was fairly funny great acting and costumessettings and some interesting ideas but just didn’t end in a satisfying way and it was a little preachy a 910 or 1010 film to me is everything everywhere all at once and i wouldn’t say barbie is anywhere close to that",2023-07-26 04:26:14
"am i the only one slightly disappointed with how they wrote out the ending for the kens

to preface i absolutely support the importance of having an identity outside of your partner and i dont think this message was bad at all i just wish that rather than have barbie being the one to tell ken that hes enough without her they had the two ken groups come together and engage in meaningful discussion about how theyre feeling this wouldve shown the importance of platonic male friendship and male support something that is lacking in our current society or often made fun of when men talk about their feelings with each other and we all know the effects of toxic masculinity

i feel like they had such a huge opportunity to teach a valuable lesson in what it means to be a man and how to approachhandle male communication in a healthy way what they did was bring barbie into the picture and depicted her as overshadowing ken made it her responsibility to tell ken that hes enough it took away from a really good opportunity to depict that it is okay for men to talk about their feelings with each other and support each other emotionally without getting bullied or made fun of im thinking of the scene where barbie tells ken that its okay to cry  i so wish that another ken had told him this i think it wouldve made the scene so much more impactful if we saw men reassuring each other that its okay to feel emotions and guide each other through that process

i wish this was the focus for the kens at the end and they totally couldve done this in a light easy to watch way following the style of the movie men supporting each other and communicating with each other without shame rather than the message that they put out of im enough without barbie because i feel like this can so easily be misconstrued to i dont need barbie to be ken and boysmen these days can definitely use a lesson or two on how to treat women and thats a whole other lengthy discussion",2023-07-27 17:01:10
i have absolutely no idea what was going on with the ending once barbie entered the blank white dimension i felt it was basically jumping the shark in the sheer absurdity of its direction and the ceo was such a poor sideplot that should have been cut down substantially if it was going to lead to nothing of substance at all loved everything else though what a bizarre experience,2023-07-27 23:34:13
"i really liked it  it seemed more like it was having fun with all the gender war stuff than pushing any kind of message to me  ken was really funny and the mom acknowledging unrelenting thoughts of death barbie made me laugh out loud

the slapstick stuff and nonstop gags wore on me a bit but otherwise it was a pretty unique movie with some heart and solid humor  glad i went and saw it

seems like people are taking it way too seriously",2023-07-28 01:54:26
im not sure why i cried the entire time it was embarrassing was with two platonic friends a boy and a girl it really moved me i always was blown away by this director though from frances ha to little women even her husband or partner or whatever  his movie marriage story made me sob the whole time too he did squid and whale which i watched as a much younger person and it impacted me then too,2023-07-28 03:46:27
"its unbelievable that ken steals the show in the barbie movie he goes through a far more interesting character arc than barbie every time ken wasnt on screen i was literally waiting for ken to be back on screen

im not gonna bother making sense of the plot or story or world building i realized it was an absurdist surreal comedy and just go along with it my only complaint is that i wished the messaging was just a little more subtle less is more you know",2023-07-30 21:22:59
"i saw it today it was fun and absurd but it was also kind of sloppy and didnt really seem to have an actual point for a movie that dealt with some pretty serious subjects in a very direct way it didnt really have coherent commentary on the subjects

ken literally says that he did a patriarchy because he liked horses

it was weird but it was an enjoyable movie to watch",2023-08-06 23:44:21
"i think the barbie movie’s view on feminism is fair

i would go as far as to say it’s a more mediated approach to the discussion

in the barbie world the roles are reversed in terms of men and women by the end of the movies the barbie said that the kens going to have to slowly gain authority which eventually would equal the barbies

while the movie ends with the barbies ‘winning’ it is not anyone’s victory just a shift view and we know from speech that they will eventually be equals

back on the real real world side the roles are flipped so the statement becomes that women will have to slowly earn authority and autonomy until it eventually equals that of men 

the state of power in barbie land in the beginning and the end stays the exact same but everyone agrees that kens would have been worse off if the event of the movie didn’t happen 

 the event in the movie sparked a discussion that ultimately lead to both the kens and the barbies understanding each other and in turn themselves more

isn’t that what we should have in this grand discussion empathy",2023-08-07 19:50:09
"i felt the movie low key blames women for the patriarchy the barbies allowed the ken’s to establish a patriarchy out of nowhere when they wanted to end it they worked together to end it if patriarchy exists it’s because women allow it and it’s their job to stop it if they don’t like it 

none of the barbie’s are mothers no  they have careers and interesting lives maybe just maybe a woman’s role in bringing children into the world and getting them on their feet sets her back a few steps and cumulatively over generations the patriarchy gains hold",2023-12-28 08:19:08
just saw it i thought the ending was really disappointing they should have suggested that the kens and barbies work together as equals moving forward but instead they decided to be petty and keep them relegated as second class citizens like in the “real world” annoying as ,2023-07-21 22:04:22
"gerwig hiring emerald fennell to just stand around at the side of the frame and be ignored was hilarious

overall i liked the movie a lot the comedy works the more seriousemotional bits mostly work though i think ferreiras big speech falls flat",2023-07-21 17:24:59
i was blown away by ryan goslings performance loved the movie i’m a 32 year old first time mom and wow some of these things resonated with me deeply,2023-07-21 17:32:32
"our 7pm on release day audience absolutely understood the assignment packed out room and pretty much everyone had some element of pink in their outfit myself included

i went in with very few expectations and genuinely thought it was a masterpiece cried way more than i anticipated too but luckily my pink turtleneck soaked up most of the tears",2023-07-21 21:14:32
the script did an amazing job subverting expectations at every corner pretty much flipping the power dynamic between men and women like three times in the first act without making it feel forced,2023-07-23 16:32:19
"so comments on here are confusing me a little

i thought the kens represented men in the real world that are waking up to realizing what patriarchy has done to them and the reason they wouldnt allow men on the supreme court in barbie land was because the kens didnt embrace patriarchal institutions ie college degrees mentioned a few times and they started to reject patriarchy by the end of the ken war and then fully rejected it by the end of the movie barbie land run by the real world patriarchy and so it mirrors the real world in its patriarchal institutions isnt there yet and thats the reason the kens cant be on the supreme court

some comments on this thread though are saying the kens represented women in the real world which would then make the barbies represent the men and the patriarchy so in the end the patriarchy wins but its starting to fail as the kens women and barbies men become more aware of themselves

on this point what role the kens are playing i thought i had it but now im not so sure",2023-07-23 23:16:21
"be me

hot girl i thought i had a connection with rejects me

real lefty commie smash the patriarchy type but im not so into that

humiliated pursue her like a loser anyway fail

spurs me to become a major success like change the world forever success power to take over the world success

bunch of guy friends all gassing me up constantly women all want me

suddenly blonde chick all over me not going for it dont need her anymore love talking at her quoting deep  and she listens

hot blonde becomes my long distance low commitment casual girlfriend shes  about it but who cares

grandiose got big plans to change the world noone can stop me

all the dudes in my secret society hang off my every word learn some new philosophy and love quoting it at them

but insecure have doubts pour them out to my blonde girl new one this time like i said low commitment and feel like shes really listening

she pretends like she cares about them but not really starts to tell me im insecure and narcissistic

all comes crashing down as i realize what ive done and it all comes back to bite me lose respect of my bros lose my woman along with it dont know who i am anymore

cant cry got to be manly

"was the daughter character supposed to come off as obnoxious and needlessly edgy as her role
can someone explain how barbie is fascist or was that a thing to add to the image of her being a kid that is using words that dont really applyshe doesnt understand just to sound more edgy",2023-07-29 07:00:10
"i watched barbie today and i have a lot of feelings about it and im unsure as to whether i even enjoyed it or not but thats a separate issue

in regards to ken is his lack of character development to a degree meant to be a reflection of womens portrayal in the media with one dimensional relationship based identities being a prominent trope of female characters i am right in thinking that or was it simply just meant to be playing into the stupidity of patriarchy if so is that not hypocritical in the sense that a society run by  one dimensional women  would not make a good society or is that the point 

also re ken the placement although very funny of im just ken felt like it was in the wrong place should it not have happened after the initial refusal from barbie as opposed to after the destruction of barbie land like it doesnt make sense to me that singing a song about being enough after ruining the society the barbies had made that was although not necessarily equal but functional to a degree to its main patrons the barbies ultimately a childrens toy a matriarchal society makes sense if its aimed at women anyway why do they arrive at self realisation post destruction would it not made more sense to have that song before kendom was brought to life like ken realises hes enough and then takes charge this understandably would throw out the whole time line of the movie in regards to the real world visit please any opinions or thoughts are welcome

like any great film with such a build up something is just niggling at me and im not saying i am disappointed at the end result of the film but it does leave me with more questions than answers and plot points that didnt seem to come to a conclusion

on the plus side the portrayals of womens trials and tribulates and americas monologue were phenomenal the symbolism of barbies interaction with the old lady on the bench and just overall emotional journey i went on throughout the film was pure awe i have not watched a film for a while that made me emotionally ache the way this one has 

perhaps that in itself is self explanatory and something that has only just click now and its silly for me to even mention this if its abundantly obvious to everyone else but i thought id ask incase ive missed the point completely any thoughts feelings and opinions are welcome",2023-07-30 12:41:29

also i imagined a scene were ken discovers andrew tate in la and goes insane with the patriarchy ",2023-07-21 16:57:15
"so they censored two parts of it in my country if anyone could fill in what happened would be much obliged

first part when they arrive in venice beach and the whole interaction with the construction crew 


the second part was when theyre showing some discontinued kens in weird barbies house they cut off after the ken with the dog for like 20 seconds",2023-07-21 18:43:41
"saw the movie on wednesday so i’m quickly forgetting details but i’ll speak generally and say how much i love this movie i had a general idea of the plot and i think i share that with other people that we knew barbie goes to the real world and has an existential crisisexperience  i think the trailer cast and general promo did an exceptional job at keeping the plot vague because i had no idea what was coming next i saw one tweet from a random user about who could possibly be a villain but i didn’t pay it any mind because it seemed so off base but it wasn’t 

i laughed so much and enjoyed the emotional moments although i was very confused on where things were going i let all the plot holes go and just sat back for the ride that was exploring the patriarchy self worth femininity and horses i’m hoping to see this movie again once the hype dies down a bit and i cannot wait for that day",2023-07-22 06:22:39
so…which scene did they have to fly mattel in to approve do you think,2023-07-22 06:44:15
"overall this was a lot of fun saw it at the drivein with my wife for an extra dose of nostalgia plus she’s 30 weeks pregnant so we really enjoyed midge pregnant barbie

i realized about 90 through the runtime that the “real world” plot didn’t really matter i’m not sure exactly what i expected but i thought barbie going to the real world and fixing something was going to be the main plot line but it sort of felt irrelevant by the end the story was more about barbie and ken in barbielandkendom and figuring out who they were which was great i could have done without the motherdaughtermattel employees and just had a deeper dive into barbie and ken going to the real world was just a way to introduce the patriarchy to ken which they could have got to in other ways 

still really enjoyed the whole thing though mckinnon was great with weird barbie and cera as allan depression barbie was hilarious loved ken discovering “masculinity” the obsession with horses “i am kenough” the beach off with accompanying dance number…gosling was absolutely fantastic as ken i’m almost certain there will be a spinoff focused on him i hope it captures the same magic",2023-07-22 12:49:47
i enjoyed it overall by no means perfect but got some laughs out of me ryan gosling is great,2023-07-22 17:12:25
it was an interesting experience if nothing else the direction use of color and pacing was pretty good margo robbie’s performance was about what i expected great but overshadowed by ryan gosling who was fantastic didn’t like the soundtrack but it fitted the film oppenheimer was more up my alley honestly but i had a good time with barbie,2023-07-22 21:55:14
am i the only pne who caught on to the shifting cast of invisible role players the ceo being a younger sibling with words put in his mouth by a parent at first  ken being handled by a neighbor with a crush  barbie beimg passed between mother and daughter,2023-07-22 23:43:39
are the discontinued barbies real or made up  who thought of pregnant barbie or the pooping dog,2023-07-23 00:38:52
"so i did indeed see barbie and oppenheimer together and im just saying that theres a scene in oppenheimer where hes pouring his heart out about his guilt to emily blunt and shes pretending to be sympathetic and then loses patience with him that would literally fit in that scene in barbie movie where the kens are pouring out their hearts to the barbies physicist ken


also he literally had jean tetlock be his long distance low commitment casual girlfriend he loves going on random self important tangents and quoting things people call him a dilletante womanizer and insecure neurotic

theres even an early scene in the movie where hes pursuing jean before he became a bigshot physicist and she rejects him and he sulks off

just saying the dude would have fit right in kendom",2023-07-23 09:35:09
why are there comments about going against the grain with my positive thoughts of the movie here when like one out of a hundred comments seems to be something other than overwhelming praise and gets downvoted to  lol,2023-07-24 03:59:49
"i love this movie

910",2023-07-24 04:14:38
didn’t realize machine gun kelly makes a cameo as ken,2023-07-24 04:18:54
if anything the movie succeeds in getting me to think about gender topics because its saying so much that for the life of me i cant figure out what its trying to say,2023-07-24 07:53:33
for me the movie was absolutely successful it dealt with issues that are inhenrently human such as sense of value insecurities injustice and being aware of death the constrast of such themes with the vibrant colors was interesting to me it might have touched on these themes on the surface level but i dont think it needed to dive in deeper  thats up to the spectator,2023-07-24 10:45:09
"really good film its rare for humour to land for me as much as barbie did 

the one thing i wasnt a massive fan of though and maybe others would disagree was that ken only reflected on his ideology being wrong after he was defeated it felt a bit weird that the film asked us to feel sympathy for ken when a few minutes before he was cool with hypnotising the barbies into basically being slaves i suppose ken is dumb enough to have not realised what he was doing but still he basically only started reflecting on himself because he lost it would have felt more genuine if hed come to the realisation that what he was doing was wrong whilst still in control and then because of it he and the other kens could have decided to vote against their own constitution change on the other hand doing that would probably mean writing out the ken battle scene and that was far too much fun to not include in the script",2023-07-24 15:23:54
"bolígrafo

",2023-07-24 21:59:05
can someone pls explain this may be a dumb question but why did mattel even care that barbie was out and about why were they trying to put her back in the box also why were they upset about the kens having taken over especially since it was good for profits the will ferrell character said he was a big advocate for women and stated that as the reason but it felt a bit weird to me was that just inserted to appease mattel and make them seem slightly sympathetic would love some thoughts,2023-07-25 17:07:57

very funny very good message awesome fun movie,2023-08-07 07:58:27
"just saw this yesterday and loved it it’s the best work i’ve ever seen from robbie and gosling works overtime to justify his cobilling in a way this movie is what happens when you tell a lot of extremely talented and smart creatives to play with their barbies and their dreamhouses again and see what happens if they’re really putting themselves and their experiences into that sort of playtime and btw anyone catch the jacques tati references you’re going to see a lifetime of pain and anger emerge it’s just the way we humans roll

it’s probably the one and only bigbudget iporiented film that will ever even remotely resemble superstar the karen carpenter story which used barbie dolls to tell a story about sublimated misogyny that was so caustic all copies of it were ordered destroyed by the courts barbie holds out hope here in moving past stereotypes and roles and embracing one’s humanity frailty and mortality 

ps the dance sequence and the dua lipa track is an instant classic the platonic ideal of a disco paradise",2023-09-06 05:08:47

was having a terrible day and week and needed some positivity it was just what i needed and had such strong points that women me and my friends have had to accept i thought it a masterpiece

watch me dance the night away ,2023-12-30 11:45:18
i think the movie was very childish and shallow the movie runs aimlessly without any answers very preachy but it doesnt add up in the end things didnt change men in this movie are showcase as dumb from that girls dad to ken and i thought in the end she will land a job but no she straight goes to gynecologist for  like what,2023-07-21 15:33:35
seems like people are divided if they loved the first half or the second half i personally loved the second it got funnier it kinda went off the rails in the best way and it got some pretty heartfelt moments in it,2023-07-21 03:25:48
it was just a hilarious comedy i rate it 810 loved all the songs references and the disco segment was awesome  i played with action men as a kid though,2023-07-21 14:02:36
is this the right place to ask why specifically it was rated pg13 besides the joke that ken has nothing in his pants my daughter wants to go and she is a bit younger,2023-07-21 18:45:27

can somebody refresh me the lines with

"my unwarranted opinion of the movie came in with managed expectations 

the goods 
• great production design 
• ryan and america were the standouts 
• a lot of the scenes were funny 
• margot robbie is a great crier
• shoutout to kate mckinnon 
• the writing is good 
• loved the opening scenes 

the meh’s 
• some jokes didn’t land
• albeit the funny scenes i wouldn’t find myself laughing if i see it again it’s more like a collective funny moment for everyone in the theatre 
• i felt like it was trying to tell me things that i didn’t already know 
• was not satisfied with the ending idk maybe i was expecting more fun and triumph  
• it felt like patriarchy 101 for kids 
• i feel like i understood the movie pretty well that it didn’t leave much to think about

i still love greta gerwig and will watch her film about a pink toad",2023-07-22 13:26:42
just watched it i thought the movie was ok it flowed weirdly from trying for humor for a while then switching into really serious topics not huge on the feminism aspect but it’s whatever not make or break at all overall just didn’t think it was a totally coherent movie,2023-07-23 05:09:46
i like that films are being made with more women and genders these days thus the world gets rid of the shackles of condemnation of those people who think and behave differently from the generally accepted norm,2023-07-24 21:19:25
i loved the movie until the last two minutes i hated the ending they did ,2023-07-25 09:11:32
"i felt seen everyone in pink everyone relating to the depressed barbie with anxiety and ocd sold
separately  i felt seen

the end montage scene when barbie wants be human holy that got me it was so beautifully done the scene with the old lady when barbie is sitting at the bus stop barely any words were said but the impact was there and it pulled where it needed to pull 

ryan gosling was hilarious and whoever had any doubts in him smhhhh he killed it i loved everything about this movie",2023-07-26 12:13:19
i liked it i dont get criticism about the movie being too feminist its a movie about barbie ffs had plenty of hilarious scenes busted blokes chops heaps and the message behind it was surprisingly selfaware and poignant and worked within the medium rather than pulling punches or completely demonising men to get the point across it was done with tact i thought it was pretty good and just the right amount of goofy i can see why ben shapiro felt emasculated by it ken looked better in the black shirt pants combo margot killed it michael cera was a favourite with myself and my friends who i went to see it with it was great would see again,2023-07-26 15:33:11
why the hate and freaks about the pregnant woman,2023-09-13 00:36:28
i felt like it was kind of  on masculinity a little bit personally i’m glad that those who enjoyed the film got to see a movie they enjoyed but i personally didn’t feel too good about myself by the time i exited the theatre just my opinion here not trying to start any arguments or offend anyone,2023-07-21 04:04:14
"very funny

but i did not like they shamed ken for wanting love they invalidated him and made him the villain

completely missed the mark on its own message",2023-07-21 08:23:19
the irony isn’t lost on me that a movie about feminism was absolutely deadlifted by its male lead goslingken was far and away the best part of this movie and did a really good job of hiding the clouded messaging and poor setup for the final scene payoff,2023-07-21 13:21:43
"honestly i couldn’t stand it 

my friends all liked it and i thought the castingcostumingset design was great but i found the script terrible the jokes felt tired it felt like it was trying to be feminist but it almost felt patronizing and insulting to the audience’s intelligence yes i know women can be doctors or moms i know that patriarchy is bad i know all of these things and the 3 minute monologue from the mom just felt redundant maybe if i was over 45 and unaware of most of the feminist ideology of the past 10 years this would feel powerful and good but i was just disappointed 

i think i had high expectations so it just really fell flat for me

i also don’t think that the way in which it alienated men was accurate or useful there are a plentiful number of valid criticisms of the way that men operate around women and it instead chose to be critical of things that i felt like were more like bullying than a constructive commentary or even fun 
additionally to a male viewer that struggles with seeing women as people to begin with there are so many teenage boys whose minds are currently being rotted by the likes of andrew tate this does very little to offset the narrative that all women are evil and just view men as things to be used 

the male characters were completely flat and while i feel like this was partially intentional it made the empowerment of women it was trying to perpetuate feel disingenuous because of how exaggerated and pathetic the male caricatures were 

i think i also am coming from a place of empathizing with the incel basement dwellers we have all come to know and love the problem is that they’re so disconnected from reality and their perceptions of the modern women are almost completely analogous with the beginning of the movie relationship between barbie and ken i just feel like that’s a narrative that desperately needs to be dispelled and i can easily see this film being used as fodder by the far right propaganda machines that this is society now and women just want men to be an accessory

i did enjoy ryan gosling as ken and margot robbie as barbie and generally thought the casting was done well it had some very sweet moments but overall i did not like it

tldr lukewarm feminism unnecessarily alienating to men weak script but some nice moments aesthetically excellent",2023-07-23 21:38:40
the movie honestly felt like it was originally a snl skit but was left fermented and became an interesting tasting wine would be nice to have a blooper reel to see how often ryan gosling break character,2023-07-21 02:31:03
so many people saying haha so funny without even mentioning literally how deep it was lets acknowledge all the messages behind it its insane how this movie hit on so many issues in todays society the expectations emotions and being human,2023-07-22 23:12:10
"i absolutely loved the first half of the film i loved the sets costumes music the outrageousness the humour the fun ryan gosling was amazing as always but i did not enjoy the second half of the film for the most part i still adored those essential elements i mentioned like the sets as they continued to shine throughout the whole film 

my first problem with the second half is that the pacing really did not fit my taste it slowed down a lot and the contemplative and deep moments went too far beyond for my liking it felt very piled on and definitely not the lessismore style of the first half that i was really enjoying 

furthermore greta gerwig’s particular feelings about womanhood feminism and gender just don’t resonate with mine anymore i have grown a lot over the past few years and my feelings have changed i think we need to stop pointing fingers at men it’s just pointless especially as our society continues to push so much heavy messaging and expectation of traditional harmful masculinity onto their shoulders plus a binary view of humanity is simply outdated and incorrect and i just want to clarify that i know greta isn’t trying to point fingers at men here my impression of her message is that it’s time to free ourselves from all gender stereotypes which is great but the entire speech from america ferrera as well as the subplot of the barbies taking back barbieland and saying they “disinfected” the dream houses after the ken’s were there just felt like more stereotyping

even though it’s happening at a glacial pace canadian society at least is making real strides towards liberation from gender stereotypes we need to invigorate this movement by promoting men’s health funding and campaigns discontinuing the use of the term “toxic masculinity” and switch it out for “harmfuloutdated masculine stereotypes” we need to let the men in our lives know as often as we can that we don’t expect or need them to be strong all the time we want them to feel connected to their emotions and express them we don’t need them to make a lot of money we don’t need them to just “tough it out” through injuries and hardships and so on 

feminism means equality of all genders so make sure to check yourself that you’re treating everyone in your life like another human and work on edging out any conscious or unconscious gender biases you have these are my beliefs and watching barbie really rubbed me the wrong way so i can only think that greta’s beliefs are just too different than mine for my liking 

if the film had just been fun a chase through the real world to capture barbie and ken epic musical numbers and hilarious references to the dolls and how we played with them then it would’ve been a 5 for me",2023-07-23 05:26:25
"i went to see it with some friends yesterday and we all agreed that the story was weak and every other aspect was perfect we enjoyed the music the costumes obviously the set even the acting and the jokes but all the feminist speeches felt very forced and none of use liked gloria and sasha and her husband was so random

dont get me wrong we liked the general message of the film but also agreed that it was executed badly

edit and allan should have had a special ending too he wanted to escape barbie world and also become his own person and he just disappeared into the background again",2023-07-23 07:10:09
 i’m worried if i watched the wrong movie or i’m lowkey depressed this film was bang average comedy was so forced,2023-07-23 20:19:37
i had very high expectations and i feel a bit disappointed overall the barbie aspect was very cleverly portrayed but the feminist aspect although a good message felt too preachy and half baked as a woman i thought the movie would tug at my heartstrings but it didn’t get there i wish the story showed me more of how patriarchy affects women by actually portraying it on screen rather than saying it the flashbacks barbie kept having would have been a good medium for that but they had no cohesiveness,2023-07-23 23:28:06
anyone feels like the more you watch or think about this movie the more it falls apart liked this in first viewing now it doesnt feel as good as before,2023-07-24 19:39:37
barbieland is pretty funny and i really enjoyed the heck out of it  when i want to go see a fun summertime popcorn movie this is what i want  but people acting like its some sort of subversive work of art are fooling themselves  barbie is a two hour infomercial for mattel and weirdly general motors that is targeted at women in their 30s and 40s that feel trapped in american capitalistic wage slavery as a feel good flick that lets them blame their lack of personal success on everything but the real villain capitalistic wage slavery,2023-07-29 15:53:20
"barbie barbie barbie

i really didn’t get the point of the movie it felt like they had a bunch of good ideas that couldn’t  develop enough in the time allotted pardon the pun but it made the movie feel plastic 

theme 1 barbie discovering she’s a toy someone is making her feel this way so who is playing with ken

theme 2 becoming okay with not being perfect becoming human 

theme 3 barbie land matriarchy vs real world patriarchy

theme 3 ken not feeling satisfied with life mirroring women’s experience in the real world and then finally being “kenough” but he still doesn’t get his own house or a better relationship with barbie or anything other than what he already had… this feels like the opposite of feminism also there was nothing about normalizing boys playing with dolls and i’m super disappointed

theme 4 motherdaughter relationship issues i felt both their roles were written very shallow even with the big “ah ha” speech from the mom

theme 5 mother is having thoughts of suicideexistential crisis which leads barbie to have these thoughts and cellulite umm what

theme 6 weird barbie not being accepted by the other barbies and pregnant barbie so many missed opportunities with this for character development

i have so many questions and i feel they glossed over so many issues that were brought up anyone else share this sentiment",2023-08-09 18:10:50
"1010 this movie was everything i wanted it to be and more a lot of posters are complaining about its lack of subtleness while there certain themes thrown in the viewers face there was also layers of feminist theory and intersectionality baked into every layer of this film 

ultimately i think think barbieland is supposed to represent the women and more specifically white feminists who believe the feminist movement has already won think the “girl boss” type so many women argue now that the feminist movement is done equality has been achieved ignoring the barriers still in place for many women especially those with intersecting identities 

that’s why it takes america ferrera‘s character and her daughter women with intersecting identities to teach barbie that her brand of feminism has not helped or solved all the problems for every women by the end of the movie barbie’s decision to leave barbieland and go to the real world represents how she’s accepted this reality and no longer wants to live behind the veil of ignorance 

it also represents how this “girl power” feminism is commercialized and sold to women like how mattel and its executive board of men still control barbieland behind the scenes girl boss feminism ignores that men still hold much of power in the world and tagging girlboss on ig photos doesn‘t change this 

this movie is also clearly criticizing white beauty standards this is illustrated by america ferrera’s character a latino women sketching a blonde white women and later telling barbie ”i can’t be you” this is commentary on the impact of media that has traditionally presented white beauty standards as ideal has on nonwhite women from an early age it also shows the impact of unattainable beauty standards on even women like barbie or real life women like marilyn monroe who do fit these ideal standards

america ferrera‘s speech at the end that cures the barbies is literally the concept of double consciousness first theorized by web dubois a notable early civil rights thinker and activist there’s so much more that i could dive into but whoever wrote this script is clearly wellversed in feminist film theory i could write a master’s thesis about all the theory presented in this film   


lastly i find it laughable that people think the end of the movie invalidates the message of the film barbieland reverses gender roles so this represents how in the real world even when feminists “won“ battles like securing the right to vote it still took decades for meaningful change to be implemented expecting that change to be immediate when gender roles are reversed is irony at its finest they’re missing the point that both the patriarchy and feminism are institutions and ideas people invented to deal with living in a  world there isn’t a magical way to fix it we saw how everyone was negatively impacted in some fashion by both the gender roles and systems in the real world and barbieland however by acknowledging this dynamic and emphasizing with each other we can begin to fix it

i think this movie did a fantastic job in bringing to light criticisms of both feminism and the patriarchy it uses satire in a very similar way to the  manifesto which is going to going over a lot of people’s heads regardless i loved every minute of it and am glad this movie is bringing these conversations into  the spotlight",2023-07-25 21:28:46
"honestly the men getting roasted was the best part of the movie youve never seen the godfather can you restart it and talk during the entire movie that was comedy gold 

all the right winger men  about it are pathetic their masculinity is threatened by a movie about a doll ",2023-07-26 10:48:55
holy  was this so boring  what on earth was all the hype about,2023-12-17 02:16:17
huge stinker negative boring bad pacing terrible and nonsensical plot cringe inducing pandering the sequence where they enter the real world get arrested with no repercussions and then seemingly teleport all over la was horrible no world building or explaining why barbie world exists how and why the dolls and humans are able to travel between them will ferrell and the evil white males were a total afterthought and a completely unnecessary story element that chase scene in mattel hq was awful the horribly insufferable daughter that wins the most slappable character this year the ridiculously melodramatic ending that closes with a lame genital joke positive robbie and gosling performances were good and a few other standouts like cera who deserved more character development overall im shocked not only that mattel allowed the barbie brand to be assassinated like this but this was really the best they could come up with gerwig is more hype than substance really not that talented move over antman barbie is the worst movie of the year,2023-07-21 06:31:10
is it true that all the male characters are either idiots or socalled toxic,2023-07-21 12:26:26
work at a theatre and i can tell you right now barbie will make a billion dollars already beaten spiderman nwh’s previous record for most admits in one day nearly 2000 admits for barbie on saturday alone with oppenheimer also selling out sessions great movie and what a time to be alive to see a sea of people in pink coming in droves,2023-07-22 07:16:04
i liked the movie but people defending it like they were involved in the production are unhinged its a movie about toys made by a multi billion dollar toy company who made the film to sell more toys,2023-07-23 01:27:27
"i said this in a reply elsewhere related to a comparison with oppenheimer and thought it would be worth posting as its own thought

maybe nuclear bombs will still destroy all of civilization but even that would be a natural extension of the patriarchal imagination suggested by the barbie film  what is oppenheimer but a bunch of kens playing with toy soldiers and fireworks",2023-07-23 03:05:30
"i think it was exagerated

the movie could have had a really good direction i liked the first half but then everything seemed really forced to me",2023-07-23 12:04:14
"im a feminist guy and i loved the message and find it funny when grown men online call it antimen projecting much lol of course barbieland wont get from matriarchy to equal rights in a day just like our world still didnt moved away from patriarchy that was literally the message and im listening to just ken in a loop i just love this song so much

then again i wish they just give the kens their dream wild west world they dont even seem to have houses of course dont have them take over barbieland but why not have their own section honsetly i would love if they actully make a wild west toy line of the kens and finally give ken the horse we want obviusly he dont want to be a ruler he want to be a cowboy and his own dream wild west casadogohouse it mean its basicly free money",2023-07-24 06:43:13
"i literally can’t believe that mattel approved this and i mean that in a good way  a pg13 barbie movie that pokes fun at the company and the toy and also is buried with messages of rejecting capitalism  holy   
  
it’s a great movie really the only thing barbie could have been in 2023 but wow  major props to mattel for letting it happen as a result i will gladly give them money for some sweet official kenough threads",2023-07-21 10:17:49
great movie but like how much did chevy pay for that chase scene lol,2023-07-21 02:53:58
i need that hoodie,2023-07-21 03:40:15
loved it but definitely feel like the first half was better than the second,2023-07-21 04:29:21
"the movie is working on a lot of levels and sometimes i dont know if it juggled them all theres the literal level a story of characters with motivations then theres the corporate satire level where jokes are making meta digs at the mattel company and then we have the analogy level where its talking about patriarchy society and manhood and womanhood

and sometimes the kens were analogies for manhood and sometimes analogies for how women are treated in the real world so opposite things and i just couldnt always tell when they were switching

overall i really liked it though",2023-07-21 05:15:49
for some weird reason i was hoping the mattel ceo would reveal himself to be a ken,2023-07-21 05:45:43
when they did that 2001 homage at the beginning i didnt count on the movie being trippy itself and it was after they got back from the real world,2023-07-21 06:03:01
i did not see that ending coming,2023-07-21 07:00:23
one down one to go,2023-07-21 09:13:35

"what was the quote at the end about patriarchy not being real

the narrator was talking about life being hard and people imagining things like patriarchy and another thing to make it seem easier

anybody got the exact quote",2023-07-28 02:40:01
just talked about some of the barbie themes in my podcast this movie was definitely one of my favs,2024-03-12 17:32:23
i would not think this movie is bad but it did not exceed my expectations i think this movie is playing a safe ground touching on feminism even though there are still a lot of men overwhelmed and feeling attacked by watching the movie it touches more on the journey of selfdiscovery and equality rather than what is being marketed about feminism the way they touch on feminism is too surface i kind of wish the movie could be sharper or more savage in advocating feminism overall i would rate it 610,2024-03-23 04:43:22
"feels like every time theres a movie with a ken in it hes a villain its kind of overplayed at this point

edit i should clarify i meant villain like antagonist not as in hes evil i just meant that like overall its a pretty good characterization of ken in this film but for me its a little eyerolly because any major film thats like a comedic take on the barbie franchise the first thing they do is make ken some sort of  antagonist yknow

ken is pretty much never the antagonist and is always on barbies side in basically any barbie media outside of movies like greta gerwigs barbie or toy story 3",2023-07-21 12:07:22
thought the second act kind of dragged and was a bit preachy but overall would recommend,2023-07-21 02:27:07
"i appreciate the resolution to the ken vs barbie conflict at the end  i read that most people prefer if the barbies didnt support the status quo and created a new government that included men equally 

however this would give us an all too easy fairy tale ending where everyone lives happily ever when in reality happily after doesnt exist  a happy and perfect resolution only serves to make us feel good in the theatre and forget that we still live with the status quo once we exit said theatre  i find this fairy tale ending highly patronizing

women still have to work harder to even stand out for a promotion against a male competitor  women get generally paid lower and are usually not in positions of power compared to men   women have even less bodily autonomy in the us than men

if anything this is a realistic ending  its an ending that is designed to encourage discourse and to encourage everyone to challenge the status quo in hopes of a better future for both sexes  after all if stereotypical barbie can create waves in barbieworld so too can we in the real world",2023-07-22 21:24:20
“i’m a man with no power does that make me a woman” the funniest line to me but there’s a lot of competition,2023-07-21 04:07:04
"i just saw the movie and i dont think this movie will do well in any non english speaking countries yall i was one of the 6 people in the theater and i was the one mostly laughing at the jokes and some of the references that i can get i might be wrong to think that people would show up with the internet hype for barbenheimer but  safe to say that most of the asians especially men wouldnt wanna step into a movie named barbie  even if they did come expecting a light hearted fun movie i dont think they will be satisfied i enjoyed the movie very much but there is a lingering feeling that i could have enjoyed it more with people around but sadly they were close to none 


 i felt like it could have been way more fun along with keeping the message intact but the movie doesnt feel like it has high and lows imo dont come for me i dont know why the ceo and his crew were so  in the real world and the conflict between america and her daughter isnt that well established and sorted out like suddenly the daughter is team barbie i really enjoyed the movie but i think i left a little bit disappointed",2023-07-21 07:48:25
"i agree with everyone saying we need an official i am kenough hoodie  the kens of the world have spoken

what a fantastic and fun movie the set design was absolutely incredible and so were the wardrobes such great integration of soundtrack and voiceovers i’ve always loved ryan goslings comedic chops and thought people have been sleeping on him as just some generic pretty boy but i’m happy to see people agree that he kinda stole the show this movie he was fantastic and had me cracking up constantly margot was amazing as the lead as well will farrell and the suits had me laughing more than i was expecting too had some serious themesmessages but all in all a really fun colorful time 

can’t believe we are alive to see barbenheimer weekend ",2023-07-21 09:32:29
this was a really great film and honestly for me very timely the conclusion and realizations about life and masculinity that ken has at the end of the film were ones i myself made literally two weeks ago unexpectedly poignant,2023-07-21 17:23:53
"gosling was hilarious 

everything else eh a neat movie nonetheless",2023-07-22 13:46:01
it just left me wondering what mattel is trying to do with this movie is the point to make hesitant parents who understand barbies problematic history more comfortable buying them for their children again,2023-07-22 17:32:26
very fun directing some great jokes and homages but ultimately im leaving the theatre confused like i couldnt really figure the movie out am i just not the target audience being a man without much experience discussing gender,2023-07-23 22:48:56
"some spoilers ahead‼

i’m going to be honest i think this is one of my new alltime favorite films it was such a creative take on the doll we all know and love the attention to detail in the set and the fashion was iconic it made my inner child happy i love the historical elements of mattel embedded into the film and the writing was sublime… the dialogue between the characters and the overall empowering messages from the film that the audience could relate to we all struggle with insecurities to some extent so i appreciated the theme of selfloveacceptance my other main takeaways were you shouldn’t spend your life trying to define yourself through someone else enjoy the simple pleasures in life knowing your worth it’s ok for both men and women to show vulnerability you are not defined by your career confronting mortality and recognizing the beauty of imperfectionspain another detail i loved was the diversity of the cast… since barbie is supposed to represent girls that can be anything it was nice to see the idea of various  backgrounds represented 

margot robbie is barbie i couldn’t think of a better person to play this character ryan gosling honestly was the star every scene he was in i loved his rivalry with simu liu that dance off scene was iconic… or should i say beach off  don’t get me started with the horses i was laughing way too hard  alan and “weird barbie” were super fun characters america ferrera’s dialogue was amazing i also loved the cameo with the “creator” of barbie and the dialogue between the two of them the ending resonated with me and made me tear up a bit i think this movie will stand the test of time and become a frequently revisited classic it’s a perfect balance of wacky fun and depth completely worth the hype beautiful film 55 stars ",2023-07-25 11:31:06
i enjoyed it ryan gosling lifts this movie to a new level he was great it could have had less of a men dumb and bad women smart and good preachiness in my opinion kens are treated like  and in the end that doesnt change at all i also didnt like the monologue about how being a woman is sooooo tough kind of tired of the feminist narrative thats not about showing how women are capable but rather about showing that men are trash and the rest of the world is to blame for all your problems,2023-07-22 07:24:51
"let the downvotes rain baby i called it  ken was the villain at the end the whole movie was commentary on how women and men should go their separate ways how men can only be incels or misogynists and that women are the future lets get this straight  barbies have all of the power ken discovers what feels like to be in power and wants this for the people like him as well switches how things are in barbieland barbie turn kens against each other and everything goes back to how it was with the barbies in charge what exactly this tells us did i miss the point also ken learns that he needs to be independent from barbie while literally still being second to barbie who breaks free and becomes a human being because women are the enlightened the future while men are these idiots who can not live without women and have to still learn to be independent i have to call all of my single male friends who have refused to be in a relationship because women are high maintenance and let them know that they are the peak of what men can be but this is only about incels yeah right like the whole feminist movement lately have been anything but men bad women best 

after this brief feat of rage  i support the message though  my existence does not depend on a barbie i have to be my best self for me and my happiness should not be tied to another person i am still not sure if feminists wants us to be equal in society but at least ken at the end had a redeeming and empowering moment and did not die as ignorant villain for which i should be thankful i guess",2023-07-21 05:34:01
"this just didn’t work for me the first 20 minutes when they are in the barbie world was great they hit all the notes and understood the satire of the movie quickly it spirals to some preachy self righteous lecture circuit about margot robbie not feeling fulfilled or wanting to be all powerful i was confused by the messaging and thought they didn’t really know what they wanted to accomplish or realistically say should women rule the world or should men they throw in a ken find your own path effort at the end but this is after we’ve seen the barbies saying under no circumstance should kens think to hard past the beach they had ideas and wrote around them instead of knowing how to accomplish their story just wasn’t for me i will be on the short side of this

robbie looks like barbie and ryan gosling steals the show and looks as if he was made of chiseled well sculpted plastic the will ferrell subplot is unknowingly confounding  to me just why the ferrell schtick is tired and again what was that entire subplot about it had no pull to it and if you eliminate it completely nothing is lost even american ferraro and her wiser then thou kid was a story that they didn’t really flush out past ‘let’s get back so we can get to the ken takeover story line’ in the end the mom gives a speech and suddenly barbies rule the world again which is the counter opposite of what they opposed with the kens rule that’s the best they could come up with it seems they want to say be yourself but be what’s been designed for you to beafter all the barbies profession are predetermined and don’t let mean rule but really women shouldn’t fully rule either idk and when all else is lost rhea pearlman will speak to us prolonging the movie for 10 unneeded minutes about the joys of the human species… but wasn’t barbielands messaging to be who you are which was a barbie 

the ken thing with barbie not being interested in him is confusing also… so if you are a noble prize winner that’s what you are if you are president that’s what you are but if you are literally barbie and ken we’ll barbie doesn’t need to be with ken which fine ok but doesn’t that mean the noble prize winner should be able to be anything she wants idk 

in a day where i saw the story of the man who created the atomic bomb and barbie i really didn’t think i’d be lectured more by the later

510",2023-07-21 05:17:28
"spoiler alert

i loved the costume design and some of the messaging was great but i have this awful unshakeable feeling of disappointment i think im still processing 

some things that stood out to me  what was the whole thing on cellulite what was the point of that barbie literally escapes to the real world to “fix” her awful cellulite and flat feet then when she gets into the real world and compliments an older woman for being beautiful  it felt so…contradictory 

another thing that keeps bugging me is the way the society kind of ostracized the pregnant and weird barbies isn’t the point of a femaleempowered society to empower all types of women

lastly i totally thought the ending was going somewhere else i loved that mattel in the real world was grey and depressing lacking color and ran by all men i 100 thought that the end was going to have margot robbie walking into the mattel corporation and seeing the grey cubicles turn to color and women being on the corporate board and barbie ultimately taking a hand in actually empowering young women like she always thought barbie could do 

maybe i was expecting too much or maybe i just didn’t understand some of these pieces but at least the movie was a fun watch and it hit some good points in its messaging",2023-07-23 23:26:27
"i was pretty disappointed with the movie after all of this hype i felt like it was a lot of almost… almost funny almost female empowering almost individually empowering almost smart 

the barbie sets and the costumes were what took this movie to the next level imo they were masterful the story itself was boring also america ferrera’s monologue about the plight of women while accurate took me completely out of the moment of satire comedy and inference i really think af her daughter and the entire mattel staff storyline should have been left out they made the story feel very cliché… but not intentionally so",2023-07-26 21:26:57
"the first few minutes got me curious as to what the big social commentary would be following that came an hour and a half of what i felt like was an extremely shallow moderate and even safe critique of patriarchy the movie promised a lot but ended up making the same patriarchy is bad and capitalism is kinda lame quips every modern sitcom director seems to love
i felt that it was lacking superficial and ironic as it may be plastic",2023-07-27 03:31:24
"first of all it took me days to figure out what bothered me about this movie i had been thinking about it nonstop so that is a sign that this is very important movie also there was plenty of moments that had me laughing out loud and i mean like really laughing so i cant say that i hated this movie because i didnt but i also didnt love it like i was hoping to i did not find it very deep and several important moments irritated me like americas speech in the middle about the contradictions of being a woman and i am woman while true i found it cringeworthy and extremely lazy writing like ripped from a twitter rant five years ago 

i finally figured out why the speech and most of the movie bothered me so much hear me out

i have mentioned the the film didnt feel deep honestly it felt like it should be called feminism for outer space aliens part of this is because they way they stop the barbies from being brainwashed by patriarchy is to give them the speech but the truth is the barbies have never lived in the real world and only experienced patriarchy for like a day and they even allow it to happen of course they explain this with one convenient line about them having no defenses to it like the native americans did with smallpox or something what okanyway so theyre broken out of the spell by have these contradictions explained to them even though theyd have no concept of them whatsoever meanwhile we have an amazing start to the plot barbie because of americas character is thinking about death why did they drop this what a missed opportunity if they could have leaned into this universal existential feeling then they could have framed patriarchy within mortality and therefore shown it to be the complete waste of time it really is were all gonna die why be such an  etc then they could have explained that to the barbies and the kens too and it would have felt so much deeper and more universal

also like many people mentioned it did feel hypocritical to me in many ways and this could have helped that too i think i honestly think gerwig and baumbach did the best they could under the circumstances probably matel trying to create a marvel universe essentially and become hella rich while trying to be cool and culturally relevant so i dont fault them very much the film is very much worth seeing i do also wish ken had a better ending that he could have selfactualized a little more ryan gosling was so funny in that part and they kind of did him dirty he should have realized his dream of working with horses",2023-08-05 23:52:58
watched it and surprisingly better than i expected i felt casting was done well ryan gosling was great as ken i admired margot robbies beauty in every scene there was of her lol also kind of teared up at the end haha   what i maybe didnt like was how aggressively they sometimes try to push the message theyre trying to make would still recommend though,2023-07-21 12:18:51
gosling ken and simu ken should have kisses,2023-07-21 15:51:48

"i had fun and i thought it was really funny at times

its also a movie about barbie dolls like you could imagine a little girl in our day and age coming up with a scenario on saving barbieland from the kens

and i think thats fun

i dont think the double standards will age well though but its a movie for women and girls about barbie theres a message there and it rings true in many ways that said all men being portrayed as dizzy bumbling idiots didnt sit right with me anymore than it sits right with me watching old media and seeing girls being portrayed as dizzy bumbling idiots",2023-07-21 17:39:41
i liked the movie but ken having all the standout moments is a little ironic and disappointing,2023-07-21 18:00:26
"i saw it yesterday its pretty good and charming its not amazing or anything but its definitely watchable 

it didnt make me laugh out loud but it got some chuckles out of me and the entire movie is incredibly deeply silly it doesnt take itself seriously at all",2023-07-21 19:17:01
"the movie was amazing but i just had my worst cinema experience 

people do not bring children that do not speak english nor can read into a movie please",2023-07-21 20:14:11
"i was starting to become worried about three minutes before they went back to barbieland that was the only time my interest wasn’t at 112 and even then it was at like a 93 would they really spend the rest of the movie with will ferrell chasing barbie

and then they immediately go back to barbieland and any fear i had was immediately put aside that last hour of the movie when ken is revealed as the “villain” is the hardest i have laughed in the theater in a long time just nonstop jokes that fired on every cylinder for me 

to top it off it’s genuinely so  serious too america’s monologue and the scene with ruth at the end were so insanely touching and moving but it all works so well 

this is a masterpiece of a movie on both comedic and dramatic fronts no notes",2023-07-21 22:54:53
"marketing felt very misleading to the actual film an enjoyable movie but the 2nd half went into an entirely different direction than what the trailer portrayed

first half kept the film fun while conveying some deeper concepts then you see the barbies become brainwashed to forget their lives  worship patriarchy the executive board plays no meaningful contribution to the plot 

the overall message of the film was beaten to death by the end clearly conveyed before 15 minutes of ken having an existential crisis  barbies conversation with ruth 

not sure why the film pushed for that pg13 rating either by adding only a couple explicit lines still a fun movie with a good message just it missed the marker numerous times",2023-07-21 23:17:29
"did anyone else find the ending to seem like the result of too many cooks in the kitchen the writing seemed to just go all over the place with no real meaning and resolution that left you kinda like what did i just watch what was the purpose of all this 

i’m also going to suspect there was probably more planned with the mattel ceo’s that got shutdown by mattel i was actually mostly surprised how much they were ok with given how strict they are as a company",2023-07-21 23:38:35

i knew it was going to be a feminist movie but was not expecting the promen themes as well ryan gosling stole the show,2023-07-22 18:46:08
i clearly wasnt the intended audience for this film hopefully those who were excited to see it received what they wanted it seems at least that many commenters really liked it im still a bit perplexed as to how but everybody has different tastes and this just wasnt mine,2023-07-22 21:39:21
"i feel as though this film is being held to a weird higher standard than a lot of the other blockbuster films based on established ip that have come out over the last couple of years sure its not as good as the lego movie but it was more interesting than a lot of the other films this year the flash shazam 2 black adam indiana jones 5 fast x antman 3 super mario 

id say it was somewhere between a 7 and 8 for me but still one of the better bigger budget films ive seen this year i think only spiderverse is clearly head and shoulders above it for me maybe evil dead rise if i can count that",2023-07-23 12:37:51
its more a ken movie than a barbie one he has much more development than barbie and cant help but root for him in his journey of looking for self worth and not be treated as an accesory its basically a rebellion against their tyrant oligarchs,2023-07-23 20:26:36
a lot saying the feminist message is outdated would have preferred a more indepth exploration of feminism or taken it a deeper direction but like it was advertised as and was a fun and light comedy and i thought it touched on more serious and realitydriven topics well alongside the comedy and everything else  aesthetic acting soundtrack etc  i think is undeniably flawless it made me laugh and cry and met all the expectations i had from greta gerwig,2023-07-23 22:27:33
i feel like my partner and i are the only people on this app that straight up did not like this movie i was personally over the tone and style about 10 minutes in,2023-07-24 16:28:38
"this is coming from a woman that has seen the barbie movie im not on board with a lot of the messaging but in this movie overall it feels like an appeasement and simplification ultimately people are celebrating it as a winning message for women which is a shame because they arent thing beyond what is on the screen

barbie has never been allowed to be a mother why is that in my life i have a successful career and i am a mother although the world can make it difficult at times why are weand why isnt barbie allowed to have both mattel has never let barbie be a mom yet its  very real issue that women face in the modern day and age where we are force to be one or the other why isnt there an astrophysicist barbie with a kid

second the movie showed different kinds of women and barbies but in real life while barbies on the toy store shelf come in different ethnicities and cultures sure but they all look perfect with unrealistic bodies none of them have realistic body shapes and sizes
the movie does nothing to address the undue pressures of beauty standards and prefection that barbie has placed upon women for decades now 

there is a weird barbie in the movie because she was played with too hard she is barbie that doesnt look perfect with odd haircut ect reinforcing the idea that there is a normal way to look and a non perfect outward appearance is weird

all this to say its a movie and it overly simplified a lot in terms of messaging i dont think anyone should take took much away from it",2023-08-02 13:52:02
"liked the movie but the ending felt weak they couldve done more with the ken character

loved the snyder reference though wb hates the cult with a burning passion ",2023-07-21 17:04:59
"just saw the movie and i loved it even though it might not have felt very nuanced if you make your own perspective on the film it can give a very powerful message women are still held down by the patriarchy and faced with struggles everyday but we continue to live and find love in our surroundings even with that pain the reaction to the movie proves that things that are geared towards a more female perspective are still strongly misunderstood and undervalued 
 i also liked ken’s story i feel like a lot of people are underestimating it ken was a victim of the patriarchy even though he didn’t realize it like a lot of modern men i feel like it can tie to how men who are trying to understand what the patriarchy is  can take it to mean that they’re supposed to have some extreme amount of advantages over women and that it means their lives are supposed to be perfect so they don’t think it’s real because their lives aren’t perfect now he believed it but he believed that it should make him all powerful he wasn’t talented at anything that made him important and he was angry that barbie didn’t love him the way he loved her and thought the patriarchy would fix it he only felt valued when a woman loved him or when he was important like modern men he uses hyper masculinity when that’s having the opposite effect he doesn’t try to understand his feelings and value himself as an individual it just shows how toxic masculinity or the patriarchy hurt both parties not just women not only that but ken is used as a mirror about how most women are treated in other media an accessory overall it can be a very introspective film if you choose to look at it closely this isn’t a perfect analysis but just how i felt about it art is subjective after all",2023-07-21 21:12:00
"this film was so fun  and surprisingly powerful i shed a few tears towards the end and really really enjoyed the movie

margot robbie was incredible as barbie and ryan gosling was a great ken kate mckinnon as weird barbie has me dying laughing loved it",2023-07-21 21:41:18
"first act was great second act was pretty good third act outside of the ken battle which was brilliant was kinda meh a little too on the nose and i felt it sort of undermined it’s own message 

very solid 810",2023-07-22 02:48:05
if ted cruz didnt like the dotted line just wait until he finds our theres a transgender barbie,2023-07-22 03:13:31
i actually liked kate mckinnon in this ngl usually her schtick of being awkward and weird doesn’t work for me in fact sometimes it’s downright cringe and gets on my  nerves see her tribute to hillary clinton when she lost i voted for hillary and trump can  but c’mon this was cringe and her verizon ad but i must concede that it did work well for weird barbie and she was used sparingly to where it didn’t get old,2023-07-22 04:27:32
"in addition to the metaphor of kens being treated in barbieland how women are treated in the real world i think that it’s interesting to note that the patriarchymisogyny shames boys for playing with dollsbarbies the kens are underdeveloped because for so long and even still now boys were told barbies and dolls were “girl toys”…from who i’ve interacted with the people who miss the metaphor are the same ones who are telling their little boys not to play with dolls ironically making them the reason kens are treated like that in barbieland

i think the kens taking over is also very symbolic of growing up in society as a girl you grow up with your friends— guys and girls— and someday the boys you loved turn into misogynistic men like when did you start hating me why and no not all guys alan slay king is representative of the guys who stand by us even when things get rough 

i loved this movie and i could literally talk about the layers to it all day",2023-07-25 06:41:56
"i had a fantastic time it mocked without being overly preachy or condemning and it communicated its messages through an entertaining lens   

ryan gosling was everything id hoped he would be nominate him for an oscar at the least",2023-07-26 11:03:59
i expected a bit more of the movie it was okay funnier than expected but everything seemed very on the nose i was hoping for some more double meanings or hidden messages,2023-07-28 17:22:03
"there was just too much ken too much ken and too many conflicting ideas

the movie opened up a lot of ideas to explore feminism body image misogyny sexism the patriarchy motherdaughter relationships capitalism corrupt justice system etc   
  
and all of those got completely erased because of ken  
  
so ken had basically gone back to barbieland to turn it into kendom because he really really liked the patriarchy the movie showed this also in a comedic way and made it seem like the patriarchy was something so silly the patriarchy was just men being shirtless fur jackets and beers in fact the patriarchy was actually the womens fault because none of this would have happened if barbie didnt have girls night every night so  on that barbie because guess what all the other barbies are happy that they dont have to think and just massage the kens feet  
  
now i understand that all the barbies were like brainwashed or something but they didnt even explain that well and made it seem like women liked being part of the patriarchy unless someone snapped them out from it thats untrue no women likes the patriarchy and were perfectly aware that its happening  
  
anyways you at least expect barbie to step up and save everyone but no she begins to cry about how shes  and just lies down and does nothing i was really confused as to why barbie kept saying that she was   
  
and its not until sashas mom gives the girlpower speech for barbie to snap out from it but the girlpower speech is literally something from an instagram post its copy pasted from old tumblr it was all women have to be skinny but not too skinny like yes thats true but also youre really reducing everything into this sappy speech of what a middle schooler realizes if you remember greta gerwigs little women the speech that jo does near the end of the movie is much more in depth and explains a lot while the girlpower speech was barely even making a statement  
  
and somehow that speech saves all the barbies and then they hatch a plan to distract the kens and do so by completely grabbing all the stereotypes of what a women is versus what a man is and squeeze it into 10 minutes it was all very just femininity belongs to women and masculinity belongs to men haha like in 2023 come on  
  
anyways barbie gets barbieland back and ken begins to sulk he starts saying that he lost interest in the patriarchy when it wasnt about horses and that he just didnt know who he was if he wasnt part of barbie all that jazz i have a lot to say about this scene specifically  
  
first what the  it was just 510 minutes of ken crying and barbie having to calm him down by saying oh ken we know you started this patriarchy thing because i dismissed you its not your fault you can cry now we understand like no because a ken knew what the patriarchy was about he didnt do it for the horses he did it because he wanted power over barbie and b men being rejected is not the same as women being oppressed and harrased everyday fragile masculinity is not comparable to the patriarchy  
  
barbie had a line where she said i think i owe you an apology i was like why i thought maybe barbie was going to apologize for leading ken on because it was obvious that she didnt like ken in a romantic way she literally said i dont like ken the same way he likes me but then she started apologizing for having girls night and not appreciating him enough what if a man starts the patriarchy are we to blame his girlfriend for not paying attention to him  
  
i dont understand this whole scene at all im still confused on why ken was so angry enough to oppress the entire barbies in barbieland im confused why barbie had 0 character arc and was apologizing to ken and im confused why ken didnt even learn anything after that he didnt apologize for doing anything he just threw his jacket away and went down the slide while being like im ken like we know get out of the screen  
  
and finally the ending you expect everything to get resolved but it doesnt the male ceo of mattel continues to make money off of women and also contributes to capitalism by making an ordinary barbie the patriarchy in the real world was not affectedchanged whatsoever sasha and her mom is magically best friends now everyone forgives each other no one likes pregnant midge and cellulites are   
  
but then barbie for some reason wants to become human and i thought okay maybe barbie wants to go back to the real world because she managed to defeat the patriarchy in her world so maybe shes becoming an activist barbie or a feminist barbie and then it just cut to another joke haha and the movie ended  
  
i think the movie had a lot of potential and it actually brought up a lot of subjects to the table but managed to end it without a proper resolution if you asked me what the sole message of that movie was i couldnt tell you at this point its fragile masculinity i thought the movie would be more about barbie not ken that  got a whole song and dance break barbie didnt even get that i mean at the beginning there was a party scene but even then it was focused on how ken wanted her attention it was just all about ken  
  
i dont know i probably expected a bit too much from a movie from a multibillion dollar brand thats trying to promote barbie dolls i should probably just be grateful that there were some golden moment near the beginning",2023-07-22 20:25:36
who knew a film about barbie could give an existential crisis,2023-07-21 02:22:07
"ryan gosling was the funniest part of this movie for me him practicing how to say no by imitating the guy had me laughing for way too long the “i am kenough” shirt the odd fascination with horses that “sublime” i kept seeing criticisms of his casting before the film came out and in response i kept telling people to watch the nice guys 


i like the film but as a feminist who genuinely believes in the message it tried to get across about women just getting the short end of the stick no matter what i think the way they went about doing that was too… on the nose hollow i’m not sure what word to use exactly but i wasn’t a huge fan of how it was handled either way powerful message 


the end credits were so satisfying and fun to watch i’m not sure if anyone else noticed but the credits for gloria’s husband were the only ones written in spanish",2023-07-21 06:10:45

"when you google margot robbie today her search results come up with special pink sparkle animated effects all over the screen

i was surprised how not good this was from the trailer it seemed like it was gonna be a blast but almost everything in the trailer was from the first 20 mins of the film the rest of it is a slog and filled with weak jokes the biggest crime this movie commits is being boring i dont really have any interest in rewatching it and i dont think it will be fondly remembered,2023-12-16 03:00:42
seeing this when i have deepseated selfloathing issues relating to being a man was a mistake,2023-07-21 02:51:11
this movie is 100 for men maybe more so than for women  men need to be more aware of the tropes of masculinity while understanding the overall themes of what this movie is about  the men who think the barbie movie isnt for them sadly proves a huge point of the movie those who dont get the jokes are sadly not very bright,2023-07-23 19:17:10
"how did it get 90 on rotten tomatoes  

at best it was sporadically funny

the messages about feminism patriarchy and so forth were about as subtle as a sledgehammer

the ending had about half an hour of explanatory dialogue which killed any momentum

the ken songs at the end felt out of place

no one laughed at the mattel executives they were painfully unfunny

the mopey little girl became happy without a real explanation

the nicky minaj song unsurprisingly 

i did enjoy the space odyssey tribute  and the dance party where barbie thinks about death was pristinely directed and a great dua lipa song to boot  but then it sort of fizzled

i just dont think people can rate movies anymore its like when something comes along that doesnt completely  people just fawn over it

 this was not a good movie",2023-07-22 08:37:26

"maybe it’s just me but i def liked the 2nd half of the movie better than the first half glad that margot producer too finally got a big hit after a few flops and they could easily make a spin off on ken at this point

 the scene after barbie talk to sasha and sasha calls barbie a fascist she said a line not understanding what a fascist actually is

"greta gerwig has done something genius

she aimed the movie towards movie intellectuals whod understand subtle jabs at feminism patriarchy and current world order but in doing that has created a movie for everyone

and she knows how to make a movie like barbie

the movie had me smiling for its entirety while also hitting me with too relatable  at time amd also simultaneously highlighting feminism issues which are valid 

the final act again is a greater parody which on a superficial look will look like a manifesto of feminism but any able minded person who looks closer will understand shes just criticising that too much of anything is  and world needs balance of both 

also ken is done beautifully they explored rom com angle through him and led to greater themes and it worked 
man is going to be very relatable for too many people",2023-07-22 10:48:14
"the movie was ok really went off the rails for me at the end where they decided to spoon feed the morale of the story in barbie heaven fourth dimension and ending scene with barbie going to gynecologist what 

i wish it just stayed campy and  but tried to do too many things in one movie 

also correct me if i’m but i really thought the end result would be equality but instead went back to a matriarchal society very weird",2023-07-22 19:46:45
"i liked it 
simple shallow and yet nice message 

related to both barbie and ken throughout the film 

obviously aimed towards women but there are some nice messages for men too 

robbie killed it but gosling stole the show as ken

very fun movie i don’t know why people are taking it so seriously",2023-07-22 21:11:08
"i really enjoyed the movie i absolutely love how they went all in on the absurdity and surreal humor 

the ending was actually a lot different than i expected i was waiting for both the barbies and kens to learn from the experience as they had both been the oppressors and form a more equal society moving away from either extreme of toxic masculinity or femininity essentially the barbie land ends up going back to being a dystopian society instead of changing at all its a pretty dark ending if you really think about it now the kens know what its like to have freedom but are forced to go back into a life of submission to the barbies 

i feel like maybe the intent was to show barbie land was just as flawed as the real world which is why our barbie wanted to escape it and be a human but it was sorta disappointing that everything that happened was basically for nothing and the kens just go back to being second class citizens especially because we see they arent evil just misguided and they feel pain and emotion just like the barbies",2023-07-23 11:49:00

i loved the aesthetics but i thought the movie was boring,2023-07-31 17:21:06
some truth to the movie but the messaging is trash too on the nose also it’s 2024 and hollywood still thinks long  monologues to educate the audience on social issues is a good idea that  is lazy writing and cringe,2024-01-20 01:58:52
"i saw it last night and im glad i wasnt the only one who thought the message was muddled i got the impression we were supposed to be rooting for the kens until the ending a sentence ive read in countless feminist articles is loss of privilege can feel like oppression which i figured was the point it was an allegory for the real world until it wasnt it seemed like it would have been an easy home run to have barbieland becoming an egalitarian society and acknowledging that both the real world and barbieland treated both sexes unfairly in different ways instead during the climax did gerwig want us to root for the barbies  the oppressors  over the downtrodden kens it lost me there maybe they shouldnt have made ken so likeable

it felt like they wanted the kens to represent both andrew tates brand of redpilled masculinity so we had a villain to root against and an allegory for women prior to having many rights and freedoms so how does that work

also during the whole ken discovers patriarchy scene as funny as that was they made some weird choices some of their depictions of patriarchy were just men playing sports and sylvester stallone in various fashionable outfits which youd think ken would already have in barbieland if it was stallone during rambo 2 or even the end of rocky 4 id get it but i dont get how men existing and doing things is patriarchal i do get that the idea was that patriarchy makes ken feel validated in a way that he never had before but if patriarchy is supposed to be the villain to be defeated maybe i shouldnt have been thinking aw look at how accepted patriarchy is making ken feel good for you ken dismantling patriarchy and smashing the patriarchy are often touted as feminisms goals but the movie presents it being beneficial in some ways",2023-07-22 15:26:42
walking out of the movie a guy behind me told his girlfriend that it was the worst movie he’s ever seen and then he mocked america ferrera’s monologue,2023-07-21 05:07:05
loved it but i thought the resolution to the ken conflict would be barbieland becoming a land where the kens and barbies were equals rather than simply flipping it back over to a matriarchy where the kens hold no power and live on the streets,2023-07-21 06:40:25
i loved the movie but my favorite part was seeing the outfits of fellow moviegoers i brought a doll with me dressed to match my pink plaid outfit i got an outfit specifically for the movie and im sure im not alone it honestly took me back to hp midnight premieres and dressing up and really having an experience rather than just seeing a movie,2023-07-22 04:53:25

"went in expecting a lighthearted comedy 

its definitely not lighthearted and while there are plenty of attempts to be comedic it just didnt work ryan gosling aside

the bigger issue though is the neverending spiel of howharditistobeawoman which frankly doesnt resonate at all in 2023 i could literally feel the theater cringe any time the movie delved into that which is often the western world has bent over backwards over the last 50odd years to ingratiate women into all aspects of society yet with the amount of whinging this movie does about supposed inequality youd think it was the 1950s it doesnt make sense at all",2023-07-22 04:02:33
the 3page monologue about the existential burden of women it was so hilarious and cringed me to the core a soup of pseudofeminist ideas muddled halfbaked subplots amateurish writing and some veeeeery heavy handed messages that literally stop the plot in order to be delivered pretty neokitcsh and elevated i enjoyed it a lot,2023-07-23 16:42:23
i’m still not over the scene with barbie and the old lady it was so heartwarmingly done and it’s a scene that stood out to me even after hours the lighting the calming sounds in the background the way barbie sounded so sincere and the reply with the lady’s confidence was just wonderful,2023-07-21 03:48:29

why did mattel poke fun at themselves in that way where it was gray and drab at the bottom office and then just entirely male at the top i guess i didn’t fully understand their own portrayal of themselves,2023-08-05 04:46:54
it was great fun when it wasnt drowning in its own surfacelevel commentary muddling itself up with platitudes to a point of even feeling a little out of date i love the ideas when you zoom out but actually sitting through the movie sometimes felt like a slog and way too selfserious for a movie bathed in such playful color id still recommend it as a fun time at the theater but i think this one might be predominantly for the ladies as a communal sort of experience to let out some steam about the garbage they have to deal with in this world,2023-07-21 23:48:37
jeremy jahns from youtube gave this a negative review calling it an on the nose feminist movie that he didn’t think was made for him he is not part of the right wing movie critics on youtube who are all hurr durr about disliking woke movies after seeing that i was thinking if this will be another one of those movies that divides the audience specially the male audience and critics there are a few here that shares his sentiment but the vast majority seemed to have really liked this and finding things enjoyable about it beyond it being just a fun time it’s interesting that something that can be called an on the nose feminist movie by some is getting that kind of reception on reddit i think my interest has peaked,2023-07-21 04:35:09

one complaint is how several of the jokes were spoiled by some of the trailers and by the narrator during the movie did we really need to be told that barbie floats because its like if a kid were picking her up would the audience have been able to infer that from a gag",2023-07-21 14:18:56

also america ferrerras monologue was too long i agreed with every point and it still made me glaze over it should have been redistributed in smaller pieces to be used to wake each barbie up that way they could show that she had as many reasons as there were barbies and could come up with something unique for each of them without ever running out of talking points done all at once it felt more like a grocery list than the getting everything off my chest moment it was supposed to be the way they had her list it all out at once and then only took waking up shots for the unbrainwashing montage while leaving you to assume that she was repeating everything again didnt feel right it felt disconnected using each point on a different barbie would give each line its own weight and the audience time to process it individually",2023-07-22 01:39:51
"more i think about it this film is gonna be like the next generation’s shrekelf

this movie was actually dope,2023-07-22 15:57:04
"i get the core message but i struggled to find myself enjoying the movie because the story was so much and then this happens and then this happens and then this happens and so much pointless fluff i just found myself asking why is this even happening half the time

like what was the point of allen kicking the  out of the kens to escape only for them to go back to barbieland and for allen to never leave what about the old woman whom barbie complimented for being beautiful i thought that was going to lead to going back to something elsemaybe her deciding to become human but it just happened barbie complimented an old lady sweet but why i know the scoobydoo chase scene in the mattel building was played up for laughs but it felt like we couldve spent a couple minutes doing something else perhaps expanding on the relationship with the mother and daughter also why was there a dragging scene of the kens fighting and then doing a dance number about how ken they are that scene just went on and on and on and it was driving me crazy 

it was an okay movie i think however with the brand they had and the message they were trying to convey it could have been portrayed or maybe better 

that being said costume and set design plus the actors cast were near perfect there were some jokes that got a chuckle out of me the 4th wall margot robbie actress breaking made me laugh and i am kenough was awesome every time weird barbie was on screen i was chortling and speaking of characters i do feel the mothers speech about women in the 3rd act and the message was very impactful if only the mothers character left enough of an impression for me to remember her name",2023-07-22 16:40:07
telling the story from the perspective of the villain was an interesting choice i only hope the kens are more successful in their next coup,2023-07-23 00:24:01
"honestly movie was a ton of fun absolutely loved it plenty of laughs in my cinema we had a good mix of dudes and girls the dudes were  cracking up with some hearty laughs so glad its been recieved well

i actually got pretty  emotional during it like if they stepped up the love just 1 id probably have been bawling im not sure why not sure if its because im about to have a daughter but it really got me and ive seen the same said elsewhere

but seriously parents can you stop taking your 6 year olds to 12 films jfc this movie wasnt appropriate for them whatsoever also theyre really annoying

i guess seeing a world ran by women whereby men come second and then seeing that destroyed by men spouting those podcast grindset lines really makes you do some inner self reflection on your entire setup

i think they could have done more mattel wasnt seen as some evil corp more ignorant and silly not sure if that was to get the film greenlit or something ken not apologizing for everything he did didnt sit right with me either but i just know if it did wed never hear the end of it so perhaps it was good enough to at least get a conversation going 

i think if you and your man watch barbie and he starts siding with ken when he makes his transition oh boy that might be a red flag time",2023-07-23 00:53:09
"barbie started off being fun because it was childhood nostalgia and dressing up in pink it was an experience not just a movie but it ended up being a movie that felt like a balm on what happens to women in the real world the real world is horrifying in our country in every corner of this world horrible things are happening to women constantly every day so to be able to go to a place where women are free can literally be anything they want to be are supported and are supportive felt surreal to see it made you feel everything you go through on a daily basis everything you overcome and ignore so that you can lead a normal life america ferrera’s monologue was amazing and in the words of ryan gosling’s glorious ken to remember that you are kenough that is just what i needed in the moment
to be able to revisit my childhood a more peaceful fairer world with fabulous clothes and gorgeous people what else could i ask for",2023-07-23 18:06:14
"i really wanted to like this movie but i was genuinely just kinda lost throughout it went from existentialism gender roles then to feminism then to patriarchy then to existentialism and then poof barbie is human 

and i feel like plotwise it wasn’t flowing at all like i had thought which kinda made it a bit frustrating and difficult for example i was expecting the plot to flow a lot like elf or enchanted in which someone from fantasy comes to face reality it didn’t tho  which is fine  but i was struggling to keep up with what was going on and what exactly the main plot was cause there were like 5 

add the fact that i didn’t really understand a lot of the references…and well…it was just a bit of a bummer 

maybe i am just not wellversed in barbie existentialism and feminism enough to understand as so many seem to have enjoyed it",2023-07-24 19:22:38
"absolutely loved it this was the first movie ive seen since before covid and it felt amazing to be back in the moviewatching experience as someone who adored barbie while growing up and considers myself a feminist this movie resonated with me deeply it beautifully depicted the complexities of humanity and the immense pressure we all face  
  
what i appreciated most was that it wasnt antimen instead it skillfully shed light on the harmful messaging that society imposes on all of us the films intention seemed to be promoting empathy encouraging us to view things from different perspectives and walk in someone elses shoes overall a thoughtprovoking and meaningful experience",2023-07-27 20:18:17
"the easiest way i can describe this movie is with 2 words wasted potential

i am easily in the opposite camp of whatever group this movie was trying to appeal to i didnt want to watch what i assumed was going to be a dumb  movie unfortunately i was dragged to this by a friend so i went in and tried to enjoy the movie

and honestly i enjoyed it a lot more than i thought it was a somewhat smarter movie than i initially thought and the camp was if not mediocre then at least adequate the production was insane even though most of it was filmed in a pink hellscape the actors put up a  of a job and did their best if i think of this as a movie then its pretty decent

except its not trying to be a movie for the sake of it it wants to be smart and intellectual it wants you to think about what you saw and reflect on it the problem is it is all over the place in what it wants to say it wants to empower women but has to do in the most tell dont show way that it turned right around to preachy and cringey it tries to show barbie joining the human world as a big deal but the movie just shows that she had a horrible time in the human world which just makes barbie look dumb speaking of the human world it takes up substantially less time than one would think which honestly makes me wonder if parts of this movie were cut for time 

thing is i do think if this movie were longer more could be done with the messaging and storytelling but also i am glad it wasnt longer because by the end when they just revert everything back to normal and barbie goes to the human world i find myself asking what was the point of all that worse as a guy i feel like ive just been told off for crimes other guys have done to girls if they had just tried to focus on something rather than try to cover everything from female to individual empowerment to why the patriarchy is bad this honestly could have been a great film as it stands its a frustrating movie that wants to be everything when it doesnt know everything and which thinks its smarter than it is",2023-08-15 09:10:14
"this was one boring movie i wish i could like it the themes seemed fine but the execution was shoddy gerwig couldnt drive the impact home story and characters all were unengaging

the production design was great ryan gosling and simu li stole the show margot robbie was very cool too and my  is she freaking stunning perfect choice for barbie",2023-11-15 11:41:51
i thought it was boring both myself and my stepmother fell asleep during the movie,2024-01-25 16:23:08
this is a movie that you only see one time zero replay value,2023-07-22 13:56:32
"i respectfully did not enjoy all of the barbie movie 

the characters were generally annoying and i found most of the plot points to be offensive to both genders though it kind of resolves this by the end it had some funny moments demonizing both men and women as a bunch of unempathetic  assholes as a core theme implying that woman has to apologize for a man’s bad behavior or implying that women in the real world are not doing enough but have to overcome their faults it’s opposite dayyou wrote the script into a corner no i don’t agree that men are responsible for all of a woman’s problems that’s ridiculous no i don’t agree that women are  subservient assholes either who was this movie meant for

the final joke in the movie after the cheesy as  finale leads to barbie being empowered to visit a gynecologist and then everyone faked laughed together fun

it’s fine 510

go watch oppenheimer instead",2023-07-22 19:48:59
"i really enjoyed the film it was a colorful romp with a lot of visual intrigue and a solid bunch of actors and jokes the film is very heavyhanded with the themes of matriarchy vs patriarchy but this is a great gerwig film what did you expect this is not a bland corporate please everyone film and thats on purpose 

honestly this feels like a vent film the monologue toward the end about the duality of expectations for women resonated hard for me its nice to hear those sentiments out loud some of them i had internalized without realizing it in regards to ken i started out in the first scene thinking man barbie should really be nicer to ken but in truth she was establishing a firm boundary with a man she didnt have feelings for the fact that ken went off the deep end because of that is his failure not hers barbie has to go out of her way to defuse kens emotional burden at the end of the film and even then he tries to reroute her kindness into a relationship to the point of forcing a hug on her ken is the epitome of a nice guy he wont take no for an answer and is explosive if he doesnt get his way once he realizes that is an option both barbie and ken deal with a lack of purpose but its barbie who turns that into something constructive rather than destructive

also the soundtrack is a banger several songs were written specifically for the movie and they are great tieins the opening song dua lipas dance the night away billie eilishs what was i made for nicki minaj and ice spice with barbie girl with aqua

edit a fun fact magic earring ken is a real doll from the late 80searly 90s designers wanted ken to be modern and hip so they went to clubs to see what guys were wearing only problem was they went to  clubs in the movie he wears a ken necklace but in the credits you can see his original design with a circle necklace lets just say it was a ring but not for your finger  the doll was quickly pulled but is now a collectors item and mascot for the  community",2023-07-23 07:19:41
610 im not sure how greta gerwig feels about barbie but it felt like another velma incept better in this case it felt like it was taking this beloved character and using this character to voice an opinion on society it was funny in some ways but after a while it seemed most the jokes were insults towards the kensmen in general and towards barbie for being imperfect at first i came in to the theatre as did many others expecting this fun enjoyable film about barbie and ken in the real world but came out with mixed messages its very memorable and the set and costume design is awesome props to that team but the messages were a little too much also id hate to be a kid watching this i dont think theyd understand a lot of it it would have been much better if both barbie and ken shared a land and a house instead of all the kens being told no that they couldnt have cool important jobs like the barbies,2023-07-23 09:37:08
"i looked forward to barbie but it did not live up to the hype watching it once was ok i would not watch it twice  


the good

 funny jokes and ideas
 set design
 acting was good especially ryan gosling where the acting lacked seemed the fault of the writer
 it was cool that mattel approved such a selfdeprecating movie

the bad

 the flow of the story
 the character development
 the message and emotions seemedforced

this movie had great skin but no bones it had great jokes great acting and a pretty good but cheesy song but the story was not compelling and felt forced i never felt connected to any characters 

the scene where barbie and ken enter the human world is clunky their realizations about the human world were fast and not believable the movie life size depicted eves introduction to the human world with more grace the first time eve discovers real food her reaction is hysterical and you believe her she is reacting to the world in only the way she knows to be fair i last watched life size when i was probably 9 so i am likely misremembering 

but when barbie and ken enter the human world they encounter very cliche events and their reactions and realization are too immediate i did love the joke where barbie thought the bathing suit lineup was the supreme court but then barbie immediately gets catcalled by construction workers and responds like a feminist professor pointing out they had an undertone of violence the situation was cliche and it didnt make sense for barbies character to instantly assess a situation she had never been in it seemed very forced and obvious like it belonged in an improv scene

in one scene barbie breaks down crying that she isnt pretty or smart enough america ferrera gives her a pep talk about how hard it is to be a woman this scene felt so out of place barbies breakdown seemed unexpected at no point in the movie did anyone expect her to be smarter or tell her she wasnt pretty it was unclear where this breakdown came from americas speech also seemed out of place it felt like a substitute for conveying a message through the story itself she talks about the complications of being a woman but nowhere in the film do we see her or barbie face those complications

similarly the scene at the end where barbie wants to be human seemed like the directors were trying to force the emotion

i expected the movie to combine legally blondes feelgood pinkfilled feminist plot and zoolanders quirky outlandish jokes while the style of the movie was unique the story itself did not come together nicely its disappointing because it could have been so good and unique with a more fleshedout story",2023-08-07 04:02:56
oh yeah women just pretend to be bad at every sport lol,2023-12-25 05:46:02
"really disappointed 

the movie ends with the barbies perpetuating the exact treatment that women of the real world face except against the kens is that really the takeaway message here that it’s okay to treat the kens as less than in barbieland since women are treated as less than in the real world seems like a huge missed opportunity to relay an inspiring message of true equality

on a more positive note margot robbie absolutely knocked it out of the park she was amazing here 

edit you guys can downvote me all you want but it doesn’t change that the fact that this is literally exactly what happens in the movie i hope with some time and distance you can see that",2023-07-30 03:17:34
"i dont get why everyone loves it the jokes werent funny it was too preachy and the story was awful like why did it have to be all dark and sad and the story is that theres the barbie world thats like when kids play with barbies but also they can cross over to the real world but also the company is aware that theyre real and humans can enter the barbie world but then ken brings back the patriarchy like its a disease and barbie doesnt actually like ken greta gerwig had the chance to make some changes to the barbie lore and she decided we should know barbie is not actually into ken why do there im not saying everyone needs a love interest but why break up an established couple did we really need that lesson about finding yourself outside of relationships from barbie and ken did we have a problem with barbie and ken being a couple

maybe what i disliked the most was how they painted their brand as if the barbies believe theyve fixed feminism and made everything perfect for women who here before seeing this movie thought of barbie as a brand that believes it fixed feminism and made the lives of women better not me theyre like oh were so naive and wellintentioned we thought we did great for women and girls but in this movie we acknowledge that in fact our brand isnt that perfect but im just like no i never thought you were naive and wellintended and trying to save girls i always thought you were just trying to make money",2023-07-22 09:10:33
"ok but imagine going to a barbie movie and your takeaway is that it didnt cater to men enough everyone complaining is literally proving the point that women cant exist or share experiences anywhere without men trying to make it about themselves 

i thought that it was actually quite nuanced on the take on ken and their entire relationship was really interesting to me loved the scene where he told her it was his house as a mirror of what shed said earlier loved her not knowing where the kens lived loved her apologizing to him for treating him like an accessory and gently pointing out that he can figure out what he wants to be without the external validation of a woman thats something that a lot of people really needed to hear

folks getting all bent out of shape about the lack of kens on the barbie supreme court im sorry i cant stop laughing",2023-07-21 17:17:50

packed theater opening scene parodying 2001 had my cackling laughing right from the get go i’m not even sure if anyone else laughed nearly as hard as i did at that but right away i knew i was going to love this movie and i sure did had a blast wasn’t perfect but easily an 810 had a good laugh throughout and was pleasantly entertained,2023-07-22 16:59:51
i just realized after the ken’s say while planning their war “how can we tell one ken from the other we should call them something else” that “weird barbie” is the barbies calling one of their own “something else”,2023-07-23 00:57:04
oh one thing i just remembered the whole barbie just gave up lets go felt so weird its a toy and her world was turned upside down and both mom and daughter just leave her like if we somehow find out we are only fish in a tank for some space men we arent gonna be cheery and resilient the same day,2023-07-23 06:11:36

"my mother just uncovered a nice little connection between the kens and horses which may seem obvious but only when she said it it clicked for me 

i could not explain kens obsession with horses to myself entirely before being reminded that there is this mythical greek creature called a centaur half man bottom half horse 

in my native language croatian the word is spelled and pronounced kentaur which makes the connection even more obvious unlike in english centaurs are one of the symbols of manliness virility male fertility which help connect the two kens and horses in the movie 

plus the name especially in croatian seems to be too similar to be a coincidence if they did any research on the symbolism of horses i feel like they mustve stumbled upon the centaur and a nonenglish pronunciationspelling like croatian or the original and most likely choice  of transliterated greek κένταυρος  kentauros

one word sublime,2023-07-25 12:13:32
"the more i think about this movie the more i wish it had invoked a disconnect between the barbies that were designed to sell clothes and the barbies with careers that were supposed to empower little girls our barbie’s existential crisis could’ve been boosted by her feeling out of place as a barbie with no career or purpose in barbieland slowly being phased out in fact they could’ve even shown her doll form in the real world as an older model passed down to sasha from gloria or even gloria’s mother as a representation of the first generation of girls who played with barbie our barbie’s malfunctioning not only because of gloria’s mid life crisis but also because her doll form is showing signs of wear and tear it probably could’ve made barbie crying over being  more impactful if there was a shadowy place in barbieland for all the weird and broken barbies that barbie was scared of being exiled to because she’s now imperfect

i found gloria’s suggestion of an ordinary barbie kind of laughable and underwhelming as an ending but i do think there was a way to have a similar beat and hit harder have her suggest ordinary barbies that don’t have to be hyperfeminine or perfect or need to be everything because it’s putting too much pressure on young girls like sasha there’s space for tomboy barbie and flat footed barbie who likes sneakers and the career barbies can realize they don’t need to be defined by their careers president barbie can be totally hair barbie if she wants to be and vice versa the kens doesn’t need a supreme court seat but they can start by being given their own careers and jobs in barbieland helping ease barbie’s burden of feeling like they need to be and do everything

and i said this in a different comment but i really wish they had acknowledged allan and midge are a couple and done more with midge than treat her as a gag really why wasn’t she with the rest of the discontinued barbies it would’ve been funnier to reveal allan is the only male doll with a successful relationship while the barbies and kens are in low commitment long distance limbo or worse having  a modern alan doll that’s completely separate from his 1960s version who’s in a relationship with pregnant midge allan doesn’t have his 1960s midge",2023-07-26 15:32:53

this movie was way better than i thought it would be,2023-08-09 02:26:17
i watched this movie last month and i really liked it  beside the kens getting beside themselves but the thing i would change about the movie would be that when they were in barbie land as the dolls they had more doll like features i like that the food and drink and the ocean was fake but i just wish there was still some more differentiation between the people when they were in the real world versus in barbie land,2023-08-17 01:11:46
"the best thing about the movie is how it addressed a lot of things in the most simplistic and friendly way possible the cast bar ferrell not sure what was his purpose there his role only amplified his negative traits like the overthetop acting in many of his comedies it doesnt fit the ceo thing at all was outstanding margot and ryan were perfect as protagonists

movie was fun and i think it deserved its massive success maybe people is too cynical here and expected a more pretentious film idk i appreciate how gerwig cared a lot about making barbie and his mythos more grounded and relatable imo",2023-09-21 13:54:10

the set designs were awesome the acting was great there were a handful of good jokes the problem is this movie focused way more on being preachy than actually being entertaining its got redeeming qualities but  this thing was hamfisted

my date wanted to walk out",2023-07-23 22:15:39
i was looking forward to another well written movie with feminist themes from greta but the writing of the scenes that talk about feminism and the patriarchy was so bad and basic that i didn’t really feel anything most of the time while watching them also i feel like they could have added more magical elements to barbieland i mean there’s plenty of dolls and play sets from the animated movies that would have looked so beautiful in live action,2023-07-23 23:28:40
"
am i the only one who was so disappointed with the barbie movie it just came across so preachy and just too on the nose overall it felt like they had so many ideas and wanted to shove so many messages and themes all in one movie and absolutely none landed a strong impact 

like i don’t even get what the overall message was of the film because it was just too rushed the plot was so chaotic and nonsensical overall watching it it just felt like i was watching the rough draft literally every scene they just had to spell out what misogynistic patriarchal unjust thing happened and then further dissect through dialogue to me that’s when you admit you have a  film if you have to spoon feed every message to the viewer 

like can they not trust us to understand through their acting what the message is i would have loved if they told a simple story about a mother and daughter troubled with injustice and adversity and having barbie reflect this through her slow and subtle transformation and keep the bulk of the story with barbie navigating the real world instead of this random back in forth between the worlds the mother and daughter literally just felt like a random accessory to the film when they should have been the focal point and then make mattel such a huge part of the film when their purpose is so unimportant also just unfunny i love will but didn’t laugh at a single joke he said because again it was just too forced and then bringing the actual ceo for the tearjerker at the end but how can i cry when i don’t even know  i’m crying for “mothers stand still to see their daughters grow” um did we even get to  see that then the cliche  montage of old times family videos of daughter running and old women smiling while a cringey billie eilish wannabe sings in the background did not do a  thing for me 

just too many subplots characters messages shoved into a short  film it just lacked any depth or impact it’s about quality not quantity by trying to list out “every” issue a woman goes through in a random speech in the movie from a character that should have felt important but wasn’t because you didn’t take the time to give her any sort of backstory other than a measly flashback felt just so lazy and just not good 

i’m sorry i was so excited for this film and it did have many great qualities and did mean well but in my humble opinion fell so short it’s becoming a theme with a lot of movies they underestimate the impact a simple story told well can have rather than trying to save the  world and bring peace between the genders through an hour and a half barbie movie",2023-07-26 07:44:57
finally got to watch mannn im so glad i dont spend money to see this   for the past 2 months everybody was talking about how great it was so i was hype but my wife was just not interested she has good intuition,2023-09-22 12:04:02
"i was honestly really sad about the barbie movie the adverts surrounding it were misleading and the movie turned into a feminist parody with no solid plotline it was like it was trying to be political and comedic simultaneously but the writers got lost if they had wanted to make a feminist movie i feel like they could have touched on some other subjects rather than just briefly discussing them in an empowering speech that wasnt that inspiring 

for example barbie didnt actually help gloria with her reallife issues they just magically got resolved through the power of taking down kendom gloria was struggling with serious things such as thoughts of death and anxiety that she hadnt made the right career choices barbie didnt comfort her about her body changing the cellulite for example instead she felt almost selfish because she just wanted to fix herself these are real issues that everybody faces throughout their lives not just women but as the film was made primarily for woman empowerment it feels odd that this was not addressed because of course barbie doesnt age she doesnt have these issues but there still could have been scenes where barbie realises that she doesnt fix every womens issue just by having a ton of careers and clothes 

for example barbie didnt actually help gloria with her reallife issues they just magically got resolved through the power of taking down kendom gloria was struggling with serious things such as thoughts of death and anxiety that she hadnt made the right career choices barbie didnt comfort her about her body changing the cellulite for example instead she felt almost selfish because she just wanted to fix herself these are real issues that everybody faces throughout their lives not just women but as the film was made primarily for woman empowerment it feels odd that this was not addressed because of course barbie doesnt age she doesnt have these issues but there still could have been scenes where barbie realises that she doesnt fix every womens issue just by having a ton of careers and clothes ed this important issue under the rug i think its great to see so much diversity in the dolls and the movies but the diversity cant be acknowledged without realising that it didnt always used to be this way multiple movements have pushed for barbie to become diverse she wasnt originally created like that which is what makes it such an important moment in time for women everywhere 

another thing that wound me up about this movie was they managed to surround the major plot points about a man ken how on earth did they make a movie about a woman surround a man i completely understand the whole point of kens character was supposed to represent how women feel in the real world overlooked ignored powerless etc but i also feel like the story could have gone a hundred different other ways i am not bashing on ken or ryan gosling for that matter he had great character building but why did we need so much of it why couldnt the movie have been about barbie and ken discovering patriarchy in the real world and both characters discovering the good and bad elements of it when i say this i refer to ken more than barbie 

one thing the barbie film did not do enough of was address the discontinued barbies aside from the odd joke the film completely didnt utilize them enough as key feminist elements for example pregnant midge and growing up skipper were just lines to make us laugh how amazing would it have been for barbie to stand up for them to say there is nothing wrong with having a baby without a husband or puberty is nothing to be ashamed of this comment does ride off the knowledge that you know pregnant midge was discontinued for having a wedding ring on if anything the movie projects you can be anything you want  just none of these things or you will get discontinued

to be honest there was nothing wrong with the ending but also nothing right with it either it just kind of left a dry taste in my mouth for one thing a normal barbie i dont really see the point in that one of the main things i loved about barbie was that everything she did was an achievement whether it was a career adventure etc she changed from a normal pretty girl with a boyfriend to a woman with multitudes of potential there was nothing ever wrong with being normal but there is reason to celebrate her achievements as margot robbie said in one of her interviews barbie went to the moon before women even had credit cards i am not saying barbie was the sole influence behind feminism but  just seeing a doll doing something you couldnt must have made women think hey i want that too 

the move to make barbie human wasnt really something i was personally interested in i dont understand the flashes of people she sees at the end or why she wanted to become human i suppose it was to feel alive if someone could explain this to me that would be great 

i just feel like the movie didnt hit home with me because it was moving between two goal posts trying to feminist and trying to be funny there were obviously moments were is succeeded like when ken was playing guitar on the beach and he was like i am going to play for four and half minutes and stare awkwardly into your eyes  i feel like every woman has been in that position or something similar however aside from those few moments of reliability the movie just had too many balls in the air and couldnt catch them 

feel free to disagree with me my opinion isnt only the correct one and maybe my standards were too high but i just thought it was going to be super funny or super feminist which would have been fine either way i think maybe i need to watch it again to get more of a grounded opinion of it but right now i am not its biggest fan",2023-07-24 23:42:49
"as a guy i thought it was a good movie loved the visuals really liked the overall world building and humor  i absolutely loved about  75 of it  only a few missteps keep it from being a greatperfect barbie movie

1 the unbearable brooding femnatzi teen archtype being that i was a nice teen growing up it sucks seeing writers shoehorn the overlysmug negativeteen who also hates thier extra sweet loving parent archtype into movies where it serves no narritive purpose the daughter was unnecessary and really served no purpose plotwise  either cut her or at least make her a bearable side character

2they leaned into the feminst angle too hard while i am not a proponent for modern feminism in general i do think the male vs female partriarch vs barbieland was funny and could have continued  to fine throughout the movie if they would have just kept it light hearted and tounge and cheek as these are concepts that barbie and ken have to contend with during thier exposure to the real world and later during thier existential crisis  but by the time the mom started monolouging super hard with a feminist twist at weird barbies house it took a fun movie into cringey eyer rolling feminist propaganda territory 

up to the point in the movie  i was thinking how it would be a fun movie to watch with my kids boys and girls but after the narritive went full on antimale and the barbies started to  the kens and cause infightingwar i changed my mind  not a message for kids on how to treat the opposite  

also its always been a part of barbies narrative that barbie and ken were an item and have broken up maybe once they could have played on this but hollywood it didnt make sense that barbie showed no interet in ken  

tldr

 99 of the cast did a great job

 great visuals and humor

 ryan gosling absolutely killed it and stole the show

 enjoyed will pharrell

 overall a good movie that could have been great but was slightly maligned by hollywoods need to make everything a political statement

i was pretty disappointed with the antimen undertones in some of the plot elements such as the focus on the production company being all men and the general gaslighting of kens behavior but i think that in the end it managed to deliver a nice message about self love despite that i enjoyed the movie a lot and the art direction was by far my favorite part of the movie,2023-07-22 17:26:57
"a couple of things that bother me about this movie  after seeing all the kens portrayed as  and the real world patriarchy portrayed as buffoonish morons we get the scene with gloria’s husband where he’s mocked for learning a language by his daughter and wife  then again later when gloria is driving she mentionsimplies a older cooler boyfriend than her husband taught her to drive it’s a small thing but it’s just shows where the writers head was at that even when there’s zero narrative purpose for it the male characters exist to be mocked and shown as losers who their female counterparts aren’t really into

another point is the scene where ken is crying  barbie is telling him it’s alright to cry and the movie seems to be trying to send the message that it’s alright for men to cry and not be “toxic” and yet  the scene is played partly for laughs contrast that with barbies crying scene which is show seriously and as a sympathetic tender moment

so gerwigs movie is contradicting its own point it’s alright for men to cry but men crying is also funny and a subject of comedy to her there’s even a funny song where ken sings about his fragility so which is it is it alright for men to cry or is it high humour when they do does gerwig herself know or understand the contraction in her narrative choices for this movie
i just find that aspect of the movie is really unintentionally representative of feminist confusionhypocrisy",2023-07-31 10:27:52
"i saw this by myself today in a half empty theater i am obsessed it was so funny and cuttingly insightful at so many points i was shocked that i teared up for me the funniest parts were ruth bringing up her irs issues probably because i worked for a revenue agency at one point 
sublime",2023-07-22 04:51:42
felt a bit messy and lost its way half way through especially the real world stuff especially the mom and daughter but from kendom onwards it was a blast withot gosling the film wouldve been a real chore to sit through,2023-07-22 18:34:49
got a little heavyhanded with the message at some points but was mostly good fun did feel like not a whole lot happened though i liked a lot of the humour,2023-07-23 21:17:10
"i have some things to talk about barbie and another film being fight club so please be careful  
also please note i watched the film yesterday and thus may have forgotten some thingsmisremembered thank you  
barbie is a genuine companion piece to fight club both films in a sense encouragemay encourage a particular gender to become stronger and more capable particularly because they are being held down but in reality both are just using that as a way to appeal to talk about much more important and far more nuanced points in particular i have also felt fight club is really a film about cults while barbie is about power dynamics in general thats why it may seem that barbie is mean spirited because its main goal is not to be a role model for people to be it is trying to show real world dynamics not just in regards to gender but also media and social classes and even false perceptions in hollywood and leaving the doordoors quite literally open to far more stuff the hallway of doors in the mattel building its one of the smartest films i have ever seen but it hides it all really  well so as to most folks watching it dont get bombarded but its truly there
i think barbie is trying to be a crash course in power dynamics with particular focus to gender but also the other things as well in barbieland barbies are powerful and thus posses many of the same traits as powerful men in our world they are cocky frankly and not good people kens meanwhile are submissive to barbies who treat them as  but kens are also not necessarily the best of folks aka the real world this gender reversal stuff is obvious but what i think folks are missing is that this is actually a key to decode the whole film the moment you do that you realize in reality the film isnt trying to be purely feminist message but actually far more interested in how things today are playing out and have been and will keep being the real world here still isnt completely the real world i mean i know that is obvious but it lets you realize the points made in it are also trying to be satirically done
in particular margot robbies barbie hence forth just called barbie can be considered to be a powerfulsheltered person realizing issues of the real world and understanding the depths and nuances of it akin to the buddha one can say especially with a character saying my savior ryan goslings ken hence forth just called ken i feel is a more satirical critique of hollywood and media with its overt messaging but not understanding the truth and deep nuances of it which will actually make things better this is extremely well showcased by the critical scene in which barbie and ken do show up to the real world at the beach and barbie feels threatened not just by of course the awful cruel men but one can also view it as her feeling threatened due to the unfamiliarity of it like a rich kid walking through a bad neighborhood i feel this is most powerfully represented by barbie stating she has no genitalia to the construction workers while ken saying he has all of the genitalia and the construction workers reaction being okay now one can say this is obviously a way to represent how barbie shouldnt actually be subject to the comments imposed upon her but i also really really feel that this is a hint to indicate that hey guys its not just  which is absolutely obvious when will ferrel shows up
now before i fully open that can of worms i want to talk about ken ken i feel is representinga way to learn the powers men have in reality duh but also how many women are currently being in hollywood and media i have all of the genitalia bingo you know particularly i think ken represents i am going to get so much  for this negative folks who are supporters of feminism who such as many people and particularly actresses in hollywood are toxic by trying to demean men patriarchy is a substitute word for feminism remember its all a big gender reversal of particular note is how even then a thing about kens actions is how the other kens in barbieland actually do become smart and educated and arent completely useless at all anymore sure they abuse their power but they arent idiots now it is akin to showing that positives even out of that toxicity is emerging including int our own real world
okay now time to talk about barbie again so barbie is very much a representation of rich and powerful folks she just gets her new clothes with ken and then runs away not paying for them like how many view rich folks doing today the kicker being how innocent it is for her but then she relaizes the struggles of normal folks and how women and men are struggling more evidence to suggest that the film even if it shows women being unfair towards men at leats barbies to kens this film doesnt hate men but then comes the moment she meets the key to all of the films great intentions she meets will ferrel
will ferrels character is really important his pink colors and power clearly symbolise he is like barbie one could also say his emasculation to an extent is a nod to fight club and believe me there are far bigger nods then that the color pink it self is a big one but will ferrel is representative of the status quo most of all he represents how he deeply cares about things being the way they are for power and corporations they want things to remain cause they have figured out ways it can benefit them in frankly nuanced manners but still dont want that equilibrium disturbed as they are lazy now they may even be aware of reality he refers at the end to know ruth but as long as she is hidden away thats okay for him reality isnt of concern if it doesnt impact the image crafted now there is some falsehood in this as mattel literally in a sense is letting this film make barbie into a feminist icon but i feel that is represented as well with companies not being complete idiots to laziness if more profits can also be achieved its a unique thin line they traverse they are both creative and lazy greedy yet helpful changing and static they are enigmas that frankly even they dont understand in how they impact the world and are imapcted by it too but one thng is for sure and this gets more into the hollywood side of things a powerful and unnuanced image is appealing with will ferrel shooting down the idea to have both barbie and ken well represented
okay i relaized i skipped actually tlaking about barbie kind of stream of conciousness here but to talk about her i need to talk about ken again one of the scenes that caught my attention is when ken talks to a guy and hey says the patriarchy is very well hidden this patriarchy i dont think is a substitute for feminism in this instance but actually refers to have male power nowadays is hidden but it then does something really brilliant in my opinion and has a scene i think years from now will be referred to as one of the greatest scenes in movie history the scene when barbie meets ruth in one of the hidden rooms ruth tlaks about her power and is literally hidden the main point of the film is present their power dynamics are way way way more complex then portrayed in general media we all know this as well its just a question of who ends up in the spotlight this hidde quality is amplified in babrieland after the kens take over with the barbies secretly reasserting power while being hidden of particular note how this is represented in the real world is by will ferrel as well he is a harmless man beholden to womens interests but the patriarchy is now hidden too
finally i want to talk about alvin and the family barbie is trying to help these folks are the real people who like will ferrel also dont understand their true power yet kinda may as well i will be honest i feel i need to watch the film again to make truly conclusive points regarding them but some ideas is younger generations impatience and also young childrens vulnerablity to media but also how positive role models exist trying to do the best they can a healthy power relationship a mom and her kids feel kinda  to call this a power based relationship other things maybe how alvin is really awesome but is  in both eras of barbieland how the common person is always in the dumps women more so in reality but men too the film nicely showcases this by showing how men out of power are still better off but still not as well of as powerful folks in general
as far as allusions to fight club there are literally two references to it with men saying let us help reflecting the welcome ad and the literally you are not your type of speech all the more confirming this films wish to be a companion piece to fight club which is needed i feel taking into account fight club is my favorite film as far as other things there are so many more little if not big things but for now i think this is a lot this film is way smarter then people are giving it credit for which is why i felt it was important for me to write about this  
if i am off please dont be mean if i have some grammar errors i apologize in advance thank you",2023-07-24 04:04:19
"just got home from the movie and  it was a blast i smiled through most of the movie and caught myself bursting out laughing too 

only part im still kind of on the middle on is americas monologue i liked the message of the movie but i liked it when it wasnt being so serious about the delivery it gave its message for most of the movie without breaking its comedic routine the movie just leans so much into humor though that it kind of caught me off guard not a bad thing but when you try to dance on that fine line between being serious and comedy it can be hit or miss luckily i think the movie just stays on the line with it though for me overall i loved it

every time ryan was on screen i cracked up the kens in general were just plain silly the watch bit killed me and once i found out they actually sold the im kenough hoodie i instantly bought it lol well played mattel  great movie overall",2023-07-25 07:59:46
this was so good a lot of depth to it and very clever writing i think it’ll get a best picture nomination and gosling a best supporting actor nomination,2023-07-21 11:39:55
any barbie experts in here was there ever a  barbie doll,2023-07-21 19:43:38
"im sorry but ryan gosling was so charismatic in this movie margot was fantastic but oh my  i have a crush on that man now

it was a great subversive movie it was politics done right and i didnt expect it to be so adult but it had me rolling 1010

cinemas back yall",2023-07-21 21:38:00
i literally cried so many times during this movie is it my pregnancy hormones or was it legit sadhappyeverything in between ,2023-07-22 19:37:57
" no this movie wasnt malebashing

to me at the end of the movie i got the message was there was love and respect towards menken by the barbies in barbieland 


all womenbarbie wanted was that if they are smart powerful they deserve to be president doctor scientists etc not saying men cannot be presidentdoctor etc as wellthis movie never implied this 

where as the misogynistic men are afraid of a movie that send this message that females should have equal rights want to control women they cant stand this movie because they dont want women to have have equal rights  powers

but again i didnt get from this movie at all that there was hate towards men the women want to be more powerful than men

people get triggered by this movie are the problems in our society frankly sad and embarrassing as a fellow man reading their  asinine hateful opinions sigh",2023-07-23 02:39:56
so based on what yall say patriarchy is bad and kens need to stop being so steotypcial and barbies need to help them but it ends with going back to the status quo instead of man and woman work together like we do right now,2023-07-23 12:28:13
i liked it barbie has always been a political statement im a man but not a traditionally masculine man so i suffer from the patriarchy as well i was bullied so i kind of feel for women since theyve been getting the short end of the stick for thousands of years,2023-07-23 21:19:24
"i liked barbie but surprisingly the crowd full of mostly women didnt seem to like it as much as me i was laughing more than them the part where america ferrera gives a long monologue about how women cant be this but gotta be that too this but too that all i heard was a woman behind me sigh  that monologue seemed to just pause the entire movie and be like ok just incase the audience doesnt understand what we are trying to say we will have a character explain it to the audience as if they dont already know 

even though i still enjoyed it there were just so many moments that felt a little overthetop like when some guy on malibu beach slaps barbies  and then she defends herself and her and ken go to jail only to be followed by 2 cops sexualizing barbie in the most unrealistic way its parts like that which make the movie just not as good as it could have been that scene in jail was only there to have 2 cops comment on how hot barbie is its not even a joke or anything so it just seems pointless besides arent men pigs 

so while i did like the movie it is definitely full of so many poorly landed jokes which felt almost awkward in an almost full theater with 80 women i expected the entire crowd to applaud at the end but when barbie title popped up at the end only 1 lady clapped",2023-07-25 21:23:27
"for me it was a meh story carried by everything else the actors were fenomenal the costume and stage designers nailed it and the dancers were a joy to watch on the big screen but then comes a problem with the story i have not seen mentioned it did not decide what it wanted to be too many mature and kinda flat jokes to be for kids of all ages and an inyourface feminist message that made it too much for those that wanted a light watch and not enough for those seeking an actual deep commentary on society the only one left is to view it as satire and just roll with its nonsense when characters act based on plot or joke convenience if they even matter at all if it just picked a side and developed that it would have been a lot better

power to those that got emotional and felt a deep conection to the characters but for me it did not even when i really wanted to so given that art is subjective in its enjoyment i think this is one of those movies that can only be graded individually by whoever watches it and also that someone might not like it for other reasons than being a triggered alpha male",2023-07-27 19:59:59
i didnt like it because it didnt make me smile and got bored too quickly the only thing i liked were the 80s neon outfits,2023-12-14 00:25:59
i read the wikipedia articles plot section and i swear to  it sound so horrifically exaugurated like it was made by one of those anti feminism channels that spew garbage and i was so shocked to know that is the actual plot of an actual movie made by hollywood i literally had a laughing fit ,2023-07-21 17:39:56
i can’t think of a single person who is better suited for this role than margot freakin’ robbie she absolutely killed it,2023-07-22 09:01:40
one of the best movies this year and one of the funniest i have ever seen,2023-07-22 15:08:12
easily one of the most joyous cinematic experiences of the year a frequently hilarious fiercely imaginative achingly heartfelt whipsmart comedy that gleefully satirizes the barbie brand — and takes razorsharp shots at the mattel corporation to boot — while doubling as a sincere love letter not just to the dolls but to the women and girls who grew up playing with them warts and all as well as to womanhood in general perfectly chosen ensemble cast,2023-07-23 04:19:04
"solid 710 really good ending scene but id change 3 things

1 more alan

2 plan with kens getting jealous and fighting to miss the vote was wierd should of ben more subtle and funny 

3 i was pretty sad that they barely had anytime in the real world i was kinda expecting a elf movie where barbie and ken are out of place in the real world like will ferrell in elf however it seemed like the whole film was in barbie land with it barely showing ken and barbie in real world i really felt like they could have let ryan shine in the real world with more masculine men humor and margo have more time being in a mans world its like they were there for 3 scenes and rushed back i wish it was more of them adapting in the real world and less barbie land",2023-07-28 05:17:32
all that girl power but barbie can just walk away that kind of spoiled it for me,2023-08-01 05:42:02
"feels like it steps on a lot of its social commentary back pedaling and overstepping on what seemed like clear subtext  but i suppose its subjective and opinionated what one got out of the movie you have literal manipulation as a turning point only to reverse that into ken not being sure of who he is not bad finding oneself but how the story got there was from a thematic point of view a bit backwords anyway a few funny moments a wellthought out movie regardless of what one took from it it had a nice aesthetic thanks to clever production design ryan gosling is very good

also poor allan movie just shat on him",2023-09-15 15:29:15
i’m not complaining but that felt like a super long snl sketch,2023-07-21 02:35:32
"this is my dumb take this is like barbie if it was an a24 film in the best possible way 

i have no clue how wb put this out and how zaslav didn’t try to  it because it is so unconventional",2023-07-22 06:47:43
good movie but the 3rd act was a downer greta wasnt given enough liberty imo there has been clear interference of corporate interests,2023-07-22 06:54:12
"one of the most 810 movies i’ve seen in a while i mean that in a compliment bc that is a superb rating but also a bit of a reality check to those expecting a 1010 masterpiece i loved it but it’s certainly a mess at times lol

the first act is some of the most fun i’ve ever had wathcing a movie the third act was also a great time the second act in the real world with will ferrell phew that was a head scratcher",2023-07-22 18:05:30
anyone else think they should get rid of upvotingdownvoting on these movie discussion threads i want to know what people think both good and bad people who didnt like the movie even if they express that politely are getting their posts downvoted so theyre hidden censorship is fine on other posts but for a discussion of the movie people should just be allowed to express an opinion just tired of having to click to see so many posts that are hidden,2023-07-22 23:38:26
borderline expected ken to start quoting jordan peterson,2023-07-23 06:21:20
"i didn’t love it and honestly that kinda jives with the point of the movie barbie can’t be everything for everybody and hit every note perfectly for the entire audience right amount of fun and satire while also making a point that’s impossible i feel like i can’t talk  about the pacing or messy plot because we’re all supposed to like this one 

idk how i felt about the movie kinda proved its point which is cool liked how it was both silly and cerebral even if a lot of the jokes didn’t land with me",2023-07-24 04:43:46
i appreciate this film trying to be absurd to demonstrate relevant social message but i feel like it didnt know how to use it effectively enough i think sorry to bother you did surrealismasavehicleforastrongsocialmessage better i also found it a bit boring but i guess thats just me i would of loved to see the barbies remove all their makeup and drop their pre defined roles as barbies to see true freedom from their box,2023-07-31 19:39:54
i didnt enjoy the movie so much some parts where great rest boring and nonsense,2023-08-01 22:38:17
"i have such mixed feelings about this movie the cast were amazing this was possibly one of the best allround performances ive seen with ryan gosling stealing the show in literally every scene he was in the direction and set design were also great they went  the style and it really did work particularly for the barbieland sections

but the writing was just so hitandmissy the pacing felt all over the place sometimes jumping from scene to scene like it wanted to skip through them with scenes essentially just being rapid fire jokes with no downtime then we had scenes that dragged on for way too long and slowed everything down the stuff in matel felt like this as well as the montage of saving all the barbies from the brainwashing i felt like i shouldnt have been bored but i really was during that montage and on that note i get to the messaging of the film 

i really wanted to go into this with an open mind but its hard not to see the issues with the theming since they had the subtlety of a brick men are  that seemed to be the main theme of this movie i think this works for the kens all the barbies and kens are these weird absurd caricatures and i think that absolutely works playing the hypercompetent barbies against the dumb himbo kens was a good commentary on how these toys are actually seen in real life i liked it the issue comes when the real life men are also all weird caricatures 

will ferrell and all his goons fun fact 5 of the 11 members of mattels current board of directors are women but lets ignore that because it doesnt fit what we want to say and the construction workers and the cops and just every male character in the real world was just a weird strawman and again i could get this as a general style but the real world women werent treated like this sasha america ferrera ruth the doctor ken talks to and the mum ken talks to were all played as normal real characters for the barbie cast to bounce off 

it just sits as weird to me the contrast between how the women were treated real complex characters with motivations who were meant to care about and the men weird goofballs who almost universally exist to be the set up andor butt of a joke oh and a special note to the joke where a brainwashed barbie claims that the brainwashing made her feel overly invested in the zack snyder cut of justice league which is not only already a dated and not particularly funny joke but also just a terribly flowing line in fact a lot of the quips were pretty awkwardly written and could have used another draft

beyond that the moments where a character stopped to look at the camera and rant about how hard it is to be a woman felt hollow and preachy especially as again kens own insecurities and issues which largely mirrored what was being said by america ferrera were played off as silly not only did these moments feel very soapboxy but they were just boring to me

there is a lot to like about this film there were a good few parts that made me laugh the pink song reprise with the new lyrics was genuinely great but theres also quite a few parts that made me roll my eyes or check my phone because it just felt like the writer using a character to rant which isnt particularly entertaining to me

this felt like it was going for the eeaao brand of absurdist humour meets meaningful and emotional themes and to me it failed because eeaao used its absurdism to carry its themes while barbie stopped its absurdism to monologue its themes at you 

also the kens deserved more the movie seriously took an abused underclass of citizens had them revolt and take over and then had the status quo restored and actively mocked them for being against it then helen mirren made some sort of weird revenge quip",2023-07-25 15:22:54
what the fk did i just watched bruh,2023-07-21 18:32:15
"there were 34 parts in the movie which got big genuine laughs out of me coupled with a combined 3045 mins where i sat there thinking “this may be one of the stupidest things i have seen this year in cinema” underlying themes were forced as well as the resolution being unrewarding and bland 

definitely a movie for people who value wacky social commentary over a real plot and character arcs 

unpopular opinion not terrible but not a recommend",2023-07-23 12:31:25
"i liked the movie but the barbies emotionally playing with the kens towards the end was cruel imo i was fine with the distraction plot line but once they were all at the campfires and guitars part and the barbies intentionally ignored the kens and tried to inspire jealously thats just  up hurting someone to further your own gains is not right

i think the ending shouldve had kens going off to create kendom next to barbieland or ended with kens and barbies in equal position of powers to those of you saying it shouldnt have ended like a fairytale i call  the movie spent the entire time hammering in the fact that barbieland was not the real world it would have been perfectly acceptable to have it end idyllically the way it currently ended made the barbies all seem like hypocrites for denouncing patriarchy and yet using underhanded tactics to ensure matriarchy having barbieland emulate the realworld but backwards might be a wake up call to the few dudes who actually realize what the message is women are still not represented equally in positions of power in the real world despite claims of equality but by and large i think most men and women who see the movie are going to miss this message and just be put off by the glaringly obvious hypocrisy instead",2023-07-23 02:48:18
"410 really disappointed actually started falling asleep near the middle of the movie
positives costumes and set 

my girlfriend gave it a 310 shes korean hated all the propaganda there a little less tolerating to all that over here in asia wonder what other foreigners will think

interesting side edit its scoring 5 amongst men in south korea and 9 amongst women

the reservation rating is also very low so possibly barbie fans draging their men to it",2023-07-25 14:25:39
"i’m not the target audience at all but i thought this movie was pretty meh the acid trip of barbie land at the beginning was great the comedy was also very good 

the story was a little disjointed and it felt like i was being hammered with the message the entire time which i never like in a movie subtlety is best 

also a female empowerment movie does not have to put down men and masculinity to be empowering to women",2023-07-25 19:41:39
"im a man 36 and went with 2 women
it was pretty good the feminism message wasnt as onesided as i heard pretty much both men and women should listen and care for each others feelings
one part i found a bit too much was of the real life woman who manages to unbrainwash the barbies
the whole people expect things from you and its difficult and contradictory well  men have the same issues different expectations but same results",2023-07-26 23:02:46
i like how this movie comes out and everyone’s saying barbie always was a pushing feminism and positivity…yet we’re  for years that barbie was awful and created unreal expectations set on women,2023-07-21 09:18:05
"the plot had a good start but about halfway through it lost me the end of the script seemed to have a hard time wrapping things up and i think the movie sort of vilified men everyone is a victim of the patriarchy and it poorly individualized men and their emotional agency with a lack of closure to their storyline in the movie not to mention how many monologues did we really need to understand the message of the movie 

it had a few funny punchlines and decent moments but the storyline was a little messy and politically radical i wish it was more tasteful",2023-07-22 04:43:13
"this movie really needed to decide what the audience was going to be the plainlystated preachy feminist themes were clearly spelled out for children and it ended up dominating the plot in the entire third act but a lot of the humor would go right over the heads of children that age 

to a kid it must be confusing and seem very random to an adult it’s condescending it needed to commit one way or the other 

also the plot was very disjointed this would have worked better as the long journey to find the kid that owned margot robbie instead 20 minutes we were in la was really pointless and in retrospect the trailer was a baitandswitch in that way",2023-07-22 06:21:28
"i found it to be a frustrating and unfocussed movie experience

the movie touched superficially on several themes worth exploring and for which barbie was a fine starting point but never committed fully to exploring any of them

it all felt very selfreferencial i doubt that many people will see the world in a new way thanks to this movie

structure and pacing were also an issue the movie felt very disjointed also the world building felt rushed and contradictory in several spaces

humor often fell flat the few really funny moments were all provided by ryan goslings ken

both robbie and gosling did great but the script didnt give them enough to work with imo

the tone was also a huge issue for me the movie seemed unsure whether it wanted to be scathing satire silly goofiness or emotional inspiration and it honestly didnt succeed much at any of those

i liked the concept for this movie but it didnt feel as if it went much beyond the concept

im pretty disappointed",2023-07-22 17:03:51
it’s incredibly disturbing to me that people think this movie is “nothing but politics” when the idea of barbie in general carries the exact same theme as the movie if you come out of this movie thinking it’s  on men for everything wrong in the world i hope you can surround yourself with people that can help you understand why that’s entirely wrong,2023-07-23 06:46:20
"i do think that the message of this movie is confusing

for example a lot of the discourse online discussing this movie isnt paying attention to the fact that the status quo set up at the start of the movie isnt supposed to be good

kens line of every night is boys night is just cementing the fact that barbies treatment of the kens is wrong but then at the end when it seems equality is reached one of the barbies completely undercuts it by saying the kens can have really low level jobs in the court or something so kens are still second class citizens of barbie land at the end

so if this is an anti patriarchy message by showing that one gender ruling isnt right then shouldnt it be an even playing field for both kens and barbies at the end or should we be taking away that its okay to point out that the patriarchy or a matriarchy is wrong but its fine to keep doing whats comfortable",2023-07-23 09:32:25
"the barbie marketing team definitely deserves a huge raise

seriously they did a fantastic job i went yesterday to see this movie and from the trailers i was expecting a fun lighthearted comedy movie not taking itself seriously that follows a similar concept to the truman show or the lego movie 

it truly subverted my expectations when the movie halfway through turned into a vice article about toxic masculinity and patriarchy i thought the whole patriarchy thing was gonna be some side joke about ken misunderstanding it and doing some minor shenanigans in the backround until barbie or someone explained it to him then it would be over i didnt expect it to turn into the main plot of the second half of the movie

i didnt get how ken even brainwashed the barbies in the first place but the scenes of the undoing the brainwashing was especially funny like how they were repeating stuff you hear on twitter or one of those banfriendly subreddits about toxic masculinity that barbies shouldnt even know about i liked the metajoke where they undo the brainwashing on a barbie and get her to remove her dressskirt because shes a physicist she would never wear this the joke being of course that the movie is trying to be so self aware it becomes unaware by imposing how a woman should dress especially a barbie of all

some people seemed to not like the ending like how they solved things by turning the patriarchy back into a matriarchy and not giving the kens equal rights but those people dont understand the message barbie world is like a mirrored dimension of the real world with roles switched real world of course meaning usa so kens being as powerful as women in the real world makes sense sure one may argue something like how real life society history and politics are way more complex and oppression of women is especially gone in the western world legally and culturally and the now self aware barbies with no complex problems could at any point make their world equal but you shouldnt listen to these kind of people

i dont know why the other guy and 2 girls i went with said they didnt like the political messages and couldnt relate at all i think the movie definitely absolutely needed those messaged and that they really really fit a barbie movie

overall i think this movie was great and a must watch and is worth a 7 or an 8 using the french grading system",2023-07-24 23:04:00
"i keep telling myself it was a fun movie but the more i think about it the more disappointed i get

just for context i am a 36m so sure i wasnt the target audience but believe it or not in a house of two teenage daughters and my wife i have been the most excited about this movie since i saw the first trailer the trailers just looked fun which is what i want to see i want to see a fun movie

i am not naïve enough to believe there wouldnt be a message in the movie for young girls i even welcome it my issue is after 20min of the movie all the upbeatness and fun of the movie disappeared it turned negative and kind of just stayed there sure there were still some funny moments but for the most part it was just preachy and negative",2023-07-25 03:50:36
"are people missing the point of the movie it isn’t trying to be nuanced about the commentary it’s providing its lack of subtlety isn’t an accident 

or are we just willfully ignoring that so that you have an excuse to hate on the movie",2023-07-25 04:22:40
did no one else think it was weird a movie about how bad the patriarchy is suddenly abandoned it’s female main character for half an hour at the end to give the biggest dramatic arc and character growth and biggest set piece to it’s male costar watching this movie was like eating ice cream at the gym and how did everyone who put on their pink mini skirt and high heels feel when the movie went out of its way to explain that barbie and her over sexualization was damaging to young girls the cognitive dissonance surrounding this movie in our current cultural landscape is head spinning,2023-07-26 16:01:23
this was a really weird movie the whole thing was an odd and unfocused existentialist narrative that didn’t quite seem to know if it wanted to be a comedy or something else the tone jumped around a lot i liked the movie a lot but i think a lot of people are going to go into it expecting an adult oriented lego movie and be very confused and bored after a half hour of not getting that i give them credit for doing something different as it would have been very easy to do a paint by numbers sort of film but i’m not sure the whole toy story does nietzsche vibe worked as well as it could have either,2023-07-27 22:05:19
this was a total miss for me,2023-07-26 02:11:53
"i just saw it with the wife and just didn’t ‘get it’ the messages felt a bit muddled and confused in what it was trying to say

 why was the real world so slapstick where america and her daughter were the only normal people really
 the bloke who was clearly happy they were in a patriarchy and hiding it better…weird inclusion

 i don’t think the movie addressed the patriarchy well it was a flat thing of ‘men have done this to women’ rather than ‘centuries of history impact men and women’s behaviour’ toxic masculinity being reinforced onto men by both men and women

they made mentions of stuff which would’ve been interesting to include eg how women cause problems for other women

was this meant to be a movie about mothers and daughters

i don’t get why barbie decided to be human at the end we had that one scene where she watched some men laugh and chatted to the old woman—but didn’t seem to have any major changes other than that

 america ferrara’s monologue about women again made it sound like a thing that was purposefully done to them by men…when many of the things she talks about effect both sexes one ways and then women have some issues men don’t men have other issues women don’t…or experience the same issues in different wayslike showing emotions



i’m guessing there was more story about mother and daughter in there originally and it got cut to focus more on barbie and the dad just chucked in there

it was very funny in places and i get some of the messages it was going for as a psychologist who knows stuff about sociology too but it was too shallow in doing them



i think little women by gertwig and ‘everything everywhere all at once’ covered some of the stuff about society and motherdaughter relationships better…maybe even legally blonde does ‘barbie feminism’ a bit better",2023-07-27 20:56:38
they’re clearly make fun of the kens by keeping barbieland a matriarchy but having kens continue to be side characters with minor roles in society the feminism is very focused on barbie and her self discovery it’s weird you’re associating that to ken when that’s not what happened at all the barbies defeat the kens by manipulating them to fight each other and restore control over barbieland not mention the amount sexism barbie experiences in the real world and also the mattel ceo being a reflection of them this movie is very women focused and pro women it’s so pro women that some men might see it as “anti men”,2023-07-21 02:17:10
"i went into this movie excited been wanting to see this since last year when i found out about it our theatre even got all dolled up for the occasion to include having a barbie and ken lookalike pose for photos with the moviegoers it really was a spectacle

all the good vibes died about 20ish minutes into the movie it really just seemed like this was the directors hatred of men being brought to bear as the barbies seem vindictive and malicious the kens are moronic manchildren and the end of the movie basically makes it out to be that the kens and barbies need to separate which would imply that they think men and women should seperate and that’s just one aspect

being a guy who saw the first teaser trailer back last year i was incredibly stoked but now i’m just trying to see what i can di",2023-07-22 09:46:09
"there i said it i did not like the barbie movie  
i had gone into the theatre hoping to experience some nostalgic barbie land moments to be filled with joy watching my favourite childhood versions barbie come alive on screen to sing “i am barbie girl” at the top of my lungs without a care in the world 
was that too much to ask for 
but no instead i got slapped across the face with so very many societal issues that i was just so not mentally prepped to deal with i wanted 2 hours of sheer joy but instead got existential crisis 
yes they were right 
yes it’s nuanced topic that needs to be portrayed more 
but a little heads up would’ve been nice 
i can’t be the only to feel this way",2023-07-27 17:01:18
there was a morbidly obese barbie but not even a mildly chubby ken wonder what that means,2023-07-22 00:19:50
as someone who puts christopher nolans work on a pedestal and thoroughly enjoyed oppenheimer barbie was the better movie of the day,2023-07-22 01:39:51
"underwhelming aside from the beautifully done scenery and national treasure rhea perlman would give this movie a 410 not very funny meh writing and overall just felt like i was repeatedly being clubbed over the head with an old message i see a lot of talk about “wokeness”  if you didn’t know inequality existed perhaps it was “woke” for you plus the storyline fell pretty flat in the middle

enchanted did fairy tale to real world impeccably well would be hard to duplicate that with the same success in my opinion",2023-08-12 01:20:00
i was also very confused to see half the theatre crying and the other half kinda sitting there like deer in a headlights my girlfriend turned to me and asked why everyone is crying and i didn’t have an answer the ending was sorta a jumbled mess,2023-07-21 23:41:18
i should have saved my popcorn for reading the comments and reviews by the easily triggered misogynists who were easily triggered by this film,2023-07-22 23:32:35
"the lego movie is my favorite animated movie of all time i put it top 5 movie of all time for me as well 


i love how that movie is so creative so funny so filled with subtle commentary and how goofy it can be i know its one giant commercial for toys and i know its made by a mega corporation kind of making fun of themselves but i dont care because its such a joy to watch 


when i saw that a barbie movie was coming out made by greta gerwig i knew it would be a similar idea to that i figured he would be full of social commentary and generally harp on society today what i was expecting was something subtle goofy and funny like the lego movie however the barbie movie is the opposite of subtle in any way the middle monologue in this movie made by the mom legitimately felt like a collection of tweets ive seen and it was recited like it was a stage play it was so bizarre it was so bizarre how this movie just felt the need to spell out every single theme every single time which is weird because this is greta gerwig and both her previous movies did subtly so well 


i am also disappointed at how unfunny this movie really is each joke felt like an snl sketch and the majority of visual jokes just felt so on the nose this movie relied a lot on randomness for humor that i dont really think worked it just wasnt that fun to watch outside of the first scenes in barbieland


this movie just felt so all over the place in the worst way possible and couldve used a lot more subtle in its messaging thats for surethe plot just felt so lost and uninspiringim very disappointed in greta i thought she would do better


a quick side note is the daughter character was just so poorly written as soon as she started yelling at barbie the first time i 100000 thought she was gonna call barbie a facist and sure enough she did that teenager was just a machine for buzzwords",2023-07-23 03:25:07
i watched oppenheimer and barbie today watched barbie last but tbh i wish i watched it first i watched allot of reviews and people say they were surprised by the movies story but the second they get to the real world it just became so predictable patriarchy and consumerism are evil i understand the message the director wanted to convey but it was done so poorly the movie requires no critical thinking skills cause it holds your hand and then just mansplains the message to you maybe that was point the director was going for not to mention allot of the characters weren’t fleshed out the mom and daughter honestly could’ve been written out of the movie without hurting any of the story elements it was a really funny movie tho and the ending was beautifully done but the journey that got us there felt like a different movie you can’t just  on a gender for 65 of a movie then switch up and say you just need to love yourself and not revolve your life around me like no duh captain obvious oppenheimer literally left me speechless but maybe that just got my hopes to high for the barbie movie,2023-07-23 05:58:09
you know i didnt think that saying following the teachings of andrew tate jordan peterson and all of those alpha male influencers is bad would be such controversial take,2023-07-23 07:03:51
this movie was so funny and had some really beautiful momentsi loved it,2023-07-21 03:23:04
ryan gosling going for an oscar for a comedic role vs robert downey jr going for an oscar for a very dramatic role is definitely not what i expected would happen it’s gonna be a fun oscar season,2023-07-21 03:46:29
haven’t seen this mentioned yet but after the ken fight kingsley benadir drops the dumb guy ken front and says in a very serious voice “we were fighting because we didn’t know who we were” that made me laugh so hard and i think i was one of five people that did,2023-07-21 04:05:44
"as a young man i seriously didnt expect to get this invested with anything barbierelated until now let alone successfully pulling off a liveaction featurefilm based on barbie for mainstream audiences to enjoy this movie has a lot of heart and actually thoughtprovoking at times while also not taking itself too seriously when news was first announced that a barbie movie entered production on april 2014 tons of users including me werent sold on this idea fearing it would end up like one of those cheesy barbie dvd movies

during my childhood i used to avoid anything girl related in fear of getting picked on or bullied by a few male students and friends i made during my childhood and school years before the 2010s hit there was a huge stigma  when boys would be judged harshly if they liked anything feminine and cute you would even be called or accused of being  just because a boy genuinely liked anything femalecentric and not interested in merchandise and anything made for your own gender tv tropes even has a trope about this called girlshow ghetto

craig mccrackens the powerpuff girls was one of the few exceptions because while it starred a trio of little girls with super powers it was actually unisex since both genders of different age groups were deeply in love with the 1998 series since its an affectionate parody of the entire super hero genre as a whole theres a reason why mccracken was reportedly  when he discovered cn decided to launch a shortlived powerpuff girls fashion line called dream in style and why the ppg reboot gained tons of backlash as infamous as brony community is it sure did spawn tons of decent content creators such as the living tombstone saberspark and jenny nicholson who started out making my little pony content before finding their own identity 


this is why i strongly admire sanrio since they managed to find way to drawn in other demographic from different gender and ages to a specific sanrio character such as aggretsuko sanrios first adult oriented series was specifically made teens and young adults mainly towards grown woman since it focused on japanese work culture but managed to find a larger audience when it became a netflix series before aggretsuko sanrio launched a series called sanrio boys which featured a group of pretty young men who are big fans of sanrio characters as a way to make male fans feel more confident of liking anything from the opposite gender 

i remember five years ago sanrio granted the film rights to hello kitty to warner brothers and new line cinema after a fiveyear courtship which was first announced on may 2019 cut to 2021 when it was revealed to be a liveactioncgi hybrid movie with users giving similar reactions to the announcement as the barbie movie did back in 2014 

hopefully sanrio alongside new line and warner brothers are paying close attention to the amount of positive reception and box office results barbie gets so they might go allin on a decently made hello kitty movie and future films starring sanrio characters",2023-07-21 21:36:04
"i loved it the jokes hit and i appreciated that it still felt like greta gerwig just on a larger scale i do wish the pacing slowed down at some points and that some of the narration was less on the head like talking about the weird barbie i think from the promo pictures everyone already assumed a child had cut her hair up and drawn on her but it felt tedious to go over that in the movie itself 

the plot was totally different than i had expected too",2023-07-22 05:54:10
so i’m just taking this movie as being gravik’s origin story,2023-07-22 10:13:32
i did the barbenheimer experience expecting it to be a lot more jovial but instead it was a little crushing in its own way too still one of the best movies ive ever seen though i particularly loved how it had content for all age groups and still managed to be extremely funny,2023-07-24 14:15:47
"i 34m did the barbenheimer experience saw oppenheimer loved it and then saw barbie i go to a lot of movies and i have never been in a theatre with so many women especially young women

i liked the movie greta gerwig is fun there are lots of laughs and i was impressed at how many bullets mattell agreed to take there is definitely some selfawareness in this movie i know there are lots of complaints about it being too preachy but i would disagree i thought there was good balance between entertainment and not taking itself too seriously with a good amount of feminist message i wouldn’t say it was the tightest script and i think the themes got a little bit messy in spots but overall a good fun popcorn flick with some intelligence",2023-07-25 06:35:48
"i liked the movie i didnt love it for several reasons but manly because it dragged a little with the mattel hq and the ken storylines margot was the best and i wish she got more airtime and that barbies storyline didnt revolve so much around ken in some parts they tried too hard to be funny but as charming as ryan can be kens part was a little to much i get that hes an  and that serves many of the arguments of the movie but my problem is that the movie tries to convince us that his bad behaviour is funny and it mostly isnt while also passing barbies distress as kind of a joke sometimes 
i also think the mom and daughter were a little wasted potential the movie plot exists because of the connection between barbie and the mother and it feels as if that plot was discarded halfway in favor of kens shenanigans there were parts i was asking myself why there were so many men talking but maybe thats on purpose to mirror real life
in the end i think the movie succeds in being a conversation starter its not an easy movie to make and interpretate and that is good its subtle and heavy handed at the same time and it tries to balance a lot it was impossible not to deal with gender if you wanted the movie to reflect the legacy of barbie and its impact on women and womens rights and the movie is successful in this
i liked the ending conversation with ruth the creator a lot and the fact that barbie turned from a reactive character to someone with agency wish we had a little more of those moments instead of empty song and dance numbers im a fan of musicals but these were mostly boring to me sets costuming hair and makeup do deserve awards for their fantastic work",2023-07-25 11:46:26
"this movie was such an interesting meditation on symbols i kept thinking about some of the opening lines of guy debords society of the spectacle
  
in societies where modern conditions of production prevail all of life presents itself as an immense accumulation of spectaclesreality considered partially unfolds in its own general unity as a pseudoworld apart an object of mere contemplation the specialization of images of the world is completed in the world of the autonomous image where the liar has lied to himself the spectacle in general as the concrete inversion of life is the autonomous movement of the nonlivingthe spectacle presents itself simultaneously as all of society as part of society and as instrument of unification as a part of society it is specifically the sector which concentrates all gazing and all consciousness
  
a pseudoworld apart where the nonliving operates autonomously presenting itself as both how the world is and how it couldshould be and which sustains its existence through objectification sounds a helluva lot like barbie land to me",2023-07-26 06:27:21
"is it me or the review are weird
one day i look amd they are at 35 on 5 and the next day they all at 45 or 5 on 5",2023-08-06 14:42:12
the fact that this movie was made while there are women being oppressed by there government is a dn shame we need freedom for all people now,2023-09-04 18:17:43
this movie made me feel so many feels i still dont know how to feel but it did touch the core of me and it has moved me and changed me i have always been a barbie girl  i knew the movie was supposed to be different from the regular barbie trope but idk i felt a lot of things i still cant put it all into worlds and its been 2 days now i would love to hear if it affected anybody as deeply as me,2023-07-21 15:22:22
i thought goslings performance in this was underwhelming his role in the nice guys is one of the funniest performances ive ever seen in my life and constantly had me in tears based on social media reactions i was expecting another role on that level from him but it mostly just had me exhaling out my nose harder than usual a lot of the humour in the film overall just felt like oh yeah i get it internet reference type humour rather than genuinely hilarious  idk anyway i thought it was a pretty decent film 77510 for me also the ending lowkey reminded me of end of evangelion lol i thought it was pretty cool,2023-07-21 22:17:18
"absolutely spectacular  we did a barbie oppenheimer double feature and cant recommend it more  surprisingly barbie was the more thought provoking of the two  im glad i avoided spoilers and whatever weird culture war was going on over this because i absolutely love sincere metamodernist works like everything everywhere all at once and once upon a time in hollywood  i dont just want to hear people complaining about problems i already am well aware of and live through every day in my satirical entertainment  i want to feel genuine and positive emotions and understand that we could do better if we would simply choose to imagine it

and imagination was really the core of this movie  i felt like the point at the end was a little too spoon fed particularly with the whole conversation with ruth and the male perspective was perhaps too subtle and glossed over but yeah its a barbie movie so okay  i absolutely loved how they juxtaposed barbieland as the result of female imagination with reality as the result of male imagination but i just wish there was more to drive home that point rather than ruth flat out saying something along the lines of whether its barbie or patriarchy its all imaginary  if the movie had made that point more apparent perhaps they wouldnt have had to come out and say it outright at the end

also the comedy was on point  when ken arrived in the real world it felt like an extended version of taylor swifts music video for the man and as a man there was a lot to relate to  i loved the horse confusion and the line once i found out patriarchy wasnt about horses i kind of lost interest  in fact as a man i really enjoyed a lot of the satire around the patriarchy because something thats often missed in discussions about it is the negative effects on men and i think discussing that more would go a long ways to deradicalizing a lot of the misogynist mens rights type reactionaries out there  will ferrells character and kens whole its so hard being in charge stuff was very on point

i imagine it hit harder for a lot of women though  while i appreciated the satire of mens roles in a patriarchy the movie focused more on women and a kind of wakanda for women of what could be if more women were in positions of power",2023-07-23 01:24:19
wow some garbage takes in here it’s a two hour fun party that gives you emotional and existencial scenes at the end a sort of pinocchio truman show vibes while also being just an overall celebration of womanhood but also individuality and humanity what’s not to like,2023-07-21 12:01:58
good but not that good of a movie it tries too slather on the sentimentality but it lacks a core message or theme so instead just comes across as hollow its worth a single watch as a comedy but its too incoherent to be considered a great movie,2023-07-22 12:56:12
"so underwhelming and downright boring at times felt as tho the writers didn’t know who they were writing for ken ends up being more fun than barbie what marketing said he’s just ken…

the part that really ticked me off was barbies plan to  and manipulate ken what is the messaging here for young girls toxic behavior gets you what you want so irresponsible and just dumb lazy writing 

lacked a compelling villain nope “patriarchy” does not cut it i would’ve enjoyed something that expanded on weird barbie possibly an evil barbie for ken to team up with and go head to head with stereotypical barbie throw in a bunch of other toy minions too but a woman versus woman conflict wouldn’t fit the agenda of this movie 

you have to go 1000 on the absurdity factor with this type of film or it falls flat it was so flat i was itching to leave the theater",2023-07-24 06:44:07
"i thought it was boring

it wasn’t a bad movie the jokes were meh the plot was confusing the rules of the barbieverse didn’t make much sense and at first i thought “well ok maybe it’s just not for me” but it didn’t seem like it was for children either maybe feministleaning women andor persons but even so it didn’t say or stand for anything i haven’t heard before and it seemed to borrow a lot from the lego movie—including will ferrel i’ve liked greta gerwig’s previous films but this one just felt eh forgettable 

also people dressing up for this film felt particularly cringe given they were paying to watch lighthearted corporate propaganda",2023-07-28 05:05:40
"there are so many contradictory messages in the barbie movie which tell you one message but show you another when it comes to men

the movie has this attitude of “feminism knows what’s best for men and has their best interests at heart” but also it contradicts itself and laughs at men for doing what the movies message says is alright and non toxic for men to do

so for instance when barbie cries it’s serious  when ken cries it’s played for laughs  yet the movie is also trying to give us the message it’s alright for men to cry 

the movie supposedly also tells us it’s alright for men to be who they really want to be and not have to play a role yet the kens expressing male interests is shown as a joke to be mocked

in my opinion the movie is on the same level as some old movie which purports to have a good potrayal and message for black people  but shows them all as stereotypical less intelligent and mocks their way of talking and living

to me this is a movie made by bigots and enjoyed most by bigots who can’t see the problems inherent in it or are able to excuse them for ideological reasons like it’s alright to punch up on your “oppressors” and i think more people will see it that way in the future 
some people may like the fun aspects and casting and just the fact it’s live action barbie and simply not consider those elements",2023-08-07 06:30:51

"this movie was really good the whole cast was great but ryan gosling stole the show for me margot robbie was such great casting for barbie the film really went beyond what you would expect and wove together a narrative about identity and finding your place in the world beyond what is foisted upon you due to your gender role it really shows that everyone struggles with issues of identity because of the expectations that we all have to deal with

barbenheimer was such a fun time at the theater",2023-07-21 21:54:41

gosling was the mvp liu was great and cera was used correctly     
    
kate mckinnon who i usually find annoying in her roles was actually to me great she wasn’t over the top and played that role right    
    
the battle was perfect i’ve never seen my wife laugh that hard during a movie     
    
good enough movie i was able to shut off my brain and just enjoy it

"it’s a meaningful movie for everyone who understands the concept of the movie but i don’t think this movie was for children personally it seemed more of a message to women out there which is understandably hard for kids to grasp i generally thought this movie was just gonna be an irl barbie movie but it’s not it’s super meaningful and very emotional

and also this is a part of the realization that we are grown and that barbie who’s supposed to be this perfect woman who has a perfect life and all is shown to also struggle with insecurities and also go through these difficult situations humans go through i don’t think it’s for children they are just simply not old enough to understand the concept of the movie they shouldn’t be introduced to that big world yet their still in their prime years and are still shielded from the world which they should be

and i mean kids as in 512 year olds",2023-07-23 14:45:34

it went from weird to silly to interesting to weird again and then the last 1520 mins went completely over my head

the message of the film was very nice too  very wholesome  the ceo and the production design was fantastic too",2023-07-24 22:11:06
"boring  2 out of 7 

will not watch again",2023-07-22 05:17:54
"saw it last night and didn’t like the movie at all for various reasons first the obvious i felt it leant into misandry perhaps more so than the director is aware she was doing with its portrayal of all men as morons or morons who are doing something wrong now i know this being reddit some people will be angered by that but i just watched thelma and louise which is about the most female empowerment movie there is and men are also on the receiving end of a lot of negative portrayal in that  but i never got the feeling that that movie was anti man in that random men who own diners or whatever aren’t just portrayed as  and to be mocked there’s the harvey keitel character who isn’t just some dumb mean man etc 

in barbie every ken and real world man is a  or a  in the wrong even gloria’s husband is randomly written as a goof who seems lame to his wife and daughter despite him having nothing to do with the themes of sexism or men holding women down

second imo the writing is bad plot lines are started as though they’re important but never really fleshed out academic style language is used by characters it doesn’t fit as characters become interchangeable voice pieces for the themes and messages of the movie 
themes conflict with one another so messaging is lost  for example ken is supposed to be both the patriarchy and the oppressed like real world women when he’s in barbie land so it’s like is this guy meant to be bad for standing up to his oppressors and the symbolism of him and the kens representing real world women is watered down because they’re shown as goofballs who don’t really even want to be in charge

basically there are way too many themes being presented in a small space i feel the movie would have been much stronger had they stuck to barbies original existentialmid life crisis story line with a side of women empowerment and made the other themes short jokes

third the humour was off for me there were some funnish parts and the weird barbie was a nest idea but overall i didn’t laugh much at all actually in long stretches the movie wasn’t fun in the least imo in my theatre most of the jokes didn’t seem to land but i’ve also heard the opposite so obviously some people thought it was funny there were a lot of obscure references that were slightly family guyish that didn’t work for me also that last  joke lol seriously that’s the ending

all in all the movie wasn’t that long but it sure felt long to me driving back from the palace i was worried my woman was going to say she loved it and want to talk about it but she thought it was kinda boring and just ok so that was a relief i can imagine this movie starting a lot of arguments between couples where the chick has gotten their man to go to the movie without him knowing much about it and thinking it will just be a fun romp like the ol flinstones live action or something",2023-08-01 05:26:56
"to the men upset about the way they were treated in this movie — why don’t you look at the way women are treated in the  you watch every day before you come crying to me

and that’s not me manhating it’s me being realistic that one of these problems is much more harmful has existed for far longer and should be our priority in what we tackle first and after we handle the way women are treated in  movies then i’m more than happy to look at how men are treated in the barbie movie

btw i watched thousands of men riot outside of my window in nyc today so i’m not going to be manipulated into believing the problem is me “hating” men and not their own behavior",2023-08-04 23:52:16
"first half of the movie was hilarious and great then they dropped several plotlines and gave long sanctimonious speeches about feminism that somehow save the world 

almost feels like the first half and second half were written by different people 

weird to have the moral conclusion of the movie leave all the kens homeless and powerless a basic work together moral would have landed way better",2023-08-12 16:22:22
if on brokeback mountain the writers dropped acid and played with dolls while listening to npr and cnn,2023-07-23 05:19:10
i did enjoy the movie but man putting all the funniest jokes in the trailer and commercials really made the whole experience worse don’t get me wrong they were funny jokes and i’m not letting the fact they were spoiled negatively affect my view of the film but still sucks on the flip side i may not have seen the movie if the trailer wasn’t so  funny so i guess it’s all good,2023-07-25 03:57:32
 amazing movie kate mckinnon was hilarious margot robbie was perfect as barbie i cried,2023-07-25 05:00:38
"watching the movie i especially felt that the speech of barbie exists without a counterweight leaving ken and therefore men speechless 
therefore i decided to balance it out by giving ken a voice as well 
i imagined a conversation about unrealistic role expectations that barbie could have had with ken just for both to find out that their struggles overlap significantly 
being convinced that due to acknowledging and better understanding each other society can truly move forward in the end nobody is or can be perfect since we’re all just humans…

i would appreciate feedback since giving ken a voice as an inexperienced video editor surely took some timeeffort 

  “what the movie missed”

what the barbie movie missed…",2023-08-24 08:29:17
"it was good i really enjoyed 

margot robbie was awesome as usual it was cool to see barbie world come to life nicki minaj and aqua at the end credits was like the cherry on top

the movie deserves all the accolades and popularity it received 

i regret not seeing it in theaters",2023-09-17 17:17:54
"the  cackles that went around the theater during the depression barbie ad was hilarious 1010 for them adding in pride and prejudice

also them bleeping out issa rae’s cursing with mattel was just amazing oh my ",2023-07-21 03:41:20
it’s funny because i watched this movie with my kid nieces both to be their cool uncle and as part of the barbenheimer meme but i never thought i would enjoy it as much as i did and better yet enjoy it way more than they did the movie’s marketing was very kidoriented as you’d expect from a barbie movie but the movie is anything but a lot of the jokes were surprisingly mature and some of the themes explored were deeper than i expected a movie like it to explore my nieces wanted to leave to go to the arcade near the end while i was enraptured all throughout,2023-07-21 09:41:47
"its a fun movie for such an unusual plot well executed 

barbies arc is very existential so kens arc is more entertaining",2023-07-21 14:42:59
ryan gosling should replace william zabka as johnny lawrence in cobra kai,2023-07-22 04:26:21
i liked the first 15 minutes that was the tour of barbieland and the last 15 minutes very sentimental the middle part was meh,2023-07-22 09:03:10
greta gerwig more like great job gerwig,2023-07-23 03:03:53
i absolutely loved this movie but i grew up with barbie and it truly felt like this film was aimed towards me very nostalgic even made me a bit teary eyed at times soundtrack was amazing was unsurprised to see mark ronson as the reason for that im looking into buying it on vinyl,2023-07-25 07:43:41
it was a fun diversion after a  day at work and nothing more i’m waiting for my bf to come back from his birthday trip to go see oppenheimer with him frankly i wasn’t really planning to see barbie definitely not with my bf but it was the spur of the moment thing,2023-07-25 12:27:53
"how exactly did the brainwashing thing work some dialogue implies that it was entirely kens doing and fault but i dont think hes capable of doing that like did he learn some kind of magic offscreen that lets him mind control people

another piece of dialogue says that barbie land didnt have any natural immunities to patriarchy but if thats true then why did the mother say to barbie that ken brainwashed all her friends it doesnt make sense to blame him entirely like that how was he supposed to know that introducing the patriarchy to barbie lad would rob the barbies of any kind of agency",2023-07-26 00:57:43
i will say i dont think the kens had it bad the first time around a life of being seen as eye candy sounds  awesome,2023-07-28 05:36:52
is the movie actually good or is it just a great message with impeccable production design,2023-08-20 21:18:38
"people wondering why barbies did not give the kens a supreme court seat after they stormed the pink white housecapitol overthrew all existing forms of government and almost ruined the entire city in a two days lmaooooooo

everyone is so close to getting it",2023-07-21 20:59:03
can’t put my finger on it but this movie did not work for me at all there were some funny parts but overall i just could not get into it,2023-07-22 00:52:47
it was not what i was expecting it left me shook but not in a bad way and it made me cry not cuz it offended me but because of how real and accurate it is it’s amazing it’ll make you laugh cheer cry and hope all at once,2023-07-22 16:33:23
just saw it and loved it great messages around lots of solid jokes i know a lot of people are saying ryan will get oscar buzz but more attention should be on margot,2023-07-22 20:03:48
"i’ve read many mixed reviews about this film but really it was pretty good and genuinely funny reviewers complaining about all the patriarchy references clearly haven’t noticed the number movies in which men take precedence simply because in those movies the politics are not displayed as blatantly as they are in this one

i feel that many points made in the movie has a backing for them in reality but it was extremely over the top in almost every way of course because it’s a movie a barbie movie if you actually think this movie is realistic in it’s entirety then you probably shouldn’t be reviewing it

go see it it’s definitely a fun one to watch and my boyfriend enjoyed it too",2023-07-23 06:57:21
i wanted to like this but there were too many storylines and a lack of cohesion from scene to scene each scene seemed to barely connect to the scene before it the movie also never established much less followed the barbieland rules,2023-07-24 05:33:56
reading the reviews on here makes me suspicious about the rt and imdb reviews seems some people here really loved it some hated it and a lot thought it was somewhat mid which tallies with what i heard coming out the cinema and irl yet if you read the rt or imdb reviews there’s a lot of ten star reviews that read like they’re written by chatgpt the studio apparently spent 150 million or more on marketing so who knows where it all went,2023-07-25 03:49:40
we both thought it was just ok once the novelty of barbieland wore off it felt pretty hollow and really dragged for us at the end,2023-07-25 21:37:01
the film could have gone in harder i understand why it didnt but for example barbie could have used the word suicide instead of dying since that is the ideation that her real world counterpart was fixated on america ferraras speech was wonderful and i dont disregard any of the micro aggressions and inequities she mentioned but while we are talking about the patriarchy we could talk about women being put in prison for having miscarriages or men being given lenient sentences because of what the 12yearold was wearing that night greta gerwig is a thoughtful artist and a savvy filmmaker and she knows the lines she cant cross but for people like shapiro to whine about the films message when it could have gone so much more for the jugular is snowflakelevel,2023-07-27 04:14:45
"this movie is overly theory crafted i swear it is just a movie about two individuals having existential crisis where one is breaking from their pattern of complacency while the other is seeking their purpose in life in the end barbie broke away from her utopic environment and embraced her humanity while ken stayed in barbieland and acknowledged that his existence is not tied to another individual that he is kenough

no barbieland and kendom are not representatives of real life feminism and patriarchy else we would have seen a lot of gossiping backstabbing territorial disputes and fighting over limited resources as we know that real humans will destroy each other given the chance 

so what is the moral of the story definitely not patriarchy bad feminism good because even ken acknowledged that he did not fully understand patriarchy and barbie chose to live in the patriarchy of the real world at most the lesson would be our system is broken but it is a system and love your mother

honestly this is a very light movie with good visuals so stop with the over interpretation and just watch and enjoy",2023-08-07 03:50:16
"just get out from the theater i was so excited by this movie i wear pink from toes to makeup 

never been that disappointed by a movie 

the directing is mid there is absolutely nothing astonishing production design was great for barbieland tho and it’s the only good thing 

there was a serious problem of rythm the jokes felt flat because of it the writing is prometheus level of bad 

greta gerwig being the first female director to hit the billion at the boxoffice is painful

i never get the hype around her her little women was atrocious but even more now

the film take itself wayyyyy too seriously for something that was supposed to be satirical and it’s the main problem 

the mother daughter were useless the character development basically inexistant or just « too on the nose » 

i love a good movie who call out the patriarchy this one isn’ painful it’s gonna be raise as a cult movie about feminism and i’m really  to have the same feelings as incels but feminism is way more than just misandrist boring message it’s not offensive for men at all it’s offensive for women and the plot should be lead by the actions with a feminist message not a plot leading by a message without being consistent storytelling don’t work that way 

moreover where was the fun  

it’s painful that a light hearted comedy like legally blonde which came out 20 years ago is a better feminist movie with a better writing rythm than a movie made by oscars nominees and i usually love what’s noah baumbach is doing 

good point  margot robbie and ryan gosling were really good 

the last time i was this  when i left the theater was when i had to endure a luc besson movie for a date but at least you know that you are going to see  yea that was  luc besson level of bad sorry not sorry",2023-08-13 15:14:50
"to preface i was excited enough for the movie to attend a thursday night preview with work the next day

the movie started off with so much promise set design and costuming was incredible the musical sequences were fantastic the cast was great but halfway through it went way heavyhanded and preachy then bounced around somewhat incoherently for a bit then concluded with one last retaliatory act against the kens for the faults of the real worlds exaggerated patriarchy had so much promise to be an alltime great but ultimately beached itself",2023-07-21 07:38:52
"everyone is going to rightly talk about ryan gosling but jesus christ if margot robbie isnt one of our greatest living actors 

she is good in everything and played an extremely layered character in a barbie movie she plays the vapid standard barbie without delving into caricature and was able to sell all of the additional emotions barbie is unironically in my top 5 performances of the year so far",2023-07-21 08:16:45
"this film is borderline a masterpiece because its just really clever it never really talks down to its audience and it is laugh out loud funny

the film honestly feels like a  though because it makes you question your position in the world the cast was great robbie really showed her chops in parts of vulnerability that could be felt and gosling was a powerhouse robbie is so likable as this character she was honestly a delight

the creative crew and gerwig did an exceptional job please look at the creative process it was a delight to watch this is a movie that really understood its assignment flawlessly also the ending line was so on the nose but hilarious",2023-07-21 21:32:10
i did not expect to enjoy this more than oppenheimer but i certainly did both very good films but man did barbie just hit it out of the park i am kenough,2023-07-22 04:04:27
i really wanted to like this but it was hard work and by the end was willing it to end the funniest moments were already and there weren’t any others either… in the trailer i wasn’t entertained because it was just an exhausting mess of a movie,2023-07-22 12:09:01
gosling was the star of this movie without him i think this movie is far far worse,2023-07-22 18:48:22
i was surprised that in a packed theatre of both men and women decked in pink many many of the jokes simply didn’t land i was expecting raucous laughter to permeate most of this film but it never really came the pacing was a bit off and the script was super weak at times imo and that was made more apparent with a stacked cast who you all know can act however gosling is one of my alltime favs and like every other project gives it 115 and elevates every moment just a complete star,2023-07-22 22:54:00
i think this was pretty good it’s colourful and fun the music sequences are pretty well done too the ken storyline seems a little underbaked though don’t get the hatred surrounding this movie men are victims of the patriarchy as much as women too,2023-07-23 11:05:41
i may get down voted but i did not enjoy the kens being played by the barbies around the campfire ken just wanted to be seen but also emotional wreck ken was too intense,2023-07-23 20:03:24
while the overwhelming majority of the comments are positive in best and for good reason i do have to laugh at those of you criticizing the  barbie movie of all movies for being too overtly feminist realistically even if the movies themes were more subtle you probably still would have taken issue at a womans issues being in the spotlight but stillwhat  the  did you expect when the director is greta gurwig and once again the movie is about barbie lol,2023-07-26 13:32:49
"i watched it with my mother and my grandmother a retired feminist professor tonight frankly it hit the right notes i would say we all enjoyed the film im trans nonbinary so i died laughing the entire time and the end made me cry  my mom thought it got a little too vapid with how they portrayed the barbieland but she liked the nostalgia of the various toys my grandmother felt it dragged a little in the middle but it tied the end up well 

usually one of us dislikes the movie we all see so id give it a recommendation i would say you really gotta be willing to take a lot of camp and satire about gender roles 

the movie is also very pink lol the aesthetic was interesting and well executed the actors all brought their agame kate mckinnon absolutely nailed it",2023-07-27 21:29:41
"i dont think the barbie movie really broke any new ground there was so much recycled material in a movie about plastic people kind of on the nose

in summary this lack of originality felt boring

i think every message they had to share with us was lifted from social media or from previous movies almost like an ai generated the whole thing it didnt feel like it had any soul but it was definitely visually appealing with how colorful it was",2023-08-02 12:22:19
"i came in without watching any trailers of this movie and the thought of a barbie movie was  but after watching it it felt so unserious and genius at the same time

910",2023-07-22 07:52:26
"so after seeing it i was hoping for more


it has corporate apologia and the ken issue i feel takes away from the movie ken is an incel but he is also a stand in for women in the barbie world which is already yikes on the stand in side the kens take over and everything goes downhill so its subtly pushing the idea that if women got power things wouldnt work out on the incel side the movie has barbie apologize to ken but i dont remember ken apologizing to barbie for how he acted


it says all the right things it calls out the issues that women face but its all just words its a case of telling and now showing not dealing with while the movie says the right words about being about women empowerment what the movie is about is more focused around the programming and deprogramming of an incel and that responsibility shouldnt be placed on women not that they cant chose to take it up but it shouldnt be assumed that incels are their fault or that they have to fix them


it made promises at the start that it didnt keep after the opening and later when both the mother and the daughter give their rants i wanted to see those issues explored instead of taking a backseat to some cishet blond white guy that cant accept a girl he thinks he likes not being into him i wanted more thank  im pretty why must women always take a back seat to men in movies


and whats worse it acknowledged the issues but it had to do more that its a better movie than most others but i think it still falls behind the likes of something like everything everywhere all at once and it hurts because of that opening promise if it didnt have those moments i probably would be less critical though still unhappy about making ceos just goofy instead of the sociopaths they are


​it had some catchy songs though",2023-07-23 21:00:48
i did enjoy a bit of what this movie had to offer it was very unique in a lot of ways and i was happy to give it a shot it really seemed original i just thought the movie was presented to me like an actual child there really werent any points in the movie where i felt like i heard something that hasnt already been said 100 times i get that its a kids movie so to them there might be something theyd never thought about or cared to think about and americas monologs at the end was very cringey its not that i disagree with anything she says really its just that it couldve been something so much more real it just sounded like something corny moms in the 40s share on each others fb timelinei know thats gonna get me down voted so hard but i really just expected more from this movie,2023-07-26 04:36:30
just saw it its boring,2023-08-16 03:13:32
"i absolutely loved it very very funny and a powerful message only complaint was that it did come to a little bit of a halt and drawn out at the top of act 3 

to the dude next to me who said america ferrera was talking to long in her monologue about what it’s like to be a woman your views on that are why you’re alone and sad",2023-07-22 03:12:42
"the comedy fell flat most of the time will ferrell and the matell guys especially

i get what they wanted to do and it was a decent film but felt kind of rushed when they only spent like 30 minutes in the real world

gerwig got her feminism through but without the stereotypical ”girlboss with an attitude” it was done in a nice way and they even uplifted the kens in a way

michael cera had a smaller role than i expected

margot robbie was good but man she is the prettiest person alive

ryan gosling was easily the best part of the movie",2023-07-22 06:46:39
i found the movie very fun and funny had a great time laughed my head off was generally grinning for the whole flick but the more i think about it the more i believe that barbie was extremely disappointing for its lack of any coherent message on gender politics power structures capitalism corporate influence on body image my problem is that the movie wasnt feminist enough it checked a lot of boxes when making good jokes but every time i tried to articulate the overarching argument of the film it falls flat theres no there there instead it leaves me wondering about mattels influence on the script and wary of the pinkwashing that the movie has succeeded in giving to this corporation,2023-07-23 00:43:04
"its insane that mattel actually allowed their brand to be portrayed like this the fact theres no women in their board of directors is a literal plot point and that the ceo makes a whole speech pathetically trying to explain it like i was genuinely baffled when that scene played this isnt a compliment or a criticism im just shocked

about the movie itself im sorry but its such shallow feminism inequality bad patriarchy bad people  for creating them and it sucks because the entire movie revolves around it i like the visuals i like the actors specially ryan gosling i was one of the people who thought why tf him when they cast him as ken but now i cant not see him as ken i even think some jokes were funny but i cant really like the overall package cause its based on an idea of feminism from a 17 year old twitter user like the movie hammers it pretty hard that patriarchy is bad and shouldnt exiast and it also makes it clear the system under barbieland is the same as patriarchy with the barbies being the men and the kens being the women but at the same time it portrays the kens destroying that system as bad and the barbies reinstating the barbiearchy as good and even make a joke about the kens not having a say in it

the implication here is that the barbiearchy is either a good thing or a inevitable thing that you cant really change and like isnt that literally the opposite of the point of the movie this just shows how shallow the movies messages are

theres also other stuff like barbie and ken getting weird looks from people in la theyre literally a pretty thin woman and a jacked dude if anything theyd be the ones giving weird looks or basically any line from that womans daughter or the cringy monologue the woman gave and thats disappointing a theatrical barbie movie that touches on the entirety of the barbie history has so much potential its super disappointing how they decided to do it",2023-07-23 01:38:08
i haven’t watched the movie so i’ll just say this there’s a youtuber by the name of the critical drinker and he didn’t like the movie you know when there are youtubers upset about a movie that a majority of people love that’s when you know it’s a good movie,2023-07-23 14:48:32
"it was crazy to see all the guys discussing how bad the movie was it seemed to really hit a nerve which means the movie worked lol 

i also thought it was cool that barbie is an idea and this movie felt like a projection of that",2023-07-24 05:33:52
"the only good thing about the movie was ken

i was really excited to see how greta gerwig one of my favourite directors and writers would tackle the concept of a live action movie i absolutely loved her interpretation of the little women and lady bird is a gem of a movie highly recommend since my expectations from the movie were so high i came out of the theaters very disappointed heres why

overall the movie felt like someone had an idea of turning barbie into a live action movie and all the interesting details one can put into it my problem really is that the writers couldnt come up with a cohesive plot to back the concept the movie starts with a barbie world ruled by barbies with kens having no say at all i think its supposed to be something that contrasts the real world we can clearly see the kens struggling with their identities and purpose however instead of showing their struggle as a real issue it is often used as a gag or a plot point that is supposed to show that the women are empowered or incharge ryan goslings ken realizing that men rule the real world was not used as a motivation but a villain arc even by the end the kens self realization was glossed over or used as a gag they were pit against each other and the women used that to gain back the rule instead of coming to a mutual decision how is this any different than patriarchy and i think this goes against the concept of feminism even at the end the kens were given token jobs in the cabinet 

my other minor issues arise with the story firstly will farrells character was completely wasted what was built up as a villain ended up being another gag by the end every male character in the movie was shown to be dumb thats not how the real world is history has shown that people who have made an active effort to suppress women are not dumb they are shrewd but clever patriarchy and power has been institutionalized to an extent that they use all their wits and efforts to suppress women i hate the fact that barbie had to do nothing clever in order to escape the people at mattel

secondly america fererras characters rant and support for barbie wasnt developed well one may argue her connection to barbie was still someone explained i would not go as far as to say it was developed but we got an explanation but her rant to debrainwash the barbies came out of nowhere there was one incident showed at the office her major character point was feeling disconnected with her daughter which did not tie into her rant at all we werent shown enough to experience her frustration this led me to think that by the end the movie became more performative than feminist 

also alan the only androgynous character who i think is supposed to be not straight but im not sure i apologize if im wrong but even if he were straight doesnt fit into the stereotypical divide of man and woman is never given any respect even till the very end like  this is not feminism

overall the movie did not end up being cohesive there was more tell than show and besides simu lius and ryan goslings ken other characters who were played by big names werent campy and over the top enough i have so much more to rant but im going to stop here

edit i have a lot of points that i keep on adding because the more i think about it the madder i get lol",2023-07-24 11:40:56
"the movie was entertaining and funny but the story and message was pretty bland the main ken was treated like a prop while living in barbieland and gets his only validation from barbie his frustration were valid there didnt seem to be a place for kens in barbieland other than to be accessories to their respective barbies then kens and the patriarchy became the antagonists of the story rather than the unfair treatment of genders in both barbieland and the real world

my main problem with the movie was honestly the plot the comedy was great but the plot was just eh it would have been better if the main barbie decided she wanted to become human and gloria wanted to become barbie since if barbie were human shed be able to change and grow like a human in the real world and gloria were a barbie than she could live in a fantasy world where life is easy and fun

edit the resolution could have been if things were changed around barbie could become a human in the real world gloria and ken could live in barbieland and enact change to make it so barbies and kens are treated equally since barbieland isnt such a great fantasy for menkens",2023-07-25 01:51:16
"i was kind of disappointed with the movie and it really isnt the movies fault it presents its core message well i kinda knew it was going to be a feminist movie but i didnt think it was going to be the entire theme i came in expecting some movie about barbie escaping into the real world getting sentience and forming a global scale rebellion or something again thats kinda my fault for building up false expectations

halfway through i could already tell how the movie was going to end and i didnt really want to hear  it preach to me about a topic that im very well aware of have heard a thousand times",2023-07-22 15:20:41
" terrible ending made this a 510

hollywood’s extreme aversion to “guy gets girl” basically ruined this movie ken was showing barbie how much it sucks to be in the position he was in they should have come to an understanding and finally kissed and shared the dreamhouse would that have been so wrong maybe give ken an actual  job instead of just “beach”

instead ken comes to a random epiphany that’s he’s “kenough” and goes right back to being a homeless loveless beach bum even more loveless now that now his barbie has  left barbie world so he doesn’t even have a barbie…just realized that 

barbie decides to go to the real world because now she’s too awakened to just live in barbie world i guess…and she magically gets a  cool whatever i mean we established that men are evil and barbie shows zero interest in them so what the  is she supposed to do with it also shouldn’f we see her thriving a little more in the real world maybe get a job as a motivational speaker or something she seems to want to help women and yet her ending is just “hey got my  whoopie” instead of something more constructive and meaningful

also the fear of death was never addressed like she had it and it got her out of barbie world but now why does she not have it anymore like that was never resolved in fact now that she went from being an idea to a real person shouldn’t the fear of death be stronger than ever as an idea she was nearly immortal because for her to die literally everyone in the world would have to forget about barbie which could take thousands of years as a real person she’s gunna be dead in like 4050 years so shouldn’t she be more worried about death now this movie has like 1000 loose ends

“i’m just ken” was an absolute banger though justifies the movie’s entire existence just so we could get that one song",2023-07-26 07:13:08
"does anyone else feel like the movie was just a big attempt by mattel to say “hey everyone don’t think about all the talk about whether barbie promoted bad body image look over there aren’t men awful”
and they just suckered gerwig and all the rest into playing a sleight of hand on the toy buying public and have now positioned barbie as this figure of womens rights

now say mattel 100 times and buy a barbie",2023-07-25 15:20:19
just left the theatre and honestly didn’t love it i’m 100 a feminist and am a female in a male dominated academic field but i just found the movie to be too “woke” and almost trying too hard it wasn’t light hearted and fun like i had hoped definitely some funny moments but overall i just thought it was too much and the narrative was a bit extreme great screenplay though and super cool to see i just wish the theme was more about barbie and not about barbie is better than ken just my thoughts,2023-07-27 04:25:10
"the more i think about the movie the more the narrative makes absolutely no sense so supposedly the america ferrara character is playing with barbie and that is making barbie sad but this is never really followed up on like why if that is the way barbie is made sad can’t america ferrara just fix the barbie and ken fight and make their barbie world better given that it’s been established that what she does in the real world effects barbie land


i know some people will say i’m thinking about it too much but even a goofy fantasy movie has to have some sense of logic and continuity there are so many things in this movie that make absolutely no sense story wise yet they’re overlooked because the movie had a message for women that’s a satire or something i get that  but shouldn’t the actual plot make some sense

seems like the writers were so into the message and satire of the movie they forget to have the plot make any semblance of sense also so many themes are brought up as though they’re gonna be super serious then just never followed up on at all",2023-07-27 15:19:30
"fun movie the music the humour the vibe and directing were contagious 



kinda feel like it became too self righteous with the message and the final stretch of the movie lost track of itself like it was trying to focus on all the issues women face today and i mean all speaking on a global level and that kinda does a disservice to itself since it simples the situation the issues women face depend heavily on the area of the globe you are like a woman in north america has too worry about expectations from society and beauty standards while someone from the middle east has to worry about legal  and execution 




i like the ambition maybe focus on only one category 





barbie was a giant  at times and feels like she didnt have much growth by the end i mean shes stereotypical barbie at the beginningbut it doesnt feel like she became anything more by the end",2023-07-30 23:16:13
"why i didnt like the barbie movie  a feminist view

so to start off with i want to make it absolutely clear i am a feminist a proud one if youre here to hate on the feminist messages that the barbie movie is attempting to make youre in the wrong place 

i just wanted to share my feelings and see if im alone in this i am a feminist i didnt like the barbie movie i feel a bit called out by people constantly saying youre antifeminist or this movie isnt for you if you didnt like it im a woman 

so first ill say what i did like then ill go on to the reasons i didnt like the movie

i did like the feminist tone in as far as america ferraras character doing the monologue on the struggles of the modern woman this is needed and it needs to be repeated until its heard im just not sure this movie was the avenue for it for reasons ill get into i also liked the set design costume design casting diversity i liked weird barbie and the idea that ken discovered the patriarchy i liked that barbie didnt need a man to make her happy theres a lot of good in this 

so now what i didnt like

1 this feels to me very much like mattel trying to rewrite the barbie narrative to sell more capitalistic  they lean heavily into the barbie has always been so feminist she was an astronaut when women couldnt have credit cards angle 

which may be true but its not the whole truth barbie was also a major contributor to body image issues she was only white and thin and blonde for so long until they realised money could be made from change 

barbie only also promotes one way to be a woman hyper feminine positive everythings a pleasure no trouble at all 

barbies dream house and car etc now being reframed as independence are really just ways to sell more stuff its just capitalism its just branding why didnt they lean into barbie bring a feminist earlier if she always was 

truth is they realised dream houses would sell so they made dream houses 

also didnt ruth handler invent barbie with her husband why are they not mentioning that 

i feel like this is just a poor attempt from mattel to get in front of the game before people start accusing them of being antiwoman and rewriting history am i alone in this

2 the story line was  poor and made no real sense it had no structure and you had no idea where it was going half the time the daze the barbies went into and how they came out made no sense how did they get brainwashed 

3 while it goes on about how feminist it is two bits really stood out to me as being problematic the first is in the fact that the thing that compels barbie to go to the real world and save the girl thats who she thought at the time wasnt any of the issues women face in the real world it was cause she wanted to fix her cellulite 

the scene where stereotypical barbie has a break down when she comes back to barbie land and shes upset because she doesnt feel important or attractive its almost made to be like this moment that every woman is able to relate to the expectation to be everything to be too much to never be enough but then they  it up with a voiceover which is like note to film makers margot robbie was not the right casting choice if you wanted to make that point after she says she feels  

umm how did no one on this set realise how that is going against the grain that everything that scene was trying to achieve 

like we all struggle with body image but you shouldnt if youre thin and blonde like margot robbie was that meant to be relatable 

4 i really hated the self aware mattel shenanigans  so disingenuous 

what does everyone else think",2023-07-31 13:42:43
"the good

the costume and set designs were amazing

ryan gosling killed it

there were admittedly some funny parts that made me laugh out loud namely the beach off argument


the bad

the real world section of the movie was just cheesy

what was actually the point of will ferrells character

the scene when all the kens are playing for the barbies was a fantastic scene and it was ruined by barbie


the 

what was the plot supposed to be it was fixing barbie then it was destroying the patriarchy then it was being human and finding yourself

at the risk of sounding like an incel they couldve built women up instead of tearing men down the message i got was its ok for people to be oppressed as long as women are in charge

if i had a nickel for everytime they said patriarchy i could refund my ticket and buy myself some popcorn

25",2023-08-02 07:28:08
"maybe i went there with high expectations everyone who’d seen it was raving about it

i thought it went on about the whole patriarchy thing for way too long you kind of get it soon and want to move onto something else as it gets tiring

i didn’t like the way “what men are supposed to be like” get portrayed lately not just in this movie they appear goofy bit dim completely emasculated etc there doesn’t seem to be a middle ground it’s just too extreme i just don’t think this kind of thing does the  “discrepancies” much justice

i thought that towards the end they’ll even things out a bit and bring the sexes together

oh and the beach scene towards the end just made women look deviously manipulative and unreasonably cruel 

i think there’s a real risk it’ll achieve the opposite effect of what it was trying to do bringing both sexes together 

all in all it was kind of childish primitive one sided and missed the mark somehow but i get why it “culturally necessary” right now

the first quarter was quite funny though",2023-08-05 20:14:40
"i think they simplified ken’s potential to grow in the movie by having his goal in life in the beginning be “for barbie to look at him” i think if they changed that to “ken worked out everyday acted macho had a high powered job to impress barbie” all things the patriarchy emphasises men must do and be to ‘get women’ then the arc at the end could’ve been much deeper

in the end he only had one way to go then which was “i can be myself without barbie” but i wanted him to change into “i can cry i can be vulnerable who cares about abs i can do what i really love which is painting or whatever” this would’ve hit harder on why the patriarchy also hurts men they did a great job hitting on why it hurts women but i wish it had that extra layer that would’ve made it more deep for me 

the ken arc and ending was a miss for me to explore another aspect of patriarchy",2023-07-21 22:47:57
i dont understand how this is rated so highly its an average movie,2023-07-22 13:53:04
"i will preface this by saying that i am a guy and i chose to watch this movie by myself because i was that excited to see it i’ve never played with barbies dolls or any sort of action figures this wasn’t a toy movie for me just a regular movie if you don’t think i’m the target demographic for this movie shame on you i don’t see movies as gendered and if you do i’m sorry you limit yourself like that 

i’m mixed the comedy and plot were generally great and everyone gave good performances weirdly it was ryan gosling who stood out the directing set pieces music choices all of it good but i did not like the themes

this movie is rated pg 13 but a lot of kids with their parents came to see it and i feel like they’re going to walk away from the theatre with some wrong ideas this movie kind of presented the idea of barbieland aka a matriarchy being so much better than the real world a patriarchy they’re both bad things the movie took on an adult theme and problem but gave a very childish view of it the barbies seriously were that engrossed with the patriarchy they needed a rousing speech and social media feminism to make them snap out of it what the  

in barbieland they presented both the matriarchy and the patriarchy as this good thing as long as the “underclass” don’t realize that there’s another option in the real world we know about these issues it doesn’t take an awakening to realize that certain groups have more power and there is no blissful ignorance being the wrong crowd means you get hurt 

and the ending pretty much reverted barbieland an idea of a better society back to where it was oh one ken will have an important position from time to time and maybe some small amount of improvement in the future i do realize that the real world is heavily favored with men in power the mattel chairman characters more subtly presented that idea better than any other part of the movie

ultimately i think this movie presented themes creeping towards toxic femininity take the example of the dad a  unable to go outside thus causing the mother to be deeply unhappy that idea is so sexist a man has an issue and because of that the woman is in anguish do women not have agency and control to determine their own well being also that dad was practicing spanish on his own to better connect with his latina family and they gave him some  for it which i don’t appreciate they also blamed a lot of problems on men that women perpetuate women physical beauty standards are almost entirely dictated by other women even shown in the film not once did a single male character as far as i can remember could be wrong comment about the way a woman looked outside of those very in your face construction workers and beach goers the barbies and other women constantly commented about each other’s appearances and even isolated kate mckinnon’s barbie and called her uglyweird several times you can’t have your cake and eat it too

all this to say i did enjoy the movie but i have to separate some of the themes with the rest of the film definitely rewatchable and i may change my opinion about it who knows",2023-07-23 06:56:41
"i dont know how anyone can have any like politicalideological takes on this movie given its a mess that doesnt know what it wants to be itd be like debating 5 or 6 loose concepts just tossed together in a salad bowl in a way thats sometimes conflicting not even in a afraid to really commit way like i assumed the reviewers were talking about because if youre easily put in upset over this stuff youre still likely to get upset but its more like it just says a whole lot and all that you can say is haha funee michael cera and then main barbies story line in specific seemed very vaguely related to all of that in a way where im sure theyre hoping analysts can cover for them like if you took a kid to this movie i dont even think theyd walk away with any message good or bad

fun film though great humor from start to finish",2023-07-23 07:05:52
margot robbie was the saving grace her performance made the movie watchable every other aspect just felt half baked the first 20 minutes set up a really compelling experience my boyfriend even said “what if the bus stop woman is who barbie was sent there for” i think that would have been more interesting than what we got,2023-07-23 13:00:32
"this is a movie where you feel like you must be insane because you hear smart liberal women who didnt like it such as krystal ball among others and then you go on reddit and are told only right wing men who hate women didnt enjoy the movie 

its a dumb persons idea of a smart movie

"my wife and daughter 15 went to this last night both didnt like it and found the ending depressing wife told me its not fun not funny very preachy and not a kids film both enjoyed first half hour im curious as to who the target audience is for this film it certainly doesnt seem to be little kids who like to play happy fun games with barbie and ken there is a reason why the transformers and lego films were so successful they are fun kids films based on a kids toy franchise for kids and with a few jokes for the parents thats what i presumed barbie film would be obviously not

edit i personally have no problems with this film i didnt see it as it doesnt sound like my thing visuals look great im just posting this as alot of women i work with are planning on bringing their daughters to it and are expecting a very different kind of film to what my wife described they are expecting a breezy campy easygoing enchanted type film for the kids thats all folks not a bot",2023-07-22 10:21:26
"while im not the target audience for this movie i did watch it because i love the cast and crew but found it pretty cringe

i do not have a single problem with the politics of the movie i just didnt think any of the jokes landed

also whats up with the ending why is she visiting a gyno",2023-07-22 18:03:22
"so bit of a pretentious  starting statement but i’m a film student i’m a bloke and i’ve written about female agency in films previously by choice i focused on how it’s neglected in certain films and hollywood in general with close analysis i watched this with my girlfriend and i would class my politics as centre left

i would give barbie an 8910 for the current climate of boxoffice releases it’s as close a thing to a classic as there’s ever been in the past few years and the aesthetic choices choreography etc were all memorable it does lose some of its semblance in its monologues but it mostly holds up because it uses those monologues to create more jokes with biting commentary that makes sense 

however as others have pointed out there are contradictions in its messaging 

i think the viewpoints that have been expressed by the american right wing are  but they do have a point that it’s not exactly a film that comes with a wholly positive message about men even though obviously we go into this knowing it’s a film primarily directed towards women on the one level i get the joke about ken being superfluous and i understand that it may be purposefully targeting patriarchy because we do still need to remain vigilant of extremism and oppression especially right now with culture wars etc but in terms of what it actually does to address the culture wars it’s definitely a film that’s happier to stoke the flames there were three moments where i thought well maybe they’ll resolve it but it did not and so i assume the point was not to resolve it and to spread the message that we need to be separate people discover ourselves blah blah blah but that’s where it loses me like the stereotypical male stuff in the film was really funny the interests applied to me pretty frickin’ well but i see more likelihood that the internet will start referring to people as ‘a ken’ to describe a sort of basic guy rather than take a message of let people be themselves maybe ken itself is a commentary on the way people define women as basic  etc etc but that feels pretty weak to me and tenuous at best the kens had genuine interest in subjects they were excited to share things with barbies and they were continually told they didn’t know who they were or what they wanted or they were belittled for it 

ken being rejected as a partner is fine but i think the message of ken discovering things he likes and then being told to find himself is massively conflicting he was rejected as a person is that the point like they were mostly pretty banal ordinary funny things barring the patriarchy which he only liked because of horses anyway it’s not the type of stuff men have to be indoctrinated into liking as if those things solely belong to a frat kid or andrew tate or joe rogan which to me was how it was presented i think in that instance the comedy just doesn’t work with the undertones the comedy part was funny and worked as a standalone but the undertones of the barbies invalidated the men having interests like again is that the point 

the barbies also intentionally made the kens jealous to make them fight each other and i think it’s fine for media like film to express and show a particular perspective in general but with a film this big i found it slightly morally questionable because it was treated as justifiable it was pretty toxic behaviour  most people would not respond well to it but it’s justified because dismantling male structures like again the comedy and the undertone just don’t mix well i like the joke but the undertone felt wrong enough that my girlfriend was the first person to mention it afterwards 

what stood out the most was the ‘you have to be x and you have to be y’ speech compared to attitudes about the kens however ironically despite it standing out a few hours later i can’t remember the speech so i can’t think of any solid examples now 

it just seems a bit out of touch that a film so intent on individualism expression identity and humanity doesn’t fully reconcile that men have similar issues i think it tried to partially but it didn’t feel complete and all it needed was a slightly more unified statement at the end it was a clear this is our territory and we’re claiming it as women thing but i think me and my girlfriend felt a bit alienated because we look at each other as peopleindividuals already above just being men and women and one of the speeches at the end about a woman being free to bedo whatever she wants felt a bit redundant and ham  given that it’s the sentiment expressed by barbies in the beginning i just don’t really know what it was trying to accomplish to me it just reinforced a gender division i grew up around feminists and division was not the kind of viewpoint that was expressed to me equity was this film felt like it was malcom x rather than martin luther king not wholly aggressive validly hostile but perhaps anti integration in a way that i think most people don’t agree with

tldr

great film but just like the character barbie the movie doesn’t know what it wants

am i supposed to laugh hate myself love myself destroy the system or help to create a new one",2023-07-22 20:12:16
the movie wasn’t made for me but it was decent my girlfriend loved it as she grew up with barbie so she was really happy to me there were a few good moments mainly revolving around ken and what they do with him  its biggest miss was it got way to preachy at times and even though i agree with the message it was presented so horribly that it took away from the movie,2023-07-23 21:25:51

"just watched it today i hadnt been following any marketing about it

im a female and i did play with the barbie as a kid but i was never crazy about it the thing i wanted to have the most was the high heels when i would play with it haha funny because now that im a grown woman i dont wear them and never have actually i just thought they looked nice when i was a kid 

barbie never made me feel bad about myself to be honest was just a toy 

anyway i enjoyed the movie wasnt a masterpiece of course but it was enjoyable and i thought gosling was especially funny i dont care about feminism or that sort of stuff i dont even think it was heavyhanded with the message it wanted to convey all in all it couldnt have been subtle about it its just how the movie was made that made it so it had to be done like that 

i just watched it as entertainment and it did its job for me 

i had read many negative comments just yesterday about it on here so i was expecting it to have big flaws but honestly i thought it was an ok movie 

i think ryan gosling helped a lot in that respect in my opinion because he was funny in it and i think without him i would have probably liked it less 

i would give it a 710",2024-03-15 20:59:35

it does that thing where in the end the better alternative still kind of looks the same as what its an alternative of there is still a president there is still a supreme court there are still hierarchical power structures but its a liberal barbie movie so im not going to really expect it to do better than that it was a fun time,2023-07-23 19:58:21
the movie was quite good some parts hit me and did get a couple tears out of me i wish the movie wouldve expanded more on the mother and daughters relationship and the ken storyline though i lowkey wanted to see things go back to normal and barbie could see how badly they treated the kens and then they would spend more time on the topic in order to really sell the equality message also with the mom and daughter i feel like they couldve taken it longer for them to bond apart from that its a very funny but also bittersweet movie really liked it felt like i reconnected with barbie lol,2023-07-27 03:37:18

"when this movie was first announced to be happening i thought it was a really dumb idea however once greta gerwig attached herself to this and margot robbie was casted i became intrigued this is probably the most pleasantly surprised i’ve been after seeing a movie since the lego movie in 2014 i guess all the hype online surrounding this turned out to be worth it 

now that’s not to say this is a perfect movie it’s not the first act for me dragged and the movie only started to get good for me once barbie and ken entered the real world the performances here were great across the board margot robbie fits into this role like a glove like seriously i can’t picture any other actress doing this role as good as she did here i find it funny that now whenever people think of margot robbie the first two things that come to mind for probably most people are now harley quinn and barbie ryan gosling who is one of my favorite actors is also really good here so much so that he arguably steals this movie away from robbie at times if you watched crazy  love and the nice guys you would know that gosling has great comedic chops and they are on full display here will ferrell essentially has the same role here as he did in the lego movie but if i’m being honest i thought phil lord and chris miller were able to use him better in that compared to what gerwig did with him here also shoutout to michael cera who had a small but effective role here 

greta gerwig herself is now 33 with lady bird little women and now this hopefully she’s able to keep her winning streak going with the way this movie ends i’m not sure how a sequel would work exactly however what i do hope happens is we get a ken spinoff movie after the likely success of this and honestly how could we not i am kenough",2023-07-22 19:35:19

"i have to see it as fun and campy romp margo had some good beats and ryan stole the show but the larger plot and the themes felt rather uninspired and lazy feels like the same kind of white woman feminism you see on twitter or saw on tumblr back in the day nowadays all in all still fine but i feel like if youre seeing this film and viewing the finale as some grand feminist outcome then i really doubt we have the same view of a feminist end game as a fun and campy romp touching on gender issues but not committing to exploring them with the depth needed 810 as a subversive satire of gender norms and some grand piece of feminist art 510 



i really feel that they just tried to address too much and this sacrificed the nuances needed to actually have this be something worthy of great feminist praise in 2023 yaknow what im really not a fan of is all the people who love it but are unable to recognize any criticism of it who treat any discomfort at the choice of having all the men be either idiots or  as proof theyre some jordan peterson fanboy frankly i have to thank it because it will be a good litmus test going forward to determine if someone has what i see as a toxic view of feminism similar to guys and their view of fight club and how it handled masculinity




edit i do want to absolutely sing the praises again of margo ryan the set designs and the music i get what they were trying to go for as a whole and while i think they only really nailed kens story i feel it just missed the mark thematically i said elsewhere it rightfully criticizes toxic masculinity but paints masculinity as performative without bothering to show examples of positive masculinity as well as seemingly justifying the sexist ways women have been treated in society by saying eh maybe eventually youll get equality but for now just take what we give you and shut up all in all maybe i was just expecting too much but considering how amazing greta is as a filmmaker i really dont think i was",2023-07-22 18:30:15
"might be in the minority but didn’t care for this movie at all margot robbie needs an oscar nomination at least because her performance was the best part of the film wasn’t really big on the overall script and plot the dancing scene at the end and the ken’s fighting just became a drag having a himbo character is always fun but that got over done too that it just stopped being funny not much development besides the real world  but then barbie liking that then the last joke to close the film really took away from whatever message they were trying to hammer in
some jokes i laughed but a lot were misses maybe because i’m quite young my humor didn’t click with more millennial humor i don’t think this film is gonna age well by the end of the year or a year after like other movies that had strong hype only to be disliked later on i don’t mind camp films but i found the greatest showman campy but well done camp",2023-08-07 08:18:16
"just watched it  loved it  you can ignore any idiot whining about wokeness this movie is genuinely very funny and the message is totally fine and good

i actually laughed out loud at many of the jokes too which makes it the funniest comedy ive seen in years",2023-07-22 04:23:10
movie was overhyped better messaging could’ve been portrayed and there were too many slow parts imo,2023-07-30 05:09:49
"i havent been this confused since watching a movie since another will ferrell movie  anchorman 2

questions i asked myself included general what is the message of this movie to did barbie undergo any actual development the movie sort of shows us these as well barbie is credited inmovie for things she says she never did a movie where barbieworld barbie teaches real life owner and daughter to reconcile through her naive but empowered worldview would have a message to it multiple interpretations but we didnt get that movie a movie where realworld evil mattel tries to put barbie back in the box as a metaphor for oppression would have very simple messaging but we didnt get that movie at every turn where this movie had a chance at messaging it replaced that chance with another joke the messaging at the end where carla tells barbie that barbies role is to continue changing and evolving and to continue to inspire women and then shes like nah im good barbie shows up in the real world and her first shown experience as a real woman is that women have to go to gynecologists its a funny shocking joke  but whats the meaning id say there is no meaning but if you look for a meaning its not a positive and inspiring one for women 

barbies taking over barbieland was rather shallow on the barbie end its a movie where the kens do the heavy lifting and the character exploring and the character growth and i could see barbie getting at the very least a nomination for best original song it might win it too the song is that good and as far as anything pivotal in this movie goes its the crux but this is barbie  so why are men at the focus why is this movie carried by men barbie also happens to cry a lot sure  crying shows her having emotions instead of being a plastic doll but crying whats that say about women near the end shes constantly crying and once again at the end ken is the one who knows who he is  an extension of barbie and he emotionally struggles to change with an emotional breakthrough its done much better than barbie going to heaven with a ghost crying and not having a breakthrough 

i dont know what to think it felt a lot like anchorman 2 that movie also had a chance to find a direction or make a point it pivoted to a joke and it feels strange that a barbie movie is so heavily carried by gosling liu and benadir the barbies sneaky plan  and you know i love a heist movie  is also heavy on the male acting the messaging of the movie is at odds with its own production

i dont know what to think of it the deprogramming by listing ways in which the world is unfair to women was something but i dont think it went anywhere or did anything to resolve the issue or to even address it and its super strange to me that we found conflict and resolution in barbie world  its a movie that has no grounded experience for us as viewers its like when the guardians of the galaxy saved that random thing okay im very well tired of save the world movies but at least save our world people obviously itd ring hollow if barbie saved earth from the patriarchy  as hollow as when black panther invested in inner cities and then disney did jack  to help inner cities in the real world  but itd at least have some kind of message for earth 

i dont know this is my rant time to read what everyone else wrote

edit i did really like the dua lipa song and the soundtrack building off that song even for the evil mattel corporation",2023-08-05 00:46:18
"this was such a weird disjointed movie…little to no character development or actual substance and i was really hoping that it would be a total female empowerment movie but somehow it was more the ken show 

idk what i was expecting but it really was underwhelming",2023-08-13 00:47:55
"transgressive masterpiece though imo fell just short of being called masterpiece walked an extremely fine line between genuine sentimentality and cringe and every time they veered into the cringe they looped it around and integrated it perfectly into the movie i hope it makes the biggest losers on the planet moan like the children they are hilarious philisophical avantegarde weird emotional such a fantastic flick not in a rush to see it again but there are so many moments of brilliance 

the opening 20 minutes or so until barbie starts her real world adventure is truly inspired i love the bumbling mattel execs feels like a response to the lego movie in many ways obviously just a grand grand time at the movies heartbreak feels good in a place lile this

shoutout to margot robbie who killed it as barbie and acted her   off but ryan gosling stole the show ken was by far the best part of the movie",2023-07-21 15:52:10
who was that lady playing barbie she was great,2023-07-21 02:14:40
"while i found it funny and enjoyable i didnt love it barbieland is a reverse world where kens might not hold much power it felt all men vs women thing what about the kens who might be in touch with their feminine sides at this day and age where trans and gender identity is a big deal is whole men vs women thing even important 

if you throw out patriarchy and make the society lean towards matriarchy you are basically doing same thing just reversing the roles what about equal representation in parliament everywhere we love playing with ken as much as we love barbie there are just more barbies so we didnt have much choice in ken",2023-07-22 17:28:57
just watched it with my girlfriend i watched it with an open mind and understood the target audience which i feel like is young female teens around age 1216 pretty good movie with some heart and a few funny segments 710 loved ken and his kenergy,2023-07-23 23:59:57
i felt more complete and inspired at the end of oppenheimer as i felt the movie ended on an intellectual high with some great dialogs and brilliant acting in the 3rd act on the other hand barbie failed to tie all of its sub plots together to bring about a convincing solution for the conflict setup in the first half of the movie added to that the ideas and writing became sloppy and too lazy in the end which was not helped with the open ending climax to summarise i felt low after barbie but not after oppenheimer,2023-07-25 22:49:28
great film i really enjoyed margot and ryans performances obviously going into the film i had no idea there was a narrator so that was a pleasant surprise too also a standout actress who i dont really know well was america ferrera i think she did a great job as the mom to an angsty teen who is just trying to figure out life,2023-07-21 02:17:55

so many matrix references in this movie i loved it,2023-07-21 18:10:53
speaking of barbies who was that woman who asked ken the time kind of surprised she wasnt a barbie because i thought she was distractingly pretty,2023-07-22 14:23:18

im seeing in some comments that this movie point the finger into male gender i have been feeling bad for a topic related to that these days and i would like to know if is a good idea seeing it now or if i should wait until i feel better what do you think,2023-07-23 05:48:35
"is anyone else having war flashbacks to the discussions about dont look up  

because if certain people are to go by this movie was made with even more disdain and contempt",2023-07-23 09:00:57
"thinking about it some more i can respect and appreciate and acknowledge that the main message of the film is about womanhood and was made for the target audience of film for female viewers and not male viewers

so as a male viewer maybe that is why i’m looking at all of the other plot points and simply can’t see the main one

i just don’t feel like the two main points of the message weren’t as impactful america ferrera  rita perlman as they could have been but maybe it’s because it was done in a calm nonreaction based tone i guess that is why i’m admittedly confused but my sister spoke about how those two moments were very impactful for her so i can see it’s like we saw two different movies",2023-07-24 14:50:00

why are the men so useless in the film  is it supposed to be like that  am i missing something ,2023-07-22 16:54:34
just came back from watching it i have to say i have mixed feelings on this one i loved how the writers really portrayed how  children played using our imaginations  to be a bad  woman boss barbie we ate what we wanted went out when we wanted didnt answer to anyone but our own feminine power the humor and bits of nostalgia was great but man why did it have to turn into a political sob fest of gender roles and patriotism yes i get it the real world didnt  exactly meet our expectations as woman but i just didnt expect barbie to step out of barbie land and into the real world was kind of a bummer when she did but thats just my 2 cents,2023-07-24 10:11:35
actors were great too preachy for me song and dance was great ryan gosling saved that movie,2023-07-25 15:13:26
"i just came back from watching this and it was good i really really wish i liked it more 

first off im a guy and i couldnt wait to see this the jokes were onpoint and the performances were so magnetic but it just felt like this movie just constantly  on men with a vague message i have no problem with the first two thirds of this movie ken needing barbies approval to validate himself is relatable and hilarious him discovering patriarchy and all the other kens mansplaining things were so on point except for the photoshop part idk why that should be considered mansplaining and americas monologue was powerful where this movie lost me was how in the end after the beachoff everything goes back to normal and the kens just get the same  deal it was one extreme or another",2023-08-01 07:37:43
"it was a good film

i actually loved the shots it took at the awful snyder jl film extra funny since theyre both from the same company

‘it felt so weird i was stuck overanalyzing the snyder cut of justice league”",2023-07-21 12:40:19
"hilarious and clever a production design i just loved seeing the world and all the references and fun stuff like that i was a girl in the early ‘90s and loved barbie 

a bit too heavyhanded in the antiman department in a few places but it evened out in the end definitely recommend",2023-07-22 05:29:49
i think the issue with the message that this movie was trying to convey was that all they did was talk about the message they didnt show why the issue of a male dominated world was a problem but then again this movie was mostly a comedy and hardly a drama so there wasnt really much to work with,2023-07-24 02:57:49
"aside from the visuals and some good jokes in there i didnt find it that entertaining all of the characters are unlikeable we cant feel sorry for margots pity party the kens war and songs go on too long as does the ruth handler scene margot robbie telling us shes no longer perfect now she has flat feet and cellulite really doesnt make the point the wanted it to make even with the 4th wall break with narration gag it still didnt land how i think they wanted it to americas mono about the impossible task of being a perfect woman was great but used pretty mediocre examples and missed a great opportunity sashas emotions throughout are at the whim of whatever point the writer is trying to make and dont follow the logic of actual human being goslings character is really unlikeable in a bad way the hype of this movie and the marketing made me look forward to seeing gosling as ken only to extremely let me down not enough barbieland or really any geography explored will farrell and co are they good guys bad guys i feel like they were meant to be bad but because they represent mattel it was like lets make them ridiculous to gloss over the fact they are also bad what do you mean barbie doesnt need permission to be a human who are all these people in this randomly long drawn out flashbackflashforward allans character was just massive wasted potential for someone interesting they almost got there with him and then gave up he was just a gag in the end

then theres the political messaging which was the lowest on my list of complaints before anyone comes at me any time you may be starting to enjoy the movie a soapbox moment appears and its like youre watching a required training video rather than a movie which is supposed to entertain good storytelling is done through the story this film has so much exposition its insulting the intelligence of everyone who watches it

contrary to the many expectations set on women i didnt need the barbie movie to be anything except entertaining but the writers completely forgot that entertainment cant be achieved by littering some jokes here and there its investment in good character background and arcs and storytelling the main plot of i need to find this girl and repair the rift is completely abandoned because ken brings patriarchy to barbieland suddenly all the barbies are  as if patriarchy is some magic spell ok then",2023-07-24 15:47:25
"a whole lot of potential but a lot of misses with the humorous bits i dont think the writing is as sharp and witty as they intended to come across for example the scene with sasha being urged to destroy barbie didnt work for me the lines werent biting enough and were not immediately relatable observations the drums that were supposed to emphasise the hard punches of truth that sasha were throwing were lagging and doesnt help that the words were weakand in the end it built up to nothing no mic drop or climax ryan murphy would be the person to come up with effective lines think santana kurt and most of all sue sylvesters lines from glee 

the movie had parts that were too abstract that made me wonder if its lazy writing that was selfconvinced to be quirky random oh its a movie it doesnt have to make sense and theyll get it sort of humour and deep the characters were forgettable and wasted opportunities none of them were truly funny and unique or iconic its not toy storytouching pixardeep or chickflick classic

 i would recommend lifesize to someone interested in a barbie movie over this i do love the set designs costumes and lizzos song",2023-07-25 16:18:36
great movie superior to oppenheimer,2023-07-25 23:54:55
i liked it its a solid funny campy pop movie but the feminism is a little ham  and cliche twitter stuff itll make some conservatives angry but i found it all a little trite and white feministy the serious or emotional stuff didnt work that well for me but it is pretty funny and set and costume design is on point,2023-07-27 18:00:59
"rant spoilers ahead

x200b

i 17m liked barbie however i cannot get the thought out of my head that it is at least somewhat against true equality between genders what i got from the movie is that yes duh women face many issues that are talked about but disregarded point to the whole monologue gloria gives and that the movie is a way to talk about those issue and put them in the forefront of peoples minds nonetheless i still think that its somewhat antimale at the end of the film once ken realizes that his patriarchy is over and begins to cry and talk about how he is nothing without barbie only for her to tell him to find out who he is for himself is a great scene showing how barbie truly does care for ken and he doesnt need her to be his truest self yet they then follow that scene with another where simu lius ken asks for a role in the supreme court only to be immediately turned down and told no way but he could have a secretary type of position only for it again to be played out as a joke where he says he just wants to wear robes even having helen mirren the narrator of the story say eventually the kens will have the same amount of power women have in the real world like why was this put in not only does it still point out the fact that everything the barbies did had no effect on the real world but it puts down the kens as well the barbies end up putting everything back to as it was before ken had instilled his patriarchy why why not change it to have true equality for both groups ryan goslings ken points out that before he changed everything he was simply a thing for barbie to look at and when she didnt he didnt have a good day so why change the constitution back to a system where one group of people are still being demeaned to nothing the kens were just as much indoctrinated by ryan gosling as the other barbies were its not right to say they werent just because they now held the power i just think that if the barbies understood what it was like from gloria and their own experiences of how it feels to be in a situation where you are clearly second fiddle and everyone sees you as an object why change everything back to the way it was still having a group of people being demeaned it shows that they are no better than when the kens had power all in all the barbies should have changed the system to accommodate both groups of people to have equal power and relevance after experiencing for themselves first hand what it was like also include alan man he needs some justice too",2023-07-28 01:09:54
"full confession i was a huge barbie girl as a little one so definitely was not in the “if you hate barbie this movie is for you” category so bear that in mind

i have to say it i didn’t like this movie and it really upsets me because i wanted to and was super duper hyped for it yes i wore pink and even took a barbie
for me and i’m sorry perhaps i’m dumb and i just didn’t get a lot of it but it really fell flat once they left barbie land i didn’t feel like the barbie character was fun and goofy enough like i imagined she would be and her being sad and not wanting to be a barbie was sad to me i would have preferred the ending to be her coming to terms with being a hero to little girls and embracing that and then trying to change barbie land to be more equal with ken

also even though ken discovering the patriarchy and his mojo dojo house was really fun and probably the most entertaining part of the movie after the first half hour i don’t really like the messaging that barbie and ken as they kind of represent men and women in this movie can’t work together and get along i did have a ken and no i didn’t play with him as much as barbie but i was never imagining he was a bad person who would be mean to barbie actually when i was finished with barbie i would usually put them somewhere together so they could keep each other company and in case barbie wanted some smooth body loving from her hottie ken  
they were supposed to be a inseparable and caring team and i feel like this movie just undid that and it’s a shame

i also wonder about the message this sends to boys and men like because the barbie movie kind of ripped on men will they now go “well the barbie movie said men were dummies so now we can just go nuts and write women as hot  in everything”
i don’t know i feel like this movie is going to be worse for gender equality than it is better yeah i know it’s a doll movie and won’t have much impact either way but still

all in all i’d give this 2 out of 5 and that’s mainly because the sets and casting are absolutely wonderful",2023-08-01 06:09:08
"just saw barbie as a movie it was good ryan gosling was acting his heart out lots of good humour bits set design and outfits were very well done

its politics are iffy im not saying it was woke propaganda as idiot rightwingers are who are purely reacting against surfacelevel characteristics of the movie it just doesnt seem very well thought out or is really uneven and weird

yes im talking about the kens a lot of people have outlined that the triumph of the movie is a reactionary countercoup that puts the repressed underclass back in its place with at best minor symbolic concessions

the message about ken is that despite legitimate grievances about society as a whole actually the problem is with him and he needs to mentally selfreflect and accept his place which is actually a very conservative mentality jordan peterson literally has a talking point that you cant complain about issues with broad society if your own life isnt fixed

yeah it is mixed with a message about being entitled to a woman which makes it messy

other things i noticed was that while there was a very noticeable plussized barbie and a wheelchair barbie that all the kens are either muscular or skinny they all are under a barbie gaze which goes completely unremarked on and an audience gaze since i could hear some women in the audience when ryan gosling was on screen

the message about feminism is also really messy and limited i saw someone call it upper middleclass feminism if you listen to america ferreras rants to the barbies its just about social expectations which is something that everybody deals with male or female i as a man have to deal with trying to manage to try not to scare people or talk over them or be creepy its a very selfcentred view to pretend that only the social expectations that impact you are bad and ignore that everybody else has them the movie makes a point about body positivity by including plussized barbie and wheelchair barbie and centring them in scenes it just seems like the charge often lobbied at the body positivity movement that its only for women and not for men the way its presented

but nothing about you know material issues like pay gaps reproductive and other women health issues poverty of elderly women violence etc women cant control their reproductive health in half the country barbie is set in and it isnt remarked on

and at the end of the day ken is going back to sleeping on the beach for all the selfactualisation that he has done 

i mean her ranting about reallife issues should also go over their heads they have no real frame of reference for it

also the movie devotes much screen time to lampooning toxic masculinity like kens earnestly trying to explain things to barbie who asked them but the movie starts with barbies playing with kens feelings and not caring about them as anything but accessories and then solves the ken problem by  playing with kens feelings and putting them back as accessories with a minor concession toxic feminity which also goes unremarked on

a feminism that is purely about lifting social expectations on women while reinforcing social expectations on men is going to be alienating both to women who do have real material concerns in their life enforced on them by wider society and to men who feel trapped and confused by contradictory social expectations and general social atomisation

maybe im just overthinking this but i saw so much praise for this as a deep movie with an important message and it just felt shallow",2023-08-06 10:01:55
"just saw it today all the controversy and complaining seemed a bit overboard but now that i’ve seen the movie i understand where some of the backlash is coming from 

i’m just not a fan of movies that are here to deliver a message first and foremost because the narrative and all the other elements of the movie tend to suffer for it in this case the feminism came across as goofy to me every man in the movie is cartoonishly  and it’s grating to watch i’m on board with the message but certain lines and scenes left me wondering what exactly they’re getting at",2023-08-23 22:22:41
"i am expecting a huge incel backlash to this movie  there have been so many imagined slights they made that character black they must be almost giddy to see a movie that is properly giving them the middle finger

still based off the hype for this movie barbie has gone woke and absolutely not broke",2023-07-21 17:12:11
this was not at all what i expected from this movie and i mean that in a good way,2023-07-21 15:04:31

gret has some big ovaries to make and release a movie like this nowadays simply fantastic cant wait to go watch it again,2023-07-22 06:33:32
i know we complain trailers give too much away but  the trailers for barbie gave away alllllll the good bits in barbieland,2023-07-22 17:45:11
i liked it until the end when the barbies and kens went right back to the barbies running everything like before even though both sides gained greater sentience and should have realized it was not fun to have no say in how things were run unless the joke is that you better vote or suffer the consequences of not voting,2023-07-21 03:23:44
started off off super strong but will farrell ruined it for me the film went from mildly inspiring to absolute chaos as soon as he entered the scene literally,2023-07-22 01:10:10
wanna say first i am not the target audience for this film…thought it was incredible one of the best comedies i’ve seen in a long time and i thought it was also very introspective as well i need a sequel,2023-07-24 23:51:07
"i personally didnt like it that much maybe a 610 for me i like the message but i was expecting more of a comedy theres a few funny sections but ultimately theres just too many jokes that fall flat theres barely any big budget comedies these days with quotable or referencable moments and it just seems like a wasted opportunity

i also cant tell who the movie is for in terms of demographics it definitely wasnt for younger kids or teenagers theres nothing particularly gen z or early millenial either it kind of seems like its for older millenial and gen x women but then theres jokes like the snyder cut one which makes me think they tried to put in something for everyone",2023-07-26 06:04:23
did not expect to lol that much in the theater very funny,2023-07-21 03:18:07
it was so good  everyone killed it but ryan gosling was the best,2023-07-21 03:20:55

so many things were great especially the very last joke they got the stereotypical male so on point",2023-07-21 04:42:33

all the dance performances were really good tbh",2023-07-21 07:21:05
"local indie theater got a 16 mm of shoot the piano player and since i wanted to at least see one of the films that came out this weekend and i figured that barbie would be the better of the two to pair with shoot and boy was i right  
both films are about the relations between men and women shoot is considerably more darker its just that barbie glosses over the more negative aspects of the patriarchy youll see women who do the same things in barbie to take control of the system where in shoot its just to survive the fact that shoot has several insults where women and men are once youve seen one youve seen them all with the more literal form of that with barbie and how barbie primes you to see the women in shoot differently ie why their lives seemingly revolve around men than if shoot were on its own i cant recommend it enough",2023-07-24 04:39:18
lmaoo ken had a huge  in the intro lmaoo,2023-07-24 04:59:32
not going to get to much into the gender or feminist aspects of the movie i thought it was definitely fun but story wise assumed there would be more from the momdaughter storyline fighting against the meaning of barbie not sure definitely trying to figure out how much of an antagonist ken really was mattel was never going to let themselves truly be the bad guys so wondering how much that shaped the actual story fun film though definitely would see it again,2023-07-26 07:52:42
i was hoping that ken was going to be vice prez by the end of the movie,2023-08-02 03:52:19
they did an amazing job marketing this movie and it should do great in the box office but then i think people will forget about this  in a few months stunning visuals and great costume set but with the bland quality of humorless writing that didnt even fully explore the social themes they discussed its hard for me to understand why someone would want to see this a second time,2023-07-23 17:04:10
i wanted to enjoy this a lot but it just seemed like a series of ideas or zoomer tweets that never really connected into anything that funny or interesting,2023-07-24 09:14:25
barbie the lego movie does a semester at wesleyan and comes back without a sense of humor,2023-07-27 21:05:53
"i liked most of it funny to see will ferrel cast as another executive in a toy company after lego movie

the start and end were great though honestly i thought the midpoint in earth was quite meh considering how fantastical barbieland was i thought they would have the real world be well real but it was so unrealistic its insane

literally everyone they passed hit on them the cops let them go twice for barbie being hot hitting on her and the cherry on top the company guy saying yeah patriarchy but keep it on the down low none of it felt real at all then they totally jumped the shark with mattel

lowest point of the movie for sure was the teenage daughter her tangent was actually giving serious new velma vibes highest point for sure was the dance war

also found the line at the end didint hit the same for me as it did others here maybe one day the kens here will have just as much power and influence as women have in the real world when it should been somthing like now the kens will have the same opertunities for power and influence as women in the real world i know its a minor nitpick but i think it matters",2023-08-21 17:18:24
"i’ll comment again since my first was downvoted by incoming incels that are livid that a movie celebrating feminism is killing the box office 

anyway this movie was exceptional saw it with my so and looked over at the ending sequence and she was crying just like me really didn’t expect such a profound experience from a barbie movie",2023-07-22 14:46:43
i liked how the barbie’s completely failed to learn from the ken’s revolution in their exclusion of the them from all major positions of influence and basically relegating them to second class citizens the idea they were going for was to have barbieland and the real world contrast each other with a matriarchy in the former and a patriarchy in the latter which they then completely abandoned in the end but even so much as banning the ken’s completely from the supreme court when nearly half of the supreme court in the real world is comprised of women really shows how this film wanted to communicate female supremacy rather than truly creating an equal world for everyone the film seemed intent on trying to spite men and convey the utopia of a femaleled society while completely abandoning it’s initial premise and message of treating everyone equal the film started off strong and at times i thought they were really drive the point home  but this film was so clearly a bait and switch in order to advance the director’s clear radical feminist ideas,2023-07-25 08:07:33

i adored the first 120 minutes of this i loved the humor the messaging the acting issa rae might be one of the most hilarious barbies my only gripes were the tonal shift at the end there was a just a touch jarring and the daughter was annoying,2023-07-21 02:38:12
okay first things first  greta and noah have to work together more often people who are  about the movie being a bit saturated are obviously missing the larger context it’s perfectly balanced with ryan gosling just killing it,2023-07-21 15:34:35

the reviews here seem mixed and thats what im seeing from other subs even those with lots of women on them and on twitter and tik tok so i remain confused about how this movie got an a cinemascore,2023-07-22 17:59:58
"this was my most anticipated movie of the year and i watched barbie last night and honestly it wasnt what i was expecting at all   
first off its definitely not for kids there was a lot of young kids in the cinema and i dont think they would have got most of the jokes or the story at all cant imagine how they feel   
i thought there was a lot of great and funny moments in the story the costumes and set designs are amazing and i loved the first half of the film and wished there was more set in that world   
i felt the messages in the story were good but also very preachy and political it was basically taking a character that is an icon and making an adult parody about it which was not how it was marketed at all   
i feel on the fence with this film because honestly there was a lot of good parts but also the messages felt forced or rushed id still give this film a 35 because it was good and fun and emotional at times and the actors do a great job but i wish it was less political and was more like the trailers advertised",2023-07-23 05:29:22
it was almost good,2023-07-23 14:34:09

"the sad reality is our societys sexism and prejudice is strongly toxic very much so this barbie touched on these topic was very important

anyone humbled after seeing this movie with these beautiful messages good for you but those continues to hate and exercise sexism or prejudice in anyway probably are the ones set on hating on this movie no matter what and they are the problem in our society",2023-07-27 13:36:25
"i know its a movie for girls and women also its fun sometimes to watch men being made fun of from time to time we get it thats how we’re being stereotyped 

but that part where the kens are being manipulated i dont like that feels a like a purposeful insult

funny movie btw love the practical effect when theyre travelling",2023-07-27 13:54:16
"i was fully expecting to majorly disagree with the movie but i didnt i found it was saying in the face of all the gender  that its all about individualism and finding oneself and that barbies were intended to help with that despite its initially dated ways


while ultimately it dismissed the gender politics by the end which i thought was great i found when it did kind of dive into it at halfway it was a bit confused women apparently hold no power in the real world except when in the mirroring kenland they effortlessly create a war among them for their affection  as history reflects but who isnt the movie more or less dismisses it all anyways

one small moment that carries the theme and that i really appreciated was the scene with the fbi agent calling mattel the fbi guys office was colorful and full of personal materials which is very much against the usual depictions about the fbi in movies",2023-08-01 23:58:08
"the movie was okay overall nothing like you would like to watch it again
the concept was good but has been mainstream since a couple of years now so all they had to do was to play with its execution the story not the set the execution felt average at best

i read a twitter post about how watching barbie after oppenheimer was going to be dissapointing it wasnt wrong it was a little too cartoony for my taste especially in the finale but i enjoyed a lot of the humour nonetheless,2023-07-23 12:05:14
"i thought it could have been better the first part was really great depicted how i played with a barbie when i was younger really perfectly there was a perfect mashup of introduction comedy fashion and just overall pink vibes i was really excited for barbie to go to the real world and battle the patriarchy and was surprised to see the plot go in a different way it went from motherdaughter relationships to the patriarchy to fragile masculinity 

i mean i understood what the director was trying to do but she just shoved so much things in that didn’t get resolved at all sasha and her mom suddenly had a good relationship the patriarchy was resolved only in barbie land and there was barely anything that helped the real world and the whole ken thing was… it just felt like it was spreading the wrong message that men want power because they don’t like being rejected because they can’t cry because they don’t feel appreciated enough i don’t know it just felt like they skimmed over each ideas and didn’t really delve into them there were some good points but it didn’t seem to go anywhere maybe i was expecting too much from the movie 

and the whole thing about the cellulites to the pregnant barbie to barbie constantly saying “i’m  no one likes me” and the whole masculinity belongs to men and femininity belongs to women felt kind of… eh to me like the whole felt so close to talking about feminism and taking apart the patriarchy and misogyny but it just never went there the ending just felt kind of rushed too like i expected barbie to become a “helperbarbie” and decide to go to the human world to help the women there but she just… i don’t know 

but the comedy was on point and there were still some golden moments it’s a good start for people who don’t really understand the patriarchyfeminism in a fun way i feel like i was just expecting a lot and the film didn’t do justice for my excitement but it was still very fun to watch in theatres",2023-07-21 05:48:40

"im a 33 year old ken and i think im gonna go see it again in a few days it was just real good for everyone funny beautifully shot with motivation messages for girls and boys which i didnt expect to be honest unexpected plot character development it was light and a bit goofy in a good way like even the real world felt a bit cartoonishdolly but again it wasnt  and out of place

audience really loved it and i just left with this warm feeling afterwards its just really good again i thought its going to be a truman show with a message about girl power but its actually way more than that will ferrel is great mr is great but gosling really steals the show and for me ken had the best arc

oh by the way its not for kids theres nothing bad or adult but its not a kids movie because we had a lot of kids in the screening and they were definitely bored

edit i also advise you to watch ken things ryan gosling cant live without",2023-07-21 08:07:44

"i don’t understand why some people are so critic about the film…

for me it’s just a film that shows idiocracy of the world and pointing out important things in a silly manner

1 how easy it is to convince people to follow certain ideology

ken came back to barbieland

 it’s patriarchy now

people followed without questioning

 okay

barbie came back to barbieland

  patriarchy 

people again followed without questioning

2 how many men are just friends instead of boyfriends and that females need to see that and comprehend instead of taking it for granted

3 females also do hate other females and that is what is similar between men and women

4 stereotypical dating experience for females like playing the guitar or how come you not see  father that one really got me

5 womenoriented brands whose target audience are females are ruled mostly by men

6 power can be even with skirt and heels 

7 things won’t change until we as females will start changing things ourselves

8 life is constantly changing and we cannot do anything about it 

9 how hard it is to be a mom with maintaining her own happiness and being a good mom  

10 females are constantly being hitted on streets 

11 men can also be sad and cry

12 it’s okay not to “fit in” team alan and weird barbie

13 it’s okay not to know who you want to be and it’s not necessary to stick to one label you can be not only barbiedoctor etc

14 big companies are oriented on profit rather than good ideas

"every car in the movie is made by gm usually a chevy to the point where it’s distracting the one the main humans drive is a 2024 concept car that was supposed to release around when the movie did every shot with that car frames it in perfect profile like a commercial and it’s really annoying i’m surprised not to see more people pointing out the obvious product placement 

i thought i was going insane until the first scene in the mattel exec building where in the background you can see two buildings out the window one has the wb logo on it and the other has the gm one",2023-07-26 12:28:03
"sooooo i just watched the movie and luckily all 6 people in the screening didn’t talk loudly or played with their phones during the movie small step for menwomen but big win for human kind 

loved the movie quirky greta did another wonderful job loved all the small details and wonderful messages across the board definitely worth a recent rewatch 

when discussing the movie afterwards me and my so had the same questions about two specific scenes and their meaning and i was wondering what other people thought about that

 spoilers ahead as i will be discussing two scenes the second one is a turning point in the movie so watch the movie before reading

1 the high school scene
barbie sees sasha and wants to approach her she is stopped by a girl who basically tells her that sasha will destroy her if she talks to her 

i was completely taken out of the movie by this scene as i didn’t understand who that girl was and why she would do what she did first i thought she was some kind of supervisor to watch over kids so no strangers can approach the children than i thought she feared sasha as she described her as kind of a bullydangerous individual which she isn’t everything sasha said to barbie was mean but not without logic and when barbie left crying that girl got even more screen time saying something like i told you so so what exactly did this scene mean and why wasn’ left on the cutting room floor barbie could have directly approached sasha and the experience for us viewers would have been the same is it just because hey we need a quirky girl for whatever reason

big spoiler don’t read before watching the movie

2 inciting ken infighting
so the barbies get rid of the brainwashing of all barbies and want to initiate an infight between the kens all the barbies go on the exact same date with their respective kens alphakens are self indulgingly playing guitar and “eyebanging” their dates for four hours thinking that is what they want rather than boosting their own ego with it this part i get but suddenly all barbies disturb the play and start to look at their phones and talk about how great another ken is and just leaves to go to another ken kens get irritated and they plan to destroy the other kens the next morning

i’m probably missing something but even though the kens are annoying and narcissistic they don’t really deserve that treatment of being left on a date for another person 

as this was a big turning point in the story i thought this was a cheap way of setting up the divergence especially with alphamales and toxic masculinity groups and incels talking about how wicked women are toying with men and stuff it would make much more sense if the barbies did something normalfeminist behaviour and the alphakens start to hijack the conversation with their toxic masculinity if going the jealousy route something on the line of “hey the other ken is good at insert proud man hobby why not let him do it” make it about horses as beachken loves them it would make much more sense to resolve this around the tropes of toxic masculinity than women “manipulating” men with jealousy now you gave all the edgelords alpha males and incels reason to say look this is how women manipulate us


so please tell me that we were wrong and we just couldn’t see the hidden layer of this scene

poor kens have to get back to homelessness after losing their mojo dojo casa houses",2023-07-28 04:58:54
"i think all the people complaining about the exaggerated goofiness and the message are completely missing the context

only this movie and this world can pull it off while making it believable and thats what makes it so effective",2023-07-21 15:33:06
"one other thing reddit is a young crowd with a lot of teens and students so i know people will  on me for saying this but as someone with a young daughter i now feel i can’t really buy her the barbie play sets etc if mattel has made the backstory of barbieland that the kens live on the street and only barbie had jobs and oppresses ken i mean what kind of message is that to send to little kids 

and yes i know this wasn’t a kids movie and no we didn’t personally take our daughter but the theatre i was at was full of little kids

regardless of that i’m sure mattel’s plastic junk will be clogging our oceans for hundreds of years to come",2023-08-01 05:27:42
"i love how greta gerwig is making it extra clear that jo marchs true ending has her single

the movie was signalling that ken and barbie would get back together but i trusted greta to stick the landing",2023-07-21 23:21:32
barbie was much more enjoyable than oppenheimer which is weird because i love courtroom dramas perhaps because i know how oppenheimer ends while barbie could have gone either way,2023-07-23 01:43:03
"34f  figured out why i didn’t like barbie

anyone of similar age remember going to see mean girls in theaters  remember walking out super stressedanxious  remember hating the movie

it came out when i was still in high school and i remember going to see it with my girlfriends  we drove ourselves so we had to be 1617  we all left kinda hating the movie and feeling really stressed  it’s because it was far to dang real it wasn’t a comedy  it was an intensely horrifying documentary  love the movie now that i’m far removed from hs

anyhow  i think that’s why i left barbie feeling the same  it’s far to fricken real for me  the last company i was at was 90 white straight married men and they treated me horrifically ie i spoke up about some math we were a little over zealous on and potentially going to lose customers over if they found out we were full of   only to have my manager say “well you’re just wrong” … and a second direct quote “if you weren’t a woman you’d be fired by now” which was a followup statement to the convo “i feel like i’m treated differently because i’m the only female on the team” “i don’t think it’s because you’re female”

i gave up on everythinglife for a minute just like barbie did and became really depressed again just like barbie  it was a really rough time in my life and it was barely 6 months ago that the fers laid me off after being miserable working for them for a year and a half  so barbie is just a little too real for me right now hopefully i grow to enjoy it like with mean girls because i did still laugh quite a bit weird barbie was the best  my sister and i definitely had one of those and she was indeed always in the splits

figured i’d share since a lot folks saying they didn’t like the movie are getting labeled as “must hate women” … and that’s not the case with me  so likely not the case with others too 

i just don’t find it to be a comedy yet  it’s an intensely horrifying documentary haha",2023-07-29 14:57:31
"so regarding barbie having a negative impact on girlswomen and the edgy teen roasting barbieis that even true i highly doubt barbie set back women 50 years thats just conjecture barbie at the worst just represented society in that moment 

now before someone comes at me with barbie promotes an impossible standard yada yada do we have quantifiable data to say barbie has caused x amount of damage to girlswomen slowed down womens advancement funny enough a big counter hysteria regarding unrealistic barbie standards may have actually ended up helping women thus barbie helping or just a small handful of people raised  with their personal critiques about barbie and how barbie personally made them feel those takes were able to gain some mainstream traction and embed themselves within the cultural psyche 

i honestly think most girls that played with barbie as children have positive feedback on barbie dolls some insensitivepoorly executed dolls throughout the decades doesnt matter that much and the counter reaction more than makes up for those dolls and helped make this movie",2023-07-22 07:44:34
"i liked it everyone was great zack snyder joke was a1

studios are learning they didnt put the feminist message hammering in the trailer they pulled a bait and switch i thought it would be a really fun time and it kinda was but man did that ending let me frustrated yeah we treated the kens horribly and they revolted lets go back to the exact same system guess i was simply not the target audience,2023-07-25 05:48:15
i really think the movie had solid potential to tackle toxic and stereotypical masculinity and if they had just stuck the landing it would have been a fantastic movie 23 of the movie was great the last 13 they really  the pooch on and the more i think about it the more it ruined the movie for me,2023-07-29 02:56:29
"enjoyed robbies interpretation of barbie though i think anne hathaway wouldve also been a solid choice or emily blunt

i also think this movie will surpass oppenheimer given barbie seems to resonate better with all audiences young and old",2023-07-24 03:43:31
even though ken found himself in the end i still felt very bad for him bc he’d been chasing this one girl who he was told he was meant to be with for years and she couldn’t reciprocate the feelings,2023-07-24 06:03:35
i finally watched it and i’m surprised a movie this juvenile can rough some feathers i didn’t love it but  some of you need to learn a sense of humor,2023-07-30 02:48:18
"i watched the film a few months ago and really loved it i just have a question about the meaning of the ending

"great movie but i guess i hoped the plot and thrill would be a bit morefelt more like a marvel film with great dialogues and funny lines but nothing of extreme suspense or thrill

the kens who were fighting over beach suddenly reading 3 books and then brainwashing the brilliant barbies into being their  was a bad arc indirectly targeting that if a woman takes the different routelobeys a man its not her independent decision but that she is being brainwashed by ken was something that could have been differently donekens make a potion perhaps

other than that the confusion that a barbie can do and thnk what she wants but if she doesnt believes in a particular mindsettype of empowerment the  she is being brainwashed and its the patriarchy undermining both the barbies intellect and overstating kens one making it all his fault was also very shallow writing and i really they missed a great plot point here

other than the the whole preface its barbies world and she is a girl boss who picks her own ending and does what she wants was great in carrying the message and i hope greta gets many major franchises after this",2023-07-23 10:43:37
barbie was fun i do dislike the very very dated form of elitist feminism the film promotes which reflects the priorities of rich white girls at barnard or something,2023-07-23 20:52:42
"you know this couldve been a great satirical social commentary comedy if it had of just been about how the kens where sick of being treated like second class citizens and decided to change things but ended up treating the barbies as bad and neglectful as they treated them in the end they acknowledge that both sides had problems and decided to try and implement real equality between the kens and barbies

also with the barbies being the more dominant gender being that it is barbieworld and therefore they hold the prominent positions of power and play the important roles presidentdoctorscopsmilitary so shouldnt ken be the one learning from the real world that they can be anything and not just a barbie accessory",2023-07-25 05:13:25
"during the monologue i could personally relate to a bunch of the negative experiences listed even though i am a straight white dude in a position of relative power which i think weakened the feminist message a bit by conflating problems that are just innate to the human experience with gender dynamics maybe these issues are more true for women though i don’t know

on the plus as someone who actually tries to use my platform to elevate women in my industry i felt called out by the messaging that it needs to be okay to not be excellent this is something new i’ll keep in the back of my mind for being a better ally",2023-07-25 10:08:58
"1010 this movie was everything i wanted it to be and more a lot of posters are complaining about its lack of subtleness while there certain themes thrown in the viewers face there was also layers of feminist theory and intersectionality baked into every layer of this film 

ultimately i think think barbieland is supposed to represent the women and more specifically white feminists who believe the feminist movement has already won think the “girl boss” type so many women argue now that the feminist movement is done equality has been achieved ignoring the barriers still in place for many women especially those with intersecting identities 

that’s why it takes america ferrera‘s character and her daughter women with intersecting identities to teach barbie that her brand of feminism has not helped or solved all the problems for every women by the end of the movie barbie’s decision to leave barbieland and go to the real world represents how she’s accepted this reality and no longer wants to live behind the veil of ignorance 

it also represents how this “girl power” feminism is commercialized and sold to women like how mattel and its executive board of men still control barbieland behind the scenes girl boss feminism ignores that men still hold much of power in the world and tagging girlboss on ig photos doesn‘t change this 

this movie is also clearly criticizing white beauty standards this is illustrated by america ferrera’s character a latino women sketching a blonde white women and later telling barbie ”i can’t be you” this is commentary on the impact of media that has traditionally presented white beauty standards as ideal has on nonwhite women from an early age it also shows the impact of unattainable beauty standards on even women like barbie or real life women like marilyn monroe who do fit these ideal standards

america ferrera‘s speech at the end that cures the barbies is literally the concept of double consciousness first theorized by web dubois a notable early civil rights thinker and activist there’s so much more that i could dive into but whoever wrote this script is clearly wellversed in feminist film theory i could write a master’s thesis about all the theory presented in this film   


lastly i find it laughable that people think the end of the movie invalidates the message of the film barbieland reverses gender roles so this represents how in the real world even when feminists “won“ battles like securing the right to vote it still took decades for meaningful change to be implemented expecting that change to be immediate when gender roles are reversed is irony at its finest they’re missing the point that both the patriarchy and feminism are institutions and ideas people invented to deal with living in a  world there isn’t a magical way to fix it we saw how everyone was negatively impacted in some fashion by both the gender roles and systems in the real world and barbieland however by acknowledging this dynamic and emphasizing with each other we can begin to fix it

i think this movie did a fantastic job in bringing to light criticisms of both feminism and the patriarchy it uses satire in a very similar way to the  manifesto which is going to going over a lot of people’s heads regardless i loved every minute of it and am glad this movie is bringing these conversations into  the spotlight",2023-07-25 21:28:37
man i really wanted to like this i dont margo is a gem gosling delivers above and beyond the rest of the cast does their part i wish cera was more of a character tbh but  what a mess it really needed to figure out what it wanted to be it felt like three episodes of the barbie hbo special vs a complete movie everything moved so fast we never got time to really settle into a ruleset before we were introduced to another the last act was a great idea but it was over so soon same with the first for the middle well light spoilers bur she spends 5 minutes in the real world it seems not enough to really sell the necessity of that plotline although the mother was a real treat,2023-07-26 01:46:16
"i was super excited to watch this hoping it would be great honestly thought it wasnt good i think they had to dig in deeper into the feminist arc as a man i had no problem with that as no one should in fact most of the good laughs from the movie came from that kind of humor but everything was just so spoon fed they explained in excruciating detail and the dialogue was boring as 

so much stuff just took me out because of how unfunny it was everything in mattel was unnecesary and long that scooby doo office chase scene was nowhere near close to being funny in the slightest all the hi ken hi barbie stuff was just head scractching at first and grew superbly old real quick you see the message the movie wants to deliver from a mile away the one surprise was that the kens rebel in barbie world and i thought that was incredibly forced and implemented so poorly though most of the actual good jokes came from the human character helping out barbies regain themselves

overall to me most of the jokes didnt land barbie thinking about dying and then the music stops is cringe and not really funny i dont really see how this is getting so much praise aside from the incredible set and world building which is amazingly well made

the best part of the movie was the last 20 minutes and those were pretty good actually horrible ken civil war and dance off aside barbie and the creator talking was really sweet again the feminism part not that i have to care was ok it actually brought some of the good jokes its just a bad movie around a good message 510",2023-07-26 15:04:27
"so yeah i didn’t get this one at all they were clearly not aiming to make just a comedy but something that had a definite theme to it that gave us an analysis of the world and the systems we have centering what men and women are conceptualized as but everything fell flat for me because none of the characters settings and interactions felt real it was all very aggressively skit like with no rhyme or reason so whatever revelation the characters were having to me it seemed like they were just being silly and saying things in a silly way so at the end i ended up not feeling any connection to the themes and the story 

i am surprised that gerwig and baumbach wrote this because their previous films were known to make things feel natural

edit  bruh i was pronouncing it kenoh it’s kenuff ",2023-07-30 09:30:34
definitely pretty meh its not a terrible movie and i admit i did laugh quite a bit but it feels like a massive datura trip and i still dont know what the message is that it tried to tell me,2023-08-07 04:02:44
barbie is overrated,2023-08-07 05:45:57
the definition of mediocre either that or growing up with shrek toys story and the lego movie spoiled me,2023-08-28 16:26:12
i loved it my only real criticism is the part where barbie sees the flashes of human life or whatever and it just kind of seemed like it was all moms and daughters i feel like this kind of went against the idea put forward in the beginning where the little girls are playing with baby dolls but then barbie shows up to say … hey women don’t have to be mothers to be valid they are valid in their own right and can be whatever they want to be,2023-07-21 14:38:09
810 had a great time unironically did just about everything better than oppenheimer the message was probably too accommodating to men though tbh just with a real life lens not a real fault just a women shouldnt have to be responsible for the correction  growth of men thing,2023-07-26 07:55:26
i want to see more of ken hopefully there will be barbie 2 or tv series cause i genuinely loved the movie went to see it two times now lol the movie theater was crowded lol,2023-07-26 19:11:06
1010 masterpiece,2023-09-11 00:35:12
never seen so many cute  girls in one place since college bro lol the movie theater was filled in pink,2023-07-22 06:17:53
felt like a movie released in the 2000s take that as you wish i enjoyed it,2023-07-22 23:31:11
"beautiful piece of pop art

saying this film is politically correct is an understatement",2023-07-23 12:53:47
"one thing about this movie i don’t get is if goslings ken is beach ken meant for margot robbie’s barbie and their similar outfits show this as well then why is ken like a dumb himbo beach dude but margot robbie’s barbie is using these elaborate terms like “cognitive dissonance” and quite clever 
shouldn’t she be a  beach barbie as well

seems like because greta gerwig wanted to show the kens as  and all the barbies as empowered and smart there was a big missed opportunity to make the barbies more fun and interesting you could have had president barbie genius scientist barbie but also  “math class is hard” barbie and there could have been funny moments between barbies but it seems like most of the barbies have the same basic personality

it’s ironic because i know that was meant to show barbies and women in a good way and the kensmen as the burt of the joke but it really just made the barbies kind of bland and boring in their own movie imo and the worst part is margot robbie’s barbie is kind of the most boring one

idk seems like it would have been more fun if you had barbies and kens all doing different jobs in barbie land and having different personalities according to their outfits",2023-07-24 12:14:29
"the america ferrera speech on ordinary barbie was so confusing since its kind of implied that this barbie would look like americawhich seems like they kind of already do what makes her normal 

not only that but mattel has created several plainly dressed barbies lol",2023-07-29 06:38:56
"great cast great sets and really funny movie

movie is also very political which given that barbie had such a large cultural often controversial impact makes sense so my comment below is going to be on the political message

im sorry women still feel forcedpushed by society to meeting these expectations of them that are unachievable because the expectations themself are mutually exclusive mentioned in speech by the mom towards the end being who you are as a person should be enough barbie telling old woman on bench shes beautiful and that men to this day often dont understand that women dont owe them anything ken coming to grips with it not being barbie ken but just barbie and ken these are clearly themes that still resonate and its important to address them

the world is still male centric in many ways and to show this imbalance the movie uses the topic of supreme court seats however by not giving ken a single seat on the supreme court at the end because barbie wants to match the inequality she saw in the real world the movie suggests that the power balance towards men is 90 which it just isnt its 63 if you want to use supreme court seats as representation so we arent at equality yet and we should keep fighting for equality but inequality in todays patriarchy as they call it in the movie isnt at 90 levels

and i think thats kind of where you lose the message as a movie and things become a bit heavy handed for my taste",2023-07-31 07:28:06
"wanted to make this post but it redirected me here
just watched the barbie movie

tldr
barbie movie is great nothing against men just empowering women one bad scene imo other than that def a good watch and lesson of the real world were in now

30m and i just cannot understand why other men were so put off by this movie

i guess mainly chronically online conservative men but still

if you as a man took offense to the barbie movie you are corrupt misguided and just plain delusional 

it wholly encompasses the patriarchy we still have today with contrast to a matriarchy of the barbie world along with how easy it is to take over the world like the kens take over barbie world and how barbie world isnt better from men in charge to then how easy it is for barbie to take back ken world

i thoroughly enjoyed this movie it had me laughing immediately at the little desert girls smashing their baby dolls to the beach off and just every other joke made in the movie especially the barbies easily being able to fool the kens it was very funny while also covering serious topics

i guess spoilers for the next paragraph ahead but i wont cover it

one joke that didnt land for me was the will ferrel ordinary barbie scene
he says its a terrible idea his team then says itll make money so he says he loves it
my interpretation of it is that women being the normal submissive housewife isnt good enough or that them being ordinary people still isnt good enough but how is that a joke how is that funny at all id much rather the scene be him hear the explanation and a consult the team and like it or b think about it for a min and have like a eureka moment for all his team
that one scene just seems to undermine the entire premise of the movie for me


aside from that one scene 910 movie imo again im a 30m and this absolutely gave me joy to watch i definitely played barbies with my cousins as a kid and no man should be ashamed of that or ashamed to be emotional i def had my crying moments during this film and just thoroughly enjoyed the movie as everyone should

thats my rant thank you for reading if you got this far ",2023-09-12 04:15:29
"absolutely loved barbie the cinematography was great both gosling and robbie nailed their roles the dance scenes were gorgeous and the commentary was something that everyone needs to hear and reflect on
issa rae was amazing as president and mirren was perfect for the narrator
i’m very surprised with some of the jokes and truth bombs that were dropped in the movies 1010 i do agree that the ending was a bit shakey but ultimately landed",2023-07-22 07:38:47
this movie is covering materialism consumerism patriarchy sexism equality war creator  existentialism etc etc etc definitely not a kid or teenager flick  more like philosophical movienever really like greta work and this also fall in that category 510 for me,2023-07-22 15:07:59
i like how it challenges both ideas both worlds i feel like it found a good balance in the end it doesn’t really accept either extreme side presented at the beginning nor in the middle,2023-07-23 09:52:41
"was a great movie i really enjoyed navigating the use of healthy and toxic masculinity not to say that i dont understand that the main point of the movie was female empowerment ofc

i feel like this is a must watch for men its just such a compelling depiction of gender roles in society being brought to their extremes yet maintaining accuracy it makes you think and put a bit of your own biases on trial that you may not have even known you had 

really funny moments and a kind of humor that i wasnt expecting but in a good way had a blast and cant wait to see it a second time tonight c",2023-07-24 16:22:12
anyone else cry at the end,2023-07-27 06:50:03
"this is definitely not a lightandfluffy girls movie this is a film of sociopolitical comment which explores feminism in ways which are astonishingly and refreshingly direct   

yes there are jokes satire and jabs at the consumerist basis of the product but there is also a surprising depth to the realities of gender conflict and existential crisis which the film brings to its forefront 

more thoughtprovoking than fun and that’s a wonderful thing given the widereach of this film",2023-07-21 03:02:07
i could have read this movie in an article feels like a big article,2023-07-22 12:23:44
just curious if anyone else agrees  should have ended 10 mins earlier without the montage and unnecessary exposition at the end  like ending it with barbie saying she wants to be human would have been perfect,2023-07-22 16:03:44
too superficial for my liking except some meta jokes i didnt find it that funny ryan goslings performance some emotion late in the film the sets and costumes and a clever ending are worth talking about pales in comparison with gretas previous two films,2023-07-22 17:11:28
"i just got back and wasn’t sure what to expect but i absolutely loved this movie i cannot stop crying over america ferrera’s monologue at the end she said everything that was just amazing   

i can’t wait to see this again   

”it is literally impossible to be a woman you have to be thin but not too thin and you can never say you want to be thin you have to say you want to be healthy but also you have to be thin you have to have money but you can’t ask for money because that’s crass you have to be a boss but you can’t be mean you have to lead but you can’t squash other people’s ideas you’re supposed to love being a mother but don’t talk about you kids all the  time” gloria",2023-07-23 00:15:13
it wouldve been better as an elf concept with barbie in the real world being the main joke,2023-07-25 14:02:53
"the movie was really entertaining
the humor was sometimes dumb funny and sometimes clever funny i liked it

every single one of the cast was perfect
the scenery is phenomenal the clothes the visual style

my only problem with it was that i felt it tried to empower women by dumbing down men and create the feeling that men destroyed the world its not very gender equality

and even if i disagree with the way it empowered women at least make it good but a lot of the empowerment was spoon fed no subtest

i liked the ending but i wish it would create better solutions for the kens",2023-07-25 21:36:51
"i’m wondering if anyone else thinks they kind of  the bed with the barbieken lack of romance

i think it would’ve been so much more effective if barbie had slowly come to a realization that she didn’t have feelings for ken as she became more human over the course of the movie as it stands it’s implied that she was stringing him along on purpose and it also acts as if barbie and ken were never supposed to be a couple in the first place if barbie was trying to force herself into a relationship because she was “supposed to” rather than purposefully leading him on it would’ve made for a better commentary on the pressures put on women instead she was just a bit of a  about it",2023-07-25 22:11:42
thought this was quite meh funny in places but not enough to sustain itself honestly the movie was a drag and i was waiting for it to end,2023-08-15 23:03:03
do they really have  barbie,2023-12-17 06:25:24
"truly adored this movie just a constant romp of fun and silliness with enough restraint to pull of the emotional core of the story it really felt like a movie that studios have been afraid to make for a long time and i hope we get a fresh wave of movies like this ryan gosling is electric and is getting a lot of attention for obvious reason but i really loved margots performance of barbie as well and i think i will appreciate it more and more with each watch

lots of standout jokes but i think my favourite is the mattel ceo being so defensive about being a man running the company that he drops i even have jewish friends",2023-07-21 07:06:41
really loved this the set design costumes and performances are immaculate the script is super funny and it balances sincerity and absurdity really well there are definitely some things that drag a bit in the second act but yeah this rules everyone is great but ryan gosling deserves extra praise for his commitment to such a goofy role,2023-07-22 17:03:23
i mean this in the most non pervy way possible but i low key expected an end credit scene of the gynecologist checking out under the hood of barbie and just being left speechless but leave it up to the imagination whether she has anything down there or not,2023-07-22 17:19:44
"just saw it

it’s kinda sad now seeing how a large minority are legitimately angry over such a care free inoffensive film

it was fun it was lighthearted when mentioning the sexism stuff hardly brainwashing

i was surprised by the pacing it flew in and there wasn’t as much time exploring the real world as i thought but i enjoyed how it was done",2023-07-23 02:36:06
just got back from watching it  thought it was great with some fun laughs  but i may be the only one to think this but i thought simu liu was also pretty great  i mean he’s still a hollywood newbie compared to ryan gosling but he acted so great against gosling your wouldn’t think it  definitely think he impress me so much  the only actor i thought acted a bit off was america ferrera  her acting felt a bit off at times but her monologue toward the end was pretty great,2023-07-25 06:05:30
"i think the strongest stuff was the interaction between the mom and daughter and also weird barbie 

even with good themes and good intentions it was entirely predictable",2023-07-26 01:26:54
critically the vo was like a desperate attempt to communicate even more what is going on i think there’s one scene with an iphone for a joke for some reason the end explanation bit was 10 minutes too long and how many times did they say patriarchy but i liked it overall love greta and noah,2023-08-09 05:09:06
got to see it it was great had me laughing and crying it was really good to go in with no knowledge of what happens because that just makes everything that more hilarious and poignant i’m really glad i caught it in theaters too the sets were gorgeous,2023-09-23 15:04:10
lotta people on here forgetting this movie was cowritten by a man,2023-07-21 21:53:21
"i just came back from the movie and i liked it although there’s a joke that at least in my opinion undermines its message and it’s the ‘margot robbie is too pretty for this to be convincing’ narrator voice over it kinda implies that there’s women that are not conventionally attractive that would make the scene convincing dunno i guess it’s a dumb meta throwaway joke but it was really off putting

good commentary on the patriarchy pretty effective in showing how men are miserable and turn on each other in a world literally designed for and by them",2023-07-30 03:07:10
i wish they used the term depression instead of death i thought they movie was pretty depressing honestly i cried and felt super sad that one day my son will hate me and we all die  not the up beat movie i thought it was going to be,2023-07-22 01:16:20
"will i like this movie as a trans woman 

i know it’s a weird question i haven’t seen it yet but i don’t mind spoilers i heard it’s very feminist which is awesome but i’m sometimes afraid that some movies or feminist media is a bit exclusive of trans women ofc i don’t have to be included in everything and not everything has to target me but i just wanna know if it’ll be a positive movie experience and not potentially triggering",2023-07-21 17:47:47
the digs at dude bros were absolutely hilarious the way everyone started dying over the snyder cut mention was hilarious the humor was so well done in this movie and it just left a happy feeling at the end,2023-07-21 03:47:32
"man i was surprised how much i enjoyed this movie not perfect and ill get to that in a sec but overall this film has a ton going for it you could tell the cast was having fun with it 

gerwigs aesthetics for the film were perfect

while margot was great gosling stole the show as ken i honestly found the intention of flipping the feminist message of a woman doesnt need to be defined by a man and directing it towards men to deconstruct the way men seek status through women was legitimately profound

that being said there are some funky elements of the gender mechanics that are a little wonky at the end like the movie sort of goes out of its way to show that the kens are sort of lesser they are accessories even if it doesnt ultimately effect who are they are as people but that just raises such an odd question about the movies themes given the very explicit intention of comparing barbieland and the real world to criticize patriarchy this is reinforced by the kens being denied real political power over their lives at the end

also honestly ferraras plotline with her daughter and the resolution essentially just being the daughter going no mom you drawings are cool just feel underbaked

over all though despite this critiques i genuinely loved this movie certainly way more than i was expecting to as a man in my 30s",2023-07-21 04:25:36
"i watched it with my sister we loved it
it was genuinely funny and had good messages that didn’t come across as cheesy

i had also gone into this movie thinking it was going to be more kidsfocused i was pleasantly surprised

 the narrator 4th wall margot robbie interruption
 gosling ken yelling sublime of all phrases
 the husband doing duolingo 
 calling barbie a fascist

"an alright movie wouldnt see it again though im definitely not the target audience kinda got dragged into seeing it since a relative had her bday and wanted to see it 

margot robbie was gorgeus and the highlight of the movie for me which says how little interest i had in the actual film

movie got a couple of chuckles out of me here and there but i dont remember any of the jokes really nearly fell asleep the last 10ish minutes

the feminist slant is what stands out most to me after seeing the movie it is kinda take it or leave depending on you attitude to the ideology

"1010 movie if the year had an extremely wide diversity of elements going on for it demonstrated a lot of matrix tier sciences of the holographic universe from interdimensional travel ken teleporting all over california barbie downloading of memories while meditating and her shining moments and the alchemical interactions of elementary souls with the personality types that we are programmed and born with 

in the beginning barbie was just that the personality type of barbie but as she was exposed to the higher dimensions of earth as earth has full spectrum science and soulpersonality types unlike barbie land where there is no fire or water and only barbie ken personality types in different bodies and allen her soul evolved to want more out of life kens soul was incapable of experiencing joy independent of barbie so when he was exposed to the real world of sociopathic patriarchal power he adopts patriarchy as a means to find meaning in his own life 

the mattel execs portrayed illuminati tier understanding of alternate dimensions the men in power mattel and the department of homeland security both had knowledge of barbie land and mattel was tasked by dhs with capturing the interdimensional being of barbie but not ken and the suppresion of knowledge like some kind of scp secret society as the movie depicts mojo dojo casa house the idea originated in barbieland before it manifested in our own world suggesting that original thoughts and ideas have to first nucleate in alternate dimensions before those ideas can manifest here on earth  the mattel exec hollywood ferrell even had occult powers of influence similar to the jedi mind trick as he was almost able to convince barbie to imprison herself the ceo loses his temper starts to yell at barbie and starts calling her names and it almost works barbies eyes glazes over she starts talking dreamily and complacently takes steps toward her prison box fortunately she breaks out of the trance the ceo put her under ken returns to barbie land with powers of influence of his own and uses it to wreck havoc on the social structure of barbie land bc the barbies had no psychic defenses against kens power of influence bc ken now has the advantage of being an interdimensional being and has been exposed to a wide spectrumradiation of personality soul types in the real world that are nonexistant in barbieland 

ken wanted power bc his soul was programmed to be codependent to barbie but barbie had such a dream life she really had no need for ken other than a pretty face on the background after kens failed attempt at taking over barbie land he and barbie converse and thats when he starts to break free of the matrix and his personality type barbie helps him realize its barbie and its ken thats when he has a revelation that as barbie puts it maybe the things that make you you arent really you pretty plain and typical line but it hits ken hard and it changes him ken is me he is then released from the constraints of his stereotype to live a life for himself rather than for barbie and his soul changes with refreshed outlook on the meaning of his life 

truth is the character developement portrayed in the movie is more drastic and impactful than what we experience here in the real world neither ken or barbie were ashamed to show that they were learning changing and evolving while that sort of expression of genuine gayness being true to oneself on earth is socially unaccepted its something to keep in mind just as weird barbie wants to control sanitation that the elite of hollywood government corporations of our earth want absolute control over our lives and controlling ones culture is among the most powerful effective and discreet ways of waging war because exposure to culture and exciting energies and souls are catalyst to revelations

but aside of the occultic ¡sublime illuminati messages in the movie this movies great best music world class dance scenes cheap jokes at the patriarchy that just melts like butter fabulously fantastic wardrobes the comedic stream of jokes dont slow dont ever the humor is both crude and sophisticated and definitely movie of the year in my books",2023-08-04 04:01:43

this movie is by no means manhating as badly as they say but a blatantly sexist or racist tirade such as black female president wouldnt come off well so they doubled down on manhating excuse to get people not to see this movie",2023-07-26 09:28:33
"didnt like the ending why would she want to be human

she probably would have enjoyed building a new barbieland more",2023-07-22 13:11:44
"enjoyed the movie as a one time watch the colours music and acting was all on point 

honestly the entire movie is an excellent marketing strategy most people now know barbie as more than stereotypical barbie parents will start buying young girls barbies again 

also the ken plot point was to disposition itself as barbies boyfriend and the new gen kidsboys can also play with ken dolls 

last year if someone bought dolls for little girls it was borderline scary you could be cancelled for assuming genders but now dolls will be back and making fun of young boysgirls having barbieken dolls wont happen anymore",2023-07-26 03:36:17
i liked  the movie  i didnt love it i admire what it attempted in style in this comic book movie dominated world  it was like greta knew she had one shot at a blockbuster summer film so hamfisted all she could about the patriarchy and the affects in one movie and im not mad at it  this movie was made for women and little girls to bond and have conversations while make men  come face to face with the world they created for me the film was an art piece that i appreciate watching once but i will understand that generations after me will love the film,2023-07-29 03:21:33
this is the funniest will ferrell has been in the last 10 years except for eurovision i loved how absurd him and the execs skating together and riding the bicycle together looked there was a missed opportunity for all of them to be stuffed in the car singing that song,2023-07-21 05:54:23
i hope all the actors in this movie win awards  it was great,2023-07-22 06:36:47

saw it with my wife and daughter today wife loved it daughter got a bit bored halfway through and i thought it was just ok definitely some clever moments and overall i think a greatimportant movie for girls but and i know its not a fair comparison just relevant oppenheimer was a zillion times better,2023-08-06 22:50:24
"i think the ga is gonna hate this tbh probably a b cinemascore i knew this movie would get controversial but ho boy they went all  in i legit cant believe wb or any studio actually allowed this

cant wait to hear ted cruzs review to point out all of the chinese references and advise us of the latest threat to america the pink scare,2023-07-21 21:45:51
"really funny of course most of all from gosling the message the movie seemed to be pushing past the jokes though felt a little hamfisted especially considering it isnt a novel one like the target demographic will eat it up of course but it isnt quite nuanced enough to be interesting in 2023 when we as a society have been talking about that message for a while

the ending also felt a little weird to me like the movie earlier on definitely says that ken and barbie the main ones are bfgf ken says it barbie doesnt deny and in that context barbie is definitely a toxic partner but the resolution of the movie is that barbie doesnt have to be forced into a relationship she doesnt want of course but the movie is the one that said they were in a relationship in the first place again feels like a copout to use as another avenue for another shallow message that isnt anything new

michael ceras character was hilarious everytime he was on screen i was cracking up at how awkward he was 

i had done the barbenheimer yesterday so saw both and overall they were both good but the surface level themes and storytelling in this movie were very obvious after seeing the other movie as soon as they showed the kid playing with dolls it was obvious it was the mother and as soon as ken started going back it was obvious he was going to have a villain arch",2023-07-24 12:41:08
"we never arrive late at movies but this time due to various reasons we arrived in the movie theater 5 minutes late and the movie had already begun cineplex ultraavx in quebec i suspect there was some mistake and the ads and trailers did not play we were  to miss a few minutes downloaded the movie afterwards just to be able to see those first minutes

i thought the movie was fun great nostalgia vibe not a perfect movie but its a good comedy that doesnt take itself too seriously while still being somewhat serious some moments are a bit on the nose",2023-07-25 13:32:48
"barbie

did you grow up playing with barbie’s if so you probably know that not everyone likes the idea of barbie some people think barbie’s are harmful to children other people love barbie this new movie called barbie explores why barbie could be problematic greta gerwig is the director previously she directed little women it stars margot robbie from birds of prey and suicide squad ryan gosling from the notebook and la la land michael cera from arrested development helen mirren and rhea perlman

in 1959 ruth handler the cofounder of the mattel toy company created barbie she wanted this doll to inspire little girls to dream and know they can be whatever they want this thought process seems sexist it leaves out little boys who also can be whatever they want the movie will show you that handler’s idea that barbie will make society better hasn’t worked out as she probably wanted barbie margot robbie and ken ryan gosling live in barbie land where women are in charge barbie needs to travel to the real world where she discovers men are in charge and she isn’t the inspiration she thought she was

robbie plays two sides of the same character at first barbie is very carefree in barbie land and oblivious to all societies’ problems when she gets to the real world however she discovers things seem to be the opposite from where she came from not only is gosling nice to look at but he also will make the audience laugh ken has always felt left out of barbie land until he travels to the real world with barbie unfortunately he learns the wrong lesson from capitalism he finds out men are in charge and wants that for barbie land what his take away should have been however is that men and women can both hold equal power alan michael cera doesn’t have a duplicate therefore he knew who he was from the beginning he has good morals and values which gives him confidence to be the best version of himself meanwhile ken and barbie are struggling to figure out who they are and want to be

the dancing choreography and  expressions were all done spectacularly well the cast including the supporting characters did a wonderful job gosling does an excellent job portraying a more submissive ken in the beginning then more dominant when he wants to take charge of barbie land robbie’s role as barbie was much different than when she played harley quinn  barbie is nice kind and not evil while harley quinn is a criminal who could be good from time to time these roles show she is good at playing different parts which will help her in the future 

not only does this movie have some funny moments but it also has themes that are relevant to what’s happening in life today capitalism equality for all female empowerment and selfacceptance are all things people need to know about

there is a lot of pressure on women to be perfect women have to go to work which usually means getting payed less than men taking care of the house and kids all while looking their best which is difficult to do all the time mattel hoped that barbie would be an inspiration for women unfortunately she doesn’t even look like most people barbie is extremely skinny which is an unrealistic standard for anyone to live up to along with that the company mattel and its founders aren’t exactly honest people  years after barbie was made handler was found guilty of tax evasion

barbie shows one of the reasons the wga writers guild of america and sag screen actors guild are striking they all want better pay meanwhile the top ceo’s of company’s make millions a year however the way it should be is more equal meet somewhere in the middle don’t pay people so little they need multiple jobs to support their family but also no one is asking to become a millionaire barbie is a good movie that happened to come out at the perfect time i would encourage everyone to go see this movie it was well cast and has multiple messages surrounding issues our society faces today",2023-07-25 15:09:44
"can’t say a lot that hasn’t already been said — this is undoubtedly one of my favorite movies of all time best theater experience i’ve ever had

the one thing i’d like to add is the masterful nod to being there when ken is discovering the patriarchy it used the same song or possibly similar enough might have to check that they used when chance stepped outside of the old man’s house and into the world for the first time the one that used the 2001 music just absolutely outstanding",2023-07-21 03:34:08

yes there are feminism element but in a good way not like she hulk which only focus on dissing male like some lady nobody lovelike 
half way of the movie i thought the movie would end with barbie and ken would learn to love each other and work together as a team respect each other bringing the new narrative of happily ever after but it doesnt which is sad to me",2023-07-21 10:42:33

late to the party my praise is endless but…was this the best comedy in the last 10 years i can’t comprehend how self aware this movie was nothing was cringey everything hit i have no idea how they nailed a balancing act to this degree,2023-07-21 07:23:08
the whiplash i get when every single person i know irl really disliked the movie and i come to reddit and its getting praise,2023-08-04 20:33:02

"great set design and soundtrack and some very funny moments but  is the overall story sloppy and some of that dialogue was rough

also was one of the main lessons of the movie for women to just accept sexism and just pretend to be happy to gaslight men to do their bidding i dont think thats the best lesson a film like this could teach",2023-07-21 05:52:04

i thought it was good better than expected could have been funnier though some solid jokes in there also nice to see a film about a doll thats ostensibly about female empowerment not shying away from the topic some of it felt a bit too on the nose  we mothers stand still so our daughters can look back to see how far they have come feels like something no human would say even if theyre a ghost  but i liked the fact the film was quite weird and messy about all that stuff,2023-07-21 05:37:23

i loved this movie waaaay more than i expected honestly i wasnt necessarily expecting to like it at all it had a dip in the middle and im not sure exactly how i feel about all of the social and political messages it was trying to put out there but overall this movie was a blast fantastic acting with a really interesting and out there premise backed up by outstanding visual design and editing better than oppenheimer,2023-07-21 20:19:52

"saw it 2 days ago and mostly loved it although i think the last 10 minutes or so went a bit off the rails

what i really enjoyed though was the messaging it was obviously gonna have some strong feminist themes but frankly the tagline of hes just ken had me worried a bitbut no for women the message is great but as a man i enjoyed kens story arc too and his come to  moment at the end was great

also the movie was funny as  and the ken song was absolutely amazing 

good dang movie",2023-07-21 04:29:32

"i know some people think barbie dolls are damaging to girlswomen but really are they really that bad i would not say they have halted womens progress at all the edgy teen stating they set back women 50 years lol and at worst they simply represent and reflect society at that moment in time 

even the blow up breast doll from 1975 was just actually about a doll becoming a teenager with a single breast size increase i thought it was the dolls breast becoming bigger and bigger and bigger assuming the worst but nope its more so about puberty",2023-07-21 06:53:30

"i liked the middle of the movie where barbie and ken entered the real world and barbie got a reality check i also loved the bonding between barbie and the mum loved the ending it made me tear up 

some of the dialogue was mid and seemed like they only worked because of the great actors the plots in barbieland got too nonsensical for me sometimes ie kidnapping women to unbrainwash them seemed like a lazy way of showing women changing their gender roles",2023-07-24 10:09:56

i’m watching tomorrow so i haven’t read through comments yet to avoid spoilers however i am curious about the perspective of this movie and the mother wound aspect from someone who has an abusive mom all the beautiful tiktok’s i’ve been seeing with this movie has been really touching and beautiful revelations about their moms but idk i have a horrible relationship with my abusive mom so i’m curious how that will be watching it,2023-07-28 00:39:09
every time i see a republican in a cowboy hat in some ad or whatever i cant help but think that cosplaying as a cowboy should be illegal  i love how this film perfectly picked up on whatever sad childlike insecurity that is for these men and we should see more films openly mocking grown men being obsessed with playing cowboy  its not healthy,2023-07-23 01:26:23
"saw oppenheimer earlier today and when i told my girlfriend she was  i didnt take her even though she had work and had mentioned not wanting to see a movie about the creator of the bomb and so she wanted to see a movie  i suggested barbie

i liked the visual displays in barbieland and thought some of the one liners throughout the movie were funny  

i didnt feel sympathy for barbies struggle wondering if that was the intention to not feel sorry for a doll  the ken takeover was an interesting development the mattell guys seemed like they lacked something in that story line  ending was meh",2023-07-26 04:13:16
i enjoyed the movie but the continued vilification of men really dampened things you have two of the biggest movie stars in the world who could’ve delivered something super meaningful without being didactic and bordering on the extreme left of ideology it honestly did paint males as a collective bad that is not the way to get your point across and a point that is actually more diluted than ever in todays progressive society the far left simply have the recoil of saying you’re sexist if you point this out it’ll likely go down in hindsight as cringe i’m not sure how old the writers are but most of it seemed to come from a writer maybe around 25 years of age who doesn’t realise that in the real world women aren’t hapless jews and men all evil nazis,2023-07-23 17:10:12
"literally just got home from my screening and i have thoughts

firstly i genuinely think this movie should be nominated for best picture also margot and ryan should absolutely get acting nominations for this i think this was probably the best work they’ve done

secondly i love how this movie discusses the complexities of barbie like i thought mattel wouldn’t allow the movie to heavily address the negativity attached to barbie but the movie tackled it head on and acknowledged it as a genuine flaw of the brand i also love how the movie used characters like midge and magic earring ken 

i also love how heavy and blatant the movie was with gender roles in the real world i know some people are gonna call this movie woke and say it’s pushing an agenda my response to that crowd duh it’s barbie of course the movie was gonna push an agenda barbie has always been a brand centered on feminism even if they haven’t always done it correctly it’s no surprise that the movie took the stance “women are just as intelligent and capable as men” i myself am not a woman but i do know what oppression and discrimination feels like greta did a great job of accurately showing those truths without being preachy or coming off as insincere it didn’t feel like barbie was doing this to check a box off a clipboard this message had meaning

finally i love how much energy everyone put into this even the people with small roles i know he was on screen for a small amount of time but i could not take my eyes off scott evans everytime he popped up",2023-07-21 04:22:15
"gotta say after back to back slam dunks from gerwig  this was a huge letdown 

it was just messy and clunky act to act it didnt seem to follow a coherent idea so many ideas  many of them good  but none of them got their due 

the feminism was just super on the nose and im not sure gerwig had anything compelling to say about the patriarchy its almost like they suggested womens default was to be deferential to men hence them needing defenses to survive patriarchy 

maybe my expectations were to high  but this movie just never clicked into place to me despite many lol moments",2023-08-06 05:31:05
issa raes fbomb was so funny,2023-07-21 02:27:33
i liked it overall but i watched it after oppenheimer and seeing it after that movie really raised my expectations the message was beautiful but some of the jokes seemed dumb to me,2023-07-22 15:17:15
this was an ok movie that for some reason lost steam about 23rds of the way in right around when they head back to barbieland where it truly excelled was the comedy  ryan gosling was absolutely hilarious and will ferrel was wisely kept in small doses where it fell flat was when it went it became a jezebel article come to life ie the constant painting of women as perennial victims culminating in america ferreras painful whinefest of a speech overall 610,2023-07-30 20:46:05
"i notice no one is talking about the messaging about beauty when barbie turned to that old woman on the bus bench and told her shes beautiful as if its some touching moment i was thinking why does it matter if shes beautiful or not what does that have to do with anything

lets face it you grow old you look like  and thats okay what we should be doing is normalizing getting old and having wrinkles barbie is scared to death of cellulite but the movie wants to imply that its okay to have cellulite we should want to move pass so much emphasis on physical beauty

the immense pressure to look good is terrible on women and men look at south korea there was an even beauty strike every time the barbies called each other beautiful i just cringed women should be more equal but lets keep the toxic social pressure to look good",2023-07-31 23:51:50
"this movie was worse than i expected it to be i expected it to be pretty good here are some things i didn’t like

it had a very goofy happy go lucky vibe but it came off kind of childish and irritating imo i can see how that was supposed to be ironic but that didn’t make it less annoying 

why does everything have to be a diverse multiverse now i love the animated spiderman movies but the multiverse concept being everywhere strikes me as kind of weird every time it’s used it seems like a lazy way to add diversity to a movie barbie is about a woman and spiderman is about a poc can we just focus on those experiences in depth instead of adding random side characters to lazily show that anyone can be the main character all these characters do is make silly comments and it just seems like fluff we don’t need 

stereotypical margot robbie barbie seems to really like old women for absolutely no reason at all she is sitting on a bench next to an old woman and says “you’re beautiful” for no reason which feels awkwardly random then the old woman says i know and then margot robbie just leaves

ken is not funny and his whole misunderstanding of male privilege is kind of a stolen joke from the recent beavis and butthead movie and goes down the same exact way

the feminist messages in the movie are nothing new and don’t go very deep its dissection of society is shallow and its political correctness feels very corporate i think this movie’s main problem is lack of depth in general

the movie is not very funny its whole sense of humor reminds me of mark zuckerberg trying desperately to appeal to people and make his products seem cool and with the times

the pacing is awkward and the plot is just all over the place things happen randomly and are never touched on again that is objectively just not good filmmaking 

the movie is backed by corporations it’s not any different from kendall jenner’s pepsi commercial and i can’t believe people are buying into it it has such strong ad vibes that it starts to feel like a propaganda movie for capitalist america it has the same sense of zany silliness as a progressive flo commercial

that’s all i can think of right now i know i didn’t do a great job organizing my thoughts i’m just putting them out there in random order the only good thing ab the movie to me was that margot robbie and ryan gosling are good at acting",2023-08-14 14:50:55
the only thing i got from this movie is that men have great taste in music movies and the arts in general are financially savvy great at all sports and are just  awesome,2023-09-03 04:15:12
ken from kenya reporting 010 for me,2023-07-26 04:41:19
maybe you like barbies or pink or political theatre or margot robbies acting but as a movie it was just a hot mess bad pacing humor was dry and sporadic plot and theme took a 180 every few minutes the ceo guy and his officers were gag inducing weird characters like allen and the office worker there was a semblance of plot the character development was slownon existent then sped up to 100 props for trying something different but poorly executed,2023-07-22 09:20:18
"people called me crazy two years ago when i said that not only was this going to be the highest anticipated film of the year but that it was actually going to be good

  



this movie was everything youd expect while also being nothing youd expect i know its stereotypical to call movies that seem to be aimed at kids to not actually be for kids but trust me this film is way more for adults who have had enough

  


  


as a man who likes to believe hes a feminist and very progressive this film still made me very uncomfortable at times and i mean that in an extremely positive way this movie is going to make a lot of men upset and i for one cannot wait

  


  


barbie is on the nose at times while also being very subtle other times and both moments hit their marks in my opinion

  


  


yes this film is going to be nominated at the 2024 academy awards and in quite a few categories its going to win several and if it doesnt i would be both shocked and appalled

  


  


oscars its going to win

  


 best makeup

  


 best art direction

  


 best costume design

  


oscars it will be nominated for

  


 best original song

  


oscars that it might not be nominated for but should

  


 best actress

  


 best supporting actor

  


 best original screenplay

  


 best director

  


anyways go see this movie its a trip a very very good trip",2023-07-21 14:48:02

edit what im saying is though the movie is making a point about the real worldin universe can the kens ever really find happiness and meaning in a world that quite literally wasnt meant for them i mean its literally barbieland i dont think the kens can hope for much equality maybe eventually plus it did seem like the barbies were perfectly fine without ken thats something to consider wouldnt the kens be happier in their own kendom finding meaning and riding horses

again this is just in universe just something to consider",2023-07-24 20:12:23
"maybe someone could help me here 

stayed for the credits and saw hod carpenter  bradley cooper 

anyone else payed attention to that ",2023-07-25 20:27:16
"que the fragile insecure men

anyway loved this movie had me emotional there towards the end",2023-07-21 17:52:36
it was worth the price of admission just to hear warner brothers publicly and openly insult the lunatic zack snyder justice league fans,2023-07-21 02:55:30
"i loved americas monologue about women


thanks for the downvotes guys",2023-07-21 14:41:43
kinda weird how the focus of the movie was on how women have less power then men but the movie ends with the men still in charge and none of the important women moving up anywhere like they’d only take a women’s idea bc it would make more money,2023-07-22 01:00:55
the way all barbies try to overthrow ken by tricking and manipulating them was hideous,2023-07-22 16:43:58
nothing about it is clever or subversive to me i’ve seen better “feminist” films,2023-07-28 17:31:43
had funny moments but i agree with a lot of people that the message was lost it was basically saying the barbie world needs to be run by women only that men need to rise up the way women had to in the real world shouldnt a stronger message be that it shouldnt be men vs women but gender equality,2023-07-31 01:13:21
"the movie practically talks indirectly to the audience the whole time through its use of humour it takes itself just the right amount of serious 

also for a movie so unapologetically “girl power” i’m happy that it 1 didn’t do a romance ending and 2 didn’t validate men’s issues 
as a guy it was uncomfortable to watch at moments because it just eviscerates men’s complaints about the world they built to then go back on it and do an angle about “but ken’s problems are serious too” would negate the whole breakdown they did on masculinity",2023-07-21 02:18:48
greta gerwig just understands women through and through,2023-07-21 08:19:08
"loved it when ken entered the real world and saw how it’s run for men i almost cried i just felt so validated haha ryan gosling was awesome 

a few misses for me though

it really bothered me when barbie apologies to ken in the end why do women always apologise ken didn’t apologise to her and he kicked her out of her home… but then i thought if the roles were reversed and it was the guy “taking barbie for granted” we’d have wanted him to apologise all she did wrong was not like him romantically what do we think about this

i did not get at all the speech ken made in the end about “i am ken” how about like “i can cry i dont have to have amazing abs even though i do” could’ve been an opportunity to call out toxic masculinity in a funny way i think this was a slight miss the speech didn’t land with me nor my male friends i saw it with

i just didn’t get the will ferrell character jokes i got at first he was an antagonist but then we didn’t see him at all the rest of the movie… barbie wasn’t worried about him in barbie land or anything i think he got lost 

overall though it was a hard thing to do make a serious but funny but light but for all ages movie that touches on barbie and the patriarchy what did we think about the last gyno joke it was nice… i mean going to the gyno is one do the most profoundly women things we can do but i wonder if it could’ve been better

side note i just like picking movies apart doesn’t mean i don’t love them",2023-07-21 21:50:15
i didnt like it hard to take it seriously as its a movie representing everything it says it fighting against,2023-07-23 03:32:41
just saw it disappointed with it  thought it would be a lot better given the glowing reviews there was a lot of tiresome moaning about how terrible it is to be a woman will ferrell was terrible ryan gosling did not give the amazing performance people are saying the role didnt require an amazing performance he performed well for the limited role as many actors could i found myself checking my watch for it to be over about half way through just found it boring 410 hopefully oppenheimer wont disappoint,2023-07-21 20:04:12
kendom was the best advertisement for global capitalist patriarchal hegemony since leave it to beaver,2023-07-21 02:48:30
fairly good movie overall but my  the experience was so frustrating cuz of these few people laughing like maniacs at every single sentence,2023-07-23 01:57:16
the one scene i didnt like was the ken singingbattledancing one just didnt work for me everything else fantastic,2023-07-30 23:55:24
alot of stolen ideas from mike jude’s “idiotcracy”,2023-12-18 01:11:30
"im just preparing myself for critics saying that the messaging is too on the nose dont look up got that feedback and im just like do yall know this is satire it is supposed to be over the top

anyways loooove it and its the comedy of the year for me",2023-07-21 12:10:24
"i dunno i guess ill be called an incel and manbaby for this but it felt like this movie spent a lot of time bashing men and didnt give them much in return while it spent minimal time bashing women even when they maintain a toxic matriarchy and gives them plenty of catharsis and sympathy in return

 men in the real world are all sexist and evil to an extreme degree



 men in barbie world prekennification are 2dimensional put all their self worth in women and are all physically attractive to serve the barbies the one man allan who is a more realistic depiction of an average man is portrayed as undesirable


 men in barbie world postkennification are all sexist and evil to an extreme degree


 men are given a status lower than women in the real world in the final status quo


 ken being in love with barbie and putting all his self worth in her giving him attention is played as a joke when thats the exact harmful behaviour the movie is trying to destroy for women yes this is resolved at the end but its not given much attention and its played off as a problem ken has caused for himself


 the monologue for barbie is very explicitly aimed exclusively at women when a lot of what is said applies to men too see above i dont know why they didnt give men the same catharsis and highlight that men struggle with elements of our current society too its almost played off that only women can feel anxiety for example


 when women realise the patriarchy is bad they use complex language and are shown as extremely emotionally intelligent when men realise the patriarchy is bad they say i good while the female characters cheer and say yay you good  well done it feels quite condescending


 the one nonsexist male character the dad is given the classic  dad whos unaware of whats going on and everyone laughs at his stupidity when he talks schtick not exactly a healthy stereotype

 women are frequently shown to be emotionally intelligent and very socially aware the only time theyre not is when theyve been literally brainwashed basically saying dont worry women if you feel like your behaviour has contributed to the current state of society  it hasnt you were just brainwashed the men are always portrayed as emotionally  and fall into dumb stereotypes at the jingle of some keys they have to have societal problems explained to them by women they are not given the we were brainwashed excuse even though men are raised into society in the exact same way women are and women maintain harmful elements of society much like men do

 on that note why is barbie world being a matriarchy presented as an innocent mistake by the barbies but when it switches to patriarchy  its a malicious and intentional brainwashing by the kens


 its seen as a joke and positive thing that men can be gaslit and emotionally abused


i want to take this movie sincerely i feel like its making a really important point i could take it all as a joke but i feel like that would be ignoring some important messages that it very clearly wants to communicate


the problem is when i do take it sincerely i just feel bombarded with a very negative and pessimistic view of men",2023-08-05 21:03:23
every male character depicted in this film is brainless and apelike while at the same time every male in kenbieland is gayish and metrosexual on the other side every female character is complex caring and self aware hows that equal wheres the arc in just one male character and the motherdaughter subplot was waaaay too cringey and unrealistic the film tries so hard to push a social agenda in minors and it does it in the cheapest way possible overall awful and unethical,2023-07-22 23:22:51
a 3 joke snl sketch stretched out over two hours pretty rough fun to see gosling back in  comedic role though and robbie was better in this than anything ive seen her in in a long while,2023-07-24 01:13:45
limmy said it best those wanting to see it will probably be a little disappointed as it doesnt reach the hype but those just unsure will like it alot,2023-07-21 11:00:04
"hollywood is going downhill  the subject and message of this movie is soo good and valid but it is right in the audiences face and the director is spoonfeeding to the audience  it is not shown in a creative way 

a lot of people will get triggered by this comment and a lot of down votes but just see how movies outside of hollywood is showing feminism in a creative way and empowering woman  one example is movies from malayalam film industry if you theese movies you will understand how beautiful and artistic films can be 

barbie was an average movie made for  audience who needs to be spoon fed the message of a movie

i was really excited to watch this movie having loved gretas previous works",2023-07-24 02:32:43
alan was the only average looking man in barbieland and was the butt of the joke constantly having a brief moment fighting the kens only to go back to being a placid butt of the joke meanwhile the average looking girls in barbieland were full fledged barbies and the only one that was really the butt of the joke was the pregnant one midge and then the average barbie idea was some idea thatd make tons of money it felt off to have barbies be very diverse but then the kens were all conventionally attractive in shape men and the one who wasnt didnt even get to be ken and was mostly just a joke,2023-07-29 20:31:07
"got suckered into seeing it again

again major meh  i cant see why this movie is getting so much love  its bland not very funny and the message isnt deep for 2023  i feel like the world has been psyoped by marketing into thinking this movie is actually good

410  meh forgettable boring barely funny not as deep as you all think it is

shoutout to gosling tho  without him the movie wouldnt have been funny at all",2023-08-04 03:23:21
"this was easily one of the best movies of the year 
truly an incredibly well written directed and acted meta narrative about just how weird and uncomfortable it is to be both a woman and also a human being 
i went in expecting to laugh and i did many many times but what i did not expect was to get teared up to empathize and to self reflect as much as i did 
everyone was incredible in this but the definite standouts were gosling and robbie bringing genuine pathos and big hearty laughs in equal measure 
as ken said so memorably sublime",2023-07-21 03:55:04
if every barbie has a ken and theres 1 allen wouldnt the barbies have had a majority if they just all voted wouldnt it have been a better message that not all men agree with the kendompatriarchy no instead we got a great emotional manipulation scene,2023-07-23 21:18:54
tbh though the chevrolet product plugs were obvious whatever statement the movie helped to convey was offset by the blatant capitalism i would never buy a gm or any american car for that matter,2023-07-23 23:54:53
was hamfisted and mediocre very similar to dont worry darling i was expecting something more satire like starship troopers but i was probably dreaming lol no way mattel would approve that oh well its fine if you expect more hollywood  but if you expect more youll be disappointed,2023-07-27 12:34:16
"theres wayyyyyyy too many directions this movie couldve gone and instead of picking one or two it got greedy


the nihilistic jokes regarding gender roles just didnt fold into the story that well totally killed the momentum of the america ferrera storyline with her daughter 
definitely took the emotion outta some pivotal scenes like there was very clearly a choice made in the cutting room where jokes were prioritized over the overall narrative 


that musical scene with gosling was such bs it was the exact type of camp i was looking forward to see in the filmand they gave us such a tiny morsel


overall i blame the fact that no one would sit down for a three hours barbie movie for all of this",2023-07-30 00:15:56
horrible movie didn’t even finish it,2023-07-31 08:53:29
"can someone explain how the way the film treated allen glorias husband wasnt manbashing

i really appreciated kens arc within the film he feels like his life is empty so he latches onto the patriarchy as a way to find purpose within his life in a world where the men are simply regarded for their looks a parallel of the real world but for women it makes sense that he would take on the ideology that would make him feel important as a man

by the end he becomes a less toxic more emotional man that is more in tune with his feelings someone who isnt only obsessed with barbie or his looks but someone who is able to find happiness in nonmaterial things

however the way that the film handles glorias husband  allen seems to be at odds with this messaging

while other examples of the barbies being meanspirited to the kens could be explained with allegory allen the husband doesnt seem to be this way the film just seems to straight up make fun of him as this weird beta male that his wife makes fun of behind his back allen the husband is purely himself dressing the way he wants and learning a language on duolingo in his free time yet the film seems to make fun of him for it

gloria even mentions that she used to date this other guy who was much more adventurous because she learned how to recklessly drive with him going off memory

 where did you learn to drive like that

 well there was this guy and gloria smiles during this

 oh was it dad

 uhyeah it was definitely your dad before giving a sly smile to barbie who understands

from my perspective the movie is clearly making fun of allen the husband while glorifying glorias past boyfriend yet this seems to be at odds with the film otherwise taking a shot at toxic masculinity and men becoming more in tune with their emotions

does anyone have a perspective on this am i missing something because for the most part the reputation of the film being manbashing seems to be overblownexcept for allen the husband",2023-08-03 15:33:24
"i just saw barbie it had some fun laughts but it overall wasnt for me the social commentaries were a  plenty and heavy handed to the point of we get already the ending did not really hit with me and there were just too many subplots i dare say this might be the worst ryan gosling movie i have seen but he tried his utmost best to carry a movie weve seen done hundred of times   
the movie was sold as being new and inventive but it felt like they beat a dead horse the horse theme from ken was weird btw and it was sold on being a socalled greta gerwig movie   
i have yet to see what makes gerwig so special she gets oscar nominations but nothing about her stands out in my opinion and her movies are at best decent and at worst barbie to me it feels like reviewers looks at her movies with different eyes just cause of her name this movie could have had any other director and i cant help wonder if it would have been received with the same praise if it did   
is greta gerwig overrated and did you like barbie   
do we have counteracts to these kind of movies were the man is trying to find himself i recall crazy  love also starring ryan gosling btw but that icks be now because the wife is a horrible person and yet the movie portrays the men as in the wrong i kind of saw that movie as a man discovering himself but basically that movie ends with cal not being able to live without emilie aka he cant be ken without his barbie   
disclaimer i am a dude is it a dude thing i wont got full ben shapiro on the movie i just was underwhelmed after having looked forward to something i thought was reinventive and thought provocking it really wasnt was it",2023-09-15 23:29:14
"ryan reynods is so funny he was cast perfectly


the movie was hilarious and campy

although america ferreiras monologue was too long in my opinion but as a woman i can relate

i expected to see a fun flittery movie but i was given a deep one i didnt cry but felt uncomfortable sometimes

edit it was ryan gosling my bad hahahahh",2023-07-22 02:05:36
im annoyed that netflix stopped sending disks and to see this now required me to buy it it was an awful movie and a waste of money my wide wanted to see it and half way through she fell asleep,2023-12-31 07:23:01
"greta gerwig continues her home run with another amazing film

 margot robbie delivers as barbie probably her best performance
 production design is 1010 definitely winning an oscar for it 
 ryan gosling is the absolute show stealer as ken he put in 200 of kenergy into the role definitely deserves an oscar nomination
 america ferreras monologue is the best scene of the movie
 ken taking barbieland and making into kendom was a great twist
 such a great ending with rhea pearlman 
 only criticism would be the soundtrack for me some of the songs did not work with the movie

one of best movies of the year",2023-07-21 02:38:54
margot robbie really needed this win after her last few bombs,2023-07-22 20:03:12
seems weird that the barbies solve their problems by making men jealously fight over them,2023-08-08 02:50:32
the first 34th to half of the movie was great but it went to  when they started talking about the patriarchy and how  being a woman is they still couldve saved it in the end by having ken and barbie find a middle ground instead of ken turning  into a simp and the the barbieworld becoming a matriarch with the kens not having rights,2023-07-22 14:30:59
"so i barberheimered…

i didn’t like oppenheimer much too lefty for my taste

barbie was a masterpiece tho greta gerwig might just be the greatest living director",2023-07-22 16:29:49
conservative here not that anyone cares but while yes this movie obviously had a message i think no men or conservatives should have a problem with a barbie themed female empowerment movie for girls and women this isnt a movie for men we just need to step aside and let the women have their fun every woman in my life under 80 saw this or wants to see it i wouldnt expect women to care about the expendables or other manly men movies nor whine about how they are too masculine or whatever so why should men complain or butt in on something like barbie this is a movie for girls about girls and clearly feminism has changed the average womans outlook and beliefs ie they are not all about traditional roles so this is a movie thats gonna make them feel good so be it go to town enjoy yourselves,2023-07-23 18:19:26
"the barbie movie wasn’t really about barbie or for girls who loved barbie barbie was hijacked to be a vessel for greta gerwigs bitterness in the same way the scooby doo characters were by mindy kaling in the velma show 
barbie was always empowered and could be anything or do anything since the 60’s ken wasn’t her enemy ken never held her back and it never occurred to anybody to even think that at least until someone as bitter as gerwig came along

oh and by the way in the dolls ken had practically every job barbie had even to this day if you go on a  atlantic flight you can buy a ken pilot and barbie flight attendant doll",2023-07-27 14:52:01
"this movie was really held back by the nonstop spoonfeeding of feminist jargon that sounded like it was copypasted from a teenagers twitter account there wasn’t anything clever about it i found myself laughing on occasion and then immediately cringe when it got all preachy 

the scene in particular that made me wince was when america’s character started ranting about the patriarchy and how bad women have it it’s like writers wanted to remind the audience this was a feminist movie rather than do so cleverly through story telling",2023-08-14 02:15:58

"tldr white feminism  
  
feminism is about all women not just privileged white and attractive ciswomen but also women who are neither white nor attractive nor neurotypical nor cisgender historically speaking barbie dolls have been uplifting and inspiring for many white and attractive ciswomen for women who don’t fit into that mold not so much to a young  girl who is insecure about her weight the barbie doll she owns at home is just a reminder to her that she does not fit conventional beauty standards to a young black girl who is called racial slurs by her classmates at school the barbie doll she has at home serves to remind her of how she is perceived by her peers—although she herself may own a blonde barbie doll her white classmates will never own a doll of a black girl  
  
although mattel has recently begun diversifying their barbies releasing curvy barbies latina barbies barbies in wheelchairs what have you it still stands to reason that for a large portion of the barbie brand’s history this was not the case casting a black woman as the president of barbieland does not erase the negative impacts which barbie has historically had on black girls mattel it is not even a step in the right direction because that would mean actually acknowledging the hurt which the barbie franchise has caused in fact most telling is the fact that margot robbie a skinny attractive white woman with blonde hair was casted as the main character does that not fit with our conventional idea of what barbies are does that not go to show that the barbie franchise is still synonymous with placing white women on a pedestal how then can mattel pretend that the barbie franchise does not still hurt marginalized women  
  
of course that is not to say that greta gerwig entirely ignored the compelling argument that barbie has been a source of pain for many women however this argument came from the character sasha who was framed as being a bratty mean girl who is overly politically correct as well as a social justice warrior this inevitably means that the arguments she made were not given as much weight and importance as they should have been given i can acknowledge that sasha playing the role of a ‘woke’ sjw but eventually finding redemption was likely greta’s attempt at arguing that although barbie has had a negative impact on many girls many girls have also benefitted from the franchise and found empowerment through it and that these experiences are not mutually exclusive—which sasha herself eventually realizes but to not at least give sasha’s initial perspective the respect it deserves by exploring it in more depth  
  
besides that i was a little confused by the entire concept of establishing a matriarchal society only to have it be overthrown by the patriarchy only to reinstate the matriarchy once again i’m not sure what message greta was trying to get at with this entire subplot sure i buy the argument that men use patriarchy and toxic masculinity as a coverup for their own insecurities and as a coping mechanism and that women are the collateral damage sure the film does acknowledge that even under the matriarchy all the kens were oppressed relative to the barbies the film leans into the argument that both patriarchal and matriarchal societies are flawed but then it pivots by a complete one hundred and eighty degrees and supports the matriarchy instead everything goes back to being pink the kens still aren’t given a complete say in parliament and barbieland is restored bizarre  
  
while i can’t really say that i care much for the feelings of men i definitely do take the argument raised by many viewers that by using rhetoric which bashed extensively on men the film isolated a large portion of its potential viewer base if anything it’s not so much the hurt feelings of men that i see as being the big issue but more the fact that men will be less receptive to feminism and women’s rights as a result of films such as barbie which will make changing misogynistic attitudes on the ground level more difficult certainly films and movie series’ can be highly political progressive and feminist all at the same time without isolating its male viewers—take arcane by riot games for instance for a movie series which attracted a largely misogynistic viewerbase of league of legends ‘dudebro’ players it garnered extremely high reviews despite subverting gender roles humanizing instead of sexualizing its female cast and portraying same  relationships misogynistic men have the capacity to be accepting if only we give them the chance to  
  
for a film which poses itself as ‘meta’ and ‘selfaware’ it greatly lacked awareness of the full extent to which barbie—the literal main character—has hurt and harmed girls i did not find it to be feminist or even remotely helpful for the feminist cause if anything the film contradicted its goals i found it to be highly invalidating towards marginalized women and i will not be surprised to see screenshots of the barbie film plastered all over incel communities on the internet really i can only describe greta’s feminism as ‘white feminism’",2023-08-01 11:55:46
well im a barbie boy,2023-07-21 02:36:11
it was absolutely mesmerizing i enjoyed this one much more than boringheimer,2023-07-21 10:56:13
i feel like the world is upside down this was a terrible movie i dont get the positive reviews i grew up playing with barbies i so wanted to like this i thought it would be a fun movie but insteadnot sure what this was i thought it would open with the barbie song instead i got some really bad music bad musical numbers  bad dialoge and an incohesive plot i think i chuckled twice through the movie  it was cringy not funny bad messaging no need to cut down men to prop up woman oh and the one scene where the girl starts telling barbie whats wrong with her and caused barbie to run out  that was bullying what a contradiction what happened to making fun movies like enchanted and toy story or something like pleasantville,2023-07-24 20:05:00
so the takeaway is women only get power by being horribly manipulative and playing men off against other women,2023-07-31 18:10:42
well this movie was amazing in so many ways ive been telling my friends its movie of the year right now and i dont even think its close,2023-07-21 14:17:04
as a socialist explicit anticapitalist rhetoric in a 2 hour long toy ad is annoying other than that i thought it was great,2023-07-22 02:29:25
"barbie was a bad movie but will make a fantastic play

all the sets would’ve been more visually appealing as a play the interaction with characters would’ve been better as a play the narrator would’ve worked better as a play the dance scenes would have worked better as a play the songs would work better as a play

 the overall cheesiness of the jokes and movements of the doll like people would be a great quirk for live entertainment narrator voice in a live theatre would be much more effective as a interactive piece the sets that were mechanical or movedopened into place would be magnificent as a live viewer not so much as an on screen gimmick the song and dances would be better with a stage cast with more proficiency in dancing from tightness to complexity of routines 

what would’ve made an amazing play made an otherwise underwhelming movie",2023-07-25 20:53:49

sets dance numbers costumes were awesome it felt like there was fun surreal adventure in there that mattel took and rewrote into some lateseason parks n rec nonsense about womanhood gosling was great",2023-07-24 20:28:59

this movie did tropes extremely well but turned them on their heads in way that impressed me even more my favorite touch was at the end when she was seeing what it was like to be human i kept expecting to see sadness among the happiness but it didn’t come and yet… there was a melancholy to the vision just wonderful my new favorite film my only complaint was i could have watched another hour of it,2023-07-21 04:44:48
i kinda just want a 2001 barbie odyssey movie i was not expecting a zoolander like comedy,2023-07-21 09:52:37

"to all those saying the men not liking this movie and calling it man hating “didn’t get it”  oh we got it we got it loud and clear 

first there was the kens all being dumber than the barbies then it was the real world men all being dumber than the real world women like gloria who actually had better ideas than men but were held back by the “patriarchy” then it was gloria’s dumb husband getting mocked by his daughter while his wife rolls her eyes then gloria is talking about some other dude not husband teaching her to drive and laughing about how lame her husband is then the kendom despite the kens supposedly being the equivalent of real world women and the oppressed class is portrayed negatively while all male interests are mocked and were supposed to root for the protagonist and oppresser barbies to beat the kens  and why shouldn’t we after all the kens are morons who don’t really want to rule anyway and the barbies are clever and competent 
then it’s ken breaking down and crying while being given the message that it’s ok for men to cry  and yet the scene is played for laughs at a man crying then while ken is crying and telling barbie he loves her she explains life to him like an idiot and tells him he now gets to find himself this is supposed to be a happy ending then it’s the barbie land going back to a matriarchy as a real world parallel except it’s not a real world parallel because as i’ve said the barbies are competent and clever like all the female characters whereas the real world patriarchy is  and incompetent if the barbies were obviously portrayed negatively like real world men it might be but they are not the kendom is
 
it’s the relentless “man dumb woman smart and good and woman needs to reeducate the dumb man” trope that runs through the movie it’s even small side characters like gloria’s husband being mocked and cast as morons for no narrative reason it’s the close examination of everything supposedly toxic about men and the lacking examination of women  although actually the movie unselfawarely reveals a lot of toxic female thinking such as the dismissal of gloria’s husband as a joke the playing off the ken crying scene for laughs while simultaneously giving the message it’s alright for men to cry and the overall want to characterise men as dumb and incompetent  oh and only less stereotypical men such as allan being shown as good yet also playing up his weirdness for laughs

any one of these things alone is nothing just a harmless joke at the other gender but so many of them together add up to a lot of bitterness about men and greta gerwig has revealed that she has more contempt for men than she would care to admit with this script imo

and to those saying i shouldn’t be so serious about a toy doll movie then tell all those praising it’s themes and messaging to shut up and not take a dolly movie so seriously as well or else it’s just a lazy attempt at dismissing opinion",2023-07-30 05:33:04
"it’s not men hating but it sure as  dumb most of the time they try to play it out like satire but that generates more plot holes for the story and the forceful comedy by will ferrel and his gang wasn’t helping the film in any way it has like 510 minutes of worthful moments of message which you can just watch on youtube with compilation there’s seriously no need to watch it again from start to end 

it’s massively overrated for that reason",2023-08-10 20:42:25

my favourite part was the dad trying to learn spanish and getting shat on by his teenage daughter honestly that character was just as much of a bully even after what should have been a redemption when she convinced her mum to drive back i think a teenage girl calling barbie a fascist was a real testament to how much women tear other women down best piece of social commentary when we took a break from dunking on men,2023-07-23 10:59:23
i really enjoyed the film it healed parts of my inner child but i couldn’t help notice that the inclusive movie didn’t include an east asian barbie,2023-07-25 08:52:51
i understand the surface level of feminism to be digestible to every audience but barbie apologising to ken as if he was entitled to her attention and it was her fault he decided to become misogynistic and install patriarchy it’s a terrible message to young girls  “be nice to men and they won’t be misogynistic” like what… i also think the movie focuses on ken’s feelings which isn’t wrong but once again saying that ken did all of this “just because he’s hurt” is somewhat implying that misogyny or patriarchy exist because women are too rude to men and don’t care about them enough that’s simply terrible the rest of the movie is really good that’s my only major complaint,2023-07-22 17:22:55

"anyone else really put off by the “white saviour” joke completely shoe horned in and just knowing that greta gerwig is white herself just made my eyes do 360s

other than that i thought the movie was pretty decent like a 610 i was expecting the message to be something a little bit more powerful tho

i still cant tell if ryan gosling is an amazing actor or complete  realest depiction of men was the godfather scene why did weird barbie do splits for one scene and then never again did i miss something 

hated will ferrell in this one idk if anyone else feels the same way but it was stone cold whenever he said anything in our screening was that intentional maybe",2023-07-26 13:37:46

also why so many references to genitals",2023-07-23 02:34:21
worst movie i’ve ever seen wasted 20 to see more leftist propaganda women already have as much opportunity as men the mindset that this movie promotes is one of victimhood and blame most good men do not want to take advantage of women they are instinctual providers and want to take care of their wives and children if anything blame the people in power for pitting us against each other and making up things to distract us from their control of our minds and lives,2023-08-28 06:52:59
"ive never seen a film thats so heavyhanded with its messaging before in my life that scene where america ferrera literally monologues a speech directly to the audience was cringe to say the least surely a team of writers could have thought of a better more subtle way to get their message across right 

awful with extremely heavy handed feminist messaging cant believe this is the highest grossing film of this year  the masses sure are led around like sheep anything that is hyped they think is great

only positive i can think of was the relatively high production value though oppenheimer was still much better in this regard 

overall barbie 2023 rating 210 silly cringey preachy film that you should skip not even worth watching for free",2023-09-04 19:27:37

i enjoyed the movie it was fun the barbie fantasy world is a good representation of the overall pop culture fantasy world created postww2 to escape the oppenheimerversereality where nuclear war and human extinction are as inevitable as a biological weapon leaking from a government lab intentionally or unintentionally is of no real consequence the result is the same so the people create ideas like patriarchy and political ideology to escape the uncomfortable fact that a powerful minority of humans will always dominate the majority until the hubris of the global oligarchy gets everyone killed they believe they’ll be able to survive in their expensive bunkers and begin to believe there’s an acceptable level of nuclear exchange between nations until escalation begins as is the nature of war,2023-07-24 11:00:10

"feels like gerwig was just really obsessed with the patriarchy and men and ken even though the portrayal isn’t really positive and many of the female characters are just kind of hollow mouthpieces to comment on men and the patriarchy

its really pretty ironic that a feminist barbie movie in which barbie doesn’t love ken is the barbie movie the most man obsessed",2023-07-23 18:38:53
"please dont take me down for this

i havent been this angry at a movie for a long while the last time i was this angry at a movie was when the new star wars trilogy came out but i was only angry at the new star wars movies because of silly nerd rage im angry at barbie because it is blatant hate speech and it deserves all of the anger i can possibly muster

the barbie movie portrays men as dullwitted frat bros who want to terrorize women and take over the world but are too dumb to lead it portrays absolute gynarchy as an ideal society and a perfect world being a world where men are enslaved and only women can lead

watching this movie this scathing objectification of men excavated a longlost memory of my childhood from deep within my subconscious

i was in 4th grade and i wanted to watch cartoons on my moms laptop i lazily looked up cartoons and the first thing that came up was a laundry list of videos of oldfashioned cartoons i clicked on the first one i saw that had a character that looked like me

a title popped up merrie melodies then another one jungle jitters

i then watched scenes of  cavemen screaming jibberish and dancing in circles they were all black i stared at the scream dumbfounded my mouth agape eyes wide open as the screaming cavemen jumped through their noserings and waved around sticks

these characters werent me i thought to myself im not  i dont yell nonsense swinging a stick through the air but i was on that laptop i wasnt smart like the white characters or the diabetic honeyaddicts or the talking  mice no i was an idiotic savage and the coyote who couldnt form a basic working plan was leagues ahead of me

i remember being absolutely livid at those dancing savages i wanted to grab the drum they ohso happily danced on and beat them over the head with it it wasnt funny to me like it was to the kids in the 1940s to me it was a brutal mockery of what i was

i slammed that laptop shut so  hard im surprised i didnt break the thing i suppose they just made laptops different back then

it was on that day i truly realized what racism really was to me im just a regular guy to the men who made that cartoon and to all the little boys and girls who were fed lies about their fellow humans by watching it i was a backwards dimwit and that was all i was and all i would ever be

racists sexists homophobes and other extremists arent born nobody is pushed out of the  swastika tattoo smackdab on the back of their little head extremists are made and this movie is the  recipe this movie is pure evil teaching children that women are perfect highborn leaders and men are uncivilized brutes that women have to babysit lest they destroy the world it is cut from the same cloth as that old racist cartoon i saw as a little kid and it is doing the same thing putting people in boxes what the modern left absolutely loves to do black people are either savage backwards idiots or damsels in distress needing to be saved from their oppressors depending on who you talk to all men are brutish misogynistic rapists and all women are basically high elves

most members of the  never really knew a poc most were raised in small allwhite towns and their knowledge of people of color was based on what racist whites told them they were brainwashed to become racist by their white friends white family and allwhite community telling them that people of color were all exaggerated strawmen that only bring crime and drugs  


when i watched that cartoon i saw what extremism truly was putting people in boxes and reducing them to hideous mockeries mutilating entire groups into twisted strawmen to use as punching bags brainwashing children with sick ideas that they are either superior or secondclass and that is exactly what this movie does barbie is extremist hands down

this movie is brainwashing women to hate men just like how  members were brainwashed and just like how 40s kids were brainwashed this movie is brainwashing men to hate themselves and consider themselves lesser than women and we wonder why the incel movement is skyrocketing in membership

we should boycott this movie and call it out for what it is blatant hate speech a recipe for rampant sexism and radical feminism that should be burned to the ground and never copied down ever again we should teach our children to accept everyone for who they are not make them acolytes for the cult of identity politics where you are either a victim or a strawman oppressor we teach our kids that racism is wrong why are we teaching them that sexism is right",2023-07-25 09:38:50
so barbie is a smash hit and grey gerwig has really normalised and brought back mocking the other gender as dumb for laughs a whole generation of boys will see women loving this and now think it’s acceptable for them too so i guess we’re gonna get a whole lot of bond style  female characters in future and a lot more dumb men bad characters great,2023-07-28 03:55:59
on my second watch i made sure to close the tab once the kens took over barbieland so the movie had a happy ending,2023-07-28 12:50:34
"the beginning little girls destroying the dolls if the visual metaphor of little girls happily destroying the embodiment of motherhood to focus their lives instead on a shallow and materialistic piece of consumerist trash is lost on you then i dont know what to say man but youre probably the target audience for this movie sums it up 

the movie just shows and amplifies how women suffer nowadays  it overexaggerates that a whole lot actually its more of a satire which targets toxic femininity and toxic masculinity and i hate it i believe it just serves as another divisive tool to sow hatred and anger between sexes the movie literally shoves it into your face how awful the patriarchy is what patriarchy none of the women in my proximity have experienced any consequences of patriarchy my female friends especially  on this movie and see it for what it is just an attempt to  mostly on men and paint the idea for the women and girls that they live in a world where men will exploit them which is  truth is anyone with power is going to exploit you men or women and women have just as much power nowadays as men do the fact a chick was in lead of this movie shows how little she has and how oppressed she was when being in lead of this movie

the success of all my female friends and coworkers who are women of great quality and ambition whom i respect very much disprove this movies messages at large it just shows that women are being hunted day till dawn theyre being exploited its like a feminists wet nightmare whered you have to cry and  yourself with how much of a victim you are which just isnt the real world sad thing is a whole lotta females actually think this is how the world is and instead of taking responsibility which is a nightmare term for your typical feminist for their actions they yet again blame the men i hate how effective it is at shifting young females perspective of the world by offering them a sympathy in the shape of supporting their victim mindset with this  of a movie plus they all miss the toxic femininity and that barbie is a  who manipulates is selfish and uses ken for attention them hoes of feminists would even tell you its good and empowering 

the best thing you can do is take this movie for what it is a satirical overexaggerated movie targeting modern toxic femininity and masculinity just take it as a comedy rather than looking for deeper political meaning behind it cuz it really strives far from reality id give it a 510 just for the looks and the acting but the message is boring and divisive its nothing new toxic men are  toxic women rock and so on",2023-07-29 08:19:19
"i’m in shock i’m the only one saying this but wow this has to be one of the worst movies i’ve ever seen it felt like it was written by ai and literally not once did my husband or i laugh random musical scenes weird “jokes” definitely not appropriate for the little girls unless you want them asking about death and gynecologists just wow…my husband and i keeping joking we must live in a simulation because it was that terrible and we only are seeing positive things

edited to say saying it was terrible simply because of the awful storyline and writing it was that bad it’s the parents own dumb fault if they bring their kid so that part was mostly a dig at them because it’s not a kids movie and that’s all i meant",2023-07-22 03:46:25

the line was at the part where barbie is having her breakdown in weird barbies house and she says im not pretty anymore and then the mother who works at mattel gives her a pep talk about appearance or something and then a voiceover says 
note to the screenwriters margot robbie was the wrong person to cast if you wanted to make this point

did i see the wrong movie did people legitimately love it this was a flaming pile of dung with no coherent message if men are so incompetent how did they take over barbie land in like 4 seconds is the message that women and men are better without each other,2023-07-23 04:47:27
"just got out and genuinely had the most fun i’ve had watching a movie in a long time cried laughed the whole gambit i did feel at times like ferrera’s character had a different story originally on paper and it was pared down as the movie went on almost like the second half of the movie was different than the original draft 

the motherhood and creation allegory was greta gerwig in the best way possible",2023-07-21 02:34:34

"movie was absolutely fantastic it was exactly what i was expecting tonally but managed to exceed my expectations even still it was subversive and confrontational about heavy topics while still delivering lighthearted laughs and being incredibly silly i haven’t seen a blockbuster like this in a while and i absolutely loved how fearless it was it’s easy to put out a big budget movie that has nothing to say a lot of people may not like some of the commentary in the film but i loved how brash it was with it it’s probably going to catch a lot of people off guard also quite a bit of existentialism in the movie that i wasn’t expecting pretty heavy stuff for a movie about a child’s toy ip 

my favorite moments had to be the lizzo pink song at the beginning moving into existential dread and the ken dance number just so much fun while packing a giant gut punch my wife was absolutely bawling through multiple moments

"im so disappointed with the movie it kept beating the same theme of patriarchy empowerment the blatant only women should be doing this ken hating etc etc the plot doesnt make a lot of sense and the story itself is not very cohesive 

the corporate men dis absolutely nothing in barbieland so apparently the only reason to include them was to show the stereotypical theme of only men are leaders in the real world

it was quite bad tbh it only had my attention bc i was thinking ok there must be a catch there is an explanation to all of this but it never came 

also i felt so bad for ken ryans ken and no the whole but hes just an accesory to barbie narrative is not why hes treated the way he is the only thing that saves the movie is the amazing costumes overall design and dance scenes",2023-07-24 20:15:38

"barbies weren’t actually manipulated kens started to dominate them like in earlier days men used to do to women they assigned them roles barbies knew exactly what was happening on the other hand kens were sometimes manipulated into fighting each other off only because all the beautiful girls were switching them with one another in actual sense they should be throwing party if they were so influenced by patriarchy 

in actual world men supported women h their voting rights because some of them were sympathetic to their situation so if all the barbies just talked to kens about their issues then all the unnecessary fighting and manipulation could’ve been cut off also there was absolutely no need for will ferrel’s character story would’ve functioned just the same barbie goes to real world finds the girl resolves her issues and so forth when barbie finally came to barbieland then why the  was will ferrel doing there you didn’t wanted her in real world then what more do you want to do in that world add more forceful comedy to an already boring movie for sure

and finally being a pro women only propaganda film just makes the film to be full of leftist ideologies either you make a propaganda film without diminishing any side or just make a fun one which both adults and kids can enjoy without any unnecessary  innuendos or personal propaganda",2023-07-26 08:15:06
over the years ken dolls have had a plethora of occupations just like barbie dolls  doctor fireman rockstar etc why does the movie pretend like ken was just a beach dude though i enjoyed the movie i feel like they just used barbie to tell a story about patriarchy and bit biased one at that,2023-07-26 23:16:59

"ken is a low iq misogynistic narcissist the movie is basically women are good and all men are bad women have to use their sexuality to make the men jealous and hate and fight each other so women can have all the power thats literally the ending of the movie

my review isnt great because i was pretty  whilst watching it but the stupidity of the movie did a 180 that made it enjoyable

not really the man who likes talking about feminism and all of it but the way it over dramatized all of it made me giggle a lot

i probably wouldnt have enjoyed it as much as if i went in it sober but i am also not the intended audience for it",2023-07-22 19:54:09
"this movie like so much of modern american media twin peaks stranger things fallout series bioshock series and so on falls deeply into the tired cliche of american gnosticism

the movie perpetuates the idealization of barbieland an idyllic and superficial world reminiscent of the 1950s representing the parable of white supremacy and reversed patriarchal norms this portrayal echoes the uncanny juxtaposition of an apparent utopia that conceals deeper complexities and societal issues while barbies escape to the real world seemingly suggests a confrontation with reality it ultimately reinforces the cliché of american gnosticism rather than subverting it

in this movie the real world becomes a mere foil to the perfection of barbieland reinforcing the notion that outside of the idealized fantasy lies a stark and oppressive reality 

to add to this barbies transformation from a onedimensional character in barbieland to an empowered advocate for change in the real world follows the predictable arc often seen in american gnostic narratives where the protagonist stumbles upon the rather obvious to the audience hiddensecret element of the so called utopic society that essentially tears down the facade this linear trajectory undermines the depth and complexity that could have been explored in her character development

the movies portrayal of the real world as an uncomplicated and monolithic representation of patriarchy and sexism oversimplifies the complex issues that exist in society it misses an opportunity to delve into the diverse struggles and experiences faced by individuals within patriarchal systems and reinforces a reductionist approach to societal critique

barbie movie is american gnosticism it becomes apparent that it adheres to the same tired clichés seen so much these days the idyllic portrayal of barbieland the escape to an equally onedimensional real world and the linear character transformation all contribute to the perpetuation of american gnostic themes rather than providing a truly nuanced critique of societal issues

did i enjoy the movie eh the barbie movie while attempting to explore themes of escaping from an idealized world to confront harsh realities ultimately falls into the clichéd portrayal of american gnosticism it misses the opportunity to challenge the tropes and offer a more complex and thoughtful examination of the realworld issues it seeks to address",2023-07-26 12:23:44
i walked out of the theater about 75 in i couldnt take it anymore i am shocked by the positive reviews and the 1b box office hit this movie is worse than terrible zero creativity and humor just shockingly bad wow,2023-08-07 03:50:06
this movie just oozes fun,2023-07-21 03:01:44
i just hated ken sm during the movie… i literally thought “men ruin everything”,2023-07-21 05:49:31
"i found the overall message of the movie to be poor for a movie that is supposed to make woman look good all it did was make woman look bad the fact that none of the women genuinely care about men and just look at them as power seekers is distressing all the men wanted were to care about the women and be in relationships and the women just viewed them as ego maniacs for control and the fact that that wasnt shown as a joke is the scariest part

the men are the people who want to connect with others and build relationships and the woman are really the ones who want to boost their egos and feel powerful which is what the women were claiming to fight against

i did like how it showed that the men just went  crazy because none of the women genuinely cared about them and at the end the message is everyone should just focus on themselves and not care about each other thats a  message",2023-08-12 08:03:09
so good my only complaint if you can even call it that was the americanisation of everyone  for a movie with themes of being yourself it was weird that so many british actors had to put on an accent barbie is a worldwide phenom you couldn’t let a couple of english accents in,2023-07-21 05:58:36

i think i’m the only one who would never watch this movie again wanted to leave so bad after the kens kept singing and it turned into a whole  musical also didn’t help that our amc movie theater hasn’t been updated in over 20 years and our seat neighbors were loud asf,2023-07-23 03:29:53
the target audience for this movie just should’ve been young girls i don’t know why they added those  metaphors like “beaching each other off” i mean seriously parents are taking their kids to a movie where kids have to listen to this kind of propaganda  that the writers chose to go with don’t get me wrong it’s good if you’re feminist and i’m all for equality among all genders but why do you seriously have to manipulate kids with your own personal ideologies and agendas which by the end of the film just showed that all men were just dumb and idiots who ended up following what barbie wanted them to do what a character arc just make a fun movie with that brand how hard is it without pushing moral agendas for  sake and it just saddens me to see this film doing well and the actors in it promoting it being proud of their contributions,2023-07-26 03:54:20
"this movie would have worked maybe 15 yrs ago this is not the gender dynamic anymore men are terrified to even talk to an unfamiliar woman on the street its so disingenuous

"even besides propaganda the movie is so dumb you could rip apart the whole movie easily you don’t have to be that smart to even figure out all the plot holes after every 510 minutes 

at one point when barbies start to switch kens their solution instead of thinking that barbies are manipulating them or being weird is to fight each other i mean you all have women switching with you being nice to you then why would you all be fighting each other  

so kens decide to fight each other but with two groups one led by gosling and another by liu 

 how did they even decide who wants to fight who what if the ones they want to fight are on the same group as them and the ones they have no problem with are on the other side but no just run at each other without thinking and all of this is happening while the dude is singing about feeling neglected by barbie  why would he sing about barbie or anybody while fighting another guy and then sparkles happens dancing happens and suddenly they’re united without any reason whatsoever what the  is going on here 

this movie is literal proof that people will like anything with their brains off as long as it’s an ip brand in shiny and dreamlike paradise and to think that some people are calling this the perfect litmus test for your boyfriend yeah if you don’t want a boyfriend who’s dumber than a bag of rocks

"barbie a movie for children it seems the answer is “yes”

let’s review the evidence

point 1 the barbie toys are intended mostly for girls between the ages of three and six analysis true

point 2 13yearolds are children hopefully nobody can disagree with this we can all agree that being rated pg13 does not mean it’s for adults teenagers are children conclusion true

point 3 teenagers have just as much nostalgia for barbie as adults the sales charts seem to suggest that barbie has been maintained as a successful brand over these past decades answer true

point 4 it is infantilizing to this country to take the barbie movie seriously and to be either for or against its supposed political agenda opinion true

closing thoughts

the barbie movie is not meant for 45yearold millennial stoners to be crowding the theater to see and you might be ruining the experience for the children who wanted to see it additionally if you were offended by its “woke” agenda or whatever you are the most pathetic person in the history of the universe the end",2023-08-01 20:13:04
horrible silly movie highlights how messed up our kids and society is today another i want to be a kardashian but not work for it barbie isn’t portrayed of doing really anything to support her lifestyle hmmm,2023-08-14 16:23:04
"is the snyder cut joke odd to anybody else considering that gerwig and baumbach are both “auteurs” who are also engaged in making a movie for warner brothers based on corporate ip i get that the joke is mostly aimed at the toxic fanboy thing but the “movement” was largely to honor a director’s singular vision in the face of corporate decision making 

i liked barbie i have no love for “snyder bros” just a thought that popped into my head and the joke feels a little mistuned",2023-08-03 22:01:15
"the thing about the barbie movie isnt that any one joke at mens expense is bad or that any one bad portrayal of men is terrible thats fine you know i’m sure that girlfriends have made lighthearted jokes about action movies or whatever  its not that  its that theres a joke about this thing that men like and another one then this thing that men like is also dumb  and theres this dumb male character then the next male character is a dumb villain and the next and every man in the  thing
so its the totality of every single man being dumb and every single male interest mocked that is the problem

i think greta gerwig really had a lot of bitterness about men and a complex about them and used this movie to puke it all over the screen 
you know if this was just about bitterness toward the way women are treated sometimes or patriachy  even if i didnt agree with the point she was making  ok thats fine  but its far more than that  its every single male character being made a joke often for no plot reason  its just bitterness against men on the whole as a gender
it was basically misandry the movie wrapped in a pink bow",2023-07-23 15:10:31
"the movie didn’t turn out like how i excepted it to be in better and in worse ways still have loads of thoughts about it

i thought there was some funny jokes but overall a let down",2023-07-22 11:31:15
barbie is basically the equivalent of a racist old cartoon but about men,2023-07-25 11:20:23
"first of all i am super excited about watching the barbie movie growing up the girls always got to play with really pretty and customizable barbie dolls while the boys at the kindergarten got well cars and guns  and im not a big fan of either i prefer swords and the subway  
  
anyway back to the actual topic my bestie has seen the film and spoilers she told me that the barbies live in a matriarchy i am super excited to see that tbh its not something that exists in our world and id like to see what thats like hopefully many men will see this and empathize more with women now the actual topic id like to discuss admittedly without having seen the movie and i will post again once i have is the topic of representation in barbie  
  
now ive taken a look at the cast and there are numerous barbies and kens to no ones surprise the main barbie and ken are white blonde and blueeyed which is fine since they were originally created as toys for white children of course from the 80s  onwards more diverse barbies and kens came into being in order to better represent the children all over the world who would be playing with them  
  
in the film we have margot robbie as main barbie white australian kate mckinnon as weird barbie  is a synonym for weird and mckinnon is a lesbian idk if thats intentional but i think its interesting issa rae as president barbie issa rae is africanamerican and black and obama was the first black president of the us and also africanamerican in a similar way african dad american mom alexandra shipp as writer barbie shipp is mixed black dad white yoga teacher mom which i guess is as white as white gets emma mackey as physicist barbie frenchbrit white also margot clone lol hari nef as dr barbie shes jewish sharon rooney as lawyer barbie scottish white im guessing shes plus size represenation ana cruz kayne as judge barbie kayne is filipino jewish hispanic and asian representation perhaps ritu arya as journalist barbie shes englishindian dua lipa as mermaid barbie white abanianenglish also popstar nicola coughlan as diplomat barbie white irish mette towleynarrative as video girl barbie towleynarrative is mixedrace marisa abela as teen talk barbie abela is malteselibyan brit libya is an arab country while the maltese language is derived from arabic so shes roughly arab representation and lucy boynton as proust barbie white englishamerican so among the barbies we can see a fair bit of representation although there is no obvious hispanic or asian representation there are a bunch of white barbies though and some of them couldve been asian or hispanic instead  
  
as for kens we have 8 of them of which 5 are white 1 is black 1 is mixed race and 1 is asian there is no indian ken and no arab ken frankly the representation for kens is appalling and it really frustrates me that once again while theres asian representation theres no indian representation the moment any romantic connotations are involved because after all kens are barbies romantic counterparts so once again we have many ethinicities of women and a bunch of white men two black men and a token asian guy only becuase he was portrayed as hot in that one tv show and that one mcu movie  
  
so for now it seems that while greta gerwig is a feminist she still is just another white woman  
  
im still excited for the movie and ill be back with my thoughts after watching the film too",2023-07-25 19:03:32

"this movie was a total  i felt like i just watched one of those zeitgeist movies from the 60s where they just assault you with endless streams of images until your brain just melts and you just leave the theater with a weird vibe instead of being told a story

i left questioning so much i wasnt alone actual comments and questions i heard as leaving the theater include

how did this get made 

what the actual  

who greenlit this 

will all barbies come with vaginas now

did she have to go to a gynecologist at the end she couldnt have gotten a job as head of mattel her first priority was her  

what was even the point of the husband

this was by far the most rampantly sexist movie i have ever seen

allen just straight up murdered a man

this movie is not for children this movie is for women who watched   the city when it originally aired and want a new drink with girlfriends movie i repeat this movie is not for your kids

so no one is gonna mention how the entire thing was basically manipulating men’s feelings how everyone wants equality yet somehow we are going backwards and celebrating manipulation and playing with emotions i rate the movie 0 stars up until that point where the ending where all the ken turned on each other that was royally f up lol this whole movie could have been fantastic and also the beach off with all ken made me so uncomfortable lol,2023-07-29 19:03:21
greta took men and women backwards  stereotypical barbiethe blondeis dumb and shallow and mean  weve heard that all before greta  what if barbie is blonde and smart and kind already she doesnt need a crisis to get there  shes already there greta  greta do you even like women or men or humanity in general  blonde barbie is a dumb shallow mean girl who cant get along with weird barbie  ridiculous  i suppose barbie can be whoever you want her to be but it makes you wonder how greta sees women in general  im surprised mattel put their name on this film at all  mattel is more or less saying that stereotypical barbie the barbie that started it all is inherently a you know what  shes dumb vapid treats ken bad just an all around bad character  also noted  no asian females in the movie  they should have made simu lui ryan and where was raquel who is also a really cool character,2023-07-22 16:49:42

"if you are a woman go watch this itll be great

if you are a guy dont go to the cinema wait for the digital release and watch it once

yikes nice set for barbie land and good humour for me personally with ryan gosling this movie felt antagonising if you are a guy to the point of no constructive place for women and men co existing it also reminded me of  monger in black panther but to be honest even that movie was less political than this was but did feel like it was also this therapeutic release of anger for women

it will be interesting to see how this movie is received both critically and financially the only reason i would recommend guys watching this at some point is to maybe understand how women are feeling and were the culture is at

it took a massive shot at stanley kubrick and thats the only thing that really got me a little bit  he was part of the patriarchy but was fundamental to the perfection and continuation of film that this message is on 2001 a space odyssey is still one of the best films to this day so disrespectful was there no other way to convey the message without disrespecting film like that

just my opinion i guess could be wrong",2023-07-21 22:42:57

i like a notorious rbg mug or tshirt  my wife has several  but i definitely dont need two hours of it onscreen  and i hasten to note that i have seen both the rbg documentary and the dramatized biopic on the basis of  and liked them quite well  but thats because they were not just endlessly serving up contextfree feminist bromides  they explored both rbg herself and the issues she fought for in a deeper and more nuanced way  even if they verged toward hagiography at times they generally featured rich characterization and much more thoughtfulness than what gerwig and baumbach have dumped onto the screen here  which is unfortunate as did really like their previous collaboration on frances ha

i dont care if the authorial philosophy is feminism or environmentalism apple tvs extrapolations or libertarian individualism v for vendetta  its not about the ideology itself and how much i might agree or disagree with it  when you use characters as mouthpieces to recite earnest bromides unmoored from the plot or any organic character development but very familiar to any educated person you have failed to create anything im going to be interested in  the delight others may get from that strikes me as little more than the leo dicaprio pointing meme hey look at that i am familiar with that philosophy and share its tenetsand now an onscreen character is reciting its precepts  awesomesauce",2023-08-02 09:20:18

i didn’t think of that lol my barbie actually had a horse i’m surprised they didn’t have a giant plastic horse for ken to ride,2023-07-22 17:27:53
yessss  this is such a good read i was thinking ken is giving horse girl energy but this makes soooo much sense hahahaha,2023-07-22 04:38:06
"so all that patriarchy stuff must have been those girls’ brothers taking over play time 

every time my brother walked in on me playing with my barbies and would pick them up and join in chaos would ensue",2023-07-23 04:02:57
i was wondering if some girls took offense to the horses being purely a symbol of toxic masculinity in this movie i think way more women are into horses than men when you look at the whole country although they are a big part of masculinity in some areas,2023-07-25 22:18:20
that was my read on why there was so much representation of different races and body types they were just reflections of the kidsparents playing with them,2023-07-23 01:03:19
tina belcher felt seen,2023-08-05 23:24:38
this makes the most sense ,2023-07-30 14:13:33
 thankyou for this comment this makes sense,2023-09-08 04:17:03
him popping in the back of the car made me so happy knowing he had a “semi” larger part,2023-07-22 07:40:36
i love the part when the rest of the construction workers back away in fear after watching allan choke one of them into unconsciousness with a shovel,2023-07-23 14:50:52
some may point out that correlation does not equal causation but i’ve loved every movie where i get to see michael cera kick someone’s ,2023-07-22 14:14:35
“once they figure out how to build that wall sideways instead of just up no one is getting out again”,2023-07-25 11:18:22
alan went full scott pilgrim,2023-07-23 03:33:21
in a packed theater i was the only one who laughed when i saw cera headbutt two construction workers   killed me,2023-07-23 13:23:32
“you want some more allan”,2023-07-24 05:55:19
all his clothes fit me,2023-07-29 21:59:51
gave me scott pilgrim flashbacks,2023-07-23 06:27:57
hes kens buddy all his clothes fit him,2023-07-27 23:23:13
scott pilgrim came back for a bit,2023-07-23 06:49:16
scott pilgrim was the best fighter in the province of ontario after all,2023-07-24 17:59:27
they made him the strongest man  i love it,2023-07-27 01:53:18
allan stands for ally,2023-07-24 02:53:09
he’s not useless he represents the small percentage of males who fully respect females ie the guys who have more female friends than male ones,2023-08-03 22:51:58
they never forgot his scott pilgrim roots,2023-07-26 02:58:12
but we never saw him train or anything he can just beat guys up now okay,2023-07-22 21:16:15
that scene seemed really out of place and unnecessary to me  what was the point of that  hah,2023-07-25 04:34:31
well except that they in no way needed to fight them especially since they immediately turned back,2023-07-31 06:26:35
i was like oh  allan has gone action figure,2023-08-09 10:19:52
for some reason that clip of the bbc pride and prejudice made me laugh harder than anything else in the movie,2023-07-23 00:53:16
"anxiety panic attacks and ocd sold separately

you can be anything",2023-07-22 08:56:07
and now her jaw is hurting literally while my jaw was hurting ,2023-07-23 04:05:15
the bbc pp reference had me legit gasping for air in my seat it personally put myself and a few friends of mine on blast in a way that was so personal it was incredible,2023-07-24 13:25:22
a couple of weeks ago i was depressed and went to walgreens 3 days in a row for a family sized bag of starburst i felt so specifically attacked,2023-07-24 04:12:45
i felt so attacked ,2023-07-23 17:27:23
my jaw dropped when i saw that commercial ,2023-07-23 05:11:30
my favorite part,2023-07-23 15:50:20
that barbie called me out and i don’t know how i feel about it,2023-07-24 04:49:36
i heard multiple women gasp including myself at the accuracy,2023-07-24 03:44:52
it was so funny and well made,2023-07-29 19:11:02
it reminded me of the gi joe commercials in a community episode,2023-09-14 00:28:44
,2023-08-23 05:02:09
thatms why barbie was invented,2023-07-21 19:14:50
i was giggling to myself the whole time they did 2001 monolith scene,2023-07-22 13:12:58
i read this nyt article over the history of barbie and it really dives deeper into that concept ,2023-07-22 23:50:18
yep i think at some stage every woman realises so many girl toys are based around motherhoodhousework its creepy i liked barbie but i remember being a kid and standing in the boys toy aisle and wishing there was an action woman doll as well as action man i wanted my dolls to scale buildings and go rock climbing,2023-07-23 04:07:39
kind of wish it hadn’t been used as the first trailer but it did give us exactly enough to know what the tone of the movie would be,2023-07-23 04:11:02
dolls houses had had grown women dolls in them for centuries and there were porcelain fashion dolls as well barbie was the first plastic mass produced doll to take off but it’s not really what they’re trying to claim,2023-07-24 04:21:58
as someone who as an adult does not want children i loved this wild to think how indoctrinated being a mom was to us when we were growing up never thought i had a choice until i became an adult,2023-07-31 01:38:28
trixie mattel does a really good history of barbie on youtube,2023-07-24 10:50:23
that whole opening scene being a spoof of the opening of 2001 a space odyssey killed me,2023-07-24 05:58:25
"thats technically not true dolls werent mass produced really until the 1950s when barbie came out you can thank cheap plastic

you had adult dolls before this porcelain dolls in particular were popular but they were expensive 

barbie was the first mass produced doll that was an adult the main word being mass produced",2023-07-22 02:13:17
it’s not true barbie was just the first popular mainstream plastic doll to be sold in department stores adult female dolls had long been a feature of doll houses and sold in porcelain with fancy clothes for centuries course most people couldn’t afford the good ones unlike barbie,2023-07-23 14:48:15
"its historical in all the ways from the point when barbie was invented in 1959 and that scene parodying odysseys ape and monolith scene

outstanding",2023-07-26 03:00:27
i was so sad watching those girls destroy their dolls i liked all dolls i had baby’s polly pockets like one barbie and pokémon figurines i gasped at the movie like  i can like both don’t destroy them,2023-07-27 08:07:00
all while paying homage to 2001,2023-07-26 15:21:12
"

here ya go ken",2023-07-22 02:09:22
it wasn’t a half battle it was a gdamn beach off,2023-07-21 12:55:26
 same i told my wife i wanted that sweatshirt,2023-07-21 16:33:16
the part when ken whisks barbie off her feet only to swing her back up and slap the  outta himself was incredible ,2023-07-21 19:04:16
unabashedly dripping with the capitalist themes it was also critiquing,2023-07-22 03:46:34
mattel are currently taking preorders for the “i am kenough” hoodie 60 us,2023-07-22 03:52:55
i’m just ken is the dark horse for best song while “peaches” is still the clear cut favorite   ryan performs it live,2023-07-22 13:57:29
that throwaway i got shot  are there real weapons in here got me,2023-07-26 02:36:49
"just looked into it after reading this and mattel actually sells it





but it is sold out in literally every size right now quite impressive as it just came out a few days ago


edit they keep restocking these periodically i was able to place an order about an hour ago",2023-07-22 21:10:37
i have cried in movies before but this was the first time that i’ve cried with laughter in a movie and it was that scene absolutely phenomenal,2023-07-22 09:03:07
what even was the dance video reference i was laughing my  off through the entire sequence,2023-07-22 15:16:13
it wouldn’t have made sense but it would have been funny to see john travolta pop up during the beach off dream sequence,2023-07-22 13:31:14
i always joke with my wife that if it werent for women pressuring us to succeed or demanding things of us men would all just get along and have no ambitions whatsoever and there would be no wars  so it was funny to see how the women manipulated the kens into all out war only for them to eventually forget why they were fighting and fall into an accidental dance number,2023-07-23 01:33:12
that number gave me major cyd charisse cameo in singing in the rain vibes,2023-07-23 13:03:03
it was so funny ,2023-07-22 02:43:39
the most hilarious beach landing scene ever filmed the ramp comes down and kens are being mowed down by frisbees and suctioncup arrows,2023-08-09 08:59:53
there were so many things happening in the background with the ken extras that me and my girl kept pointing out and laughing,2023-07-24 16:07:45
"if you haven’t preordered one yet they’re back in stock

",2023-07-23 02:41:59
that scene was by far the best part of the movie for me,2023-07-24 00:39:09
" if i had that i am kenough hoodie i’d never wear anything else

mattel made it a real thing its on their website but it looks short and boxy like a crop top",2023-07-27 03:41:30
seriously the second it’s on sale if ever i’m buying 100,2023-07-22 08:49:22
the hoodie exists it’s sold out but it exists,2023-07-23 02:05:18
that hoodie needs to be available to buy,2023-07-22 17:22:40
it’s sold out but you can preorder for the next round,2023-07-23 00:48:46
you can buy it,2023-07-23 04:12:00
i ordered the sweater as soon as i left the theatre no shame,2023-07-23 06:45:59
that hoodie will be a thing in about a week,2023-07-23 20:37:07
what size should i go for im men’s medium normally would it be the same unisex,2023-08-09 03:18:52
obviously didn’t see the hangover or team america in the cinema,2023-07-30 20:08:53
young ryan gosling’s spirit took over for ryan’s performance for ken especially during the big music number with all the kens dancing,2023-07-21 12:19:40
he is more than kenough,2023-07-21 23:18:25
he’s kenough and i really hope they sell that tie dye hoodie he was wearing because i’ll buy it immediately,2023-07-22 08:46:19
theres not a single actor that could pull off that character  the whole movie is great but is doesnt work without goslings comedic skills,2023-07-24 14:35:30
did you also watch this in an alamo drafthouse ,2023-07-22 06:57:02
hes talking hes got that super cool faux fur long jacket and in the middle of his talking he randomly does a few pull ups that was so ken and he owned the role,2023-07-25 17:23:02
i would say that clip is a big reason he won the role perfect nostalgia for millennial audiences,2023-07-23 04:06:03
at alamo before the movie started there was a montage of baby gosling dancing,2023-07-30 04:04:35
im kenough,2023-07-27 20:22:39
brewski beer and a horse for you sir,2023-07-22 00:10:28
my major take away from the movie is wearing a full length mink coat is hella dope,2023-07-21 23:53:27
the one guy on the drums grade a,2023-07-21 20:57:29
as a dude who has played a guitar for a girl while looking in her eyes i indeed felt personally attacked in the most hilarious of ways,2023-07-21 21:10:21
i know several men who will feel personally attacked by that scene,2023-07-22 15:03:23
i was expecting wonderwall,2023-07-23 06:16:55
the funniest possible song choice matchbox 20 is such a good ken band,2023-07-23 04:57:42
rob thomas didn’t deserve that but i guess that was part of the joke,2023-07-22 08:01:33
on the way out of the theater i heard someone joking to a friend about the rob thomas erasure “did you write that” “yes” too good,2023-07-22 20:56:38
i was losing my  at this part ive had the exact experience of having a guy try to romantically play the guitar at me  too good,2023-07-23 02:15:40
my wife loves matchbox 20 and rob thomas and she was crying during that scene as we left the movie a matchbox 20 cover band was playing at the park next to theater and we were giggling like little kids,2023-07-22 13:34:34
plus ryan just commits to that late 90s overpronunciation to the point of gibberish and it works so well the way he says i wanna take you for granannn,2023-07-31 22:02:40
that part especially murdered me as i was talking to my wife just a few days ago about how much i cant stand rob thomas but that is all my motherinlaw listens to,2023-07-22 21:07:27
i genuinely like this song and felt so roasted,2023-07-24 06:35:38
also the fact that they’re obsessed with a song by matchbox 20 tickles me and probably no one else,2023-07-23 05:47:50
they could not have picked a better song lol,2023-07-27 16:54:42
i had traumatic flashbacks of college and how the dorm common area always had that guitar guy who thought he was so deep,2023-07-26 00:32:12
the choice of matchbox twenty  chefs kiss  perfect,2023-07-26 16:31:59
reading online that people were discovering that song as a cover song made me feel oooold,2023-07-27 22:56:13
"im not the most self aware guy but that scene made me feel a bit better about myself since ive always looked at things like that and been like wouldnt that be super awkward for both people involved

yes yes it would my normal person behavior detector was going off properly for once",2023-08-01 00:28:30
i was dying watching that scene i loved it lol,2023-07-26 16:08:56
i haven’t laughed that hard in a long time ,2023-08-01 07:06:55
"i loved that song in high school it’s what nudged me to stop listening to country and eventually expand my tastes to other rock genres 

i am a woman however who has had a man play that on the guitar for her flip side being that he let me sing it

all of that to say this scene killed me on so many levels crying with laughter",2023-08-06 02:59:03
"the official music video on youtube from 13 years ago all the top comments are in the last 30 days lol

",2023-08-13 23:53:11
i thought they were going to do wonder wall,2023-08-01 22:11:44
i saw this but it didn’t dawn on me until now that’s gold lol,2023-07-29 03:03:25
 this movie balanced everything so well it was smart subversive humor like that just worked in so many ways and complimented the bubblegum and corny perfectly the helen mirren voiceover about not hiring margot robbie got me,2023-07-22 02:05:04
panic attacks can be bought separately ,2023-07-21 21:39:53
same and i knew someone who fits that depressed barbie cause they also watched and read pride and prejudice more than 7 times,2023-07-22 04:47:58
i literally have to see it again because the entire theater including myself was laughing so hard that i couldn’t hear anything not that i wasn’t planning on seeing it again anyways,2023-07-22 04:35:05
screaming also the pride and prejudice hahaha,2023-07-22 06:05:36
i got a little sad cuz i realized i been depression barbie for a while  i also felt like the only person in the theatre literally cackling at it bc of how relatable it was hahah,2023-07-24 09:15:48
the only thing better would have been tim robinson presenting it,2023-07-22 20:43:00
my theater was having a blast too it was so spot on the people in the theater were so busy laughing that when the jumpscare of weird barbie was the next scene after we screamed so loud i have never screamed that loud even for a horror movie and then started laughing crying again,2023-07-23 02:04:03
it reminded me of the opening of m3gan lol,2023-07-23 07:27:21
everything was so accurate except i’m more of a pride and prejudice 2005 kind of girl,2023-07-27 02:12:36
as someone whose partner fully watches pride  prejudice when they’re feeling sad i felt this,2023-07-24 01:01:02
hit way too close to home,2023-07-24 20:39:02
same here,2023-07-25 22:52:34
hardest laugh from the cinema it was so good,2023-07-29 19:03:14
funniest fake ad in a movie since m3gan,2023-08-08 03:31:05
she lived kens life for 5min and got depressed,2023-08-12 22:14:39
i did barbie first just because of the way the times were at the cinema i went to but i would definitely recommend it the other way around,2023-07-21 21:47:10
saw oppenheimer before barbie and happy i did oppenheimer is a brutal gut punch that leaves you feeling emotionally drained barbie helped give some hope and i left it feeling much better oppenhiemer was an incredible film and barbie was the perfect pink chaser and phenomenally done,2023-07-24 04:14:44
fr that speech at the end i dont need to know im gonna die thank you very much,2023-07-24 14:52:47
i saw both movies on different days but i think oppenheimer first is the way to go… that movie is just so long and fairly slow i would have lost my mind sitting through it after having already seen another movie ahead of it,2023-07-25 04:57:02
definitely see oppenheimer first barbie is the perfect dessert,2023-07-23 04:19:57
"ill go against the grain and say barbie then oppenheimer my experience was happenstance because of the qualitytimes of the movies but i loved barbie and am glad i didnt risk the chance to taint that with 3 hours of anxiety beforehand 

barbie builds up into these thought provoking questions its targeted towards a mixed audience even though i came out of barbie with a lot of questions oppenheimer really had my brain worked up id rather end with that so i can more easily separate the two features

oppenheimer wasnt a steak before angel food cake and strawberries it was more like a 3 hour heated debate on morals with your love affair before angel food cake and strawberries",2023-07-30 07:07:17
im having a hard time watching other movies since seeing barbie its like ive pinkpilled,2023-08-07 05:13:52
all kidding aside as someone with pretty serious death anxiety barbie really struck a chord,2023-07-24 11:58:38
its existential crisis all the way down,2023-07-25 00:38:46
oops i saw it first honestly though having all the weight of oppenheimer on my mind watching barbie mightve depended the great mood it has throughout even with the overall poignant message,2023-07-29 19:32:33
i did the barbenheimer double header a week late and i left with such a feeling of dread over the state of humanity and society i did see oppenheimer last but still,2023-07-31 04:56:36
"

knockoffs all over amazon too",2023-07-21 23:22:08
i did t expect to start crying all of the sudden but that’s what happened,2023-07-28 10:21:21
and the producers wanted to cut this scene but greta fought for it,2023-08-19 02:33:51
"i know i am   


paraphrased because i forgot the line",2023-08-05 23:24:14
wasn’t that the creator of barbie’s daughter barbara,2023-09-16 04:58:07
i loved that,2023-12-29 04:04:49
you can see barbie get less and less glam as things get worse by this point in the movie her hair has lost its curl she seems a little less made up but of course she still looks great because its margot robbie i genuinely wonder if this fourth wall break was unplanned and was added when they realized margot still looked totally beautiful and the line had less impact than intended lol,2023-07-22 06:08:30
i second this epic 4th wall break here,2023-07-21 14:19:43
it was a wonderful piece of filmmaking because you know everyone in the audience was thinking it it took it from a moment that pulls you out of the movie into one that pulls you in,2023-07-22 18:48:24
“i don’t look like stereotypical barbie” or something like that ,2023-07-21 12:35:52
the theatre i was in burst out laughing at that part,2023-07-23 01:33:19
one of the best 4th wall breaks of all time,2023-07-21 19:02:44
i was thinking wow she looks so gorgeous even when frying and that’s when the fourth wall broke i lost my mind ,2023-07-22 04:12:19
that was the single best beat of satire in the movie and i mean it ,2023-07-21 11:42:14
line of the movie,2023-07-23 03:15:42
that was definitely the one scene where everyone including me and my group broke out laughing for several seconds straight,2023-07-23 07:13:02
our entire theater broke out in laughter at this unexpected voice over,2023-07-25 17:25:25
haha that was signature baumbach writing move,2023-07-21 12:21:13
that was so funny ,2023-07-25 22:11:38
that was one of my favourite lines,2023-07-25 13:06:36
wasnt amy schumer originally cast in the role that explains a lot,2023-07-23 18:03:14
"no it was when gloria assured barbie she was beautiful and perfect the narrator implied that margot was not the best casting to exemplify the epitome of beauty

which i thought  she really let herself be roasted for a pretty funny joke",2023-07-22 07:02:30
i think that was my favorite joke though there were so many good ones,2023-08-13 04:23:37
that was a genius touch,2023-08-28 04:23:48
that was amazing ,2023-10-01 20:35:26
"in a similar vein the godfather cameo was really funny too i especially loved that the ken said the exact same words about robert evans and the aesthetic sensibilities of coppola as greta gerwig did when she was interviewed by letterboxd about which movies influenced barbie

",2023-07-21 17:23:01
i literally just watched price and prejudice the other night i am depression and anxiety barbie,2023-07-22 02:57:37
i literally pointed at the screen and was howling at that part felt personally called out,2023-07-21 18:30:38
my cousins grandma and aunt had dinner last night and had the “who would you most want to be having dinner with us right now” talk and my aunt immediately was like “collin firth but it has to be collin firth in pride and prejudice” my cousins and i saw the movie tonight and when this part came on we looked at each other and straight up  died,2023-07-22 04:36:49
loudest laugh in my theater,2023-07-21 21:28:59
i had literally done this about 3 weeks ago so i felt very understood,2023-07-21 22:04:34
okay but i maintain that it is a masterpiece,2023-07-23 01:33:02
they came for people with that clip,2023-07-24 07:39:17
"one rainy weekend when my wife was feeling down i watched the entire bbc pride and prejudice with her

we saw barbie in theaters together when that bit came on we exploded with disbelief and laughter",2023-07-23 17:44:50
me and one other woman in the theater screamed seemingly involuntarily can only speak for myself at that part i wish i had met her on the way out,2023-07-23 06:31:20
lmaoo,2023-07-22 03:39:21
 same,2023-07-22 08:49:47
i felt kind of personally attacked there hahaha,2023-07-23 18:48:07
my wife about fell out of her seat laughing in that moment the depression barbie montage was real,2023-08-07 22:18:43
i have jaw pain and am obsessed with the bbc 1995 pride and prejudice i feel so called out,2023-12-21 22:04:22
this is the most valid criticism of the whole movie,2023-07-22 01:39:19
lol a crouch kick with no reaction would have been funny,2023-07-23 14:46:51
 that’s the first plot hole i’ve heard lol,2023-07-24 04:55:35
i had the exact same thought,2023-07-22 04:49:31
i also dont get how can barbie cry when theres no water in her universe,2023-07-25 18:19:23
btw were those ryans real muscles or did he do a plastic torso thing like ricardo montalbán in star trek 2,2023-08-28 04:26:09
shut up and take my upvote ,2023-07-31 10:48:15
"i liked how they showed the mixed reaction where some people thought they looked  and some were like “that’s a vibe”

it was realistic because if i saw people out dressed like that i’d be admiring them",2023-07-21 15:51:55
most unrealistic part of the movie no one would blink an eye in venice beach at how they were dressed would be far from the wildest looking people in venice,2023-07-23 09:20:16
i feel admired but not oggled and theres no undercurrent of violence at all,2023-07-26 09:42:22
the judgment on venice beach was the only thing that i bonked on no one would bat an eye at that look there and if they did it would be compliments only,2023-07-23 01:39:15
i had that rollerblade barbie and when i saw the promo pics of them in those outfits like a year ago i knew i’d have to see the film,2023-07-23 05:02:57
really i thought this joke was super flat like not offensive or anything just like  like fashion stereotype joke is just boring and unoriginal now,2023-08-07 06:29:06
when i say i screamed,2023-07-22 05:21:21
lmfaoooooo,2023-07-23 18:09:45
i feel like in real life nowadays in la they wouldn’t even stand out from the crowd with that outfit,2023-09-05 21:04:44
"its so great too because the rugged cowboy had long represented the ideal masculine man ex john wayne 

dude didnt want to subjugate women tho he just wanted horses",2023-07-22 14:00:48
i loved that line reminds me of what someone said on the documentary about barbie it was along the lines of having to put feminism and the selfesteem of girls on the tiny plastic shoulders of a doll is quite a burden greta and margot really got me empathizing with a doll lol ,2023-07-21 05:00:54
loved his faux minx lining with horses,2023-07-21 08:58:05
almost like mattel was trying to make barbie and thus themselves the victim,2023-07-21 11:43:38
" dojo casa 

excuse you that is ken’s mojo dojo casa house",2023-07-21 05:24:19
ken repeating things unnecessarily because he doesn’t really understand them killed me the foosball tables the mojo dojo casa house the  double sunglasses so good,2023-07-22 13:01:53
you have to say the full name mojo dojo casa house feels good doesn’,2023-07-21 05:40:52
i loved looking for all the superfluous ken stuff like the three watches didn’t catch the extra foosball table,2023-07-21 22:42:43
it was full of tiny hilarious things like that,2023-07-21 03:33:26
another detail i loved was that all the mojo dojo casa houses had tvs mounted way too high up,2023-07-23 04:57:44
for me it was the massive tower of guitar amps,2023-07-29 18:27:22
they did an excellent job of making the dojo casa look like something a rich redpill youtuber would live in,2023-07-26 13:25:44
i know exactly what you’re talking about it but i didn’t recognize it when i saw it but now it makes perfect sense ,2023-07-21 04:07:24
"i was 100 expecting ken to shout something but didn’t expect it to be sublime lol


probably gonna use it from now on since my wife and i both had a blast watching this


ryan gosling everyone involved really absolutely knocked it out of the park",2023-07-21 03:37:27
"don’t know why but this line totally got me my friend and i hollered in the cinema if it’s  in a very specific way that’s my sense of humour exactly

i’ve been in a gosling mood for a while before barbie and this reinfected me",2023-07-21 08:05:52
"this triggered something super specific in my sense of humor easily the funniest part of the movie for me and some of the hardest i’ve ever laughed out loud for anything no joke

it was so unexpected and specific",2023-07-22 04:20:46
"absolutely the best ryan goslingken moment such a beautifully random and hilarious line that caught me off guard and like other commenters are saying is the type of comedy i love too i also always forget gosling has comedic chops

will ferrell telling the one guy not to hug him at the end his delivery always kills me

margot robbie was not surprising so fantastic and such a great actress and hilarious too  stoked to see her as tank girl 

i dunno oscar noms for robbie and gosling i would not be surprised 

overall a……sublime……flick and will definitely nab the pinkbluray",2023-07-23 05:46:27
this made me cry laughing,2023-07-21 19:44:32
i laughed so  hard at that and i was the only one in the theater laughing which just made me laugh even harder until i was just sobbing and choking in the theater,2023-07-21 15:15:55
this was the hardest i laughed the whole time i was expecting him to scream or something but i was not expecting him to yell sublime in a broken matt hardy voice,2023-07-25 02:12:23
what part was this,2023-07-21 19:23:30
sublime,2023-07-24 04:17:27
probably my favourite one liner in the film ryan gosling was amazing but the whole cast was as well,2023-07-23 22:46:15
that got the biggest overall laugh for the showing i just got out of that line killed it was so unexpected and bizarre,2023-07-25 04:24:20
this killed me best joke of the movie,2023-07-23 03:36:54
i didnt get this joke  was it a callback to something earlier in the movie or something,2023-07-22 16:43:31
the cry of a man who’s wanted something for so long and has finally gotten it,2023-07-30 06:56:00
this is absolutely entering the lexicon of my best friend and is everyday conversation,2023-07-22 22:18:27
poor ken was friendzoned the entire time ,2023-07-22 17:25:21
i’m 100 going to walk around using this,2023-07-25 19:42:28
i was laughing at all the same stuff as the person next to me and we were dying at this scene we became buds by the end and were talking about it and how each others laughter made it even better  i havent experienced that much collective joy in a movie in a long time it was awesome,2023-08-02 07:41:48
i was cackling at part,2023-08-02 15:20:12
my husband and i lost it at the scene where ken takes off barbies glasses and realizes she’s beautiful i have shotforshot had a man do that to me and it was every bit as cringey as you think lol,2023-07-22 16:00:05
the pronunciation of the godfather joke killed ne,2023-07-21 06:34:12
ive been with my girlfriend for seven years now and i still felt that,2023-07-21 15:09:58
eh i don’t think mattel really cares so long as the movie makes tons of cash and the public buys all of the barbiemoviedolls at 50 apiece along with all the merchandise see above thread with the ken stuff already sold out ,2023-07-21 19:15:41
being anticaptitalist is unironically a capitalist ploy its how you get sweet sweet money from people who think youre so cynically self aware,2023-07-21 20:31:31
how completely unrealistic they made the real world  mattel was probably helped  having will ferrell break out the box  while holding drum sticks probably does not impact how people feel about the real company,2023-07-23 04:16:08
"“that’s a terrible idea”

“it will make a lot of money”

“i love it”",2023-07-23 21:00:07
portraying themselves as lovable buffoons is almost more sinister propaganda than simply being faceless and evil,2023-07-25 19:35:24
that’s how they get you capitalist billionaires selling anticapitalist sentiment,2023-07-23 08:32:19
"mattel has been having a problem with barbie becoming a negative feminist symbol so this was their way of laundering barbie for a new generation the critiques were all very consumer friendly barbie still comes out as the hero 

mattel won huge with this movie",2023-07-25 03:37:10
honestly though i think this movie is going to cause a massive shift in public opinion of barbie in a good way it was such a beautifully feminist message without being preachy at all,2023-07-22 05:08:44
mattel hq looking like the empire from andor was pretty funny screamed corporate misery,2023-07-24 01:39:46
i feel like it gives their brand some newfound relevance though if the movie had just been some kind of generic biopicbased on a true story like blackberry or air i doubt it would have had this amount of impact,2023-07-24 13:43:47
"i wouldn’t give them too much credit they knew the score at the end of the day

“capital has the ability to subsume all critiques into itself even those who would critique capital end up reinforcing it instead”",2023-07-24 16:30:12
seemed like a compromise to call mattel out in business practices but humanize ruth as a mother her daughter appeared as the older woman on the bus bench so she approved it and give her props for creating something that lived on as a woman have a bit of a theory it was added in later will ferrell’s character said “she keeps an office on the third floor” or whatever as a throwaway line but then she actually had a whole little house in there with a kitchen table and pretty sure rhea pearlman didn’t interact with anyone but margot robbie,2023-07-21 20:55:38
they explicitly said the movie wasnt a vehicle to sell a new line of barbies but rather tell barbies story and where it fits within the bigger conversation of gender roles in america good or bad which i thought was admirable,2023-07-26 13:27:45
yeah it’s tricky because part of me wants to be like “ capitalism they’ve calculated that the immense profit they will make out weights the minor jabs at them in the movie” but then i’m also like “ i need to buy a barbie”,2023-07-26 02:00:32
i don’t think they really care seeing as they’ve a good chance of being the biggest film of the year as well as selling millions of merchandise,2023-07-23 13:33:17
eh if it makes them money and serves as a good ad for barbie toys then i dont think they care,2023-07-24 04:03:26
did you see the money its making no wonder,2023-07-29 19:39:01
"it did

it erased the entire creation of the barbie doll which was to be a doll for men to perv on",2023-07-25 01:59:43
from what i understand creatively mattel wasn’t involved other than licensing the character out,2023-07-22 12:10:46
"ncuti and emma being eachothers barbie and ken was all i needed ncuti saying “i miss my barbieeeee” only for her to pop up with a “i’m right here” was the cutest scene 




connor swindells was hilarious too even outside of his lines he’s always doing something in the background",2023-07-22 19:41:15
i noticed a couple fleabag cameos too  the 2nd mattel guy who gets shot with the arrow but also the fbi guy who rings mattel is the hot lawyer,2023-07-21 23:22:22
it was a very weird feeling seeing adam talk so much for once ,2023-07-22 19:19:50
it took me so long to place maeve got adam and eric right away and thought the same thing lol,2023-07-21 16:50:13
when i saw at the beginning credits that emma mackey is in i totally expected some kind of swapjoke with margot robbie,2023-07-21 22:21:01
emma mackey looks like margot robbie and i’m guessing ryan gosling wanted ncuti gatwa to be in it,2023-07-21 21:41:34
i clocked this too and it was the first thing i texted my friend upon leaving the theater  about to throw the series on for a rewatch and prep for the final season after that haha,2023-07-22 01:32:11
rob brydon was suger daddy ken lol,2023-07-23 21:20:17
the barbieland parts were all filmed in england so it could just come down to the fact that theyre all there already,2023-07-25 21:09:04
my guess is that one of the producers is a fan maybe greta is i definitely think that ariana greenblatt getting cast has something to do with her 65 costar adam driver being gretas friend,2023-07-22 03:26:59
i noticed that too and that is exactly the reason i’m here,2023-07-24 03:54:38
same with lila from umbrella academy for me had me doing the leo pointing meme in the movie theater ,2023-07-25 02:53:01
my head cannon is that greta gerwig binge watched  ed while they were casting and she loved the show so she decided to cast them in the movie lol,2023-08-10 13:51:36
maybe this is all a really weird dream of otiss,2023-08-19 06:48:50
i thought i was the only one that noticed i literally love that show and i’ve always thought emma and margot look alike so seeing them in a movie together was uncanny lol also they all had rlly good american accents haha patiently waiting for the next season to come out ,2023-07-23 06:54:29
that what i was wondering i mean they were all great it was just a bit confusing,2023-08-19 06:46:29
"mine personally was when one of the kens said i’m thinking of a bird and other kens guess different birds and he says

“no it’s a peliken”",2023-07-24 07:22:13
the whole movie was like americanstyle columbian magical realism the only other movie i call recall that leaned in so hard into  magical realism was sorry to bother you,2023-07-24 01:41:43
"the underrated line the last line of the movie im here to see my gynecologist

x200b

earlier to catcall construction workers and i would just like to inform you i do not have a vaginawe dont have genitals  
narrator so she left behind the pastels and plastics of barbie land for the pastels and plastics of los angeles  
reassuring by others before going into doctors office youve got this im really proud of you

x200b

conclusion shes going to get that  installed",2023-09-04 15:54:15
my theater in a jewish area burst out laughing so hard at that,2023-07-21 14:47:23
kate mckinnons face when ferrell asked to be called mother got the loudest laugh from me i think,2023-07-28 21:10:37
maybe i’m just   i am but can someone explain the jewish friend part i can’t tell if it’s something to do with women considering the moment the joke is made or if he’s just saying “we are inclusive”,2023-07-22 09:07:17
i loved that when barbie showed up he was just watching horses on tv,2023-07-21 02:54:22
"there is something about the way gosling delivers this line with such conviction that it absolutely takes me out

i also think any other setting where the word patriarchy is thrown around so often would be cringeworthy but gerwig incorporates this into her characters excellently—ken is exactly the type of shallow himbo to throw around a word like patriarchy without knowing what the heck it actually means",2023-07-21 05:19:49
i wished patriarchy is about horse in real life,2023-07-21 02:52:56
as a dude same the idea of a patriarchy is pretty boring when horses are barely involved takes me back to when my dad first wanted to get me into cars as a little boy and i had to tell him i was into a different kind of mustang,2023-07-21 09:37:08
that was the best line had the giggles for ages after that,2023-07-21 09:37:16
this was the biggest flaw in the movie that the kens needed patriarchy to have horses there should have already been lots of horses in barbie land,2023-07-26 16:13:40
super late but i live in an area where old rich white dudes come to play cowboy this line spoke to me,2023-11-23 10:47:14
i didn’t understand the horses and the relation to the patriarchy,2023-07-24 03:17:33
my favorite character in this movie was ryan goslings torso,2023-07-22 21:19:40
he was so insecure while being so hot,2023-07-21 15:59:14
my man didnt drink water for a month for this movie lol  which in a hilarious twist of irony about how difficult it is for dudes to look stereotypical hot,2023-07-24 15:39:52
its already sold out ,2023-07-21 19:15:46
of course it did theyd be  not to capitalize on that,2023-07-22 03:05:47
with some shades of the lego movie in there too,2023-07-23 02:27:49
it gave me a the good place vibe too,2023-07-24 14:11:04
,2023-07-22 03:48:28
great comparison,2023-07-22 04:52:45
my headcanon is that the daughter is the girl from you story 2 who threw jessie away cuz the whole movie reminded me of that scene lol,2023-07-23 21:22:24
"that’s incredibly apt

this feels very speed racer influenced as well i feel",2023-07-24 06:48:46
i found it to be more like elf though i think elf was done better,2023-07-25 04:44:50
i watched alone on the way to the cinema i felt silly and self conscious that i wore pink was really happy to see many in the theater wearing the same,2023-07-21 10:40:34
the theater i went to decorated the entire lobby in pink balloons and covered the bar in pink table covers and seemingly everyone and their mom came to see the movie in pink shirts and dresses i didnt expect that at all i honestly cant remember the last time theaters and the audience went all out for a movie maybe deathly hallows part 2 but its easily been a decade or more since ive experienced something like this the overall atmosphere reminded me of gamestop when they still did midnight launches  a bit cheesy but also pretty fun,2023-07-21 05:16:54
it’s the first movie since infinity war that i’ve been in where the audience applauded at the end loved it,2023-07-21 12:51:42
yes it was really just so fun seeing everyone have fun everyone’s energy was just so infectious,2023-07-21 18:51:29
my exact experience,2023-07-21 04:21:35
yeah this was maybe the most fun theater experience ive had since they rereleased the original star wars trilogy in 2000ish,2023-07-22 02:08:06
i went last night and i’d say about 80 of people were dressed up with most wearing pink but there were tons of people dressed up as exercise barbie cowboy barbie and a lot of kens it was so fun the staff were also all dressed up  the theatre was decorated and there was a signature barbie drink,2023-07-22 17:36:34
i’m so stoked we all had the same experience it was honestly so magical,2023-07-22 05:02:39
i kept saying to my fiancé as we both rocked pink outfits that there’s something magical to this movie going experience seeing so many people dressed in pinks bringing old barbie’s to the theaters so many smiles and so much excitement i’ve never been to a movie where people pseudocosplayed the lead like you see on tv  just so special,2023-07-23 10:37:35
i always see movies at odd times too and was excited to see this with a full theater heard maybe three chuckles the whole movie while i was laughing the whole time ,2023-07-21 06:46:14
it’s reasons like this that make me write off anyone that says they hate the theatre experience it can be one of the best parts of movie watching,2023-07-23 00:37:27
yes my entire threater was booked out in pink even the guys such a memorable experience,2023-07-23 01:01:08
right my row especially was apparently ultrainvested and onboard with the whole thing at least two  is literally mes were said,2023-07-22 08:21:59
saw some ladies like that and was like you going to see oppenheimer lol im just silly like that,2023-07-21 12:44:24
oh it was so nice seeing just the range of people’s interpretations of barbie summer saw everything from full on cottage core barbie to coachella barbie to just like a mean girls pink polo shirt moment barbie,2023-07-23 19:40:07
same,2023-07-21 15:14:31
the theatre i went to had a human sized doll box it was sublime,2023-07-22 18:42:00
this is why we are fighting for theaters these experiences like this are unmatched its an absolute blast especially with friends,2023-07-24 06:40:49
oh man i am the same as you but i got the bad side of it had the person next to me literally take a call and be like i cant talk right now im in a movie i had a mom and son in front of me the son was 6 and he didnt get the movie and just kind of cheered for the guys at the end had a family with a little girl behind me and the girl kept saying she needed to  family shushed her a dozen times throughout the movie a group of cackling girls on my back right that clapped and cheered in the middle of the movie and would yell  like yes girl yes and  shes just like you to her friendetc anyway still loved it,2023-07-24 03:03:59
saw on a monday at noon and it was pretty full the movie is a phenomenon,2023-07-25 09:30:49
i went today tuesday 2 pm at an unpopular theater it was packed the lobby was packed every seat in the theater was full and everyone was dressed up i still can’t believe this,2023-07-26 04:59:26
saw it on tuesday at 3pm it was still kinda packed,2023-07-25 23:21:31
i loved the excitement for this movie and all the link but i was in a different theater  it was packed but not a lot of good crowd reactions as i had hoped,2023-07-25 04:37:58
glad you had a better experience than me i went at 1015 pm showing where it was nothing but teenagers they were laughing before the title card for barbie even appeared then at the end when the credits started rolling and that nicki minaj song started playing several of them began to get up and twerk loved the movie my experience watching not so much,2023-07-27 02:10:48
unfortunately the theater i went to had a group of immature teenagers who would not stop taking through the movie  i tried to tune them out but towards the end they got louder and more obnoxious someone even yelled out loud “” and they kind of ruined the experience it’s like just stay home if you’re that annoying…,2023-07-27 19:18:54
just came back from a packed 130 showing had a blast,2023-08-01 21:54:47
here from almost three weeks in the future packed theater on a wednesday afternoon,2023-08-10 04:13:12
"there honestly was not a lot of laughing out loud in the relatively full theater where i saw this  i really dont care about the wokenot woke political talk around the movie but to me a lot of the jokes were just too obvious and fell flat and actually i thought the male characters had the funniest performances ryan gosling will ferrell simu liu 

just my two cents i loved lady bird by greta gerwig shrug",2023-08-22 02:48:14
as a big fanboy of golden age hollywoods soundstage films barbie land was a feast for the eyes glad they didnt use green screens,2023-07-21 02:39:43
i got so excited when i saw the mermaid barbie and ken because i had them when i was little and i totally forgot until tonight i used to fill up the bathroom sink and make them swim when my parents weren’t paying attention,2023-07-21 03:38:08
if you like the details watch the 7ish minute youtube video architectural digest has on the dream house it’s incredible how much thought went into the house alone  i can’t wait to see more “making of” videos,2023-07-21 20:47:54
commenting late but i saw a twitter thread that said the production team knew barbie’s height and measured her against all her accessories and apparently she is 23 bigger than her environment they built the sets accordingly and if that doesn’t deserve and oscar i don’t know what does,2023-07-27 23:14:01
yea the set design was fantastic,2023-07-23 15:48:33
barbieland was great la scenes looks looked oddly lazy and drab,2023-07-25 04:43:52
john cena as a mermken was a big and pleasant surprise ,2023-08-28 04:28:32
during the barbie party scene i had been thinking about how size and race inclusive all the barbies were but they were all young at the risk of being dramatic the bus stop scene took my breath away,2023-07-21 04:51:54
agreed especially when she looked up to just appreciate the beauty of the trees and we as an audience got to take them in for a moment as well something so everyday yet really so beautiful when you have a chance to pause that whole scene felt like a reminder to all of us to take a moment to breathe and appreciate all kinds of beauty that’s around us every day,2023-07-21 06:58:48
greta said she refused to cut that scene even though it didn’t move the narrative along and seemingly was a “culdesac” in the plot she said it’s the heart of the whole movie and if it wasn’t included she didn’t know why she was even making movie and it’s ann roth the costume designer who is a legend  conviction,2023-07-22 02:36:30
sidenote that woman was legendary tony and oscar winning costume designer ann roth who probably knows a thing or two about beauty standards and the things we expect women to do to fit into them that was some  tier meta casting its like if edith head were still alive and they put her in this movie and they probably would have,2023-07-21 18:27:39
"as soon as she called that woman beautiful and smiled at her i legit started really crying the punch line helped but it was at that moment that i was like oh  this movie is gonna get me

i absolutely lost it at the part with rhea perlman at the end when they played the montage of moms and daughters with the billie song playing in the background like fully crying 33 yo male lol",2023-07-22 04:53:43
"had to scroll way too far to see this it’s my favorite scene in the movie and i kept waiting for the movie to top it emotionally for me it’s totally okay that it didn’t i still had a great time but there was something so endearing about her just watching people existing some having just a regular day some clearly distraught and turning to the woman as ken would say sublime

also the ending “being a human is uncomfortable” was a good cherry on top of this scene",2023-07-21 23:02:45
literally the first old person she’s ever seen and she thinks she’s beautiful,2023-07-22 02:38:04
that scene made me a little emotional ,2023-07-21 07:24:23
that was my favorite part  my grandma lived to 91  gosh she really was so beautiful in her old age that scene made me miss her so much,2023-07-22 18:29:30
i cried it’s so genuine and so kind,2023-07-22 21:02:10
that scene was beautiful i know everyone is talking about ryan’s acting which i don’t get he was hilarious but margot was the heart but i felt every single emotion margot went through as she observed people and the “you are beautiful” moment just cinched it for me incredible incredible scene was sobbing through it margot absolutely  killed it what a talent,2023-07-22 21:45:01
that scene messed me up for a bit so lovely it really reminded me of the scene in soul where hes playing the piano with all the mementos thinking about how 22 experienced life,2023-07-22 06:22:13
whats great about that scene is that it would typically be the climax of another film but afterwards they had even more to think about and get emotional over the ending montage got me emotional too,2023-07-22 11:27:41
i think i read somewhere they wanted to cut that scene but greta wanted it in i’m so glad it’s in there,2023-07-22 17:38:58
i definitely had a good cry during that scene it was beautiful,2023-07-22 18:05:43
"that was a very endearing part as well womanhood is not defined by age nor appearance because womanhood is more than that

during my viewing a man laughed out loud in the theatre during that scene probably because the optics of how absurd it is that barbie would call an old woman beautiful 

i just found it quite funny that of course it’s a man who misses the message and finds that sweet scene funny",2023-07-27 17:04:32
this is the scene i teared up at greta has talked in interviews about different techniques that evoke emotion and even something as simple as experiencing the wind in the trees brought that to life for me,2023-07-23 05:59:35
"that old lady is barbara handlersegal daughter of ruth handler and the namesake of barbie such an amazing cameo

edit apparently im misinformed the woman on the bus bench is costume designer ann roth imdb trivia lied to me",2023-07-21 05:37:49
this was the first moment i cried in the movie and from here on out i was hooked,2023-07-22 06:13:34
i loved that scene too,2023-07-21 23:10:46
greta said they wanted that scene cut but she wouldnt do it  im so glad,2023-07-23 00:29:20
best scene i have seen on screen in a long time so simple but it was so beautiful the movie wouldn’t have worked without it,2023-07-23 03:09:06
i loved that scene too it was so heartwarming and kind and really set the tone for how barbie was going to navigate the real world,2023-07-29 05:07:02
i loved that scene too the montage bit felt very eternal sunshine inspired with the jon brion like score he also scored lady bird so maybe it was him,2023-07-23 19:21:10
read some trivia on imdb that that scene was almost cut but the director really wanted to keep that scene in,2023-07-29 05:21:21
im so glad magic earring ken made it into the film even just in the credits,2023-07-29 19:07:02
you get much more out of movies than i do i havent thought about that scene once lol,2023-07-25 02:38:36
"could you explain how it was “gorgeously shot” 

i agree it was a great scene but it seemed like a standard two shot",2023-07-24 01:44:30
yes these are the scenes that stuck with me as well,2024-01-10 01:38:09
thing is though that margot plays the part so well that i did believe that in that moment she didnt feel beautiful we all see that shes gorgeous but im sure even the most traditionally gorgeous women on the planet have days weeks and even months when they dont feel attractive at all,2023-07-21 15:56:32
im kinda disappointed we never get this question answered tbh but ill live lol,2023-07-23 02:25:27
makes sense that ken is so desperate to come over to barbies house every night hes not just thirsty he has nowhere else to go,2023-07-28 01:53:56
michael cera as allan honestly stole the show for me,2023-07-21 03:17:36
of course the kens don’t know how to fight for real much other than doing a  brotherly love hate dance off,2023-07-21 03:22:57
i wish i was high for that sequence and that it was 3 hours long and i was part of the sequence  i wonder how many men will be inspired to do dance fights from this because it definitely awoke something in me hahaha  that  lawnmower arm pumping move they kept doing  it was so masculine but positive  i love that the kens learned to get along because of it,2023-07-22 13:38:02
" maybe my favorite sequence in the movie

my favorite fight scene in a long time i generally gloss over when fight scenes happen but that one was so unique i was so invested",2023-07-21 09:00:12
i was honestly expecting gi joes to show up during the battle sequence until i remember that its a hasbro property and not mattel,2023-07-23 04:47:41
i was not prepared to see a real beach off,2023-07-23 19:52:19
im almost positive that scene was the best sequence to at least 34 of the people who saw this movie i wouldnt be surprised if it was everyones favorite scene and number,2023-07-31 10:05:13
horses should just rule the government,2023-07-24 05:41:15
as a selfproclaimed horse girl who is all about dismantling the patriarchy i literally said “same” out loud when ken said that the added layer of horses everywhere was just comedic gold to me i wasn’t even mad about it ,2023-07-29 03:01:27
that ken is definitely owned by a horse obsessed girl,2023-08-09 04:40:20
yeah that got the biggest laugh in my theater,2023-07-21 10:39:34
they refer to telepathy as shining,2023-07-21 03:30:27
beach volleyball scene was 100 top gun,2023-07-21 05:18:14
monty python and the holy grail horse riding,2023-07-23 03:32:28
the zack snyder cut of justice league,2023-07-23 17:28:19
singing in the rain with the dream ballet sequence just needed ryan or simu to be wearing a white silk veil playtime with the office layout at mattel the obvious godfather reference greta did an interview talking about films that influenced barbie on letterboxd here and there’s some smaller references umbrellas of cherbourg hairstyling etc,2023-07-21 06:19:43
singin’ in the rain grease for the musical number,2023-07-21 06:45:00
"fight club barbie says something like “you are not your girlfriend you are not your mink”

forrest gump the bench scene is set up similarly",2023-07-25 03:22:40
yea i texted my buddy after and was like “dude they did a  dday scene” movie was amazing,2023-07-23 16:12:17
elf reference when barbie was leaving for the real world the first time,2023-07-24 05:46:43
"america started in a disney channel movie about cheerleaders from a mexican area and their motto was “si se puede” 
when they said it in the barbie film and america immediately reacted strongly and said to not mess around with that quote i lost it  i said to my partner that me and like 4 other people are going to get that reference",2023-08-03 13:11:59
i thought that was a saving private ryan reference but when i said it yesterday my friends all thought i was insane,2023-07-21 06:02:06
was ruth supposed to resemble the oracle could be a second matrix reference,2023-07-26 07:22:04
i got american psycho when ken was explaining the music to barbie,2023-07-25 04:20:29
beach war was also a 300 reference,2023-07-21 16:50:26
the driving parts were 100 wizard of oz but with a pink brick lane instead of yellow,2023-08-01 12:59:59
not sure if it counts as a reference but i got monty python vibes from the kens riding around on fake horses,2023-07-25 06:47:42
 weird barbie doing somersaults like pris in blade runner,2023-07-26 22:49:27
gerwig hasn’t mentioned it as far as i know but the kens taking over barbieland made me thing of “back to the future ii”,2023-07-26 17:45:12
when the daughter asks her mom were she learned to drive like that during th chase scene the mom says there was this guy maybe a reference to gosling in drive lol,2023-07-27 14:30:53
when ken said thank you barbie thank you it had the same delivery as ronans phone call to her mum in ladybird,2023-07-24 14:22:30
the whippan between very squareon shots of the three kens talking to each other from the top floors of their houses felt way too wes anderson to be an accident,2023-08-04 10:23:40
fear and loathing,2023-08-05 12:33:47
the scene where all the barbies and kens and allen greeted each other reminded me of the rocky horror picture show scene you know the janet drscott  janet brad rocky one not sure whether it was a reference though,2023-08-10 15:19:09
you’re missing the shining,2023-08-11 16:22:30
the mattel office cubicles are almost identical to the office cubicles in the jacques tati film playtime which itself includes themes critiquing soulless architecture and institutions,2023-09-12 21:54:02
elf,2023-08-10 22:44:38
"gotta kick it up 

i also don’t know if this is true but i felt a who framed roger rabbit vibe with the travelling between worlds",2023-08-12 22:16:53
i loved how the two kens who were very gaycoded were instantly on the side of the barbies,2023-07-21 05:16:24
good ol’  ring ken,2023-07-21 03:30:19
i was too busy being happy rob brydon got the cameo as sugar daddy ken,2023-07-21 15:08:41
will ferrells ceo directly says her ghost set up office on the 17th floor,2023-07-21 02:41:55
"the use of the mattel logo as the censor is brilliant 

president barbie saying  was something i did not expect to hear in a barbie movie and i’m all here for it",2023-07-21 13:00:08
ruth handler died in 2002 so yeah plus as the others have pointed out will ferrell explained that away as her ghost having an office,2023-07-21 04:43:18
ruth handler’s ghost has an office on floor 17 didn’t you know,2023-07-21 02:38:47
i thought it was funny the mentioned ruth handlers irs problems too,2023-07-21 22:45:11
" was not expecting john cena to show up as a mermaid

same i had no idea he was in this and when i saw it it just made perfect sense",2023-07-22 05:44:53
" mermaid

merman

",2023-07-21 15:58:30
"that was john cena

hahahaha im dying in hindsight",2023-07-21 14:13:10
apparently in test screenings they didnt bleep it and now im sad because issa rae dropping the hard  would have been so cathartic lol,2023-07-31 21:33:38
thanks to those who replied i’m in san diego for comic con and had to step out near the end my uber driver was nice enough to tell me i left my badge in their car for me to retrieve i figure i missed that will ferrel confirming it than thinking it was just a dream sequence btw the barbie cosplayers here had at least one like the boardroom scene full barbie in the box dedicated cosplayer,2023-07-21 05:56:26
oh that was not censored by anything in the international release version i saw,2023-08-01 19:11:47
that was john cena,2023-08-01 00:31:27
ah so that’s why barbie’s name was handler at the end i didnt catch that part,2023-09-08 04:54:48
i felt so attacked by that scene,2023-07-22 02:13:07
i went with my wife and her friend and they were howling during that,2023-07-22 02:52:26
doll physics are  hilarious the way she held her arms and hands like barbie was always amazing me if youve ever played with a barbie you know how their bodies weirdly behave and she made it look so natural,2023-07-21 06:27:04
truly a barbie who is done playing,2023-07-21 05:31:37
yes it’s so good and i don’t ever mean to be that person who commentates at movies but i’m pretty sure i said aloud “mood”,2023-07-22 21:04:04
that was probably my favorite comedic moment in the whole movie completely unexpected with a perfect delivery,2023-07-24 01:40:07
he was cast perfectly,2023-07-22 04:13:55
i like the idea that unlike ken with barbie allen actually does know who he is so he doesn’t feel the need to change much aside from someone throwing a horse patch on him,2023-07-21 15:26:04
allan’s queerness was something speculated on historically and then he was paired with pregnant midge lol so to use him and other canonically  coded kens as allegories for femme  cis men within the battle of the sexes was well done,2023-07-21 04:06:56
he wears a unique all pink outfit at the constitution voteassembly,2023-07-22 04:05:04
it’s one of those rare movies that the style is just fun it’s why speaking of michael cera i love scott pilgrim it’s just a fun movie it’s not common for a movie to just accept it’s a movie and have fun with it,2023-07-22 07:59:14
all of ken’s clothes fit me,2023-07-21 02:54:13
when they reveal it was the mom who loved barbie and is making her think about death instead of the slightly edged teenage daughter who outgrow barbie it hit me quite hard,2023-07-23 11:08:00
"then handwaves the rest of the way

think of it as a town in sweden",2023-07-23 04:18:24
" i was so worried when barbie first met sasha that the movie was about to become barbie teaching her about being more positive etc

  


quite the opposite really the movie was about barbie learning to accept negativity excellent

  


 honestly i thought i had this movie figured out from the trailers but it just kept swerving in the best possible ways

  


yeah the trailers were pretty much just the first act of the film will ferral was barely even an antagonist unlike what we were led to believe

  


 some light exposition and then handwaves the rest of the way like will ferrell just casually mentioning that ruth was a ghost with an office like any other movie wouldve had the humans spend a lot more time questioning things

  


best type of world building honestly if the characters just go with it youll just go with it its why star wars works the force exists because it does were in the past but somehow in the future but everyone else is just living their life in it so lets just watch them do it

  


the world of avatar the last airbender has hybrid animals and elemental control but no one ever stops the plot to explain it they live it everyday so why cant we just watch them do that well catch up

  


this movie trusts us to be smart and not beg for information and i love that",2023-07-21 15:30:03
allan said all of kens clothes fit me,2023-07-21 03:10:40
i like how the real world clearly wasnt like on venice beach and in school barbie and ken got treated like youd expect sure but in mattel the cubicles had no doors will farrell and the other executives chased barbie themselves and ran around like the scooby doo gang its like theyre acknowledging how silly it is,2023-07-24 23:28:54
for real i love so much of this movie was “don’t question it” cause as a viewer we don’t care just push the story you want and we’ll enjoy it i can’t stand spending wasted time just convincing the supporting cast to accept the story just so we can move the story forward,2023-07-22 07:57:49
sasha calling barbie a fascist was one of my favorite jokes in the movie so  on point for the black and white discourse we have today,2023-07-22 23:52:59
i thought gloria didn’t question it because she worked at mattel and knew that was a thing that was possible but no other humans believed it was a real barbie,2023-07-24 02:08:05
i think also when america launches into her monologue stereotypical barbie isn’t wearing any makeup which was such a sublime choice,2023-07-27 22:42:07
simu liu was a natural ken one of my favorite parts of the movie was him storming the beach twirling that ribbon lizzie mcguire style while he rode the other kens like a tank,2023-07-21 14:36:27
"its funny i dont think hes even credited as ken 2 but hes the second most prominent 

he played goofball well though and ive been a fan since kims convenience",2023-07-21 13:35:40
his  expression comedy game was absolutely a i don’t think there was a single moment where the camera pointed at his face and i didn’t smile or laugh,2023-07-23 06:17:18
tbh i think he dances way better than gosling but had to tone it down to not outshine him idk idk,2023-07-22 09:08:21
"he was so  great in this

i was pretty indifferentto shang chi but this moviehas me wanting to see him in more stuff",2023-07-25 08:15:41
"there was a scene where simu liu has his leg up on something in a pair of green short shorts and you can see so far up his thigh that you can see the curvature of his 

1010 worth seeing on the big screen",2023-07-21 12:43:58
hes great in the other two and playing a very similar character rival to a ridiculous love interest of one of our main characters,2023-07-24 16:30:42
"dont forget those hair sparklers

unfortunately,2023-07-21 11:53:28
he’s so funny with the physical humor too i was dying when he slid down off the hood of the truck and when he was sliding down the slide,2023-07-21 02:44:25
seriously hollywood if the nice guys wasn’t enough to convince you please tell me this tipped the scales give gosling as many comedic roles as he can take,2023-07-21 02:38:39
"gosling walked into a movie called barbie that has a very strong prowomen message and walked out the undisputed mvp of the movie 

he dominated every scene he was in",2023-07-21 02:35:19
he achieved james dean level cool and jerry lewis level silliness all in the same movie,2023-07-21 02:18:14
i was violated by the “7 hours on instagram” line ,2023-07-21 04:40:50
based on the laughs in my theater a lot of us felt personally attacked by that scene jennifer and colin are just too good,2023-07-21 03:17:51
your estranged best friends engagement photos was painfully spot on loved this movie,2023-07-22 01:52:38
i legit screeched in the middle of a crowded theater because i felt so called out it’s such an obvious punchline but  was it well done the colin firth clip is what pushed it over the edge into genius,2023-07-22 00:03:29
every single thing said applied to me we couldnt stop laughing,2023-07-21 08:58:53
that was like a tim robinson sketch almost,2023-07-21 12:43:28
yep i avoid instagram sometimes because my old best friend who doesn’t talk to me anymore is engaged and it’s depressing that i wasn’t in the know so that line took me out haha,2023-07-23 01:10:24
that scene got the biggest laugh in my theatre,2023-07-21 23:25:12

my mom was like “……”

 so i continued with “yeah like daniel was that the boss’s name and the pretty blonde lady they keep saying they’re sleeping together and that they’re having  so sleeping togetherprettysex”

i was so confused at first i was like okay america ferrera is going to be the young girl now a young adult but no she was the mom we are old yes,2023-07-30 01:33:29
i watched her in superstore where she also plays the mother of a teenage girl it kinda lessened the blow,2023-07-25 04:00:05
i said this to my kids in the car ride home,2023-07-22 00:42:05
she had a teenage daughter on superstore too,2023-07-29 07:32:14
i couldnt understand why she sounded soo familiar then i realized she voices astrid from how to train your dragon i only knew her name from the credits but i had never looked her up to see what she looks like so this film was like a huge revelation lol,2023-07-31 11:30:27

his kenergy in the film was off the charts you could tell this is the most fun he’s ever had filming a movie actually pretty much the entire cast clearly had the time of their lives with this picture,2023-07-21 09:31:49
i can’t believe people were doubting him he was perfect casting and he knocked the roll out of the park,2023-07-21 17:57:45
he is beyond fabbbbb but does anyone else think it’s odd that rg keeps getting highlighted but not so much mr i thought they were both great but i just could not take my eyes off her in this film—her movement range expressions…so perfect…the artfully placed tears is the bulk of the attention being on rg some bizarre life imitating art situation,2023-07-21 05:08:49

i know simu lu is pretty buff and an actual marvel superhero but holy  ryan goslings muscles made him look like a child lol,2023-07-23 23:05:40
tbh i never liked him as an actor i know hes a decent actor but i didnt understand his appeal but this movie completely changed my view of him not every actor at his level of fame can pull off himbo role like this i really appreciate that he took a risk with this role without taking his image too seriously he really nailed it,2023-07-21 02:34:02
i keep seeing this homer regurgitation of ryan gosling doesnt have range,2023-07-21 06:27:25
nah sorry he did a great job but i was still distracted by all of his makeup that unsuccessfully tried to hide his age that and the fact that his head is shaped nothing like kens i really wish greta had casted someone else,2023-08-14 03:29:45
never said he was old i just didnt like the color of his hair and i stand by that,2023-07-22 01:23:02
ill be honest ive gone along with the literally me memes but have always been kind lukewarm on him but no more i kneel at the alter of gos,2023-07-22 21:42:10
he made the movie for me,2023-07-30 20:55:23
too old people are actually saying that,2023-08-03 04:50:19
i love when he gets these fun roles he’s great in this  reminded me of the nice guys in that he got to be silly he’s a great actor and nails these roles,2023-08-09 04:56:10
that was kind of the problem this was the barbie movie but ken was the star and it dragged any time gosling was offscreen he was dynamic and the rest of the film was just slow and dull by comparison,2023-07-21 03:58:52
"are these people in the room with you right now

e sorry i guess i must have missed the swaths of people that supposedly doubted ryan gosling if there’s one thing to know about him it’s definitely that his acting abilities are constantly  on",2023-07-21 02:17:52
nobody called him “too old”,2023-12-26 01:50:53
my theater lost it at im a man with no power does that make me a woman,2023-07-21 08:17:22
i love how mattel allowed the movie to let audiences know that ruth handler actually lost ownership of mattel due to her tax evasion ,2023-07-21 09:38:54
loved the fourth wall break thats exactly what i was thinking the whole time shes claiming to be  they cast the wrong person for this part,2023-07-21 09:18:09
it was moments like this that make me love this movie every time it was too much or not believable the movie gave you a cheeky little wink to know that theyre in on the joke it was a brilliant way to make the wackiness work,2023-07-21 03:30:40
"theres definitely a lot of competition but that mightve been the best joke in the movie

also ryan gosling was  phenomenal in this film literally incredible but there was something about how ken was written and also shown that made me think if they didnt get gosling bo burnham wouldve knocked this role out of the park as well i think its partly to do with the childish mentality and behaviorisms that ken had which bo makes a lot of fun of and embraces at the same time in his comedy specials",2023-07-21 02:23:36
that was the best joke in the movie ,2023-07-21 03:15:02
it’s similar to how the simpsons used to make so many jokes at the expense of fox network that they were airing on,2023-07-21 04:58:20
this movie had so many great moments and one liners depression barbie the kenoff the 4th wall breaking narration about margot robbie so much of it was  fantastic,2023-07-21 22:29:41
"its not shocking that a corporation would crunch the numbers and realize that saying to your audience were on your side is going to sell more products nothing about the movie will undermine their profit

what is shocking is if you know how much of corporate world is run by rich dudes feelings its surprising how selfeffacing the movie is disney would never ever make a movie that portrayed their ceo as a bumbling sexist hypocrite even if it made them money",2023-07-22 18:48:14
"eh mattel is pulling a sleight of hand here yes they’re doing the “self aware” schtick but notice how they never really fully address the criticism that barbie gives women an unrealistic body image they start from the premise that she is inherently empowering i think they mentioned it maybe once then moved on 

also the few jabs at capitalism seemed very simplistic they wanted to make a couple of jokes that showed they were hip to the kids humor but very cognizant of not venturing into any territory that would indicate the entire corporate business model being unethical 

gerwig and baumbach are great filmmakers this movie was beautifully shot and some of the acting and jokes were top tier but you can tell this thing was an advertisement and had the mattel pr hands all over it it’s a corporate movie after all they’re not gonna green light a movie they feel isn’t good for their bottom line

a corporation is very obviously not going to fund an honest satire of itself this company isn’t special",2023-07-21 02:52:18
maybe a reach but was that a reference to the killing the same line is said by the gorgeous coleen gray unironically in that one,2023-07-21 17:26:23
huh i assumed that comment was a funny dig at timberlake,2023-07-21 04:11:10
thank you my theater was laughing at allan so much i couldnt hear this bit,2023-07-21 03:19:35
i think the “that one” allan was talking about was jt not fatone never fatone,2023-07-21 04:26:50
all kens clothes fit me,2023-07-21 07:09:25
wasnt this a plot hole they said that there was only one allen and michael cera even said yeah ive been wondering about that,2023-07-23 06:01:46
i still dont get this joke justin timberlake is an allan how,2023-08-14 03:32:34
sarah silverman joke but the best part about joey fatone is it literally spells  one,2023-07-24 19:40:07
i didnt laugh but i was enthused that this movie actually acknowledged what fascism is and pointed out how most people use the term incorrectly just because they think its insulting,2023-07-25 01:18:20
that was an epic joke and showed that barbie was a  of a lot smarter than she thougnt at that point,2023-08-13 05:26:24
i was cackling at that railroad line,2023-07-30 21:22:16
nominate it just so they perform it again at the oscars rrr style,2023-07-21 13:53:38
i really want a ken style dance off between ryan gosling singing “i’m just ken” and jack black singing “peaches” on the oscars,2023-07-23 05:58:25
my favorite scene in the entire movie,2023-07-21 14:54:50
" song wardance off

it was a beach off",2023-07-24 12:30:20
made me think of monty python,2023-07-22 01:31:02
when i found out patriarchy wasnt about horses i kinda lost interest ,2023-07-22 01:12:41
i was kinda expecting them to do some monty phyton references haha,2023-07-22 11:38:42
did ken ever have an accessory horse or was it just barbie,2023-07-24 02:40:45
while i was watching the previous scene i said out loud is this how they will end this movie in a battle abruptly like monty pythons holy grail and in the next scene i see them ride imaginary horses  i was dead ,2024-01-02 17:44:37
i love that the kens are pavement fans they know the good stuff,2023-07-21 02:51:05
that entire sequence where they baited the kens into getting over excited about those stereotypical things that guys often love to discussexplain had my theatre laughing out loud when it started it was just a little giggle but by the end of the sequence i was tearing up from laughing it was just too on point,2023-07-21 02:33:17
the ken overexplaining photoshop killed me,2023-07-23 00:40:26
there was only me and one other guy in the theater and we were the only two that laughed at the zsjl joke my wife was so confused ,2023-07-21 03:37:27
you mean the godfather,2023-07-21 06:22:36
i was the only person in my theater to laugh at the zsjl joke but i think our showing was mostly older women and young girls both of whom are not that movies targeted demo  but i’m in the dc cinema sub and the amount of fanboys that lose it over that movie are def unmatched and will unleash an infodump circle  the second they can,2023-07-23 10:41:36
the zsjl went over the head of many people on the crowd where i saw it but it had me rolling greta held no punches with that one,2023-07-23 16:35:45
as someone in graphic design the bit with the barbie who just doesnt understand photoshop was relatable and had me dying,2023-07-24 19:42:17
this sounds like a  you’d see in rmoviescirclejerk…no way that is actually in the movie rright,2023-07-21 02:34:13
they really are literally me fr fr,2023-07-21 09:52:30
kendom was the best advertisement for global capitalist patriarchal hegemony since leave it to beaver,2023-07-21 02:53:30
you just know some snyder stans are gonna be mad,2023-07-21 03:16:13
the snyder cut shout out got the biggest laugh out of me,2023-07-26 17:36:25
i felt so incredibly called out during that entire sequence,2023-07-22 15:02:30
the kens got good movie taste at least ,2023-07-21 04:20:21
i was holding my giggles like a champ throughout the film the godfather scenes almost made me laugh out loud but i couldnt hold it when they mentioned zsjl my girl had to literally had to tell me to pull it together ,2023-07-31 09:04:18
the snyder cut line absolutely took me out i loved it,2023-07-23 23:55:49
film bros unite,2023-08-05 02:38:08
lol,2023-07-21 02:14:25
i think that joke would have worked better with fight club instead of the godfather though the latter i feel isn’t that much of a stereotypical « guy » movie whereas the former is a movie that bros will chew your ear off to tell you their  and wrong interpretation of the movie,2023-07-21 06:51:33
to beat the mansplaining you have to lean into the mansplaining and say oh really,2023-07-21 06:12:44
what was the justice league comment about i didnt see that movie and dont get it,2023-07-22 19:29:05
emma mackey reappearing with the “i’m right here” was perfect,2023-07-22 19:43:20
i’m bummed that only the first part of the lizzo song is on the album  was hoping the reprise would have been a bonus track that was so funny,2023-07-21 20:43:57
the barbieken dynamic reminded me of the batmanjoker in dark knight the good guy is kind of the straight man while the bad guy is very fun and creative,2023-07-23 01:47:27
incrediblep has entered my vocabulary,2023-07-21 18:45:11
"only comment about margot robbie the star and heart of this movie   in relation to her beauty 

meanwhile comic relief gosling gets praised for carrying this film",2023-07-26 12:06:03
it was a bad idea for me to take a sip of my drink before that line,2023-07-22 05:14:07
i thought it was because you could hear her australian accent come through,2023-07-21 19:37:33
out of everything in this movie i just hope its enough to convince them to make nice guys 2,2023-08-02 01:46:02
yeah that scene in particular really struck me that was barbies first time seeing an old woman and it would have been easy to have her be made uncomfortable in that moment and play it for a laugh but they found a really beautiful moment in it,2023-07-21 05:37:45
when i did this double feature i think this was what i was looking for in oppenheimer we truly do see the worst of humanity the hubris the destruction just a well very sad and unhappy time for this double feature to work barbie needs to refute oppenheimer or it needs to affirm it and i think while in many ways this films affirmed the more cynical world view of oppenheimer this particular scene stands out because it very quietly and respectfully refutes it there is real beauty in the world in humanity and it comes in some very unexpected places and it is that beauty which gives some justification and hope to humanity even if that is very small,2023-07-21 04:53:07
"i’m not sure if this was intentional but i think the movie also subtly called attention to the fact that even as barbies become more diverse they’re still always the “perfect” representation of their type 

like initially i thought stereotypical barbie freaking out about her body being damaged flat feet or cellulite was slightly … hurtful  to some of her friends because the movie has plus size barbies and a barbie who uses a wheelchair

but even a plus size doll is still plastic and smooth — she’s still “perfect” similarly a disabled doll doesn’t experience any genuine physical limitations because all dolls are manipulated around by their users 

dolls will always be perfect and unattainable even as they become representative of more people every doll is the perfect version of herself 

anyways when barbie is in the real world it’s her first time being exposed to flaws but to her everyone but her is still perfect because they’re themselves she thinks she’s the only one who isn’t exactly right — when in reality all humans even margot robbie are flawed in some way",2023-07-21 14:26:23
it was such a breathtaking scene i flew out to meet my two cousins this weekend partly to see this movie but also so we could spend time with our beautiful 84yearold grandmother we had dinner with her last night and lunch with her today before we saw the movie i’ve been very aware the past few days of the limited time i have left with her so this scene hit extra hard for me,2023-07-22 05:53:11
apparently gerwig said that scene was pivotal and essentially the whole point of the movie and i have to agree that’s the moment barbie embraced and understood humanity on an intuitive level and also showed her underlying positivity and empathy i knew she’d end up becoming human at that point,2023-07-23 22:38:30
this was the best scene in the film and i really wish we had tugged at that thread more in the film vs some of the more shallow and “easy” hits on patriarchy and a tween daughter who thinks her mom isn’t cool both those themes felt very 90s in its interpretation just dated and not saying anything new i wish the film explored more about what life is like to age what it means to age as a mother what it is for a daughter to see her mother age why aging is a gift aging beautifully and happily as a woman is in itself an act of resistance against patriarchy but we really didn’t get anything more from that vein and instead focused way more on the kens and their ken issues and the gaggle of incompetent corporate goons i did love the kens but felt like the second half of the film definitely focused way more on them than anyone else,2023-07-24 03:02:14
i love that i expected the older woman to get emotional or thank barbie for making her feel good or some  and instead she was just like  yes i am  brilliant,2023-08-13 05:31:24
great comment,2023-07-22 09:21:08
during that scene i legit thought to myself  this is gonna be the best scene in the movie,2023-07-24 03:31:11
i don’t know if it’s true but a friend told me this old woman in barbra ruth’s daughter in real life whom she named barbie after,2023-07-24 02:56:56
this is what makes me feel i’m bad at watching movies because i saw this seen and just didn’t believe barbie was being sincere how could she see the beauty in the old lady and be freaked by a little spot of cellulite maybe i’m obtuse but i like your take,2023-07-22 14:19:41
 i missed this  what do you mean,2023-07-21 23:06:09
make sure your date if it’s a guy is secure in himself and his masculinity nothing worse than leaving the cinema with a redpilled ken,2023-07-24 13:35:39

"that’s a cool idea to me wish they’d explored that but there was so much within that movie already

i think him knowing how to get to barbie world is easily explained mattel created barbie world so their top exec should know how to get there",2023-07-21 16:47:17
someone on tumblr said one of the escaped allans and with the quicker to go over gag repeated with allan later that tracks honestly,2023-07-21 16:56:29
i feel like that would have been both better and yet also more complicated and taken away from ryanken,2023-07-21 16:47:43
obviously he’s the man upstairs from the lego movie,2023-07-23 04:31:48
i don’t think we need to overexamine micro plot points of barbie the movie was unashamedly silly and not interested in plot and focused much more on theme and mood and style i think the ceo was just a cartoon ceo and doesn’t need a backstory,2023-07-21 17:01:49
"not alone  my one gripe with the film was that the ceo and board all acted like buffoons  like they were not real humans especially the chase scene 

that really took it out for me i was really expecting them to reveal that they were a long lost escaped set of kens which would have made all that silliness make sense  but no just humans who acted zero way like a real person would",2023-07-21 19:35:07
i thought all the leadership of mattel knew how to get to barbie world because they created it,2023-07-24 02:21:35
me too especially during the chase scene in the cubicle office all the board members were running like kens they were also all starstruck when they met barbie i was convinced they had escaped and were working at mattel to get closer to barbie,2023-07-25 13:10:16
that wouldve been an awesome reveal,2023-07-22 02:40:49
"i wouldve laughed if he brought in an inadvertent lego movie reference that wouldve tied the whole thing together

see i thought the biggest product placement was chevy the blue chevy car they were being chased in by the mattel ceo in chevy tahoes with prominent logos it was actually a little distracting to me,2023-07-21 02:31:57
“si de puede means yes i can” i immediately thought the same thing gotta kick it up is a disney channel classic,2023-07-21 03:52:36
bruh that car was pristine in the movie haha,2023-07-21 02:41:52
can you explain the final gag both the spanish in the car and her seeing the doctor were over my head,2023-07-21 03:30:23
it’s funny to me that the first ever fully electric corvette made by chevy was for  barbie i hope the corvette museum in bowling green gets one of them to display,2023-07-23 06:04:49
i thought the exact same when i heard “si se puede”  must be a nod to gotta kick it up,2023-07-22 08:24:12
im mexican i dont understand the si se puede being appropriation i thought he was just trying to be nice i really hope people are not that sensitive,2023-07-21 05:15:28
i don’t get how you could think ken became a villain he was just doing to the barbie’s what they did to all the ken’s treating them as second class citizens whose only purpose was the serve the other side,2023-07-23 21:39:56
w for gotta kick it up i accept that as a reference for sure,2023-07-29 01:43:18

high key for me what an incredible jab,2023-08-09 21:12:30
loved it too but it’s also not what fascism really is if the whole point was that sasha didn’t really know what fascism was barbie also kind of missed the mark i kind of wish she got it right as a way to highlight the overuse and misuse of the word but as a joke it was top notch,2023-08-10 02:48:29
oh man i missed that one i heard the end bit but didnt realize she was responding to the fascism accusation,2023-08-14 02:24:05
that part got the hardest laugh in my theater been there before will definitely be again hahaha,2023-07-22 04:05:05

that monolgue was legend my theater went silent during that i know it couldve been cheesy or pretentious but amercia ferrera delivered it with passions and sincerity and it worked,2023-07-21 02:12:04
helen mirrens narration was so funny i wasn’t sure if it was actually needed or not in fact i’m still not sure but it was definitely hilarious especially the end where she said that barbie left the plastic and pastels of barbieland for the plastic and pastels of la,2023-07-21 05:05:21
"i need her monologue transcribed asap scathing depressing but also exhilarating to hear it laid out so plainly

a funny aside i saw the movie with my friend and her 9yo daughter and when ferrera said something to the effect of “mothers are the ones that get  on for the bs dads get away with” her kid looked at us and went “she’s right” children are savage…",2023-07-21 02:55:31
"this movie definitely gave me huge lego movie vibes especially with will ferrell as the main “antagonist” in both movies i was expecting him to be a lot more traditionally evil and villainous than he actually was

i went into this movie without knowing what to expect and really enjoyed it",2023-07-21 03:40:33
ferrera truly crushed it she does likable righteous anger so well,2023-07-21 02:40:21
everyones talking about robbie and gosling but for me america ferrera was the standout by a landslide she was incredibly funny believable and this monologue was 1010 i really hope she starts to get some oscar buzz because she really is an under appreciated talent,2023-07-21 03:34:43

mattel execs were there just so they could show a fake villain in the movietrailers they didnt add much past that because they didnt have to do anything they werent even bad they were pretty useless and clueless like the real world execs,2023-07-21 08:52:40
with one joke this movie undid all the progress i had made with my gf to get her to stop leaving her money in a 1 interest savings account the highyield account i helped her set up is over 4  at least put it in that we dont even need to bother with cds,2023-07-21 04:48:33
" the mattel execs subplot didnt really add much solid 810

do execs ever add much",2023-07-21 13:44:30
i think i laughed the hardest when i saw myself in annoying ken with movie discussions or something i’ve read about investment,2023-07-21 12:28:26
its the heros journey it shows barbies ordinary world before the call to adventure,2023-07-21 05:02:37
schneider,2023-07-21 15:21:01
yeah it’s like the movie forgot about them i guess mattel wasn’t really the main villain like the trailers suggested but ken was,2023-07-22 20:51:42
not a fan of all the “relevant” jokes no one who watches this in 50 years will get them,2023-07-21 04:59:28
that’s so so true i love that as well and all the barbies and kens of different races and even sizes being able to just be barbies and kens not tied to their appearance,2023-07-23 04:35:39
he is handsome af,2023-07-23 14:45:26
i get it and i’m glad too he was a perfect ken,2023-07-23 22:43:45
it was great  i think there coulda been more asianindian barbie though  think i may have seen a couple quick shots in the opening sequence,2023-07-25 04:55:37
i agree shangchi and harley quinn fanfics are probably coming lol,2023-07-23 04:15:49
i’m glad that simu liu as cast instead of bowen yang  i’m just sick of seeing ken jeong and bowen yangtype asian guys in movies and tv like that’s how the average american is going to regard asian men,2023-07-30 01:36:28
he was great,2023-07-23 04:28:08
"it’s worth noting that we’re discussing a movie that rebukes the pressure that girlswomen feel to be sexy and attractive yet here we have everyone talking about how sexy and attractive simu liu is and how that’s a win for us asianamerican men presumably because now we asianamerican men will be considered more attractive in society

jeez we’re going to need an america ferrera style monologue or our own to rant about the contradictory messaging we men especially men of color get all the time",2023-08-05 11:41:02
simu was definitely able to perfectly match the himbo trophy husband kenergy to a t that perfect mix of being a total muscle hunk but also having that kind of softness to his face that makes him less intimidating,2023-08-14 20:02:40
have you seen the kiss me more music video,2023-07-25 19:17:49
"it’s not just the innocence and naivety it’s the powerless feeling many men feel and isn’t acknowledged

ken comes from a world where men are worthless and their only contribution is as eye candy he has absolutely no power then he gets to the real world sees patriarchy and doesn’t understand it nor does he see the harm that comes with it he just likes the fact that it gives him a feeling of power he never had

in a similar way the men who tend to fall into manosphere groups incel groups and who get conned by  harassers like andrew tate and robert greene are men who feel powerless and lost and fall victims to these assholes who manipulate them and get their money while simultaneously making their social skills even worse

ken is not evil he is misguided he did something wrong but it makes sense why barbie forgave him and gave him advice and compassion at the end he wasn’t being purposely malicious eventhough he did something harmful",2023-07-22 04:11:05
oh yeah hes not a misogynist but he was lost and lacking identity which is how a lot of guys end up in the wrong groups,2023-07-23 12:43:25
well said i think they handled the ken issue really gently and with care i was pleasantly surprised to see some messaging in there about guys as well,2023-07-23 22:56:32
i didnt think about it that deeply while i was watching it but i picked up on it a little and definitely have to agree i very much enjoyed the contrast between them i dont think the movie works without ken,2023-07-22 04:04:34
i wanted ncuti gatwa to nerd out by kensplaining doctor who to barbie,2023-07-23 17:16:28
that would’ve been perfect ,2023-07-22 17:10:20
why,2023-07-22 09:35:05
felt like they were red herrings for the villain role before it was revealed that kens took over barbieland,2023-07-21 02:28:50
i was totally expecting there to be some reveal they they were actually toys as well they were operating on the same sort of dream toy logic as the barbies and kens in barbieland i wonder if that was there earlier and got cut out because they had barely anything to do after they arrived in barbieland,2023-07-21 02:24:51
there is some suggestion they were all toys they all talked and acted like the barbies and kens and the workers cubicles didnt have doors just 4 walls a box,2023-07-21 05:06:29
will ferrell was the best of them honestly he was the only one that was needed,2023-07-21 03:17:00
therye kindof the bridge between reality and the toys they produce so it makes sense in a way like the second ken mentions something it just appears in their warehouse they are at the nexus of their brands meeting the real world and the people there are essentially the corporate version of barbie standins for popular conception on how a ceo should be rather than how they are,2023-07-21 22:20:17
yeah the mattel execs felt like an afterhought,2023-07-21 02:18:19
someone i was with mentioned that it seemed like there was a plot line that all the matel execs were actually escaped kens themselves the movie mentioned that there were escaped alans the whole nsync group and the execs said they dont care about escaped kens either,2023-07-21 03:14:50
i agree they werent really necessary for the whole narrative of the film they didnt even need to come to barbie land at the end,2023-07-21 02:39:55
they didn’t actually impact the plot in any way when you think about it didn’t put barbie back didn’t reset the world in any way… they just kinda followed barbie around she was the one making stuff happen,2023-07-21 05:46:42
it feels like they added them to tie into the mattel cinematic universe,2023-07-21 05:16:48
i loved them a fantastic red herring that i absolutely fell for and will turning out to not be evil and just cares about little girls in the least creepy way possible i still am laughing from that line ,2023-07-21 06:51:01
definitely the weakest link of the movie,2023-07-21 02:35:02
"somehow they needed a car chase with the product placement cars

i was hoping they got found in their hiding spot purely for how blue it is",2023-07-21 03:30:01
"if i had one nit pick with the movie it felt like the reasons why barbie needed to go from barbieland were rushed in explaining as if they didnt want us to think about it much which to be fair was probably the joke if youre a fan of pixar movies that spend a lot of time with world building and explaining the rules of the cross universe relationship such as monsters inc soul and coco you may be a bit frustrated

and to your point the role of the executives didnt really add much to the film besides serving as a group of people to chase barbie around

mainly the plot points that moved barbie  ken to the real world and then everyone back to barbielandkendom didnt make a ton of sense",2023-07-26 13:29:39
yeah that plot point went nowhere no arc and no resolution they also made the real world appear too goofy which made the serious issues adressed by the movie appear less serious,2023-07-21 06:56:18
maybe but will ferrell was hilarious so i didnt mind,2023-07-21 09:44:17
i hated everyone of their scenes didn’t work for me at all,2023-07-22 00:46:54
"i legit thought that the movie would end with barbie turning down ken to be with the dorky cubicle worker that tagged along with the evil suits 

they really were a red herring overall 

you go in thinking they were gonna be the big bad and it turns out to be ken",2023-07-21 02:40:17
agree 100  the only thing bad about the film was the inclusion of the mattel execs those characters needed to be more serious and threatening the second we were introduced to them it felt like we were back in barbieland which is problematic instead the execs added pretty much nothing to the plot that couldn’t be dealt with in other ways,2023-07-21 05:37:23
not enough jamie demetriou,2023-07-21 04:08:16
i thought it was commenting on the cartoonish evil of corporate capitalism in a way not saying if i thought it was well done or not but that was my take at least,2023-07-22 01:29:25
them being goofy and kind of unrealistic sort of makes sense since they’re the main connection between barbieland and the real world they have some of the ridiculousness of barbieland while still being “real”,2023-07-22 22:49:01
i thought will ferrel was going to turn out to be a ken or allen who had crossed over and accidentally ended up running mattel,2023-07-24 08:05:06
i took it as more of a commentary on corporate america and how all these male suits in highpowered roles are actually idiots half the time,2023-07-24 22:50:47
"shocked by the comments here the ensemble of suit guys was one of my favorite parts of the movie the speaking in unison the complete failure to capture barbie the one guy getting shot out of nowhere it was all just such campy fun 

i’m really happy they didn’t make them the big villains of the film cause it’s just too obvious and simple ken being twisted is far more interesting and unexpected",2023-07-25 01:57:18
yeah my biggest gripe of this movie i feel like the movie could be better if most of their scenes were cut,2023-07-21 03:40:22
when will ferrell said call me mother i started wondering whether the point was that they were all secretly ,2023-07-21 09:30:38
if i didn’t know this was a movie by greta gerwig i would have walked out hating the entire real world sequence except gosling’s segment it’s very poorly written america ferrera and her daughter’s characters were written with the nuance and depth of recent marvel films it sucks even more because  greta has already done a great mother daughter film probably the greatest ever loved the beginning and the end but the middle is non existent to me,2023-07-21 10:05:22
as soon as will ferrell showed he had knowledge that he knew how to get to barbie land i was betting on him being an older ken that escaped,2023-07-22 18:10:42
yeah its almost as if this was a satire,2023-07-21 02:45:17
except that scene with them on the rollerblades had me  rolling,2023-07-31 01:17:19
its not an actual real world theres california instead of usa that was perfectly deliberate i feel putting a doll in a perfectly realistic world would limit creative options of the film so they set the expectations clearly at the beginning but maybe it still got over some peoples heads eg our first interaction with mattel is learning that they are aware of barbie world,2023-08-15 22:53:09
"im not into musicals or dance numbers but i will never say no to experiencing that magic again 

anywhere else id be a ten is forever rent free in my head",2023-07-21 03:08:42
"margot is sublime

i see what you did there",2023-07-21 15:20:20
i was getting euphoria s2 finale dancemusical vibes with that energy it was so  amazing,2023-07-21 03:00:22
"im a liberated male and its strong to cry or whatever that line is was great  

they had an opportunity to leave ken crying as simply a punchline but theres a lot of truth behind that sentiment and i appreciated them leaving that in there",2023-07-21 03:39:34
yeah me too i need that hoodie,2023-07-21 02:13:05
i was hoping to purchase a thoughts of impending death barbie but alas tis not available,2023-07-21 22:32:01
the 2001 space odyssey spoof in the beginning and was released as part of the marketing was spoton because i felt like this movie was on a space odyssey level of surrealism and heady existential ideas,2023-07-21 03:37:12
"after reading this article i suspect the mattel executives dont totally understand what they green lit

but anytime i get too deep into references or the politics of this film with gerwig or the actors i’m quickly reminded by an executive or a producer that it’s a fun summer romp",2023-07-22 03:15:38
" im shocked that mattel  warner bros greenlit this film

i mean as great as the movie is its likely just a 2hr commercial to mattel so theyll probably allow some digs and crassness if it means the movie is good enough to drive interest in barbie",2023-07-21 04:39:02
idk mattel although a corporation has kind if always pushed for little girls to see themselves as more barbie has been everything for decades,2023-07-21 17:45:40
i was pretty surprised at the “beat each other off” joke at the very start lol,2023-07-23 13:21:21
yeah im gonna email mattel cs tomorrow about it they have to produce that  its like printing money for them probably didnt even realize so many kens in the world would want barbie merch,2023-07-21 07:52:31
greta being attached as director already gave me a sign as to how this movie would play out but once margot and gosling were attached there was a 0 chance this movie would be style over substance i’m glad mattel and wb let this movie go as far into territories most blockbusters wouldn’t dare enter,2023-07-24 07:59:04
and that the mattel executives were portrayed as idiots that get hurt all the time and just wanna tickle each other i mean it’s 100 true but that greta got away with that was amazing,2023-07-22 02:52:52
if they don’t start selling them they are fools barbie and ken and even allen costumes will already dominate halloween this year i’m sure,2023-07-23 07:09:27
it’s probably much easier to greenlight this movie when you know everyone will be buying hoodies and other merch they are still ruthless capitalists after all,2023-08-08 02:45:35
i’m kinda hoping mattel does tries to copy this film for their other adaptations i’ll be laughing my  off at a viewmaster film that tries to be deep,2023-07-21 03:15:12
"not sure how the humour would be seen overseas  i’m from australia where snl is seen as both representative of usa humour but also seen as one of the lamest forms of comedy tbh

i was in a packed theatre for barbie  some of the jokes were a hoot and really well done and very smart eg depression barbie narrator speaking over barbie’s insecurities barbie acting stiff like a doll a lot of other jokes felt flat and to a quiet audience here interesting to see if the praise for the comedy is a us only phenomenon

really digged the movie references outfits of barbies and kens the female empowerment monologue was done really well",2023-07-21 20:44:43
it’s gonna make money just like the film says ,2023-07-22 13:25:44
yeah i know the lego movie also does it well but having a movie based on a product like barbie having such a message is surprising but great shame wb only sees a movie based on a product doing well and deciding thats what people like about it,2023-07-29 19:34:32
i didnt know i needed ryan gosling to sing push but i totally did his comedic timing at several points in the movie is impeccable,2023-07-22 01:42:04
the best joke of the whole movie was hearing different sections of the theater catch on to the song ken was playing at barbie many seconds apart when i started laughing at the first 3 chords i almost died with how long it took some people it was hysterical,2023-07-22 04:21:00
well not literally the opposite actually,2023-08-22 16:51:45
btw ruth handler constantly stressing her tax evasion charges was hilarious,2023-07-21 02:27:31
the line mothers stand still so daughters can look back to see how far theyve come hit me hard,2023-07-21 02:22:52
i teared up when she told the old lady she was beautiful which for me made her line land even better,2023-07-21 02:36:46
"i couldn’t stop the tears rolling down i went there expecting a fun and amazing visual experience and i got that but also opened up this memory chest with a new perspective i saw myself growing up and putting away my barbies being to cool for her and my mom having to feel that in silence i saw my self when i felt small in a room but had to control my words and thoughts cause they wouldn’t take me seriously i felt everything when ruth told barbie to stop and breathe

i loved every detail in this movie the art direction was inspiring but i never thought i would feel so much and at the same time didn’t feel alone a beautiful shared experience",2023-07-21 02:26:27
i watched the movie with my mom and i cried like 6 times or more and was still crying leaving the theater the flashbacks between sasha and her mom just hit so hard  seeing sasha go from wearing all black to incorporating pink back into her style just meant so much to me because i went through the same thing rejecting everything feminine because you are being constantly told to not be like other girls as a child and that barbie is the literal devil in disguise for having unrealistic proportions but it was never barbie that contributed to my body image issues,2023-07-21 10:03:27
biblical even…she was talking to her creator,2023-07-21 02:20:41
i spent way too much of this movie all choked up the opening scene had me misty america’s monologue on how hard it is for women the scene with barbie and ruth i loved the whole movie so much,2023-07-21 04:23:46
i cried a few times lol  the scene where you realize it’s actually the mom who’s connected to barbie and not the daughter  oof  i got into dolls as an adult in that same kind of sadwistful way like a lost childhood  and i have a tween daughter who’s exactly like the girl in the movie  which is both exciting to see an independent personality coming out but also so sad to lose my snuggly little girl  this movie was great,2023-07-21 10:28:56
showing the grainy moments of life’s memories got me wasn’t prepared for that,2023-07-21 05:15:13
i was going to ask the same question all the women in my row including me cried i’m also pregnant with a girl right now so ruth’s line about her daughter right before that sequence made me lose it,2023-07-22 04:40:07
"i cried almost the entire time following the scene with barbie in the la park something about her looking at the trees and all the people around her just being human really got me and i was bawling by the end when she and rhea perlman were in the white space 

it was a really strange theater experience for me because it was halfempty and no one else was laughingcryingreacting to anything very awkward",2023-07-22 14:59:27
honestly i was tearing up at the opening  so much anticipation in a theater surrounded by people in pink so excited to be there it just got to me,2023-07-21 04:38:07
yes—i got emotional a few times throughout the movie  even during the opening sequence the scene where barbie is having a moment sitting on a bench in the real world also got me,2023-07-21 04:51:37
we just got back my wife and i and when the real life footage rolled i lost it made me think of my wife and my daughter and it  got me good,2023-07-21 20:35:44
i did start to tear up during the end the movie was really relatable and i’ve felt a lot of the feelings barbie has,2023-07-21 04:30:45
i cried a few times there were some touching moments that got to me,2023-07-21 02:20:59
i cried throughout this movie i loved it i had therapy earlier in the day and was talking about how much my identity has changed since motherhood when america said something to the effect of moms never getting to do anything fun anymore it felt like they were just quoting my therapy session,2023-07-21 19:25:56
that ending was definitely emotional this movie kept surprising me to the very end in the best ways possible,2023-07-21 15:17:05
i cried during the the flash montage of “real women”,2023-07-23 23:14:19
i went with my girlfriend and we left an hour ago and shes still crying it really kicked up a lot of feelings for her,2023-07-21 21:21:32
i cried a lot granted i’m going through a big self esteemwhat am i doing phase so it poked a lot of buttons for me,2023-07-24 04:17:27
i’m glad my husband was sitting between me and my very sashalike preteen daughter because i didnt want her to see me crying mom tears over the last third of the movie like all the things i try to pass on to my kid while tempering her for heartbreak and feeling like nothing is right were summed up in the mom’s speech and rhea perlman’s speech and i was just crying ,2023-07-24 17:28:19
late response but i just saw this last night before the film my gf went to the bathroom and there was a woman in there sobbing she turned to my gf and said that the barbie movie  her up ,2023-08-06 13:22:05
cried laughing,2023-07-21 02:15:50
i know i’m late to the party but i cried multiple times during this movie like at least three but i might’ve lost count america ferrara’s speech and barbie’s second talk with ruth handler just really got to me,2023-07-29 20:19:38
cried like five times,2023-07-24 06:22:30
definitely got a tear been feeling discard and not so beautiful smart whatever so the bit about depression really hit for me wouldve been crying if i wasnt laughing lol,2023-07-24 19:33:50
ken being introduced to manhood by seeing a giant poster of bill clinton is another fantastic bit,2023-07-21 03:04:48
when barbie starts describing anxiety and a woman just walks up behind her and says thats exactly what it is i felt that,2023-07-21 03:48:41
i agree it made me cry too especially when she said the old lady was beautiful the music used for the emotional scenes worked really well,2023-07-21 18:45:28
look its the supreme court,2023-07-23 04:48:40
“feels violent to me”,2023-07-21 04:36:51
i had this exact experience ken goes in head first with what can benefit him give him power take advantage of all the things he sees he loves and wants like horses lol and barbie just slows down and observes it was a beautiful contrast,2023-07-23 01:04:27
"as a man i identified much more with barbie in that pair of scenes

i guess i mention that just to point out the notallmen notallwomen aspect to all this  theres almost certainly some kind of average male experience and some kind of average female experience which are fairly distinct from one another but in no way is it actually anywhere near that binary at an individual level",2023-07-22 22:01:47
thats exactly because they are different,2023-07-21 02:39:04
"this makes me think of a quote ive seen around grown men come to conclusionsrealisations women had as 14 year old girls like guys in a general sense live in this cushioned youre amazingboys will be boys existence for so long for most of modern history while for women generally speaking its one hardship after another particularly in that delicate tweenteen stage you are taught girls can do anything as a kid then gradually find out how untrue that is

again for anyone angrily typing a rebuttal i am generalising based on common experiences not each individual one",2023-07-23 12:34:56
it was so powerful for me men truly are disconnected from the every micro and macro dangers we face been through it myself several times when beggars or violent people tried to stop and harass me on the street and i tried to get away from them and my exes always stopped to talk to them it mightve been coming from a good place but they always put me in danger this way and no matter how many times it happened dude is going to stop by those creepsweirdos while his woman is trying to run away,2023-07-21 21:25:14
the images men see and fall in love with quickly become a prison i think the movie was trying to get you to see that this was true for both sexes and i think you missed it,2023-09-11 00:02:11
to me i think it was a perfect illustration of how poorly women understand the male psyche actually,2023-07-23 09:21:53
i’m a bloke who cried in that bit it’s not just women,2023-08-01 22:24:55
i’m a man too and i cried at this scene the juxtaposition was beautiful and neither stereotype wholly represents one gender or the other imo,2023-07-31 12:48:45
"uhhh you got the wrong takeaway from this movie if you think that men only care about power and women only care about feelings

edit why the dvotes",2023-07-21 11:29:25
stop dating men that you disconnect with stg its such a specific person who wont learn their lesson who has this kind of relationship problem you choose who to date you know that right you get to pick use stricter criteria,2023-07-21 07:16:02
it was the same coat sylvester stallone  wore in a picture from when ken realized men rule the real world,2023-07-21 21:40:42
perhaps but i thought it was more from him seeing those pictures of sylvester stallone wearing a fur coat during his revelatory moment,2023-07-21 22:43:08
"it looks nice on ken 

this does make me wonder if ken and the other kens have watched fight club ",2023-07-21 17:17:16
i already have this coat from a previous halloween costume and you bet your   i’m starting crunches now and being incel ken for halloween this year,2023-07-22 05:02:21
that look is going to be popular for halloween,2023-07-21 16:16:12
absolutely,2023-07-21 14:03:14
it reminded me of joe namath,2023-07-21 22:17:59
it’s never a fight club callback,2023-07-21 22:45:05
i thought it may be logan paul reference too lol,2023-07-23 15:19:57
i thought that the teaser with the monolith was made just for the teaser when the movie opened with that i was in tears,2023-07-23 01:10:51
and they also reference the end of 2001 while the billie eilish song plays with the zoom in on her eye and the montage followed by her in an all white room,2023-07-23 04:15:49
the vast majority of children who have no idea what 2001 a space odyssey is probably won’t love that part they’ll be confused if anything,2023-07-21 06:39:44
i thought it was a metaphor about how our society pits women against each other so they’re too distracted to change their status,2023-12-05 04:24:50
"thats the bottom line barbie won because this is a movie and most movies have to have a happy ending

in the real world there is no ending you win some you lose some and life just goes on",2023-12-05 16:08:04
i liked that they took back their world instead of fixing it i dont know if it was intentional or not but it kind of gave the message that even if women ruled it would not be fair to men and they would make the exact mistakes men do in the real world,2023-12-20 21:12:03
this is absolutely 100 correct and i feel its the main message i took from the movie,2023-12-17 05:11:53
i think that was sort of the point they were definitely commenting on this trend in modern society,2023-12-17 16:12:27
"it was fun but also thoughtprovoking why did ken stage a revolt because he lived in a femaledominated world and he felt ignored and emasculated he was not recognized as a person which is how many women feel in a male dominated society

why did barbie go to talk with ruth handler because when you are going through a crisis and wondering who you are and what your purpose in life it many people want to talk to their creator",2023-12-05 16:05:51
it’s a message for the world tbh there isn’t a superior gender we are all humans with flaws and desires and dreams we need to embrace one another and accept each other for our difference,2023-07-23 04:18:43
"i feel motivated to comment why are you watching this you are kenough on an andrew tate video

i felt bad for ken he was made for barbie and the movie is her telling him  you,2023-07-23 04:03:56
so simple yet so beautiful it’s the scene i can’t stop thinking about,2023-07-23 03:23:44
i read they almost cut that scene and greta fought hard to keep it in,2023-07-23 04:35:55
i don’t know if this is true but my friend said that old woman is barbra ruth’s daughter in real life who the doll’s name is based off of,2023-07-24 03:21:03

"i was pleasantly surprised that nothing dramatic caused the rift between america and her daughter no death no divorce

  


just the natural cause and effect of a girl growing up and trying to prove shes not a kid anymore even if that breaks a mothers heart",2023-07-21 16:00:40
"honestly thats what i thought too theres a weird wistfulness when they talked about him in parts and afs character said she was feeling lonely and thinking about death

it wouldve made sense but then i guess they wouldve had to resolve that subplot as well",2023-07-21 03:25:08
i honestly wouldn’t be surprised if they even filmed some scenes in a way where they could make that choice later in editingbased on test screenings,2023-07-21 02:45:02
"where did you learn to drive like this
there was this guy
was it dad

no honey youve seen your dad drive he drove you to school this morning remember

i dont think an early draft had him dead i think early parts of the final cut has him dead",2023-07-21 02:36:33
to me it was obvious and established until they proved otherwise like the whole thinking about death part shouldve come from somewhere right and this momdaughter fall out felt way more than just teenager things so when they said dad is alive i was really surprised,2023-07-21 08:57:17
and ultimately winning by making the ken’s insecure in the same way that a lot of men do to women by making them fight against each other,2023-07-21 02:38:33

"watching mafia films together

i literally react the exact same way when a girl or anyone really tells me they haven’t seen the godfather which is probably one of my favorite films of all time so i felt especially seen in that part  down to the random bits of explanation while watching the movie which i admittedly do quite often i’ll probably do that while watching barbie on streaming with some friends in a few months",2023-07-21 09:46:07

i immediately looked for it but its just generic ones,2023-07-21 15:11:31
seconded,2023-07-21 15:01:15
just saw the movie just looked it up too and here it is straight from the source,2023-08-05 08:42:44
theres no official one yet hopefully they release one and were just waiting until after the movie was released,2023-07-21 14:22:32

flashbacks to having finance bros mansplain basic economic ideas even when you work for a bb,2023-07-22 01:44:31
my cinema was quite evenly split gender wise but the laughs were notably more female during that part ,2023-07-23 08:09:01
"i feel exactly the same way it was actually such an important message that i haven’t seen positively discussed and relayed in media 

for men that your self worth shouldn’t and isn’t decided by your access to women 

for women it’s important to keep trying to change the world even if it seems fruitless and exhausting and that the worst thing you can do is be complacent 

along with several other very important messages",2023-07-21 02:36:54
seeing barbie break down after a teenager called her a fascist was not something i expected in this movie the fact that barbie even knows what a fascist is,2023-07-21 03:47:24
the beautiful part is that ryan gosling is used a lot in representing the sadbroken man that is the catalyst on why they turn red pilled so using ryan to show positive male growth is gonna  them off even more,2023-07-21 08:14:52
"personally i have mixed feelings about some of the commentary in the film but the one thing i thought was really interesting either way that almost no one has pointed out is that

at the end of the film ruth handler informs barbie that things like patriarchy and an equivalent word for ken i forget what it was are just ideas that human beings invent for themselves so they can cope with their suffering on earth before they die it was almost like she was telling barbie that patriarchy isnt real in the sense she thinks it is and that what was more important now was barbies journey to discovering her own identity

it was wild and i didnt expect that to be in there and i think that most people wont notice it till later on either",2023-07-21 22:51:45
"the people complaining they pulled the punches on ken feels like they missed the entire point of the monologue given by america ferrara 

he like barbie is just a doll its unfair to put the entire patriarchy on him when the only reason he engaged in it was he felt lost afraid and unseen 

was it wrong of him yes can you understand how he stumbled into it also yes",2023-07-21 11:23:28
this is really well put  i’ve already had multiple people online respond to my effusive praise for this movie with the usual word salad about it villainizing menken but i quite love this interpretation of it ken basically never feels like he’s an adult man and i think this is exactly why,2023-07-21 23:05:58
i think your kenalysis is spot on,2023-07-22 13:35:19
" one observation i havent seen made much is regards to ken a few critics have accused the film of pulling its punches with regards to ken in the end
 
 how i saw it was that ken wasnt a representation of tatepetersenredpill leaders so much as a representation of the naive 12 year old boys who dont know enough about the world to not fall for it

i dont see kens transformation to be something akin to altright extremism where impressionable youths are taken in by the appealing surfacelevel appearance of conservative ideology 

i saw ken as an analog for females growing up in a maledominated world when ken went on his walk he saw men in positions of power that he couldnt imagine himself as in barbieland feminism in our world is that push from females to create a system where they can achieve those positions of power when they normally couldnt  just as feminism is the vehicle for females to obtain systemic power ken saw the same thing in the patriarchy he saw the system that would allow him to obtain those positions in power just as a female looks to feminism to rightfully empower them

my only problem with the ending is that ken didnt reject this ideology by his own volition he only left that way of thinking once the system he created was destroyed",2023-07-21 04:08:24
"absolutely agree on the incel comparison it felt like gerwig was trying to drive home a message that ken wasnt the villain but rather that patriarchy is the villain incels are created by men defining themselves in their relation to women just like ken does the ken is me scene is making a point that men need to find an identity that doesnt need to center around women whether that be obsessing over them or oppressing them our modern world has a crisis of identity when it comes to masculinity most of us have recognized that what masculinity used to be is unacceptable but weve failed to fully realize an alternative positive form of masculinity for men to follow there are elements out there but i dont think theyve come into sharp focus yet the redpill movement and others like it are a rejection of the mainstream critique of an older toxic masculinity in the face of not knowing where else to go with their identity i believe that the ken plotline of this movie is a rebuke of the redpill movement and an attempt to reveal its shortsightedness and direct men towards the revelation that we need to create a new identity that doesnt depend on women to define ourselves

most of my thoughts i just laid out actually come from a contrapoints video i watched a few years back that stuck with me ill need to see if i can track it down but it feels like it could have been written as a direct analysis of this movie she talked all about the concept of a missing positive masculine identity and how men using women to define themselves creates the toxic behaviors that have defined the patriarchy both for men and women 

it speaks so wonderfully to this movie that i think it has just as much to say to men as it does to women the lessons are very different but both are sympathetic to their respective audiences there is no villain here besides the system itself that traps all of us",2023-07-24 05:05:17
" they need to work on themselves before they can earn what they feel entitled to

more than that even after he works on himself he wont have earned barbie because shes her own person and not a reward for good behaviour

he needs to work on himself for himself because hes currently defined by someone else",2023-07-27 22:03:25
i think i was the only one in my theater cracking up at the control the railroadsflow of commerce line ,2023-07-21 05:21:05
i really liked the ending with all the kens in the end barbie didn’t hate him she was just like “hey dude maybe chill the  out and let go of your bravado so we can all live in harmony”,2023-07-22 03:04:01
"i thought the movie did a good job of not trying to claim it had all the answers and just acknowledging that the world is tough to navigate for women and the reasons why are complicated it gives some wisdom on how to cope and treat yourself and others with kindness and respect

the people who are claiming that it manhating propaganda didnt actually pay attention to the movie",2023-07-26 13:35:56

"falter a little on driving home the point that they need to work on themselves before they can earn what they feel entitled to

this is my one significant criticism of the movie  it was pretty heavyhanded in its female empowerment dialogue but extremely subtle with the point that patriarchy hurts men too the very menboys likely to be  into tates worldview are i think highly likely to miss that point",2023-07-24 01:18:46

let me guess the quartering,2023-07-21 06:13:46
can you share some of the articles where they made those comments about ken,2023-07-21 21:54:53
the patriarchy is fine,2023-07-30 05:40:20
loved that whole scene as well,2023-07-30 02:28:46

"feminism isnt antimen  the patriarchy harms men and this movie touched on that some but the focus was primarily on women

the narrative that feminism is antimen is rightwing propaganda and a way of pushing people against feminism or framing attacks on patriarchy as attacks on men does the same",2023-08-10 13:27:35
honestly i feel like the movie was long enough but could have gone without the mom and daughter entirely keep the focus on barbie and have her be the one to deliver the monologue so that it feels more earned the fact that the movie switched main characters halfway through really took a lot of momentum out of the plot i feel like the lego movie did the whole child and parent relationship aspect a lot better anyways if the barbie movie had taken a little less out of the script about how hard it is to be a woman and had instead made the central conflict more about barbie wanting to be a human and what it means to feel and grow old and die then the ending scene would have also held a lot more weight to me it felt unearned as well,2023-07-25 07:38:23
"very nice writeup interesting point about the unearned for a lack of a better word monologue i found myself a bit confused and uneasy by what barbie as a film was trying to do and your comment helped to highlight some things that perhaps contributed to me receiving the film that way

theres one point i strongly disagree with
 
 ryan gosling has never been more funny and charismatic in a movie ever 

he was funnier in the nice guys and exhibited a similar type of charisma there as well

ps regarding the board of execs being underdeveloped i thought it was an interesting contrast to the dolls who seemed to possess distinct personalities this is also visually represented by them all having different outfits professions and affinities but the suits were all interchangeable except will ferrell and the nature of their jobs seemed to restrict them from going outside the corporate hivemind standard",2023-07-25 07:39:32
"giving a voice to the cognitive dissonance required to being a woman under the patriarchy robbed it of its power

i think she made that exact point to say it out loud

but yeah im curious as to what they cut",2023-07-25 07:18:11
yeah a lot of people miss that i see that people are hating on this movie for its treatment of ken and they hate the feminism of this movie but this film is more in the antipatriarchy camp as in hey look how patriarchy has hurt barbie and ken,2023-08-14 02:17:16
i took my 15 year old daughter and we were  crying together and holding hands by the end of it i dont think small children will appreciate it at all but teens and especially teen girls absolutely have a place in the theater for this one,2023-08-28 19:17:49
finally saw it and had the same issue not that i blame them at all i agree with everything you said some kids in the theater were struggling to behave towards the end for all the reasons you said,2023-08-27 03:36:34
i think the only reason it was pg13 instead of pg was to signal to parents that young kids wont be entertained by the movie,2023-09-11 06:12:18
 yea on this writeup this sums up my own feelings wellbearded dad and husband here pretty perfectly,2023-07-26 02:15:34
there is such a fine line on bringing up these topics and sounding preachy or veering into meaningless virtue signaling or missing the mark completely and in my opinion this film kept that balance really well i wasnt prepared for how thoughtful and emotional the movie was,2023-07-26 00:11:39
"same 

can’t remember the last time i had just a good time watching a movie",2023-07-26 12:27:41
amazing take,2023-07-26 02:01:56

if anticapitalistic sentiments help chevrolet sell cars they couldnt care less what ethics a movie has,2023-07-22 14:44:12
the writers directly make fun of this in the movie “that’s a terrible idea it will make us a lot of money that’s a great idea” greta gerwig and noah baumbach directly mocking the people that finance their movies,2023-07-23 00:18:40
what about it was anticapitalist,2023-07-22 17:10:22
yeah i thought it made some good points about how the patriarchy also hurts men i think you have to be quite thin skinned as a man to think this film was anti man as opposed to anti harmful gender roles ending was a bit meh but at the same time i cant really think of a good alternative,2023-08-10 22:16:46

" main character has the same day every day until event details their life
 

this is just about every book movie tv show and play ever written",2023-07-21 19:12:04
i was thinking about that during the movie,2023-07-21 18:59:02
also  being much much better and deeper than a movie about a toy franchise had any right to be,2023-07-21 20:50:32
it was like a much less subtle and less funny version of the lego movie,2023-07-23 02:52:22
warner brothers is another connection,2023-07-22 04:54:12
i joked with my friend after can you imagine if mattel just greenlit a whole bunch of postmodern intellectual films based on their toy lines it would be like if a24 was a toy company,2023-07-21 03:49:42
"i think its hilarious only because its technically very innocent from the kens not as a concept

goslings ken just wanted to be noticed that woman acknowledging him just enough to ask for the time was a spectacular event in his life

so he turned to something which acknowleded him on a more frequent basis in the wrong way and for the wrong reasons but still

so its also kind of allegory for how easily lonely people can get  into these things",2023-07-24 00:50:34
haha same i’m a woman who is very feminine but id totally be okay with that environment seems like fun,2023-07-23 22:04:35

"i agree wholeheartedly 

i really wish margot robbie got one musical number as big and impressive as goslings just to match the kind of overwhelming energy that ken song had",2023-08-04 04:55:04
"mattel execs who in all honesty didnt need to be in the film

worth it for that one shot of all of them on the single tandem bike

i agree overall though late in the film i kept being like where did the execs go felt like they get disappearing without much to do",2023-08-04 00:19:06
definitely worth it to go see  even if its by yourself,2023-08-05 15:20:20
i’m 37 and just saw it alone lol i really enjoyed it,2023-08-05 21:03:52
its not really a kids movie so youll be fine,2023-08-05 12:54:33
no shame in it bud it’s a good movie that’s got some well deserved hype just go and enjoy,2023-08-06 04:53:50
not at all i went alone in a crowded theater and it was a blast,2023-08-05 12:27:44
the new trolls movie maybe not the best idea but i think you’re good to go on barbie bro it’s worth it,2023-08-05 12:41:07
"i 23f was worrying about the same thing this morning and ended up going to see it by myself this afternoon was really fun laughed a bunch and went home thinking i should go to cinema more often

just you alone is kenough,2023-08-08 03:47:17
yep adore the shining and loved that unexpected reference,2023-08-12 18:37:29
i wanted to laugh but ive never been able to sit through more than 10 minutes of that movie way too scary for me so i was more bummed that i was missing out on the joke,2023-08-14 02:28:13
what scene was that,2023-08-20 22:57:16
"just watched it for the first time in 2024 after seeing all the extreme reactions in 2023 i was expecting a total political mess maybe some very biased dialogue etc 

but i cant agree more with your take i thought they handled it very well the fight scenes dance sequences lyrics and little barbie toy moments twist ties on the back of the box the dog  the not needing to walk down the stairs etc all very well done 

its obvious ken still wants barbie even when he has all the patriarchy behind him thats not the power he wanted i think people are choosing to miss the point its very easy to make this movie into whatever you want for ones own political agenda but it really can just be an enjoyable film

also love the king julian energy from will ferrell",2024-01-06 04:50:49
i think it definitely meant that females are here to take all of mens power and be in control of everything,2024-01-07 22:03:29
"and then later he wore 6full watches on both of his wrist

i laugh out loud at that part literally",2023-07-25 04:01:07
i did ,2023-07-25 02:00:23
i think of that scene and it makes me sad,2023-07-25 01:45:19
it’s because it’s not funny it’s actually sad and i felt so bad for him,2023-07-25 01:56:55
"it’s like the filmmakers forgot that there are ways to convey complex ideas in a film without relying on expository monologue directly explaining everything for the audience or they didn’t trust that the audience would understand or catch on to satire unless it was explicitly explained

just watched it last night and this is how i felt overall still thought they brilliantly wove satire and fantasy which is more than anyone couldve expected from a movie about a toy but the monologue brought the narrative to a screeching halt i already felt like america ferraras acting was the weakest part of the movie at some points her delivery sounded like she was just reading the script but then they gave her that longwinded onthenose monologue and it took me out completely

still enjoyed it though and i think margot robbie deserves all the awards its one thing for actors to ham it up in oscarbait movies but margot making me believe she really was a toy having an existential crisis in a comedy was just masterful",2023-12-23 18:47:01
i think they are generic until they become sentient it seems like the “broken” ones are because someone that played with them ruined them in some way when barbie came back and there were a bunch of the discontinued barbies in  barbies house midge was still in regular barbieland but i remember the discontinued barbie’s talking about how many of them were sold idk i’m not explaining it well,2023-07-21 13:36:43
i dont think shes the sole owner i interpreted it as bc she was playing with a stereotypical barbie stereotypical barbie was the one who had to go and find her,2023-07-21 13:59:59
"im pretty certain the idea is that each sold barbie belongs to their own different parallel universebarbie land from the one we see in the movie

theres the whole thing where the execs in the real world talk about how this happened with another doll skipper years ago we also see a skipper in this barbie world but we also know that stereotypical barbie is the first one in this barbie world to experience something like this and is the first one there to go to the real world so if thats the case that had to have been a different skipper presumably from a parallel barbie world different than the one we see",2023-07-22 00:49:57
i had a similar thought,2023-07-21 13:25:42
each barbie and each ken in barbieland is the personification of their particular line of doll,2023-08-09 09:28:10
i loved it but completely agree but is that a bad thing barbies dilemma was far more existential whereas ken just wanted to matter and be noticed his journey was to learn to love himself for himself not in relation to others which is something most people can relate to id think,2023-11-30 20:53:06
i completely agree even the writing and character development for the ken is better than barbie,2023-11-12 06:21:46
i do think that was kind of the pointi read barbieland and the kens as pretty much a straight allegory for unequal treatment of women in the real world kens being treated as vapid eye candy himbos generally lesser than and brushed aside by the barbies is supposed to make you sympathetic toward the people who are being marginalized and treated as secondclass for no real reason clearly it was dialed up to 11 in barbieland relative to real life not saying all women everywhere are always treated like that,2023-12-25 07:00:38

"ken reminded me of many of my male friends in high school having an identity crisis while to figure out how to interact with women when theyve been fed a bunch of hyper masculinity 

sadly i saw some of my friends go down kens path never to return and only end up as bitter avoidant of women and taking their helpless feelings out on those around them 

watching kens identity crisis play out was hard to watch but an important reminder that we are failing adolescent men just as we are adolescent women 

i think this movie may actually spark some positive change in our society it was amazing and i cant wait to rewatch it",2023-07-21 16:09:03
a lot of people can’t differentiate between “men” and “the patriarchy” if anything the movie showed that patriarchy doesn’t serve men either,2023-07-23 02:35:21
yeah i think the “menbad” overcoat was very tongue in cheek the message there clearly being lost on some to me the message was more about how there isn’t really a perfect barbie land regardless of who you are it’s a fantasy,2023-07-21 16:59:19
kens story was pretty much the story of my insecurity in high school and college,2023-07-22 19:02:13
kens existential crisis is not why people would think the movie is antimen it would be for other aspects the portrayal of all men as dumbincompetentaggressiveetc or the resolving of the gender conflict in barbieland by putting women back in power over men would be a couple examples,2023-07-21 22:28:26
"there was not one single relatable normal good man in any of the realities america ferraras husband was as close to it as you can get and he too was a bumbling fool and she clearly was dismissive of him to top it off

all the kens were all perfect and a caricature while the barbies could be regular people with normal jobs

how is it surprising that the take is that all men are bad",2023-07-21 17:20:47
"because the movie concluded by having the barbies turn the kens back into a  class and say they wouldnt stop till the exaggerated patriarchy thing of the outside world was stopped 

it was a surprisingly anti male movie i assumed it was gonna be a fun comedy action about a princess in the modern world like encanto it was not 

the message of the film was clearly that men are wildly sexist and they need to be kept enslaved as accessories or they will oppress women which is a strange message it shows the film has been in development for a while this is more 2017 feminism than more modern feminism they didnt really give ken any sort of fulfilment or development on his life he was just enslaved again",2023-07-21 16:48:46
i dont think the message is so much that men  bad so much as it is that men need to unlearn their toxic beliefs and stop basing their selfworth around having girlfriends it probably could have been articulated better but if the movie came right out and said that men need to learn how to be better equals to women people would call it preachy,2023-07-21 19:28:17
how many times do we as men have to tell you that we men face an extreme amount of demoralisation in the current times literally every movie that comes out of the mainstream now is about men being bad or pushing men to become feminine or submissive i realise toxic masculinity has been a big issue throughout history and that women have had nothing for thousands of years does that mean that men right now deserve to be bullied and demoralised into oblivion that men deserve to be called loser and humiliated by women except if they are the top 20 of men physically in that case they are allowed to be the career womens poolboys that women get to use like a toy literally like in the movie this is what women want to do with men you are everything like the patriarchal selfish men you supposedly hate everything dont you realise that im literally suicidal over this that because of tinder and female hypergamy there is literally no future for me that i have literally never got love from a woman except my own mother this is the reality for a lot of men its not just a misogynistic story that misogynists use to justify that they want to go back to oppressing women its a living reality that a lot of men face,2023-07-21 16:41:18
because thats not the message the movie wants you to see on the surface the movie is just men are trash internet talking point which is  as  everything america ferrera pointed in her motivational rant to barbie is also what every guy feels irl but then again thats not the narrative they want this movie wants to appeal to the fringe and make it a central talking point that causes more divide it wants to portray issues as just being one sided in real life when every person regardless of  goes thru the same thing it actually  me off that the movie turned political so quick and fast without even subtly shooing it it was just in your face twitter comment section made into a movie,2023-07-21 16:24:00
what are young girls on tok saying about it seems like the men here all love it like i did,2023-07-22 02:02:13
i’ve seen too many comments saying that ryan gosling was the mvp of this film as if there wasn’t a full cast of ladies that killed it,2023-07-22 04:20:52
i scrolled through most of the thread its literally a 101 ratio of praise to criticism youre literally just lying,2023-07-23 20:37:41
"youre not your job youre not how much money you have in the bank youre not the car you drive youre not the contents of your wallet youre not your  khakis youre the allsinging alldancing  of the world

you are kenough",2023-07-21 23:12:26
" i think the kens also dont ever get a fulfilling ending 

i dont think it was made for the kens or anyone who would ever root for a ken 

even as a plotpoint they were an afterthought",2023-07-24 19:20:23
they tried to make the kens represent women and the patriarchy and it kind of ruins the point of both also the whole thing about kens needing to discover themselves is really a feminist idea come to life that after patriarchy is “defeated” men will be able to cry and find themselves etc  it’s something which fell flat in the movie because really only feminists pretend men actually care about this it’s a feminist idea of how “patriachy hurts men too” and why they’re also helping men with feminism regardless of what men think about it so that was why that was there it would be confusing to most men that that was supposed to be a happy ending for the kens but that’s how a feminist would view it,2023-07-24 14:31:22
i mean that’s kinda on the parents the movie isn’t for kids it’s pg13 and wasn’t marketed to kids either,2023-08-05 11:35:09
"i think the movie did exactly what it intended to here then i thankfully saw it with no children but the adults in their 30’s i was with had a great time 

i think there will be definitely kids that this movie really grabs but 56 year olds may be a little young for this one not to mean it’s too inappropriate i have no good idea about this sort of thing but there aren’t a lot of conversations or jokes for kids that young the movie wasn’t intended for that",2023-08-05 12:44:29
yeah i wouldnt bring children younger than 13 to watch it a lot of the movie would likely go over their head theyd probably have more fun watching something else,2023-08-06 18:25:58
probably because the ending was dragged out for too long i was drawn in for most of the movie but the ending made me wish i took my adhd meds for the movie i was ready for it to be over i couldnt imagine kids having the attention span for the ending,2023-08-05 18:28:50
it’s true my nieces 7 11 were so excited about going and they said they enjoyed it but i could see they were a little confused my little niece kept asking “what why are you laughing”,2023-08-05 10:38:15
well why did their parents bring their kid to a film that was obviously not made for kids it’s not frozen,2023-08-05 15:56:27
parents should watch the trailer for a movie before they take their kids i guess,2023-08-06 13:39:12
yea i wasnt sure if this was a film i wanted my kid to see but it was a film that i think she needed to see,2023-08-06 18:00:10
what was the deal with allan  was he supposed to be a beta male,2023-09-08 14:41:28

ohh then she woke probably love don’t look up,2023-12-27 23:38:25
i feel like farrell and the board did a stealthy 180 in characterization about half way through the movie,2023-07-22 00:33:14
imo will ferrell was miscast his performance was funny enough although seemed like he basically phoned it in but didnt gel with the vibe of rest of the movie it almost felt like his scenes were from a completely different movie,2023-07-22 01:08:40
i definitely didnt think any of those jokes were worth getting upset about btw they were funny and an honest portrayal of lots of dudes i know,2023-07-23 00:10:35
" after being able to beautifully show without telling

to be fair i dont think the film almost ever does this there are certain moments of subtly like barbie meeting ruth in the mattel office as you mentioned which was a beautiful almost otherwordly scene like barbie stepped into a different dimension but for the most part the film is extremely heavyhanded with what its saying from start to finish",2023-08-03 15:36:31
 like that really got on my nerves we get it the writers think they are smart,2023-07-22 00:26:34

it literally makes it out that a society created and ruled by women would be horrible

barbie world wasnt supposed to be a perfect world or one that the director wants its essentially supposed to be the opposite of ours hence the now you have as much power as women in the real world or however it was phrased line

the director would likely agree with you that barbie world is horrible",2024-02-18 20:37:11

the movies beginning and end both paid tribute to 2001 a space odyssey  symmetrical filmmaking,2023-07-23 20:55:08
i absolutely loved that moment anything that shows male affection among other men makes me feel happy and comforted since you dont often see it and i like how it breaks the mold of that stereotypical stoic exterior that men feel like they have to put up,2023-07-27 15:38:59
yeah there’s quite a bit of that scene where it looks like ryan is trying not to laugh and it’s beautiful,2023-07-27 12:17:24
a bit sus,2023-07-27 12:19:19
i think you’re supposed to sympathize with ken everything he does is the result of his entire existence being an extension of barbie barbie herself makes a point of this to not even be angry with ken because it’s partly her fault that all ken’s need more in their lives than simply seeking barbie’s approval,2024-01-02 19:25:01
"i felt like the mother daughter relationship was pretty rushed and everything just happens really fast and conveniently i really liked the way the director intended to convey her politics though also i didnt get micheal ceras character allans just there at the end hes not being acknowledged even then i think its a good film to make men who are willing to understand things from womens perspective understand how being ununderrepresented feel why does barbara visit the gynaec at the end i get that its a personal choice but is having a  what defines a woman what about transwomen then is that affirmation required

basically

1 motherdaughter relationship didnt work for me felt artificial and i think they couldve used a more capable actress
2 allans arc
3 the ending im just confused about the ending

and yes how ken managed to brainwash all the barbies isnt also touched upon were just made to assume whatever they were doing there was fragile enough to be disrupted by a ken who got into patriarchy for the horses",2023-12-20 01:52:07

i got giddy when i saw connor swindells,2023-07-22 00:45:25
"i think with the antimen stuff it feels like it almost hits the mark of making a salient point but misses and then goes nowhere same with most of the messages in the film for instance ken lives a life of existing just to get barbies attention hes finally shown some respect in the real world and immediately goes 100 the other way when he tries to find a job and gets rejected i thought that was making a point that men arent just handed things by virtue of being men but then it was undermined by him being able to turn barbieland into a patriarchy and learning nothing from the rejection then again i thought they were going to make an interesting point with the barbie preferring kenworld because its like a spa day for her brain then immediately undermined that with them all just being brainwashed and ken being stressed from being a ruler was just a side joke 

there was also a weird point where the barbies purposely manipulated the kens into violence which almost seems like its suggesting women are secretly behind war and conflict between men and then it just turned into it all just being a distraction for the dumb kens so they could keep barbieland the same then the unified kens instead of convincing the barbies to be more equal just fell apart with ken crying 

that also brings me to another point mens mental health is not treated very well in this film barbie has a really powerful scene of crying and feeling true emotion but then kens showing emotion is played for laughs and mocked as fragility

i found the movie had a lot of mixed messages not just with gender but with things like capitalism too where it takes an anticapitalist stance whilst still being one big glorified advert for barbie like it mocks it but leans into it at the same time 

the film then sort of goes on to talk about how women are hypercriticised and theres no correct way to do feminism it just means having the opportunity to do what you want to do but then kind of criticises men and paints the correct way for them to be it even paints a picture of the correct form of masculinity being a placid goofball butt of the joke unless having to fight toxic masculinity and is just bullied for trying to learn another language or wanting to be happy 

there was quite a mean spirited undertone to the film and it felt like it contradicted itself a lot when it makes men the butt of the joke for just living their life like alan and the duolingo husband did but then turns them into villains for having autonomy

sure maybe the purpose is to turn the tables show men how it feels to be constantly scrutinised but then is that sort of nuance suitable for a movie about a childs toy like surely people will just come away from the film with an eye for an eye type attitude instead of realising two wrongs dont make a right i think the duolingo dad in particular left a bitter taste in my mouth like he did nothing wrong and got bulliedmocked for no reason",2023-07-29 21:39:04
"at the end barbie basically womansplains to ken how to find himself and educated him while he cries about how much he loves her and that’s a happy ending reverse the sexes and it’s highly offensive and no women would call it a happy ending

the anti men part comes from making every man in the movie an idiot even little moments like where gloria and her kid see her husband  he is a  who his wife and daughter role their eyes at i think gerwig revealed she has a bit more contempt for men than she cares to admit here

and in spite of barbie land supposedly being a reverso of the real world for gender  it’s not a 1 for 1 in the real world women are portrayed sympathetically and as intelligent the kens are portrayed as morons who don’t even want to be in charge they’re just insecure so the oppressed kens standing up to the barbies are supposedly the equivalent of real world women yet are all incompetent morons who you’re supposed to root against as the barbies take back over and on top of that they were idiots anyway so it’s clearly showing they didn’t even deserve any high position 

the movie is anti men and merely saying it’s satire can’t excuse that",2023-07-29 18:46:24
"barbieland is a matriarchy but the kens are not objectified nor pushed into servitude — they just coexist with the barbies but are still accessories to the barbies with no real agency or identity of their own when barbie comes back and teams up with the other barbies to correct the patriarchy she implores ken to find meaning as ken not just as an accessory to barbie she acknowledges the matriarchy wasn’t fair either she wants him to live out his own purpose to have agency — even after everything he did ken isn’t evil and the barbies aren’t manhaters but the kens fell victim to patriarchy too as men  
  
  
  
the very last scene is made to be like typical close out scenes — aspirational and gearing you up for a real feel good endingbarbie chose to live in the real world despite a guaranteed troubled existence she chose to “have ideas” and make a difference rather than continue living life as an object many women have this radicalizing moment themselves in their own lives — dare i say when we get “woke” to patriarchy and the   glass ceilingshe becomes the ordinary woman heading to her gynecologist appointment — a completely mundane activityshe’s just a woman and that is just fine

i think once the hype and fun of going first dies down many people who enjoyed the movie those who didn’t won’t change are going to realise it’s not actually that great it just looks great and they wanted it to be,2023-08-08 04:04:25
i have only seen it once but it was well after opening week and i have not been in a cinema that full in years legitimately had to buy tickets in advance to get seats its also the first time in my life ive seen a movie where the audience clapped at the end  so weird  there was a lot of laughter and a lot of commentary from the crowd very much felt like a community event i do think that if you expect certain parts it wont hit the same though like the beach off and i know a lot of people are seeing it multiple times i intend to see it again myself the second time ill be watching for things that have been brought to my attention since apparently there was a barbie with a prosthetic limb did not notice so i probably wont be laughing as hard so to me thats the most likely answer,2023-08-09 07:02:36
"i think the only thing i would change here is that she says that she cant in good conscience let her do this without knowing what it entails so i was kind of hoping that they would have at least a couple of sadder aspects like the vague grief of a loved one maybe lying in a hospital bed or something of that nature sandwiched in the middle of the good not to bring the entire tone down but rather to try to convey that life is complex and that experiencing the whole spectrum of emotions is what makes someone human and that you have to have bad to appreciate the good

"this

if the film was antimen it wouldnt have highlighted kens dissatisfaction at being just a sidepiece in barbies world

the ending for the kens  i think has levels of irony too nuanced for some viewers and i dont mean to be a snob about it ive just taught english for a few years and have come to realize at least a third of people dont understand anything that isnt explicitly said for them in their art the ending vouches for the kens having a slow argualbly superficial path to equality rather than instant justice which some audience members dont get because the ken portion of the film doesnt have a happy ending in a movie where most everything else is dressed up as traditional comedy

i get a person seeing that ending and thinking the film is agreeing with what happens to the kens but its not  rather its saying this is how life actually works a lot of the time sucks dont it",2023-07-26 14:56:28
"it’s intentionally oversimplified because those who call it “antiman” are pandering they peddle their outrage bait to the fragile crowd incapable of analyzing art with any nuance or even outside of “it’s woke” or “not woke”

so of course they don’t get the points of movies like this because asking them to think critically of themselves or even slightly inconvenience themselves for the sake of positive change is too much work for them so they reduce it call progressive thought “woke” and say it’s the rest of us who are the problem

kinda with you on the ending montage i think maybe was hurt by the order of the clips and selection to some extent—ie without the first shot being a mother and daughter i think the message wouldn’t have gotten confused on second viewing i think the clips of the little girls weren’t showing motherhood per se but girlhood and womanhood in all its forms",2023-08-07 22:26:32
"my daughter and her friends are genz in college and their take on the ending is that its a message about fighting the system  the kens tried to change the constitution but were too busy fighting each other  and we need to change the constitution so that women have equal rights under the law

women currently dont have equal rights which is why its perfectly legal to prevent women from having abortions even when they are medically necessary

women currently dont have equal rights which is why gynecologists are under attack by the us govt especially in certain states

dr caitlin bernard was punished by a govt appointed agency for speaking to the press about the effects of new abortion laws particularly on victims of child   if the govt and patriarchy bully our doctors into silence how can voters know the effects of their new laws and vote in their best interests

whats stopping us from having the era equal rights amendment that would grant women equal rights  maybe we are distracted like the kens are  rich men are trying to distract us by saying we should be afraid of mexicans crossing the border or afraid of sharia law or afraid of democrats grooming their children  women are currently divided and fighting each other  shades of ken beachoff

"i thought the message was really clear men rule the world for the most part via the patriarchy helpfully pointed out several times as the patriarchy by characters in the movie it was the opposite in barbieland 

which part was unclear to you which side plots didnt make sense",2023-09-14 15:37:51
the movie does a lot for masculinity too if men subdue their egos a bit to see the value in the message  sleeping with barbie isn’t what will make ken valuable  he is kenough as he is,2023-07-22 13:42:14
couldn’t have said it better i was expecting lighthearted laughs and i got plenty of those but was not expecting to be so emotionally floored in some scenes with the immense relatability and humanity of a movie about plastic dolls i never played with gerwig’s voice as a writer and creative vision as a filmmaker are so impeccable she just knows exactly how to captivate and speak to people with her work what a delight this film was,2023-07-21 02:54:57
you write the best reviews my guy,2023-07-23 10:11:07
" the thematic implications of this movie are insane and it doesnt feel like theyre brought up and brushed aside but rather that gerwig is using the beautiful artifice of barbie to really dig into them

yeah they really dug into the way barbie encourages consumerism unrealistic beauty standards the predatory nature of the corporate board what caused the mothers onset of depression and how it got resolved

oh wait it actually just briefly skirted on these themes and then sort of brushed them aside for a musical number and made its primary focus for the third act patriarchy which even then it almost undermines with a line at the end

entertaining sure  thematically it was frustratingly shallow and structurally it was all over the place",2023-07-28 14:13:47

i think barbie liked being able to have complex emotions and once she experienced the real world and realized women arent powerful just because of playing with barbie she couldnt go back to barbieworld and just pretend everything is fine she malfunctioned and couldnt undo everything she learned about women,2023-07-27 03:06:07
"barbie realized that she basically had no sense of self she was literally stereotypical barbie aside from being an icon of beauty she was a completely flat person simply an idea of the ideal woman physically beyond that she literally had nothing and having been changed by the real world she couldnt go back to simply being stereotypical barbie

by choosing to become a human she gave herself the ability to grow into her own person she was no longer simply the idea of stereotypical barbie she was now her own person she even adjusted her name to barbara to show this change",2023-07-27 04:46:06
i think it was shocking to everyone because it was stereotypical barbies feet shes supposed to embody unrealistic beauty standards i think lol,2023-09-20 18:20:54

“they started it” is so valid honestly it’s always don’t fight fire with fire but no one tells the antagonist to stop burning things smh,2023-09-07 00:09:03
"thats the point  its highlighted at the end when she says its barbie and ken  thats one of lessons barbie learns in the end that a lot of this was her fault and she wasnt being fair  they then poke fun at reality when the kens ask for a seat on the supreme court and they say they can have a seat in the lesser court

barbieland is an extreme matriarchy where the kens exist only as an accessory to barbie  in the end they make incremental movement toward a fairer world but its largely superficial  the feminism point here is a lot of the changes over the last few decades have been superficial and there is still a lot of work to do to have an equal world",2023-09-01 15:25:36
"barbieland is a fantasy land and none of the real people ask to stay there at the end they all go home happily most of the allens eg nsync escaped years ago and the one barbie who saw the real world decides to become a real person instead of a thing in a fake fantasy land so no barbieland is not actually sold as better than reality in this film the narrator admits she lets the barbies think their reality is perfect that doesnt mean it is perfect its a fun place for girls to visit not stay

a lot of it is silly remember they are dolls the houses have no walls the construction workers were pushing invisible dirt they dont drink or eat there is no real water in barbieland all the plants are plastic pregnant midge just stands in the corner outside all day at skippers tree house when ken took over the mountains were carved into horse heads in a single day wherever the kens stay at night they are not physically suffering 

that the kens have nothing is both horrible but also a joke based on the reality of the barbie toy brand ken was never the big seller the best selling ken ever is that magic earring ken that was only on the market for 6 months ken wasnt worth developing a lot of accessories for im almost certain little girls are more likely to have two barbies than a barbie and ken this is no different than my little brother had action figures and almost no girls existed in his role play unless i joined him and created girl transformers or whatever my brother didnt care at all about girl characters or roll playing their story many little girls are the same but it is the boy toys they dont care about

if little girls did have a ken then maybe the little girl pretended barbie and ken were married but maybe they dated in the little girls fantasy where did boyfriend ken live when barbie went to her dreamhouse at night possibly no where a little girl is not going to beg her parents for a ken house ken can live in the lincoln logs or in a shoe barbie might go on adventures and ken would be left out she might playact a date with ken and then toss him aside so barbie could go to work or have a party or time travel to visit the stuffed dinosaurs maybe a little girl had her barbie  ken and bury him in the backyard there are many things for the little girl to do but barbie is the feature and ken is simply an accessory to her story like the pink car or the pooping dog 

the creators of this film were aware of the tragic essence of ken ryan gosling tells a story when he was first asked to play ken that he went outside and saw his own kids ken doll face down in the dirt and he then understood kens story it is a sad reality for the poor ken doll he might come in different forms but he really is an afterthought of the barbie universe so the ken arc in the film was an effort to be authentic to the toy and how ken was used by the girls who played with them hes a girls toy with a  crazy villain arch that i could absolutely see a little girl creating with a little girls understanding of patriarchy and feminism these concepts matter but this is a deliberately silly movie that doesnt take them too seriously at the end ruth points out that these are made up concepts by people trying to deal with the confusion and complexity of life  

there is a good message in the movie for ken to work on himself and understand his own needs and value ken learned to not define himself through a relationship with someone who doesnt meet his needs and the movie does make it clear that barbie was a bad girlfriend who did not value him that is a solid character arc for an accessory character 

so yeah tldr 1 no barbieland is not actually presented as better than the real world 2 kens story is true to his toy essencebarbie zeitgeist it isnt about real men or an attack on all men 3 yes kens are ridiculously second class in barbieland and the creators are aware of that they even lampshade it at the end with one of the comments by president barbie  

edit spelling and rearranged the paragraphs to make more sense",2023-08-31 06:23:13
"the movie explicitly says the kens will have the same rights as women in the real world so im pretty sure this is the takeaway you are supposed to have like thats the joke that things still arent really fair for the kens at the end of the movie

the only thing that they do to contribute to the barbies is just stand aside and look nice  so yeah sort of like what women for the last few millennia have been expected to do the comparison is definitely intentional

edited to clarify a sentence",2023-09-01 15:34:38
thats literally the exact point of the movie dude,2023-09-03 04:03:07
"im going to try to explain this with the nuance there is but im not sure if im going to do a good job

none of the barbies personally treated kens badly they were each personally nice to them let them live their lives have their personal freedoms they just didnt center them in their lives and preferred to be around each other the kens could have gotten together to have boys nights and support each other the way the barbies did they chose not to

while not being a priority to someone you love does really hurt and it hurt ken that he wasnt really on barbies priority list shes not required to center him in her world if she doesnt feel that way and its still not treating him poorly you can force someone to want to be with you when they dont want to in real life you talk about it andor walk away  this is one place where the main barbie did hurt her ken personally because she knew how he felt about her yet she continued to hurt him

where the kens were treated poorly on a mass level was this they had no political power and the barbies were neglectful of their political and person situations like not having homes because they just didnt think about it or care since their lives were centered and great but it was not done maliciously 

kens didnt have houses because these are girls toys and little girls care about the barbies and not kens so there are no kens dream house they were never created all the houses you see in the movie are actual dream homes that were sold why would girls toys center men this is in line with the toys themselves and how girls will play with their owns toys however if you want to make a point about kens not being treated fairly in the movie just for discussion sake the barbies neglect of this situation is sad

when the barbies realized the kens werent equal in the end they actually cared apologized and wanted to prevent things from going back to how things were before they didnt whine and fight it and scream that they were the real victims kens deserved it or things were already equal the point about kens not getting political power was a very on the nose commentary about our real life society

the kens treated the barbies way worse when they stole power they brainwashed the barbies maliciously took away their power and reduced them to sexualized slaves in skimpy outfits feeding them beer that is vile this is what i was referring to when i mentioned the barbies let kens have their personal freedoms they didnt reduce kens to  objects and make them serve them like this kens were free to do and wear what they wanted barbies didnt require kens to follow them around and do their bidding and wait on them they let them live their lives and hung out with them when they wanted to because they were friends the kens never apologized for treating the barbies so horribly in the end

now lets contrast that with women in the real world men treat women horrifically in the real world women are  murdered beaten trafficked dehumanized treated like slaves etc by men no it is not both sides or even close to being equal women are kept out of positions of power even though some have broken through on lower levels womens rights are being erased and so many men are gleeful about it when women get angry and try to change things men in general have fits they dont want to hear it they will scream to deny it and will actively do things to harm women politically and personally just to rub it in more  real women arent treated as well as the kens or even have the personal freedom kens had

does that help",2023-09-04 17:42:54
himself alan,2023-07-21 22:24:23
the guy whos smart enough to see the toxicity in the behaviour of kens hes standing there with a judgmental look in his face during that initial gosling ken and simu ken faceoff later when kens take over with their version of patriarchy he decides that kendom is not a place where he wants to be and leaves with gloria and sasha when they decide to return he goes with them to try and bring the barbieland back i dont think hes necessarily  though he might be in the barbielore allan is married to midge and is the father of her baby not sure if this is also true in the movie  leaving his pregnant wife behind wouldnt be a good look,2023-07-22 01:19:31
to me he was the men who dont fit inside traditional masculinity and therefore have no real use for the patriarchy it was also interesting that all of the  coded kens immediately sided with the barbies,2023-07-22 12:01:26
i was also soooo confused i guess he represented a feminist guy which if so is so disappointing they made him whiny and weak and he was the only one out there fighting with the barbies i wish he was beta but also cute and charming,2023-07-21 22:29:00

for me it’s like a coming of age movie but the for sexes of all ages instead of just teenage years

hiw do you think this movie will stand the trial of time will it reach a cult status like rocky horror show",2023-07-28 00:54:58
i completely agree with everything you wrote well said,2023-07-27 20:05:15
" to show that people will never be satisfied and look for reasons to be offended by anything

this was absolutely not the point of the fascist line and tbh thats a really dumb and lazy take thats one of the most important criticisms of barbie that she is a symbol of consumerism capitalism and corporate america and she reinforces ultraorthodox  beauty standards politically these are intertwined with conservativism and white supremacy

without these criticisms there would be no reason for this film to be so hyper selfaware and sociopolitically critical at all this movie literally could not be made without the criticisms of the cultural hegemony that barbie represents

so for you to say its just to show people will get upset about anything is hilariously off base",2023-07-28 04:53:43
the movie you just described didn’t sound like fun though it sounded depressing af,2023-07-27 18:38:37
the movie is so depressing to me it’s promoting men and women should stay away from each other and not be together it shouldn’t be like that you can have your own separate identity and still be with someone,2023-07-27 18:47:36
"so technically toxic masculinity kinda already existed in barbieland since the kens were meant to just chase after barbies… 

that’s why there is so much discussion about this film  some people think everything is satire and representative of something else ken learns to overcome two versions of male expectations meanwhile others take it for it’s literal connotations all male characters are dumb the film actively doesn’t like men … who is right who is wrong maybe both are right in their interpretations ",2023-07-28 05:31:27
as the movie repeatedly says “don’t think too hard about it” the movie works better with mattel being cartoonish because that way they know barbieland exists and you don’t have to waste time with everyone going “ barbie’s are real” it was a smart decision to keep the plot moving,2023-07-21 16:47:37

i felt like it was a commentary about how people at super high levels of power and wealth live in their own fantasy world,2023-07-23 04:42:37
yeah i really liked how it was really fair to both men and women most movies in today’s climate are purely focused on women’s struggles and this one was definitely heavier on those but i really appreciated the time spent showing that men are also emotional and trying to find themselves,2023-07-22 12:26:49

i agree the speech made me role my eyes there were some funny parts but its a 6510 for me,2023-07-24 16:33:11
"  i wasnt convinced why barbie needed to leave the restored barbieland and live in the realworld

 i think it shows that even an ordinary person is allowed to want more

 her leaving gives both barbie and ken to room to grow

 it gives an opportunity to show that the humans are now happier in the outside world theyre even interacting with their ken",2023-07-24 19:12:18
captured my thoughts as well really fun movie with some great though a bit muddled messaging a bit unnecessarily hamfisted at certain points with the dialogue and i found the ending a little bizarre with that said i had a great time and the movie was enjoyable from start to finish,2023-07-24 17:01:53
i think there is absolutely a chance the academy wouldnt turn that down,2023-07-26 00:36:47
to feminist women it probably seemed like a happy ending the patriachy is gone but ken gets to cry and find himself or something and somehow that’s equality,2023-07-28 03:23:37
a lil too on the nose for a movie that had managed to be mostly subtle up until the america ferrera speech,2023-07-29 06:41:33

"criticizing consumerism is the best way to sell product in 2023 the movie is a fantastic piece of marketing but it’s just that marketing 

it is really hard for me to reconcile the messages surrounding feminism everyone claims the movie is so great at when they really do nothing to upend the fascism of barbie other than turn stereotypical barbie into a real person and seemingly one who’s goal is to be a mother  and create “ordinary barbie”",2023-07-28 04:47:39
knowing mattel’s stock trends the irony is palpable when you watch it,2023-07-28 02:54:06
"honestly one of the best gags in the movie but its a subtle dig like in reality women got the vote and what 60 years later get their first sc judge 

so in barbieland the recovering matriacrchy of course it makes sense that the kens need to wait a bit too equality doesnt happen over night thats what they tell us about everything right 

but is the point that yes equality takes time or doesnt this seem dumb and cant we just get to equality now 

i think its the latter  meaning the whole point of this bit is that we need more sc judge representation of diversity of gender and id add some more stuff",2023-07-31 12:39:55
"why am i upset at the line 

in the real world women dont have equality and were correctly obviously told over and over this is a bad thing

so to say kens will get the same equality as women in the real world theyre saying kens will never get quality they will be as mistreated as we saw barbie be when she got to the real world 

why not end on equality in barbieland they showed us sexist societies the whole movie and missed the chance to show what the alternative looks like 

am i supposed to be happy the kans will always be oppressed why why would that sit right with anyone 

it presents the world as one big gender war where only 1 can be on top vs equality and teamwork for all",2023-07-31 11:28:28
i wouldn’t say i’m upset by the joke but i think as someone else points out it paints “equality” as a zero sum game with one gender always on top instead of things actually being equal but i also think this movie wasn’t really trying to push the whole “topple the patriarchy” angle that some seem to think it was trying to convey other than a few meta jokes that wasn’t really the message,2023-07-31 02:04:31
when the audience groaned loudly was this a good or bad thing american here havent been overseas yet dont know if groaning is a good or bad thing from an audience,2023-08-02 23:27:48
strange they didnt dub that line because it would have gotten a laugh with another country name in sweden and your point wouldnt mean anything lol,2023-08-05 04:05:40
"i find the criticisms about ken odd because i enjoyed the movie a lot but found his character by far the most sympathetic even if not the most likeable in fact the film was imo at its most interesting when it shifted to show how he had to find an identity besides being barbies boyfriend

barbie was made to be every possibility but ended up wanting to just be human and choose for herself she was born special and amazing but wanted a normal life

ken was made to be simply an accessory and ended up learning that he could be his own person with his own identity he was born disposable and just wanted to be special to someone and in the end it had to be to himself

ken getting the girl would have undermined that for him as much as her",2023-11-30 20:49:19
i think most of the controversy is from the fact that it is very clearly a feminist film its essentially the people who complain that star trek suddenly got political without having a look at the role star trek or barbie have had since their conceptions people who think that movies they dont agree with are political while movies they agree with are not,2023-11-28 22:40:08
she went from being a plastic doll to having a real  she can feel and be real,2024-02-03 03:03:40
on your last point i think it was simply meant to be a funny way to embrace the reality of it if shes becoming a real woman theres gonna be stuff like that and this is one of those things they could reference that isnt about men,2024-02-19 13:57:40
"and margot robbie barbie would not love or care about ken ryan gosling  no matter how hard he tries

this is true ken was trying to win her over with thoughts and deeds but thats just not the way it works if you dont love or care about someone theres nothing that can change your mind",2024-02-01 11:03:42
"to be fair one of stereotypical barbies last acts before leaving barbieland was to amend the constitution to give kens and barbies equal rights under the constitution so they were secondclass citizens but in this fictional universe the opposite gender group acted quickly to right that historic wrong once they realized it  


that is not a minor detail if you understand the feminist struggle in the united states and specifically the fact that the equal rights amendment was just fully ratified by a sufficient number of states in 2020 and still has not been codified into law",2024-03-03 23:28:32
this is sooo true and while i really enjoyed this movie the line at the end where the narrator says “the kens will have just as much power as women in the real world” really just triggered something inside of me lol,2024-01-30 12:09:02
this is the comment that speaks best to my mind out of all these commentsthis movie tries to pretend that it’s a friendly empowering movie that tries to break woman stereotypes as well as fighting for equal rights but it just makes men look like assholes they didn’t specify that those ken’s were supposed to be alpha male stereotypes just male stereotypes i felt so guilty watching this movie because it feels like it was attacking men personally it’s constantly using the word “patriarchy” to describe how women are treated in the real world but never use the word “matriarchy” because they don’t wanna put a negative connotation on women being in power they really compared the way the kens treated barbie’s to the way men treat women in the real world come on now,2024-02-10 06:17:58

more than just her being a real woman its a depiction of women just existing its all moments where women arent having to perform womanhood where they have to face all of the stress and scrutiny that gloria describes in her monologue about all the contradictions of doing things right when youre a woman i saw is as barbie soaking in the moments of just getting to exist freely as a human being and embracing that,2023-07-23 05:42:56

"where did the pent up aggression start

the daughter is going through puberty momsdaughters watching the movie generally would get the shorthand and wouldnt need it to be elaborated on puberty is tough on mom and daughter dynamics as well as any gendered teen because daughters are trying to be independent of their parents and may not have the same values as their parents they grow apart because of this

right plus the barbies learn at the end of the movie that they shouldn’t have taken kens for granted and allowed them to be more apart of the world it was about unity and being equals the tongue in cheek joke about kens not having a seat on a senate was more of a criticism of this world when women have seats on the senate ken can have it as well and in movie…idk if i’d just give a seat on senate to a bunch of people who literally just got over brainwashing me and my friends lol,2023-07-22 15:04:38

this doesnt ring true to me as something men actually struggle with and its not all kumbayya holding hands around the campfire among women  plenty of competition and lack of validation to be found amongst us ever opened up social media the problem is that the movie tries to use ken as an analog for both the male and female experiences and it only creates confusion",2023-07-22 20:44:53
"and he’s like why’d she go to gynac then and i had to explain to this adult man that women go to the gynac all the time and not just when they’re pregnant 

i remember barbie telling those work men that she didnt have a  so maybe she was going to the gynecologist because of that",2023-08-12 20:04:03
" it never really explains why the patriarchy is bad

if you need that explained then discussing it with you is a lost cause ",2023-11-20 15:07:16
they kind of did when they are back in barbie land and all the kens have taken over and the barbie’s all become super submissive to the kens … i love when ken is like “beer me “ ,2023-10-23 22:00:34
yes society was built around a lot of evil patriarchy  which of course allows for oppression and violence towards women racism classism all these are things a lot of societies are built on america britain india china etc,2023-11-11 03:36:40
surely you dont need an explanation for why a power system that excludes one  and favors another is bad,2023-10-25 04:06:58
"i can point out a bunch stuff that couldve used improvement like the motherdaughter characters didnt feel very fleshed out and the mattel guys kinda lost significance about 20 minutes after their introduction and film feels stuffed with messages it wants to convey

but there are the things i absolutely loved like set design the direction cinematography the tender emotionally rich moments id expect from a greta gerwig film and margot robbie and ryan goslings performances were perfection

i wouldnt say it exceeded my expectations but it did meet them",2023-07-23 16:33:14
"inventive great production design but weirdly the thought that nagged me throughout the movie was how  cool it would have been if this came out 1015 years ago i feel like it would have been transgressive irreverent and so ahead of its time obviously lol when barbie was still i think a little more culturally relevant 

but in 2023 it seems weirdly outdated i felt like it was diet feminism in a way i agree with it being on the nose at least for the target adult audience who are probably already largely feminists like i think this movie would be great for preteen and early adolescent boys and girls but i counted mostly full grown adults in the audience",2023-07-21 17:50:29
"i felt the same i liked it but didn’t love it i enjoyed the campiness and how over the top ridiculous it got all of the actors killed it and the whole aesthetic of the movie was great

some random thoughts

 as mentioned some of the dialogue was too on the nose one of my pet peeves is when it feels like characters are explaining everything

 the mattel hq and higher ups felt like they fit more in barbieland than la 

 didn’t like how easily barbie was able to convince the motherdaughter who she was i would’ve had them skeptical until they actually see barbieland with their own eyes

 the daughter went from  to accepting everything really quick felt like there should’ve been more time in barbieland where the motherdaughter connect

 michael cera beating up all those construction workers made me laugh will ferrell just being will ferrell was funny too

 the music and dance numbers were great

i think it’s a 710 for me",2023-07-22 01:26:48
i was looking for this one…i thought it was a solid 710 film but i was just expecting more ryan gosling and margot robbie absolutely killed it and i loved a lot of parts of it but ultimately i think there were big pacing issues and some of the more heartfelt moments felt really forced and tacky also just feel like the mother and daughter characters were also just whatever and the weakest parts of the film especially the daughter who goes from a pos to just ok,2023-07-21 07:32:08
"same here gf and i walked into the theater with high expectations walked out confused and more than a little disappointed 

everything was great until ken went back to barbieland and somehow brainwashed all the barbies and turned the entire place upside down all by himself that made no sense and the movie pretty much fell apart for us after that 

the message was fine and absolutely expected but the way the second half was set up and resolved with the barbies being deprogrammed and manipulating the kens into fighting themselves felt really forced and left us both with a bad taste in our mouths it was so on the nose that it ended up not being very fun or satisfying for us at all also the mattel exec and motherdaughter storylines went nowhere

i guess were in the minority in this thread but i have a feeling a lot of people our age gen z are going to leave the theaters with a similar feeling of disappointment

margot and ryan absolutely killed it though",2023-07-21 05:48:57
"i think its gonna hit hard for some people more than others for me the journey barbie goes through emotionally was near identical to how it felt for me to become a woman and seeing that reflected in the ultimate girlhood symb barbie was a very emotional and beautiful experience for me full of lots of depth and nuance

that isnt to say that youre wrong just to say that isnt it incredible the exact same movie can be experienced so differently just speaks to the high strangeness of art",2023-07-21 05:31:43
"i am right there with you for the most part i had higher expectations that the movie would have a more meaningful and and well told message as well especially since i felt that ken stole a bit too much of the spotlight from barbie i also felt that ken had a more impactful emotional climax than barbie and while i thought it was enjoyable i felt it a bit counterproductive for the overall messaging of the movie 

my biggest issue with the movie is the product placement and the humor trying to be a bit too purposefully funny or camp 

in my theater about half the jokes fell flat and it was primarily jokes that had the penguin of doom lol so random style of humor that got the least laughs to me it feels like those jokes were written a few years ago and now that type of humor just isnt as funny i mean i can dig the impressive sets and goofy antics but it started to feel forced and off pace during the chase through the mattel building someone let out a big sigh because it was more boring than funny or interesting 

in terms of the ads the chevy car chase scene was way too distracting and honestly felt really forced the whole corporate plotline was forced and flimsy imo at least the birkenstocks and the barbie ad were funny but i felt it was still a little too obvious and distracted from the movie itself",2023-07-21 06:25:37
"it’s definitely not the masterpiece everyone’s making it up to be 

it’s a fun summer film that relies 1000 on its campness",2023-07-21 02:45:17
"i agree with you i liked the film but i think as a feminist film the message was too on the nose and lacked subtlety it was a bummer greta gerwig chose such a blackandwhite approach to the issue with no depth maybe its because its her first big budget film and she needed to simplified the story for a broad appeal but considering how good the scripts were for her previous two films i think she could have done better

anyway its was refreshing to see a big budget film like this went full bonkers and took a risk in storytelling that alone makes this film worth watching",2023-07-21 02:58:18
"i really do not understand why they focused so much on ken and his feelings 

like it felt like this was a movie about making sure a mans ego was okay and not about barbie finding her new place in the world

like ryan gosling had like 5 solo songs and like a 30 minute sequence all just about ken 

and like initially i got it haha patriarchy ruined barbieland great bit

but it just kept going and then barbie had to console and comfort ken

also alan did nothing

this movie started so fun and then got super incoherent",2023-07-22 05:01:57
"crazy how i long i had to scroll to find this i definitely agree everyone wanted barbie to be a masterpiece me included i had very high hoped before the reviews came out less so afterwards but i was a little let down even still its not a bad movie by any regard and has plenty of funny jokes and a gorgeous aesthetic as well as great performances from robbie and gosling but as for the script it felt really messy at times with satire as sharp as a sledgehammer and clumsy monologues 

i feel like this proves the assumption wrong that a great filmmaker is enough to make something great out of pure corporate ip the movie is too closely tied to protecting barbies brand it never has anything interesting to say about it at least in depth all the attempts to go deeper and explore the themes of the movie felt surfacelevel and like they were approved in some boardroom beforehand like the one at matter hq",2023-07-21 09:40:13
i really didnt like it unfunny thematically incoherent completely compromised by mattels involvement im rather baffled that gerwig who wrote such a great motherdaughter relationship in ladybird wrote such a terrible one in barbie,2023-07-21 04:22:27
it’s the cobra kai of movies,2023-07-22 07:04:12
totally agree i just could not connect with this movie some of the dialogue was way too on the nose for me and i found myself eye rolling at the big monologuefeel like ive heard a version of that many times before dont get me wrong some of the jokes were great and the cast and set were fantastic it just felt like a long lecture in parts which for me didnt fit right,2023-07-25 22:45:54
the message is incredibly relevant but it was delivered with all the subtly of a slap in the face in particular that monologue from the mother from the real world,2023-07-21 22:48:43
yeah the message is pretty basic though imo wellexecuted but i was talking to my mom after walking out and the big disconnect was in how funny we respectively thought it was so i think thats gonna be a point of contention in how people view it i think its first and foremost structured as a comedy and for me nearly every joke hit and i was laughing out loud every few minutes which is very rare for me with movies for others i think maybe the gags or silliness wear thin just different comedic sensibilities ,2023-07-21 05:41:33
you and me both ,2023-07-21 07:06:26
yes the message was way in your face and too pushy and i think people will take the message to the extreme in a wrong way,2023-07-21 16:53:29
agreed,2023-07-21 23:30:58
what were you expecting from a barbie movie it was better than it had any right to be,2023-07-22 04:24:54
yeah it was a bit on the nose but for a general audience i can understand the need for it i thought it was great not perfect and it dragged just a small amount towards the end,2023-07-21 05:26:35
this is reddit if you were expecting a different reaction about an extremely feminist movie youre probably new here,2023-07-22 04:16:40
shapiro and his ilk truly think that kendom land is the proper order of things so it’s not surprising they had negative reactions,2023-07-30 15:53:00
"as a male i really resonated with a lot of the ken stuff interactions with other people how to act around other people being who i am

i know it was woman focused but it was nice to have a little sliver in there for me",2023-07-22 02:39:33
the only one’s complaining about it are butthurt qanon people i absolutely loved it,2023-07-22 13:52:20
men aren’t oppressed but women are and they deserved to be uplifted no one should be offended by that fact the monologue and female montage is the most emotional part for me it’s great the patriarchy needs to be destroyed,2023-07-22 14:50:16
also we sort of expected them to get back together but they didnt  even barbie acknowledged and apologised for her treatment of ken earlier they were fulfilling heteronormative roles expected of them to the point they werent themselves its nice the film acknowledges that societal ideas of who we are can diminish or at least play a huge role towards our self worth and identities,2023-07-23 13:34:06
"i would identify the ‘issue’ with this movie that many people experience as the fact that it tells women ‘you are inherently valuable and should not need to do anything to be respected’ while telling men ‘you are inherently flawed dumb and violent but if you behave yourself well you can be loved’ which is exactly what will rile up the more incelly parts of the world even more

it kind of turns in around at the end with an idea of ‘being human is a fundamentally  up thing to try to be’ but the takeaway message is so severely undercut by the ‘lets defeat the idiot men with their inherent idiocy’ that it almost disappears

i had a great time at the movie but any story about gender dynamics that inherents a strong ‘us vs them’ attitude will only ever add fuel to the divide which is exactly what we’re seeing now i wish it had focused more on the idea of “we’re all struggling life is a series of  up paradoxical expectations for everyone maybe your genitalia don’t define your worth” it’s in there but it is drowned out in satisfying but unhelpful yas queen v  bro rhethorics

i think most people who see this movie regardless of gender identify more with barbie than with ken but the movie seems to not know that",2023-07-23 14:53:38
"men were obviously not the main point of the movie but as one of those boyfriends who saw the film with my girlfriend there were definitely moments that resonated with me and felt spoken to directly about expectations and how i do or dont define myself based on those expectations you could look at barbie world where men are one of many things the women are supposed to accomplish on their way to being a girl boss who has it all but also where men dont gave space to emotionally define themselves or you can look at the patriarchical real world where you do define yourself by your job but inevitably it is a pyramid scheme where if youre not at the top you question your own value and then kendom in many ways was a cartoonish world defined by stereotypical expectations of what being a man is that the kens much like the nonmargot barbies in barbie world didnt really consider whether it was what they wanted but i feel like the viewer was supposed to the moral for men just like for women isnt that either world shows the ideal of how things should work moreso the moral is the choice barbie is given at the end of the film to define meaning for themselves and then the movie ends open ended ken didnt have that same moment but as a viewer i felt like the moral was supposed to be the same

i also might be the type to not feel so uncertain about my place in the world to read personal slights into systemic criticism because i could see any number of spots some would get sidetracked in and not see the macro point",2023-07-23 14:03:30
"it brings up what feminists think men are going through in reality the whole ken crying and going off to find himself is more of a thing that feminist women would say to each other that men should like to see and care about rather than something men actually care about

literally every man in the movie is  and mostly  and bad and even male interests in the movie are mocked for some reason it was basically misandry the movie even though many women may not get why",2023-07-23 14:06:15
"i definitely enjoyed the movie overall but yeah the ending sort of fell apart it felt like the movie was gearing up to do something with the whole real world and barbieland are mirror images of each other in regards to gendersexism but then it just didnt really do anything much with that

but it was funny wellacted and poignant i appreciated its use of some really stylized scenes im not sure the scenes with mattell were actually the best way to motivate certain plot events tho",2023-08-17 23:48:10
love this take on the movie focusing on ken because i honestly thought the same it would have had a clear cut direction,2023-08-16 03:27:16
if those 4 plotlines were too much for you you should definitely skip oppenheimer besides getting your ear drums blown out practically every scene theres 10 storylines being told mostly involving mcarthyism while they yadayada the science,2023-08-16 06:00:58
it will be fun if some designer brand actually collab with mattel to bring the collection that got thrown into life size,2023-07-21 17:13:02
i think the old lady had a big role thats why she wanted to be a real woman she wants to experience and live womanhood even the most mundane things such as visiting your gynecologist,2023-07-24 07:09:58
"didn’t love one of the main plot points being her apologizing to the guy who just ruined her house

shes already won at that point she sees him suffering and she cares about him why wouldnt she comfort him 

shes been ignoring him every day for centuries like it didnt even occur to her that he might be homeless 

they didnt make it about them getting together which would have been the easy choice her journey isnt about him but even as a friend she never once considered his feelings 

of course she was angry at first but to move forward and grow she had to see how things got to where they are and part of that is realizing that she never thought of him thats what shes apologizing for the movie would be weaker without that",2023-08-06 02:45:27
it is strange how the barbie movies character development all went to ken,2023-08-05 00:46:53
"totally agree with a lot of the critique i’ve read here
1 will farrell parts were unnecessary and muddled the message
2 the ken war was also superfluous and added nothing to the story

biggest gripe
would also liked to see more of gloria and sashas’s relationship as i felt that that was the most moving aspect of the film how barbie represented this hopeful idealized feminine dream for gloria and how growing up forces women to contend with the “reality” that we aren’t as far along in terms of gender equality as we hope to be i think the film is correct in suggesting barbie’s journey is essentially gloria’s journey just thought it would have been handled more realistically it’s not enough for gloria to have a “rallying speech” in the last act without showing the viewer why she feels this way the speech doesn’t feel earned and was a classic case to “telling without showing”

all in all thought it was a terrific concept but could’ve been pared down in terms plot points which would have made the central message humor and poignancy shine more a for effort but also a bit of a squandered opportunity",2023-08-19 17:24:27
 so it wasnt kenough,2023-08-15 14:55:41
i agree a thousand percent with everything you said i keep looking for people who have gripes with the film that are based on the storytelling and less because they misunderstood the albeit shoehorned and trite feminism “being a woman is so hard” made me cringe so hard the pacing was totally disjointed and they reached the emotional core of the movie like thirty minutes in and you’re left feeling like…now what i thought what was going to happen was she would teach this girl who was playing with her how to not be such a  kid and rub her good attitude on her and then this kid would teach her about being a human with her angsty teen feelings but the daughter straight up didn’t need to be there,2023-08-15 15:26:50
yep youve basically put my thoughts into actual words,2023-08-16 21:59:13
you though eeaao was a masterpiece,2023-08-16 23:13:04
" it basically ends that men will not get a say in barbieland so long as women dont get a say in the real world

i think it’s very interesting that the movie ends with “someday the kens will get just as much power in barbieland as women have in the real world” and you took that to mean “men will not get a say in barbieland”",2023-12-28 04:13:47
"i really agree with your comment i really enjoyed the first half  i had a big smile on my face but by the end i was so confused about what was happening i definitely think that they tried to focus on too many storylines and should have just focused in on one or two  cut out the ceo i am so confused about what that added to the story besides shock factor he didn’t even end up being the bad guy in the end or really cut down the number of barbies and their screen time 

one of the reasons i was so excited for greta to do this film is because i felt like she portrayed such a beautiful complex picture of womanhood and feminism in little women without making it preachy  it felt so genuine and human to me and true to how those characters would experience the world so i was disappointed when the feminist messaging in this movie came out to be so one size fits all and woman vs men it felt like the conclusion of the movie was like “all women living under patriarchy are brainwashed and we just need to enlighten them and take over men then everything will be good again” and then to add in the motherdaughter tones of ruth  it was just a lot happening and not in a very nuanced way or felt true the the characters",2023-07-21 20:04:48
the fact that it didnt end up with an egalitarian society is a big miss,2023-07-21 20:03:22
yessss vindictive thats the word that eluded me this movie ended on petty vindictive undertones which i did not care for,2023-07-21 18:42:16
"id agree the complete lack of showing how kens actually live does hurt the movie and how theres still no recognition of this at the end once their society is fixed and balanced   


recontextualise the names and this is basically like some kind of episode of star trek where a planet of naive natives gets corrupted by the way of earth and america ferrera is captain kirk putting them straight but the resolution doesnt quite go as far as it needed too",2023-07-21 18:41:27
"i felt the movie conveyed this idea that for women to feel safeliberatedheardvalued that it’s a zero sum game with one gender needing predominant power as opposed to building both up and learning to value the other strengths and weaknesses alike empowering maleness and femaleness and how they can build each other up

i worry about this message being the message a lot in modern feminism in both social media and traditional media and i say this as a woman im in a very happy marriage and expecting my first child a son and i really want to make sure i teach him that we can all respect each other and work together i most likely will not be watching this movie because im seeing a lot of similar comments from people about the core message",2023-07-21 19:36:16
i thought the overthetop vindictiveness is because the film makes fun of its own conclusion and basically a jab at the overzealous  you read on twitter like „woah those kens are allowed to be some lower judges  barby land is not a single bit different like the real world“,2023-07-21 21:13:08
"as a man who watched it and thought it was just okay i think you nailed it with what they were going for with the kens 

i literally just told my wife i thought ken was representing how women were before the suffragist movement etc in the usa 

i do feel like it would have landed better if when the kens asked for a supreme court position they said you can have one  maybe two since women are on the supreme court and have been for decades now",2023-07-23 17:05:33
"no we get what the point is meant to be  however when you portray literally every man in the movie as an idiot doing something bad and the barbies are not portrayed that way it can’t help but come off as men bad and women good even the husband of america’s ferrara is just randomly an idiot who is mocked
how can we take it as a message of equality when the women in the real world struggling against patriachy are portrayed so positively yet the kens are morons clearly it’s an uneven portrayal  if they had of made some of the barbies more villainous it might have worked in the way you describe as a plot as they would have reflected the real world men however that wasn’t the case

so we get what it’s meant to be however because of the constant portrayal of all men as  and male interests as dumb it just comes off as bitterness against men in a thin veneer of social critique

it’s also hilarious how mattel have rewritten history and convinced young women that barbie is some feminist icon despite feminists protesting her for the first three decades of her existence

think about this  if a movie came out men liked that a lot of women were saying was woman hating in a way they didn’t like would your response be  “well clearly those women are wrong and they just don’t get it” i doubt it you would probably encourage men to actually consider that possibly they have a bias and blind spot that they aren’t aware of and the women have a point perhaps you should do the same in return and think about whether you as a woman are actually the best person to judge whether a movie should be offensive or considered man hating to men",2023-07-23 17:04:41
"i love you for driving this analysis across so beautifully 

there are so many people who are calling the film antimen but its not there were points in the film where i was scared its going to become exactly that especially towards the end i almost thought the kens are going to go back to being an accessory but i liked how it takes a step towards creating their own idea of equality in the barbie land with the men now getting a position in the supreme court regardless of it being lower or not 

i think the whole idea also is also to give us a taste of our own medicine through satire and challenge the roots of patriarchy and what it really means to be a human following these concepts 

something about the film has felt so personal as a woman and has healed a part within me definitely has become one of my comfort films",2023-07-23 18:22:47

like i knew it would be an entertaining surprise like the lego movie but i just kept laughing my  off while watching definitely didn’t expect a joke about corporations using dirty legal tactics to get personhood so they can erode those very rights of the actual humans they’re suppose to protect",2023-07-22 14:11:04

the point was that it mirrored the real world where women had to inch their way into positions of power and the kens situation parallels that of women in the real world theoretically kena woman is now allowed into positions of power but realistically those at the top are still reluctant to actually give them a chance so the gender ratio is still not balanced,2023-07-27 06:27:56
"its being said as a joke by contemplating kens reduced position of power in barbieland you are empathizing with the womens struggle in the real world its a funny because its true kinda thing

edit someone farther down explained it better  

the ending being a matriarchal society still is a joke about the real world sure a lot of people will say women are equals now and should be treated as such but the actual change that should come along with that never happened overnight and is still a work in progress when women first started getting jobs nobody was like “here’s a seat in congress” the movie isn’t saying that slow change for the kens is the way it’s supposed to be it’s just reflecting how society actually baby steps towards equality instead of fully embracing it

im personally more confused by the zack snyder justice league reference i mean it was a good cut but where did that come from",2023-07-27 06:22:59

"it sure does seem to take a lot of words and articles to try to prove why barbie isn’t man hating hmmmm

perhaps the fact every ken and real world man is written as a  in need of moral correction has something to do with why men perceive it as man hating

also how in the  does gerwig making a story about a mother and daughter in a different movie prove this movie isn’t man hating first off all that has nothing to do with men and secondly  it’s a different movie it can’t excuse this one somehow",2023-08-07 03:58:40

agreed my thoughts exactly the visuals actors and humour were great it started off strong but the storyline got lost halfway through the movie and it didnt manage to wrap up their commentary of society into a satisfying conclusion for all barbies kens and humans,2023-07-21 19:18:04
"i did enjoy barbie but i feel like they lost their own point a few times and the ending was messy

nope you got it

i wonder if they filmed an ending where the message was actually embraced but it tested poorly so they shot that nonsense they ended it with",2023-07-21 20:59:30
what did you find messy about the ending,2023-07-21 23:49:08
yeah i think its really lazy when a movie has to stop the plot to have a character literally tell us the message of the film,2023-07-23 08:49:10

real close during im just ken,2023-07-24 01:24:19
"very much tell not show

that seems to be pretty standard these days  show not tell used to be a writing maxim  but i dont think it holds as much weight now  telling is normalized to some degree for younger generations of writers and moviegoers so to them its not looked down upon or particularly jarring",2023-07-26 17:24:44
"i agree with everything here i admit i spent the first 14  12 of the movie thinking ken was a role reversal to highlight how mistreated women are  after all he isnt respected by the barbies or other kens he has no status he is the butt of every joke he is excluded from the all girls party and the narrator even says something to the effect of but ken only has a good day if people look at him as a woman these are all things i and my friends have felt at some point and i thought they were setting up ken to sort of reverse the idea so men could understand better or something i didnt have a problem with that alongside barbie doing her thing

but then at the halfway point they have ken getting into the patriarchy ok i thought now he wants to dismantle the barbie matriarchy as a symbol again of how women want to change the rl patriarchy and gain some respect and power instead they show that him wanting to be respected and loved is wrong he is just power hungry and of course he is a complete idiot who cant do anything right they go on to show that him wanting to change barbie land is wrong while at the same time they have barbie telling the other barbies how oppressed they are even though they just had a barbie matriarchy to be clear this was not a movie about ken nor do i want it to be but it felt like a movie about ken in the second half because a ken could change barbie land but barbie couldnt change rl i guess and b barbie wasnt shown actually wanting or doing anything the original throughline was that the portal was weird and barbie wanted to be perfect again which wasnt really resolved except with a handwave that now she wanted to be human i actually left the movie almost feeling like the message was that things should not change and that women are just crazy and should be happy with what they get but i of course did not leave with that message because they made sure to give the speeches about how bad the patriarchy is

feel free to disagree or counter some of my perspective here i am a woman who hasnt always fit in with my female friends because i dont always see things the same way and am somewhat analytical even though i am liberal and do want change three people around me in the theater were crying at multiple scenes in this movie and i genuinely feel like i missed a huge part i was supposed to connect with as a woman",2023-07-26 16:18:21
agreed a lot of telling instead of showing and i’d hoped those onthenose meta moments would evolve into an interesting perspective but then the movie just pivoted away toward a different point altogether i was very disappointed,2023-07-26 22:49:46
"did they want equality though because ive been trying to find what message the movie is trying to send and im having a tough time because it seems like every time it gets close to saying something except for its lectures it under cuts it with a joke or a gag 

the kens are a great example in the beginning they are treated as almost pets then when they have the patriarchy they are both extremely informed capable and dumb as a rock when the barbies regain control instead of equality they go back to complete domination 

the message that hes kenough is good but he was literally made to be with barbie its not a great metaphor made worse by him never actually doing anything but stating that

then the patriarchy somehow all these strong women can suddenly get pulled into it until an independent woman showed them they actually want to be independent what was that suppose to be 

it wasnt a bad movie but it wasnt a good one and it really was muddy in terms of messaging",2023-08-11 21:14:39
"i just watched barbie and was also confused by the theme  i cant figure out what it was

 it wasnt a you go girl theme because the initial barbie utopia was insipid unfulfilling for stereotypical barbie and was overturned in a day by ken

 it wasnt a women should run the world theme because barbie treated ken like an object

 it wasnt a antipatriarchy theme because ken didnt get anywhere in the real world asserting his male privilege and when ken took over barbie world everyone was having fun  i dont understand why or how the barbies had been brainwashed

 it wasnt a promasculinity theme because ken wasnt doing any better  why were horses such a big part of kens manliness  young girls are much more fond of horses than men are

 there wasnt an antagonist or bad guy like in the lego movie

i generally like the movie  the style and dialogue were great as was the humor about living in a toys world  i just wasnt clear on the message or what resolved the barbie crisis",2023-09-08 14:37:31
"if a woman dreams about being a housewife why not let them be one

they literally say this multiple times in the film",2023-07-31 06:03:14
on barbie not a dressing the body image controversy surrounding barbie it seemed intentional like “hey forget that body image stuff look at men don’t they ”,2023-07-31 08:37:01
i agree with everything you said good comment well written better than i could,2023-07-31 21:23:41
the andrew tate thing is spot on i think i was thinking about that during the movie too he claims he became who he is because women rejected him for his looks on reality tv so much of what men do is to impress women,2023-08-01 04:31:47
" the reason there are no  kens is itself a critique of unrealistic female and male beauty standards in the real world

the absence of diverse body types among the ken dolls in the movie may be a conscious choice to highlight and critique the often narrow and unrealistic standards of male beauty just like barbie has historically been criticized for promoting unrealistic body ideals for women ken can be seen as representing a similar issue for men the typical ken doll represents an ideal male physique—tall muscular and lean this single body type could be seen as reinforcing harmful standards of attractiveness and masculinity

the film seems to challenge these standards by including characters such as allan described as bumbling awkwardly in a sea of hunky kens allans inclusion might serve as a contrast to the homogeneity of the ken dolls and as a critique of the limited representation of male body types

moreover the film is set in barbieland a world originally constructed around the dolls specific aesthetic this limitation however does not mean that the filmmakers are endorsing this single body type as the ideal rather they may be using it to highlight the problems with such an unrealistic standard

ultimately the movie appears to encourage individuality and selfdefinition over conformity to specific body ideals both for barbie and ken

the guardian seems to have picked up on this too but its obviously over their head",2023-07-30 07:14:39
so basically a teenager keep in mind i say this as one myself,2023-08-29 05:21:34

i think the point is that people are not prizes to be won its unfortunate that he was but then again just because youre created for a reason doesnt mean you shouldnt be able to decide for yourself what your true purpose is,2024-02-01 11:14:40

because barbie never had genitals,2023-07-23 03:52:08
she accepted becoming a human and everything that comes with it even the somewhat awkward bits of seeing a gynecologist because becoming human  getting genitals,2023-07-23 04:45:21
the movie unironically taught me that i am kenough,2023-07-22 04:17:07
love that i learned the term “selfsnitchers” those folks mad are outting themselves as if he patriarchal problem,2023-07-22 04:00:14
lol did you just say if someone didnt like the film they are a bigot ,2023-07-22 01:55:40
good on you for owning that but ive gotta say this is very much not a kids movie i dont think it was even marketed as a kids movie and while yes kids will want to see it because its very stylish and quirky the majority of the movie will go over their head,2023-07-24 05:52:16
the entire ken society was just a reflection of how woman were back then they had purpose through barbie aka husbands they said it plainly at the end when the kens were denied political positions but the narrator says they will fight for it over time,2023-07-24 07:02:56
the moms speech was trying way too hard,2023-08-02 03:05:34
yes 100 loved it but some parts were a little heavy handed and didnt quite land,2023-08-01 02:24:40
"yep you said it all
the what was i made for thing is the theme of the movie you see it in the scene with weird barbie before she leaves to the real world in the scene you mentioned when she meets ruth when barbie has her existential crisis and gives up and again at the end when she chooses to be human and essentially eradicates herself and the idea of perfectionthe entire movie really begins with the mom having sad existential thoughts which force barbie to become introspective and think about meaning and death and the idea of imperfection but it gets a bit sidetracked with the gender roles thing once barbie enters the real world",2023-08-01 03:16:46
agree with all of this,2023-08-01 00:03:54
it was much more about the kens emotional journey than barbies i was taken aback by the disproportionate focus,2023-08-03 05:15:30
you can make the argument that ryan gosling carried the film i loved margot robbies portrayal but ryans ken just brought so much fun and life to the film he killed every scene he was in,2023-08-03 15:08:45
it was way more funny than i expected  people mad at how ken is portrayed seem to be missing the point,2023-07-24 12:36:43
felt the same about those parts dragging but my gf and other female friend who i saw it with said those were their favourite parts other than the beach fight scene so maybe theyre just not aimed at me,2023-07-21 05:28:01
i think midge wasnt with the other controversial discontinued barbies like growing up skipper because she was reintroduced and is still being sold while the others arent,2023-07-21 21:00:15
so you totally missed the part where the dreamhouses were all still part kendecorated and every night doesnt have to be girls night theyve already started taking what they learned and are trying to make everything more equitable everything changed from the heros journey arc,2023-07-22 01:16:47
i saw his whole arc as a warning on the dangers of radicalization both in toxic patriarchal masculinity and in radical manhating feminism he didnt want to fix barbieland to be equal he wanted it to be just as unbalanced but in his favor,2023-07-22 01:23:33
if you mean the mattel hoodie then 60 is worth it the “i am kenough” is stitched on that’s way better quality than a printon,2023-07-23 00:46:49

thats transphobic,2023-08-01 23:17:48
i loved how the kens just wanted to be treated equally and fairly,2023-08-12 20:25:08
"i think ultimately it felt like the kind of film that wants its cake and eat it too which does dilute the message a little bit im a little confused about what the movie is really trying to say despite everything being so explicitly spelled out and i think part of the reason is that the movie tries to cram too much almostconflicting ideas into it there are different layers to the themes but i still kind of feel like a coherent whole is missing that prevents this movie from being truly great

for some reason it reminded me of marvels showsmovies esp those related to cap america like the tv show with falcon and winter soldier they would raise these interesting questions  topics like refugees and so on but always find some lame way to not resolve the tough questions and distract you with something else in the end

i did enjoy a lot of snippets of ken discovering the patriarchy the humor etc though but yes i find will ferrells character and passé to be basically unnecessary after the initial revelation that all the executives were men they just essentially became realworld cartoon characters",2023-08-21 09:14:27
one of the points was that it shouldnt return to the status quo the kens did get some representation but the sass is that they would get equality when women in our world received the same,2023-08-19 20:06:37
will ferrell’s character was the ceo of mattel which was needed to… call out the ceo of mattel will ferrell’s style of comedy fit right in with the rest of the comedic style of the movie,2023-08-21 04:50:52
"it helps when you remember that this is a giant commercial from mattel they funded it they wanted to rebranded their name honestly they probably regret hiring greta gerwig because of how many serious scenes she pushed in there

for reference look at lego movie don’t get me wrong i love it and it has some thoughts and feelings i appreciate but its goal was to sell more toys 

just look at the price for the dream house and look at the original price for the movie collection barbie",2023-10-24 10:44:56
"  it seems it wants to talk about something very insightful and important

there was a scene when barbie is in the real world and sitting at a bus stop looking at an old woman and some girl kids and she has an emotional moment  and i get why someone could be that emotional about an old woman being confident in a bus stop or a kid just playing but in the context of the movie it felt uninformed and unearned that it felt corny to me a dude

that said i can see how that same scene for an actual irl woman with a childhood of interacting and playing with barbies in a parasocial manner that one tiktox sized clip of barbie telling an old woman that shes beautiful can be extremely validating and emotional  but again that requires the viewer to be bringing in a lot of irl context into the movie

its writing if its meant for a wider audience especially movie critics its pretty meh and thinly played out more style than substance like the star wars sequel trilogies  if its meant for just people who played with barbies then its fine",2023-10-20 18:09:47
"also just finished watching it im pretty sure your exact comment is exactly the point of the movie or one of them after the supreme court thing they even joke that maybe one day kens will have as much power as women in the real world the point is that neither the patriarchy or matriarchy are good and are actually just as bad as each other and we need to work to make things equal across both

this point is reinforced when the kens first take over and ken echoes the same arguments against barbie that she made against him when the barbies were in power this is barbies dream house not kens dream house

at the end when the babies are taking back control barbie  our protagonist even says she doesnt think things should go back to the way they were ie women in total control its just the other barbies need to catch up to her",2024-01-17 09:39:27
"after all the hype i expected mean girls level of subversive humour and a nuanced take on current cultural battles going on  i like you was bored and disappointed as there was an excess of tell dont show with themes that would have been edgy in the 80s shoved in our faces as feminism and the patriarchy

also read as a giant ad for me   honestly do not get the hype and im glad i chose oppenheimer at the cinema rather than this",2024-02-11 23:06:04
"nobody is upset by that  they’re upset because all kens and real world men are written as comparatively  and morally lacking alongside their real world female and barbie counterparts you know this but choose to ignore it and say it’s just cos ken is a himbo no it is not

and speaking of ken the himbo  when ken the doll was the president and barbie was the first lady in doll form  was he a himbo what about when they brought out doctor men and nurse barbie or pilot ken and flight attendant barbie 
i don’t have a problem with ken being a himbo but the whole thing about mattel only ever giving barbie jobs is just social media spin for this movie actually what mattel doesn’t want to tell you is that for ages they gave ken the “man” job and barbie the “woman” job like doctor ken and nurse barbie",2023-08-02 18:48:08
i thought this was aimed at millenials,2023-07-22 05:55:08

she is my name is gloria and i remember hearing it at some point,2023-11-16 15:11:11
you dont think the movie recognized that i thought lines like barbie solved sexism and inequality and the scene when sasha makes barbie cry were pretty clear that thats not what the movie thought,2023-12-22 05:17:49
"its not like these were deep cuts its pretty surface level satire

i wouldnt even call it satire the movie takes direct jabs at the current world and patriarchy",2023-07-23 16:02:18
it’s especially funny because the thesis statement of the movie was essentially that neither patriarchy’s or matriarchy’s work let’s find a harmonious balance for ken and barbie,2023-07-23 17:18:45
think about this  if a movie came out men liked that a lot of women were saying was woman hating in a way they didn’t like would your response be  “well clearly those women are wrong and they just don’t get it” i doubt it you would probably encourage men to actually consider that possibly they have a bias and blind spot that they aren’t aware of and the women have a point perhaps you should keep that same energy for men,2023-07-23 17:07:12
“girly” and “feminine” things have definitely been lampooned in media regularly though it may have become a bit more taboo lately but it happens to men and some of them lose their minds the fragility is a bit embarrassing,2023-07-23 16:01:41
"everyone complaining about this is most likely one of those shapiro weirdos saw it today and thought it was  hilarious and fun was talking to a family member and told them it was funny and a great time this person said shapiro said its woke propaganda conspiring against men and targeting children with

"heres a genuine question when are men allowed to complain about negative portrayals of men

i grew up hearing about negative female portrayals in tv showsmoviesvideo games all the time even if it was only one woman and their portrayals often werent even negative lara croft is an example of a female character who was a smart capable adventurous badass but was in the crosshairs of feminist critics for being sexualised every piece of media with so much as a damsel in distress has come under fire for it

yet whenever we get shows or movies with male characters who are all portrayed as either  lazy condescending predatory etc were not allowed to call them out at best you get told you cant have a laugh at your own expense like you did or women have had to deal with it for decades its about time the pendulum swung in the other direction ignoring the decades of media with negative portrayals of men too i can go and watch laurel and hardy movies where im supposed to laugh at them being victims of domestic violence pick any sitcom and youll see a bumbling  husband and a smart wife rolling her eyes at worst you get called an evil sexist altright incel  mra manbaby for calling it out

its not a satire if its just another in a long list of other shows and movies that do the same thing",2023-07-23 19:06:45
one of the movies key ideasthemes is that the world would be perfect if it werent for men because all men are dickheads who sexually harass women its an incredibly sexist movie and had the roles been reversed it would have received a ton of hate,2023-07-23 16:24:38

i loved it firstly no one in barbieland ages so this was barbie’s first time seeing an old person and her first thought was “she’s beautiful” in society we are often ‘ashamed’ of aging of wrinkles and growing old… but in reality it’s a truly beautiful thing i think that’s important to remember too for the ending when barbie chooses the real world and mortality mortality is what gives this life meaning,2023-07-25 07:16:21

"wouldnt putting barbie on the board just validate that women are there not because they earned the spot but because of tokenism barbie doesnt have an mba or any job experience

i think that a lot of the people who didnt like the movie seem to all think there should have been a fairy tale ending  barbieland is now a utopia of equality and barbie is fixing the real world by making feminist strides in the workplace but the barbies are all reflections of the children playing with them  they cant be fixed any faster than the real world can not to mention that the kens had literally brainwashed them all into something akin to slavery  and were about to change the constitution to  them of their rights forever why do the barbies need to rise above why do women or blacks or insert oppressedwronged party have to rise above the kens certainly didnt when they got their power after being marginalized i know that it has to start somewhere but who does that fall on",2023-07-24 17:38:20

i agree heavily with number 2 they should have become an equal society,2023-07-25 00:23:44
you have summarized all my feelings about this film perfectly such great points and i too found the daughter very annoying imo i felt like she could have not been in the story at all and it would have been fine i suppose then we wouldnt have had the twist about barbie coming from the mothers thoughts instead of the daughters but the same points still could have been made without that twist also i felt like there couldve have been more done with ken as you pointed out though i understand that barbie is meant to be the focus of the movie anyways love this review and thanks for sharing,2023-07-24 18:03:19
"great analysis i totally agree with most of the points they could have gone waaaay deeper in the topic of human experience and that type of things but they wanted to tackle so many things at once that in the end it was kind of messy 

also i have to take in consideration that there was definitely an understimation for ken as you said it would have been great to see them fully collaborate with the barbies and to see the main ken ryan gosling take the same route as the main barbie in the real world living as a human showing the maturity and development of the character

i think they were really close to making a really solid movie but it ended up a bit weak in terms of plot and messages 

even though the scenes and sets were definitely amazing for sure",2023-07-24 16:58:29
i think i agree most with you,2023-07-24 17:15:51
also the problem with 5 is that if kens are dumb  while barbies are that smart how do they lose to the kens,2023-07-24 22:53:01
"the matrix reference with the shoes

the shinning reference when barbie and gloria are bonding",2023-07-21 20:29:39
ken and the ken squadkendom payed a lot of homage to grease,2023-07-21 20:27:57
in the early scene where barbie is driving her car through town the posters on the movie theater are characters from the wizard of oz a bit of foreshadowing,2023-07-21 20:29:24
"yeah well said my take is that the movie started strong it ended fine too but the plot seemed really rushed 
it seemed almost like the director choose to give ken the story arc and it overshadowed barbie 
ironic given the general theme the director was going for",2023-07-22 07:00:11
i mean thats kind of the point of kens whole character arc his wants arent wrong and the audience should be in board and sympathizing with him his problem is how he goes about achieving those wants and he learns that by the end,2023-07-23 06:19:20
part of barbies whole arc is that she knows something is missing from her life but because shes a stereotypical barbie she has no idea what it is figuring out who she is and what she wants to do with her life is her driving goal,2023-07-23 07:06:57
she really britta’d it,2023-07-23 17:26:05
oh man i was like that as a teenager on some level just repeating ideas that i didn’t fully understand so that was so relatable and funny,2023-07-23 17:12:23
personally it reminded me of the big lebowski a bit at times all the movie references were incredible,2023-07-23 22:55:06
its because the narrative isnt engaging at all all it has is a few laughs thats it,2023-07-23 23:41:08
maybe that none of the characters had a real arch or background and barbie’s talk with ruth at the end didn’t have much meaning other than to wrap it up somehow,2023-07-23 22:45:13
i dont think it was kens crying that was played for laughs it was kens running away to cry that was played for laughs  thats why it was so easy to laugh at his im a liberated male and its strong to cry because he said it right after he ran from his peers to cry in private  ken said those words out loud but he might not believe them,2023-07-24 16:38:14
"i thought there were really interesting and unique themes about men’s mental health and how men experience the world at first ken is invisible unless barbie is giving him attention then ken discovers the patriarchy and overthrows barbieland but they end up trashing the place and looking ridiculous toxic masculinity barbie says to ken that he’s enough just as he is and doesn’t need all of the superficial stuff to feel good enough basically men should be themselves and have inherent value that’s got nothing to do with women cars their clothes etc i was kind of taken aback by the themes about men’s issues just wasn’t expecting it unfortunately the end of the movie kind of invalidated those themes they were building on it felt like we were supposed to laugh at ken crying about the minfridge idk men are made to feel like they can’t express sadness should we be laughing at him crying or should we root for him for showing true emotion also ken crying about a mini fridge made it seem like men have trivial issues compared to women that may be true sometimes but is it always

i would have appreciated 1 consistency across themes if the movie develops a theme or message stick to it through to the end and 2 a more nuanced approach on issues that are well truly nuanced",2023-07-24 18:04:27
i thought it might be a hot take to say it but i do think they kind of really beat on ken in this movie i thought it was going to build up to the barbies and kens mutually respecting one another and treating them as individuals and stop using them as superfluous man accessories and accept them as meaningful parts of their lives but no they just sort of go back to being kens i thought it was kinda  up that barbie mentions how she doesnt even know where all the kens sleep at night ken loves someone who doesnt live him back he has no power at all in his world and isnt qualified to get a job or have any power in the real world like no wonder dude did what he did i thought they were going to build up to tackle some mens mental health issues and struggles but it just boils down to sorry ken youre valid i guess,2023-07-24 17:14:23
so true i was literally on the verge of tears when he started crying so sincerely on barbies bed but i think i heard some people next to me laugh,2023-07-24 20:21:39
"i honestly felt like barbie was too sympathetic to ken in that moment she shouldn’t have forgiven him 

he literally took her house and she forgave him…",2023-07-25 01:41:42
it seemed pretty clear to me that the obvious enemy of the film was gender inequality in and of itself and that each of us regardless of gender operate within the inequities of this framework and leads us to act and feel a certain way it wasnt women are better than men or all men are dumb it was wouldnt it be nice to have a bit more balance,2023-07-27 13:00:49
"  ive seen a lot of people saying this movie is antimen

its like they got up to go to the bathroom every time ryan gosling was on screen i just dont get it",2023-07-27 10:18:35
"the problem is it shows a feminist idea that “patriarchy” is bad for men by showing gosling ken cry and then get to find himself when the women take over and “patriarchy” is defeated   but it’s just that that is a feminist woman’s fantasy of what she thinks men should want 95 of men aren’t secretly wanting to cry more or find themselves so the idea that “patriarchy” is bad for them because it’s holding them back from doing so doesn’t mean anything to them at all so what seems like a happy ending to feminist women is actually entirely meaningless to most men and in no way shows them patriarchy is bad for them and they’d be better without it because it’s just a feminists idea of what is better for them not their own

also the reason it’s anti men isn’t so much the ideas it espouses whether you agree with them or not  but the fact all the real world male characters and kens are portrayed as morons who are doing bad stuff whereas the real world women are sympathetic and competent and the barbies are more intelligent and competent and cooperative than the kens so the whole idea that it’s a satire of a reversed world doesn’t quite hold true because the barbie matriarchy is clearly portrayed as much more competent and sympathetic then the real world patriarchy or kendom is",2023-07-27 10:49:55
and you are ok how ken was treated by barbie in the beginning of the movie and barbie literally taken back the barbie land by lying and manipulation of the kens  i am sure you are going to reply that this is how men being portray woman for centuries yet this is exactly why this is a bad movie  two wrongs does not make a right,2023-07-27 18:29:01
"does the film even attempt to show one good male role model in the film no

its antimen",2023-07-27 12:46:09
the movie definitely is supposed to be satire but the conclusion barbie arrives at on where she sees herself in society and how she wants society to interact and respect her is meant to be taken serious and as soon as she takes her own agency back she kind of denies ken his by telling him he doesnt get a supreme court seat unless she feels like it down the road with the justification being well men do it to us in the real world  which the movie goes indepth to criticize so its understandable when people see her using that excuse as vindictive rather than satirical ken didnt cause the real world to be hostile towards women so why would you shut him down especially since he comes around to accepting barbies viewpoint in the end and follows her example to want more agency over his own life rather than just looking pretty on a beach that goes against the whole morality of the story,2023-07-31 20:22:01
these are the same people who when women are made fun of in entertainment media which historically has been a lot objectively are the first to say what why cant anyone take a joke its humor people,2023-07-31 18:49:52
thank you exactly hope people see your post because theres a lot of chest beating here by people with little feminist understanding satire  subtlety flies over most heads sadly,2023-07-31 18:25:55
just watched it agree really felt like a lot of character arcs went nowhere and movie basically ended with nothing actually changing,2023-09-14 03:52:43
i dont think its necessarily saying someone else shouldve been cast to get the point across i think it is just trying to ironically state that margot robbie is beautiful and i think it also adds that margot robbie fits he stereotypical barbie beauty standards but i didnt think it was saying anything negative about other people who dont look like margot if that makes sense,2023-10-09 17:27:17
i usually like when media breaks the fourth wall this wasn’t one of those times who was she trying to reassure margot or potential critiques it felt overly analytical and was uncalled for the amount of men online calling margot robbie “mid” is proof that anyone can have self esteem issues no matter how conventionally attractive they may be,2023-10-11 04:56:36
wow that line went over your head completely,2023-10-07 06:31:23
"oh holy  i finished watching the movie 2 hours ago and i just now got it  and here i thought it was some ah real life means hard stuff like going to the doctor but no she has a real  now  

this is as good of a last line as im going to go home and sleep with my wife",2023-07-23 01:21:47
in the bathroom after the movie the mom at the sink next to me was explaining to her girls what a gynecologist was  their faces  x,2023-07-23 01:06:00
wait what was the shining reference,2023-07-23 19:42:54
i was cackling lol,2023-07-23 19:45:49
i think it was a nod to the big film fans and would have been missed by the casual audience i was laughing but it didn’t seem to hit in my theater overall,2023-07-23 19:47:54
for the fbomb pass i think the bleep and mattel logo made it funnier than if she just said it,2023-07-26 12:00:03
woah i didnt even notice this now im curious lol which scenes include cast members who arent filming together,2023-12-07 15:09:43
totally agree on the ken being a part of the supreme court part  here we are a movie about how the patriarchy is putting down women and then in the end they do a joke about the matriarchy putting down men instead  why even include that joke  it takes away from the movies message  i did enjoy it but it couldve been a little tighter,2023-07-22 07:23:31
"really well said the movie started strong but it seemed to end up in a more of a confused narrative spot 

also the supreme court line confused me because arent there currently multiple women on the supreme court in the united states",2023-07-22 06:54:27
"agree so much im a guy so i was obv relating to ken more throughout the movie 

x200b

when he goes to the real world he realizes hes not actually qualified to do anything but they still make a joke that cause hes a man he would be able to get a great job even though he failed and couldnt with no degree or experience

x200b

that supreme court part was really sad i didnt get the point the director was making are we supposed to be happy that barbie world is controlled completely by women is the idea that the real world is still completely controlled by men

x200b

wanted more dancing beautiful sets and singing the real world journeys for both ken and barbie couldve been so much more that couldve been like 30 minutes longer and no ferrel",2023-07-22 07:20:41
"kens moment where he cries that he is nothing without barbie is seen for laughs which makes me sad i’ve seen so many women be raised with that idea and be so lost with themselves when they realize they don’t need to think and act that way that making it for a joke just because it’s a male character upset me

while this does prompt laughs because of how good gosling is at physical comedy i feel like its treated well within the scene barbie is just spending time with ken trying to get him to realise that he can be a perfectly valid individual without needing to be in a relationship and he does come to that realisation its not a throwaway",2023-07-22 07:50:41
about the resolution with ken’s the joke is about people in power not wanting to give it up but instead compromising while retaining the vast majority of power it is poking fun at the barbie’s for doing what men do in the real world while claiming progress is being made  this movie was not exclusively making fun of men and it’s shocking to me to see how many people think it is,2023-07-22 19:08:50
honestly i agree i saw it last night and left feeling let down on the upside though i saw oppenheimer as well and it absolutely blew my expectations away i highly recommend seeing it,2023-07-21 16:36:56
i wasnt disappointed but the tonal shifts were crazy its like gerwig tried to cater to all audience groups but with no effort to combine them in a seamless coherent way so it went from goofy lego movie joke scenes to existential drama scenes and back like it was nothing,2023-07-21 14:35:39
i agree completely,2023-07-21 14:35:51
"same 

i wanted adult barbie fun instead they gave a halfassed movie thats kinda for kids kinda for adults 

both men and women were excited to see it but it got preachy about the patriarchy so great way to push men that were already supporting the movie away 

i wanted more time in barbie dreamland

more time of barbie and ken exploring the real world 

instead i got rants 

i love that at the beginning of the movie the showed little girls destroying baby dolls i was so pumped then it ended on barbie seeing a bunch of momdaughter scenes sigh",2023-07-21 16:57:49
this is so true,2023-07-21 13:53:58
same,2023-07-21 15:21:23
yeah like did they miss the end of the movie where barbie apologizes to ken for the dynamic set up under the matriarchy,2023-07-23 17:17:20
i loved the 2001 space odyssey opening thought it perfect,2023-07-31 20:28:51
"i don’t think gloria going into barbieland was hypocritical she mentions never getting to do anything for herself because she’s a mother who works fulltime the husband will be fine because he’s an adult who can look after himself 

also the husband is shown to be a nice guy but has a hispanic wife and hispanic daughter of high school age and is only just starting to learn some spanish it’s def implied the mum does most of the mentalemotional load in the relationship",2023-09-29 21:18:27
"im not gonna lie the fact that so many viewers beeline it to the most uncharitable simplistic view of the film and what its message was is very concerning 

its about becoming human when glorias chafing under having to do everything while her husband enjoys the benefits of the labour done and pursuing her passion projects then gloria going wherever the  she pleases for once is in fact an act of making a choice to be more than she has been so far namely a wife a working bee a mother ticking from one day to another her husband does not appear to be interested in the slightest about doing the same with himself or even just going along with his wife even out of curiosity 

shes unconcerned about her husband because her husband is not concerned about her i mean your wife and kid take off and you dont even think to ask where youre going when will you be back what chores need doing whats a barbie whos this strange blonde woman theres nothing really there for gloria to be concerned about because her husband seems to be about as exciting complex and complicated as a well plastic barbie hes barely a person hes more like a softspoken drone",2023-10-17 13:48:05
what else would you expect… from a movie about barbie a literal feminine object,2023-10-01 14:36:39
"if this is analogous to real life as you say then i dont think the kens concept of being free from the matriarchy being analogous to feminist being free from the patriarchy in the real world would paint feminism in a positive light

the question would be when does the satire begin and when does it end",2023-07-24 06:08:34
everyone gets that but it was just done in a  way and was a downer,2023-07-24 08:35:38
"they also mock the husband character when gloria is driving in the car and talking about her old boyfriend it’s just another chance to take a little shot at a male character for comedy i think gerwig has a lot of bitterness about men

you probably didn’t realise it but the ending of ken crying while the barbies take power back and barbie womansplaining that now he gets to go and find himself and cry is actually what feminists think is a happy ending it’s a representation of how when “patriarchy” is beaten and women have more power men will be able to find themselves and express all the emotions they secretly want to express  according to feminists
i know to most men that doesn’t seem particular happy or desirable but that’s actually meant to be the happy ending in line with feminist theory",2023-07-31 03:37:57
the narrator said if you want to make a point about barbie becoming  you shouldnt hire margot robbie or something along the lines of that,2023-07-21 23:45:39
hes the singer for the band dead mans bones pretty good stuff also la la land of course mans got talent,2023-07-22 07:04:51
lol you think he was singing in that cute,2023-07-22 07:08:58
it shouldve ended 10 mins sooner  the emotional part with ruth at the end wasnt the best and idk why barbie needed to become human,2023-07-25 13:58:56
i actually cringed so hard at that line  only a few minutes beforehand barbie was so horrified by the threat of discovering cellulite on her legs that she embarked on a huge mission to the real world in order to prevent it five minutes later she views a wrinkly oldaged female as beautiful,2023-09-23 13:31:10
"i would have loved for her to respond with something along the lines of

youre so beautiful

i know and it took me far too long in life to see it",2023-09-17 03:08:56
just saw the film and loved it despite a few flaws as for that scene im not sure if it needed more or not but i found the moment deeply moving really hit me hard,2023-09-15 20:12:41
bro id beach you off any day of the week,2023-09-19 15:26:53
i think part of this is keeping the movie light and fun its a movie you want to take your daughter to and im not sure getting deep into feminism would fit the movies tone,2023-07-22 17:51:42
i’m somewhat curious to know about the process of greta and her real life partner noah’s writing collaboration since everyone is discussing various aspects of the writing  the good bad and the   who wrote what that is was not as simple as greta writes from the female perspective and noah from the man’s did they disagree on the dialogue as they wrote etc,2023-07-22 16:59:26
exactly  it ended up being all didactic which became annoying as the movie went on  also note to greta  it was never all about ken so why make him such a focus  truth is ken could actually be a fully functional dude he supports barbie what is wrong with that  in making ken vapid who is so insecure in his masculinity greta takes feminism backwards  is barbieor women in generalnot worthy to have an adoring dude  barbie life in the dreamhouse did a much better job of this  also gretas treatment of weird barbie was cruel and depicted a mean girl element that i dont think reflects the barbie brand in general  the barbies cast weird barbie out how does that make sense when there are other unconventional barbies living in the barbie kingdom   sorry greta life in the dreamhouse is much better on every level,2023-07-22 16:33:50
"its bizarre that they gave that monologue to a character we just barely met whats meant to be an empowering speech is more of an eyeroll when it comes from a side character we have zero connection with literally all we know about her to that point is that she has a moody teenager they used to play with barbie dolls once upon a time but now shes sad and depressed i honestly cant even remember what her characters name was 

i dunno maybe have barbie actually experience the real world beyond just a boardwalk and middle school have her notice and see the struggles women go through instead of a scoobydoo chase it would have made way more sense for margot robbie to be the one with the big monologue highlighting womens struggles after an actual emotional arc

there were so many corners cut in this film that just dont make sense the tone and plot were just all over the place with dreadful pacing just moving on to the next set piece without much resolution its weird to read of many people being genuinely touched by this film when it felt so surface level and hollow throughout especially the 2nd half of the film i just dont get it",2023-07-22 17:40:58
"look how afraid you are to have an opinion  


thats the world you clearly support",2023-07-22 18:08:32
most excellent this is exactly what a dude’s take away should be “good for the girls ryan gosling is awesome i am kenough and going back to my mojo dojo casa house”,2023-07-22 23:50:14
lol anyone saying the movie is male bashing must have missed the fact that the kens situation in barbieland is meant to mirror womens situation in the real worldunable to selfactualize and only able to define themselves in relation to men,2023-07-23 03:20:53
barbie was afraid of imperfections flat feet cellulite then she sees an aged woman and realizes there’s nothing to be afraid of and that it’s beautiful to be a human,2023-07-25 18:41:06
"i didnt initially understand it when i saw the movie but ive seen people giving their interpretations and i really liked their takes 

first in the context of the movie barbie has never been confronted to mortality  and thus getting old either this was her beginning to see the beauty in humanity and what it entails  getting old and dying having a limited time on earth and using it to evolve

and from a more meta point of view it is also a sort of feminist scene  barbie doesnt see a woman getting old as a negative because she developed in a society thats basically the opposite of a patriarchy the movies saying that despite what mysogny says theres beauty in a woman getting old its even more powerful considering its coming from barbie whos the embodiment of each of our societys beauty standards",2023-07-25 18:48:23
"i dont think shed ever seen an old person before 

she saw someone who was different and saw her beauty

i also saw a 10 things video that stated the lady was involved in the production of one of ms gerwigs earlier works

i wonder what would have happened if itd been an old man sitting there",2023-07-25 19:05:58
completely agree my comment is currently being downvoted because people are saying i’m taking it too seriouslybut i really thought it could have been done so much better,2023-07-23 23:48:30
its cuz they wanted it to be a lecture and didnt bother writing an engaging story to begin with,2023-07-23 23:38:54
i took it as one hilarious that they were building it up and not sideways lol,2023-07-21 20:35:24
the scene where she cries in the bench was the most memorable scene for me aside from that i agree,2023-07-21 23:55:56
there’s going to be a sequel kenland,2023-07-21 23:25:12
this is the weird part about the movie it was so ridiculously feminist that it prescribed a playbook for defeating a radical movement that could… easily work on feminism it was really strange and incoherent in its approach,2023-07-22 05:35:28
 it was a statement about  what is already being done to women not a suggestion on what should be done,2023-07-22 04:06:16
"unless youre very rich youre already part of the ones being turned against each other your comment is  a good example of that

literally it was amazing when i saw how packed the parking lot was i was like yes,2023-07-22 13:17:51
the ending was great honestly robbies performance with ellishs song and rhea perlman was just very touching thank you for getting the message honestly i think this is the message trying to be told,2023-07-22 15:37:33
kate mckinnon was gymnast barbie,2023-07-23 00:29:25
the fact the word mattel was mentioned like 100 times should answer that question,2023-07-23 18:34:11
"well… i don’t think so the movie was more about the weight we put on society and thus the weight we put on this “doll” rather than like mattel as a company because there is the massive joke about a boardroom full of men running a toy company that kind of dictates the image of women 
i think with that joke alone it didn’t really feel like a sale",2023-07-23 17:19:27
this is really fantastic context and now i know why i also struggled to like the movie 100 felt like neither storyline got resolved properly in addition to too many conflicting details,2023-07-23 18:33:47
"i dont think it goes back to the kens being oppressed by the barbies they literally get a position in the supreme court so that become a step towards equality in their own little world 

also the kens were never really oppressed by the barbies in the first place they were always happy had no reality of self  sure but thats because of the nature of their existence oppressed is a pretty strong term

also i think the end is openended for a reason i think they may make a film titled ken in the future because just like you i was kinda dissatisfied with the fact that we didnt get to know what happened to ken i think a film navigating his journey to finding who he is would be cool 

itd be so cool if they make one for midge and allan too",2023-07-23 18:10:18
this was never a movie marketed to children it was for millennials and genz who played with barbie it was made clear from the very beginning,2023-07-23 22:01:02

" the early kubrick parody in the particular is something i imagine young audiences wont be able to understand

that scene has been parodied in cartoons for years kids dont know its referencing a movie but they grow to know that music and understand implicitly that its referencing some culture moment of greatness

my packed crowd had very few big laughs or reactions  just scattered occasional laughs  i might have laughed a lil once or twice but i’m a tougher laugh  overall a decent movie but not one i’m recommending to anyone but those who are into it or are fans,2023-07-25 14:37:43
"i feel like after the hype has died down and we’re out of the current cultural zeitgeist this movie isn’t going to age well at all i can’t see it being this thing people still think is funny or iconic like the old addams family movies or whatever else

i also wonder how much of the 150 million reported marketing budget went into pampering critics and pushing a lot of good reviews a  of a lot of the 1010 imdb reviews seem to be very basic and clearly written by chatgpt",2023-07-25 15:45:27
"well written thank you for the comment   


i left the movie impressed with how it handled so much of the philosophy and concepts rooted in feminism and gender studies i only hope that people can understand that barbieland was not meant to become an equal space for barbie and ken and thats ok barbieland is not supposed to reflect the human spectrum or experience and definitely is not a stand in for achieving gender equality in the real world",2023-07-25 14:36:06
i appreciated your thoughts just wanted to clarify that ken has to be an incel because he literally can’t be anything other than celibate without genitals,2023-07-25 14:43:33

apparently each artist was given a scene and was told to write a song for said scene so i think each song became moreliteral and can only go with each specific scene if that makes any sense i tried to listen to the soundtrack but in my ears the only song that can stand on its own was billie eilishs track,2023-08-10 04:21:07
"my m29 point of view about the end is that well thats how life must have felt quite often for women you think a message has passed a win has been earned and then you turn around and youre like thats it that all weve won after all this 

the kens are still in barbieland with a fullyfemale supreme court having to ask for a position for scraps and being overjoyed at being given said scraps  which is still more than they had before does it feel disappointing it has to or else it doesnt pass its message barbie is not a feelgood movie its uncomfortable a lot of the messages are straightforward but many others are less so 

those that are less clearstraightforward are those that will leave us men uncomfortable and i feel it makes us ask women around us did you get it while they can answer with  yes i do it leads to a conversation",2023-08-19 05:14:08
"i think the meaning of the ceo of mattel is in conjunction with ruth the creator of barbie together they symbolizes different facets of our parents  the ceo represents our parent’s expectations that defines who we are by raising us according to that definition no matter how well intended that is each person still has to become their own person in their own terms or else the parents’ expectations will always be a burden on them 

the ceo wanting barbie to go back to the box and stay as “stereotypical” barbie where she can be this perfect little doll are like parents that wants their children to be exactly how they are raised some parents raise their kids to be an extension of their own egos some raise them to behave and to fit into society hence being “stereotypical” some raise them to be successful some raise them to know good etc…the spectrum can go pretty far from end to end

ruth on the other hand represents the realization that their own child one day will outgrow the confines of the parents…these confines are necessary for a child to reach adulthood they are filled with ideas and expectations for them to learn and understand the basics of the world typically this is where being “stereotypical” or “normal” are idealized but every child needs to decide for themselves eventually who they are and what want to be

this is distinct from the ideas of masculinity patriarchy feminism and etc…for these things are social concepts we come to know as we are being integrated into society when we leave home but the image of who we are instilled by our parents is much deeper and intimate yet as well meaning and lovingly as this image is it is still an idea and not who we are though we may incorporate from it we can never be it because an idea is still a box at the end and everyone has to eventually grow out of that box to become a fully realized person

at the end the “stereotypical” barbie becomes an actual woman named barbra who is not defined by the concepts and ideas she’s more than that and that is what living is and this is what being a human means

that being said this is the final point the movie is trying to convey i think…and this point is only more poignant when we see the ceo in that light if we take what the ceo said in face value he does not fit in this mode of evil capitalism because he rejected several times bad ideas that make money…especially bad ideas that harms the image of what barbie is at the same time their ideas for barbie were all stale because they too can only come up with so many as long as barbie is still in a box",2023-08-19 15:38:19
"theres a wonderful and  up game called pathologic whose entire overarching concept revolves around three protagonists two of them who start out as dolls simple things to play with who march along their intended path as determined by creatures more whole and unknowable and complex than they are how toys and the act of playing is preparing for actual life but simply not sufficient to be considered a living thinking breathing thing that while there are limited paths you can take but even choosing between two prelaid tracks is still a choice and that you the player and the characters cannot become fully fledged and complex humans until you make a choice to stop playing and go outside to touch grass

the genius in the ludonarrative of the game lies in the fact that it is a game made by russians about russia with how much global ire russians are drawing for apparently being so apathetic and disinterested not just in the fate of others but their own fate it ruminates on whether it is possible forfeit so much choice to keep on walking with your head down fearful and disinterested and entirely unwilling to try different paths that you can no longer really even call yourself a human or even cattle because even cattle protest and question things but a toy a toy never does  it just does what its made to do it is what the player says it is it doesnt care it doesnt show curiosity it doesnt ever define itself or even cares to a toy does not use the word i and make a choice it is not interested in change it cannot change

 just ken became an actual person the moment he chose to accept himself as just ken a thinking creature full of potential barbie became an actual human when she chose to leave the game world and well go outside of her play castle and go touch some  grass to leave the simple play world behind where shes safely practiced and played at being a real and complex thing without suffering the consequences of real life and real decisions those who arent ready yet to leave barbie world are still working towards becoming the most complex version of themselves and they too will likely leave when they are ready to make that choice

you yourself are a little more than a toy if you allow people to treat you as one you will stop being a toy and a simple 2d creature when you go and face all that youve been practicing for so answer me this what are you your name who you are today if youre willing to change or evolve from what you are in the future if the answer to this is yes then congratulations of leaving barbieland youre a real human creature making choices about your life and existence to the best of your ability",2023-10-17 13:14:53
"i liked it a lot  also a guy i was a little disappointed because i thought it was gonna be a musical

"oh 100

my friend  i just saw this there’s no subtly  the film beats you over the head with their messages

it takes you out of the movie

parts where barbie is like “they look at me like an object” and “underlying sense of violence ” didn’t need to be said viewers aren’t  even kids pick up on subtlety so it’s just too much 

it would take just a few tweaks to the script  it would’ve been greatly improved

overall still really good but i wish hollywood would stop acting like everyone is  and focus on a smart script 

constantly pointing things out just kills the suspension of disbelief",2023-09-25 01:03:28
nice comparison with the matrix that’s probably what pulled me into the movie so hard,2023-09-24 04:49:45
the scenes where barbie becomes more human  the energy out of the movie it hurt the final product it’s not as rewatchable as it should be,2023-09-25 11:45:46
"at the beginning she believes that her existence has been helping female in the human world 

then she starts having darker  more real feelings 

she goes to the human world and realizes that barbies are not as helpful and inspiring as she thought 

the mom then also tells her that having those new feelings is close to what humans are

finally she says she rather be the creator of an idea than just the idea itself because that way she can change the world which since the beginning she wanted that also accepting all these new feelings that come with being a human",2023-07-21 17:53:47
"it’s not anti male like him and barbie not being together they also show another ken and barbie together so not sure why idiots are getting riled up  the movie is also selfaware

the movie gets right up to the line that an unbalanced biased society is bad  and then just rejects the message and says barbie gets a  happy ending for everyone",2023-07-21 20:53:46
honestly i liked the tween daughter used the word fascist with no understanding of what it means except bad reminded me a lot of posts i see here and on twitter,2023-07-22 23:48:58

i laughed louder than everyone else in the theatre at that one oh my ",2023-07-23 02:59:08
are high school girls incredibly articulate about their developing understanding of culture gender patriarchy consumerism etc  yes,2023-07-24 02:10:58
in the real world women are portrayed as clever heroes battling the patriachy  how is that the reverse of how the idiot kens are shown,2023-07-26 04:23:20
think about how women received the right to vote in 1920 but there were no women on the supreme court until the 80s they even say outright that the kens will one day achieve the same status as women have in the real world i think the parallel is between barbieland and an earlier stage of history with society just beginning to take baby steps towards equality,2023-07-25 19:50:47
i liked when allen beat up those construction workers,2023-07-26 16:28:26
"men don’t define manhood by their relationships imagine an ending scene of a movie where a woman portrayed as an idiot sobs about loving a man  and the man mansplains to her how she should find a purpose and that she’s enough would anyone think that was a happy ending no
well that’s the supposedly happy ending of barbie but with genders reversed",2023-07-29 18:48:39
homie when the final joke of the movie was her going to see an obgyn for her new  i   my pants laughing 1010 flick for me really blew me away,2023-07-31 02:42:44
"despite what the marketing would suggest this is not a movie about female empowerment its a movie about fragile masculinity which still makes it a feminist movie

also barbies plot was about giving up being a plastic ideal inspiration at the price of immortality and instead choosing to be a real messy woman with all the pain and death that brings",2023-07-31 02:21:00
this ken is a skrull,2023-07-21 03:56:20
i think that was supposed to be camp making mattel more real would made less sense in context of the movie since they literally built barbieland and they know that barbies and kens are sentient beings in it and that they know ruth handlers ghost still works in their buildings 17th floor,2023-07-24 03:38:29
"the mattel facility escape scene was fun in a dumb silly way and then i was incredibly infuriated whenever i saw them on screen for the rest of the movie

they contributed nothing they werent funny and they had the same 2 jokes the whole movie

the board meeting was dumb too

i absolutely love this movie but oh my  these suits were not needed at all they werent ever even a threat besides maybe the one scene where the ceo preys on barbies gullibility",2023-07-21 12:35:14
i really teared up at that bus stop scene it was very emotional,2023-07-21 15:56:59
am i wrong or was that actually barbie handler i heard she cameos but i have no idea what she looks like or how old she even is,2023-07-21 14:19:32
"yeah thati havent watched the movie yet just review by thecriticaldrinker on youtube and came here bcz i genuinely thought that it was going to be a good movie and honestly it might be but the ending that you all are talking about like whats the point of a movie if their are no charachter arcs apparently yhe only one being of ken who went from  trash to misogynistic trash then back to  trash when the protagonist was perfect from the beggining

now idk if i should watch it",2023-07-23 16:08:13
yea after the mom and daughter got introduced i thought they’d go more indepth with the characters but they never did,2023-07-24 08:33:08
 i literally thought this was me typing hahaha i was also dressed head to toe in pink and super super super stroked for it it was definitely a surfacelevel portrayal of really tough issues going to try to watch again to see if i view it differently because i really want to love it,2023-07-24 08:38:16
the movie wasn’t particularly good you’re not alone i think unfortunately it turned into a cash grabpander by mattel there isn’t real substance about relationships friendships etc its all patriarchy bad girl good ok great we knew that already boring,2023-07-24 07:25:07
i agree with this the movie isnt bad really it pointed out good topics but i think the ideas are all over the place  or i shouldnt have watched it with high expectations,2023-07-24 14:24:49
"i agree way too many themes i came out of the theater kinda empty it was funny but not a comedy because some theme felt too heavy but at the same time the film lacked depth the film itself felt like it was going through an identity crisis trying to figure out what it is and what it wants to say 

i honestly think the film should have turned the opening scene on its head and show barbie encounter motherhood for the first time barbie has been everything except a mom not that she becomes a mom at the end but maybe exploring and taking more time with the mom and daughter characters sasha and gloria and having barbie see what real life is the good and the bad when ken went off and discovered the patriarchy and went back to barbieland that’s when the movie died for me they went in the wrong direction also the mattel guys were a complete waste of time 

i was excited for the film to be about the female experience from childhood to adulthood the director did a masterful job with ladybird i was expecting that caliber of depth and nuance and heart with barbie 

show women being women and barbie seeing real women in the real world and helping them but also letting them help her how the real world differs from the hyper positivity and femininity of barbieland why it’s good and why it’s bad kinda like enchanted ugh but that’s already been done

unless the story went the opposite direction and the mom and daughter character were brought to barbieland earlier and they have to go on an adventure through barbieland including other barbie locations from the various barbie movies in the end this could have represented the mom and daughter bonding while playing with barbies and marathoning barbie movies over like a weekend not like the “it was all a dream” trope but something similar with symbolism and heart",2023-07-28 04:41:55
it definitely fit with the theme because barbie is portrayed as perfect woman so her having death thoughts means being human and being flawed something women feel pressured not to be since being kids and playing with barbie is a factor that influeces directly on that,2023-07-28 05:23:17
"they should have stuck with the whole barbie having a crisis about who she is it was never really resolved satisfactorily because they just barreled from that theme into heavy handed feminist stuff
seems like an original idea about barbie the doll representing the brand and having a mid life crisis got largely forgotten in the middle of the movie because greta gerwig badly wanted to talk about patriachy",2023-07-28 03:10:16
"saw it last night and i feel similarly not sure it said everything it thought it was saying  


i think the duality was outright stated in the america ferrera speech  women are in a double bind too smart or too  or too much or not enough the movie is in the same bind  is it funny or is it sad is it smart or is it shallow feminist or misandrist maybe this is the point the form being the message but i left feeling like yeah we knew this i liked hearing it out loud but i didnt feel it was a unique commentary  


i also hated the last line for similar reasons the funness of womanhood was celebrated genitalfree for the whole runtime im not sure why it would be the closing sentiment and sign of real womanhood the whole theater laughed and i cringed especially after loving hari the whole time",2023-07-28 15:57:38
"you could really feel the assignment you could really feel greta’s need to please multiple sects of barbie fans and stakeholders it almost felt like a defensively told story it hurts a story or a comedy when you can feel the effort from the filmmaker to get ahead of internet comments or please all kinds of people this happens with ip and reboots it’s a tedious watch for me when i can feel that 

your comment on the last line is a great example of what she was very careful to try to avoid and the audience could feel it in the end you can’t please everyone they’ll always find something so just stay true to your vision in this case and maybe just what the movie needed to be her vision was a scattershot of teachable messages and themes to please all niches of barbie and feminism communities but i’m not sure that’s the most successful approach to telling a story that said this movie is pure marketing and very carefully told to optimize success",2023-07-28 15:59:01
"love the points you bring up in your first couple paragraphs

my question would be was gerwig actually trying to appeal to each of these different groups or was she trying to represent them and the conflict between various groups of feminists to critique both   


my take is i don’t think gerwig intended to have a take on barbie at all barbie represents something different to each character just like in real life i think gerwig did an excellent job in presenting each side in nuanced ways while not shying away from critiquing either one   


take barbie for example she represents new wave girlboss lipstick feminism that reclaims hyperfeminism and abandons traditional gender roles to pursue her own dreams all great in theory yet we also see when she arrives at the real world she quickly learns that this hasn‘t magically solved everyone’s problems in the cafeteria scene barbie is rightfully portrayed as delusional and naive for believing herself to be a feminist savior to all

this rings true of criticisms made against new wave feminism in real life particularly that it promotes unrealistic standards for all but a privileged group of women that the reclaiming of hyperfemininity and sexuality isn’t fighting for a real cause like early feminists did which seems a bit frivolous to focus on especially when other women are literally risking their lives and dying to fight for equality in other parts of the world   


then we have the other side america ferrera’s daughter she represents 2nd wave feminism which rejects femininity as a tool of patriarchy and seeks to uplift women left behind by the first wave of feminism which only fought for white women she brings up great points like how idealized white beauty standards and lack of representation in meds affect nonwhite girls growing up 

which is fine but in the process she displays a certain anger and contempt towards the barbies she refuses to help them at first she rejects pink and makes fun of their clothes as being a result patriarchal brainwashing rather than a rejection of it this also true of real life criticisms of this wave instead of supporting all women and their right to choose what empowers them they end up ”using feminism as a stick to beat over other women’s heads” when they make choices that don’t align with their values 

so i don’t think gerwig intended to appeal to either group i think she attended for both sides to have some selfreflection to do at the end it’s not as simple as one being right and one being wrong they both have valid points and valid criticism 

lastly i would argue that the film refraining from choosing a side as “right” doesn’t mean there isn’t conclusion in fact i would argue that is the conclusion in the end it takes both groups working together to save barbieland from the kens it’s this alliance that makes them successful personally i think think this is a much more powerful message the message that if women stopped fighting each other and instead empowered each other to fight the patriarchy together we could make real change because that’s what feminism is right empowering and supporting women to make choices different from our own",2023-07-28 23:11:51
maybe its okay for a woman making a movie about women for women to mention gynecologists and maybe the trans women members of the audience are largely  totally cool with it,2023-07-29 06:28:03
 totally agree with you about the gyno visit at the end while casting a trans actress,2023-07-29 04:58:49
nobody said it was  it’s the whole movie and portrayal of men which is man hating if it was just the women’s speeches and empowerment stuff it might be preachy but not man hating it’s the way men are portrayed which makes it man hating,2023-07-28 18:58:30
yes the monologues felt preachy and out of place i thought this was a fun movie at timebut the speeches were just buzzkil because they were so  long and it seemed to slow up the movies energy and felt weird and out of place,2023-07-31 09:03:12
"finally somebody understanding the movie how it was meant to be 

im reading the above comments and thinking how did so many of you misunderstood the movie lol the message was loud and clear if youre willing to look at it",2023-08-02 19:40:22
"i feel like everybody saying its misandrist completely missed the point of ken it touches specifically on how life for men isnt all rosy when ken gets to the real world he tries to get respect by getting jobs and is turned down everywhere its only once he cant get this easy respect that he returns to barbie land to overthrow the barbies its a perfect example of how things arent always easy for men in reality and so they turn to something fake to get the validation that they need

x200b

things dont end perfectly but barbie still encourages ken to be his own self instead of what others think he should be",2023-08-02 16:22:34
then the movie its not about barbie its about ken finding himself which is a mirror for women in real life about how they should find themselves idk its a weird plot,2023-08-03 03:35:50
its a great film but youre not getting a thesis out of it,2023-08-03 19:41:10
"also the idea that ruth handler is a feminist icon is kind of laughable she was a capitalist who saw an adult novelty toy for men bild lilli and said to herself i bet little girls want to play with this when her ghost or whatever talks to barbie my eyes almost rolled out of my head

i basically know nothing about her but throughout her scene at the end i couldnt help but think theres no way this isnt one of the biggest white washes ive ever seen",2023-09-09 19:48:08
i did find the ruth handler stuff to be really weird and the part of the film that felt most like a commercial for barbie dolls the end scene with her and barbie where barbie becomes a real person felt like a pat on the back for doll owners all of that playing and makebelieve leads to this moment where your dreams become real that moment felt like the biggest selling point on why audiences should buy barbie dolls and play with them even more than the intro or the fake depression barbie in the middle,2023-09-06 05:30:40
the movie is too self aware for its own good and forgot to have a interesting plot in favor of meta for the sake of meta jokes,2023-09-11 01:24:18
"i mean a big part of the movie is that the kens have been getting treated unfairlyfor awhile its not until it happens to her that she understands it and then they both grow

ruth literally refers to tax crimes when she appears lol",2023-09-06 02:39:56
i think part of the popularity of the film is that it’s not a superhero movie of superheroes battling an evil villain trying to rule the universe or a super spy jumping out of airplanes battling a super villain but rather a totally different story about people’s connections to toys mothers and significant others the story is a bit scattered but is really well done in many scenes with lots of jokes it’s just a different movie from all the others out there,2023-09-17 07:52:52
"the motherdaughter characters

they were the worst part of movie lol they basically booted barbie out of being the main character for most of the movie",2023-09-08 03:35:13
i didn’t know those images were the castcrew’s families that’s actually really cool that scene was the worst part of the movie for me in the theater cuz i thought they were just showing some glorified stock photos of random people being happy lol,2023-09-19 13:37:22
"i loved america ferreras speech about women and the ridiculous standards and expectations placed on us

i assume youre in north america but im genuinely curious do you actually feel these ridiculous standards and expectations in this day and age and is it coming from men and women or primarily other women

i ask because in my industry finance the majority if not all women come in to work with little to no makeup no high heels and its not even a topic of discussion a number of companies within my industry also have mandates to increase the hiring of women so women generally are highly coveted in the workplace i know theres been more of a push now than before but i just have never experienced a situation where a woman has been disadvantaged sexualized yes that may never change unfortunately however a number of the women i speak with mention that they end up using it to their advantage to get what they want ie reaching sales targets 

for what its worth im in my late 20s and i understand that my experience might be limited and thats why im curious to get your thoughts and others",2023-12-16 08:08:57
exactly,2023-12-03 06:41:25
i dont know bro i feel the film does a good enough job of showing men how it could feel to be stripped of everything you think you stand for for the benefit of one type of person that doesnt include you  it allows for men to understand womens struggles and also urge them to put themselves in barbies shoes if men cant grasp the way the movie showcases patriarchy being bad for both men and women when its shown so obviously in this way i cant say its due to filmmakers not making a convincing argument its just a lack of understanding at that point,2023-07-21 22:22:25
"am a genx canadian who grew up on us politics and media and pop culture i grew up on saturday morning cartoons and worked in toy stores when i was young ive always been extremely wary of the influence of the toy and ad industry and its effect on consumers

 this movie was quite odd all in all

not really you kind of nail the point that the movie is just an ad everything about the plot and story is just a convenient way to market dolls to consumers and try to justify it with a meta commentary spin and some fancy sets and dance numbers

 on the one hand the central conflict somewhat acknowledges the struggles of incely men and urges ken to find his own path

its amazing how corporate gaslighting affects american culture using words like patriarchy incels and barbie is mind blowingly  personally no offense to you its criticism of the movie not your comment ryan goslings characters motivations are some hollywood stereotype of an andrew tate type of character

how about the subtle racism in the movie making the black barbie say  giving the black ken a  coat the token black president while in real life black americans are still largely segregated to low income slum communities and exploited by hollywood as ghetto entertainment for suburban white people

 so the movie didn’t really make me feel like the conflict mattered or made sense

why would it everything about this is convoluted and makes zero sense you have to basically ignore reality on multiple levels so why would you even attempt to apply real world politics to this movie it relies heavily on americans  pop politic culture to sell a toy",2023-07-21 22:24:45
yeah i like how the movie was structured and it looked like it was just a huge adcommercial especially with the depression barbie ad,2023-07-21 21:55:41
"i agree with that 

it seemed like the directors wanted to spell out hey having a society dominated by either gender hurts the other but were too afraid to do so 

literally all they would need to change is the ending and show the women in barbie land being the bigger person and letting the kens be equal instead we got uhhh no youre not going to hold any remotely powerful positions in government not even a seat on the supreme court 

it was the petty ending and that causes more division instead of working towards a society with true gender equality",2023-07-22 21:02:46
i absolutely agree with you…,2023-07-22 21:08:05
a strong story  blatant social commentary,2023-07-22 21:01:29
i guarantee you there is at least one person in every theater who needed to hear that “basic” message,2023-07-24 01:18:02
"as a man i realized you have to separate what is real life and what is real world and barbieland  


the movie is about selfdiscovery for barbie and ken develops to have selflove and how he doesnt have to chase and get barbies attention  


ken is me and i am kenough",2023-07-26 21:59:25
yeah men could make a movie with a large cast of women who are all absolute morons doing something wrong and call it satire but i doubt people would be so enthusiastic about that,2023-07-27 03:23:08
"is it at all possible to agree that women absolutely have had it harder and continue to do so in society but feel like the movie missed the mark and it leaves with a bunch of people cheering on the matriarchy

this gives me the feeling that if a switch could be flipped and make society perfectly equitable regarding gender there are people who would not actually want that and would prefer to oppress the nonoppressed",2023-07-27 01:59:15
"this is why i love reddit i liked the movie superficially but when i think deeper about it i didn’t like it really even though i loved loved certain moments but you explained exactly why i didn’t really think it did anything new 

it’s funny you brought up the crying scene bc margot is one of the producers so she herself signed off on it

all that said i liked the movie and it’s tone it mixed the campiness and heavy themes pretty well",2023-08-09 04:42:47
a lot of what you say resonates,2023-08-09 05:10:26
you just vocalized exactly how i felt leaving the theatre tonight but in far better words than i could’ve written up the movie did some things very well but also absolutely missed the mark in several other critical areas,2023-08-09 07:37:18
"a compelling analysis although

 the movie made the mistake that most people that try to portray a matriarchy did in that it just swapped the labels but kept the contents the same and in doing so tiptoed right over the point 

didnt the movie acknowledge this at the end its the key point that resolves the barbieken conflict the kenflict

 will ferrels character would have been such a perfect way to showcase how powerful men enforce negative patriarchal ideals on other men around them while paying lip service to feminism

i thought ferrells ceo character did that what do you think was missing

 how easily a disillusioned and isolated man can miss the nuance and just blame women for his feelings of inadequacy

ken explicitly showed this at the end no

 it would also have been nice to see how ken was able to influence the other men and how some of the barbies might have fallen for it because that absolutely happens in real life

im not sure what you mean here — i thought the movie did exactly this in the sequence after barbiegloriasasha return to barbielandaskendom and one of the barbies lauds how easy it was to not have to make decisions

that said i dont think patriarchy diminishes womens need to decide — far from it i think women instead end up having to make thousands of decisions about how to best suit erratic mens desires —  so i wasnt sure that reasoning landed

your point about selfimage issues and robbie is sharp and i agree with it i think though that gerwig and baumbach were in a bit of a bind i suppose they likely thought that if they had just had barbiemargot feel bad about her selfimage some women might just respond what does someone who looks like margot robbie have to complain about id give them the benefit of the doubt that they were trying to inb4 such a response although their chosen solution wasnt great

to clarify if it helps for context i thought the movie was overall fantastic i thought glorias speech in the ambulance was the best dialogue of its type onscreen since network",2023-08-09 11:07:17
" the feminist message wasnt anything new

weird how we still have to keep repeating it though  weve known women should be equal since at least the 1960s",2023-08-10 13:32:10
i thought the monologue too was pretty cringey but i guess it wasnt written for me totally agree with your suggestions i thought this movie missed so many opportunities for nuance i expected more from greta and noah and it makes me a little sad that such a simplistic concept received so many oohs and ahhs from the masses,2023-08-09 14:35:21
i was sad when i left the movie and you have hit on why i thought thats not how this works thats not how amusing of this works the point is dont be a  human,2023-08-09 03:29:04
"the feminist message wasnt anything new

right why dont feminists just quit its old news

just incase s",2023-08-10 03:12:00
" what is the message barbies can unfair too

some people on twitter had similar views as you and the response was that its a condemnation of both the patriarchy and matriarchy both genders are victims of cultural norms to accumulate power and exploit those more vulnerable men are victims in barbieland and woman are victims in the real world neither are supposed to be aspirational dont know if that is accurate since i havent seen the movie yet",2023-07-22 19:16:51
they werent contradictions they were allegories you were supposed to draw the conclusions you derived to understand the plight of women in a second class world and the paper thin appeasement for equality that exists today,2023-07-22 19:23:08
i think that was intended ending we never learn from mistakes what happened with ken in barbieland happens to quite a women in real world they are promised of equality to be not given eventually ofcourse things are changing but still valid in many parts of world,2023-07-22 19:07:12
it is definitely a hit contradictory imo the barbies in barbieland being allegory for real life men kinda contradicts with the im not pretty enough monologue bit,2023-07-22 19:16:49
i saw it as the contradiction being done purposefully they said something like if they work hard enough the kens can have enough power as the women do in the real world like lets just drive it home harder worked for me i spose,2023-07-22 19:05:15
it would be a lovely allegory for the real world if it was the movie was written to lift that perspective but that sadly wasnt the case its only ok if women do it no,2023-07-22 18:53:52
ugh how do people type like this i hope for your sake your real life personality isnt reflected by comments like this,2023-07-23 20:17:44
kinda threw me off when they decided to flirt with other kens to make their ken jealous and turn them against each other is that how they want to show girl power,2023-07-24 03:32:43
"yeah youre not alone in this i watched it with with my two friends all women too i guess they enjoyed it better than me i honestly didnt have much expectations save for fun times i found funny a few scenes and the choreography wss nice the message is important in its way of course but hmm i dont know i was too confused by most of the movie to fully enjoy it

the mattel guys had some unnecesary screentime and at the end didnt add much theyre supposed to be the typical goofy villains but in all honesty i was wondering wth was going on to really focus the end was also abrupt with barbies wish and other scenes that i wont go full on explaining bc then i would be here all day

i had a few barbies and a ken when i was a kid so i was somehow intrigued how would they do the story it started out okay but then made me think about some aspects in my life which tbh i preferred not to not that its bad to talk about such things its just that it makes it a bit tedious

dont be afraid to show your opinion its not supposed to appeal to everyone it didnt for me",2023-07-24 03:46:43
"wish barbieland became an equal place for both the men and women instead of

the narrator told us the kens were going to work hard and make progress until theyre where women are at irl today

if a watcher already believes the world is a fully equal place today that line means its a happy ending  

if a watcher thinks same amount of power as women has a negative connotation there might be a call to examine why that negative connotation exists and what can we do about that 

on some level its a little weird to think i feel bad that ken is going to end up where 50 of the population is at today isnt it",2023-07-25 01:22:51
i just got back from it and i told my friend i bet a sequel if it gets one will explore equal place for the kens and barbies in barbieland that feels like the natural next step after the plot from this movie,2023-07-25 01:27:28
the resolution to the main plotline literally being repeatedly give the characters an onthenose speech was a bit much for me re telling instead of showing,2023-07-25 00:39:43
"i didnt think the mothers speech was true i wasnt offended by it because it didnt feel like the movie was placing the blame on men but it sounded more like a highly neurotic person acknowledging the problems that every person regardless of  has to face than it did an archetypal woman expressing thoughts that are universal to womanhood

its funny that that she mentioned men get points just for participating while women have to actually work for their goals because i hear that talking point a lot from men but with the sexes reversed the problem is that its a hard claim to quantify and seems largely based on personal observation which in turn is based on your specific culture and surroundings",2023-07-25 01:17:27
"i definitely agree about that speechmonologue every word she delivered was true and a sad reminder of the  that women have to deal with on a daily basis  there’s a lot of moments throughout the film that give us all that extremely important reminder men can   and women are often just expected to deal with it that’s  up and i’m glad this film’s message is as feminist as it is especially knowing that a kid somewhere is gonna be hit hard by it and it will teach them lessons that unfortunately not every parent does 

but  this film about as subtle as a shotgun blast to the fast the film’s message is so deeply important for so many reasons i just wish it wasn’t so simplified and heavyhandedly delivered but hey i’m a 20 year old guy and i’m cynical as  so i know i’m not exactly the target audience for a movie like this",2023-07-25 01:25:47
"barbieland becoming equal was never the answer barbie as a franchise and a land will always be barbie centric

why should barbieland be equal when the real world isn’t

 women can’t even have a fictional land to themselves without people crying it’s not fair…",2023-07-25 01:15:26
i think the children she sees is only part of the picture there were many shots of adult women as well and i just kind of got the general sense that despite it all being a woman  being human and having life is a beautiful thing i think it just started with the children,2023-07-21 23:52:12
"i think it went on one extreme to fight another extreme 

it tried to counter patriarchy with over the top rants about the problems of motherhood and how all men are  

a middle ground would have been more favorable",2023-07-22 06:39:32
what was her message about the patriarchy,2023-07-22 07:28:01
because the wonder of being a human and getting to truly be alive trumps out the societal structure barbie would have to endure,2023-07-23 05:43:09
i think its because she felt feeling human feelings the empowerment happiness fulfillment in helping the barbies find their own power back and taken down the toxic patriarchy and probably felt the desire to keep feeling emotions and keep the empowerment in the real world,2023-07-23 05:58:56
"they even highlighted some of mens issues which is rare for anyone to do these days and without there being accusations of misogyny 

what a bleak commentary on the state of the internet",2023-07-24 00:45:40
"i think the cultural appropriation comment from the daughter is meant to be tongueincheek the daughter also calls barbie a fascist earlier in the film which segues into a joke about how barbie doesnt control the flow of commerce

i took it as a riff on young teenagers who have a general social consciousness but cant express it all that effectively interested in hear other thoughts though",2023-07-31 22:54:36
apparently it was a phrase coined by activist dolores huerta in the 1960s and adopted by the ufw however as a native spanish speaker i was like im sorry what  when she mentioned that,2023-07-31 23:07:13
my eyebrows went up at the smallpox statement could have said the same thing about immunity without referencing intentional genocide i think they tried too hard there to include historical facts  was a mistake,2023-07-31 20:01:48
it was kenough for me,2023-07-23 13:19:19
i had no connection to barbie before this movie beyond general cultural knowledge and i thought it stood on its own quite well really funny throughout and i think most guys can relate to the kens twisted sense of masculinity in a tongue and cheek way like i totally felt called out in the scenes where the kens were explaining the moviesmusic they liked to the barbies my guy friends and i took it with a laugh but there were some people who said the movie was man hating which i didnt think was the case at all but to summarize ryan gosling was literally all of us men,2023-07-25 04:43:48
"i enjoyed it i know nothing about barbie never played with dolls or girls’ toys and have no siblings 

it seemed to me like a pretty clever comedy with harmless jokes about gender stereotypes “high heels  men love gangster movies” i genuinely don’t understand what some of these other dudes are so upset about maybe because i approached it as a comedy about a toy brand and not some kind of dissertation about why men are bad",2023-07-25 13:54:46
my brother and i made barbie fly out of a plastic bag parachute off a brick wall and said she was a skydiver i miss those times a lot,2023-07-25 04:35:39
i loved it my sisters had one or two barbies but did not really play with them in the same way as a lot of women,2023-07-25 08:54:57
yeah i saw it didn’t like it despite the deepness some are reading into it it was very much a man dumb woman good movie every man in it is an idiot or a villain idiot women would hate that if a movie portrayed them the way this movie portrayed men  and in spite of what people might answer their really is no other movie that goes out of its way to rip on the opposite gender as much as this one did,2023-07-25 09:40:03

"i think this is a fair criticism i don’t know if i blanked during her conversation with ruth but that’s where the film explained it and whatever barbie said i didn’t find that convincing either 
 
they were heavily hinting at her disillusionment with barbie land with all her depression  lying around  when it needed fixing so that was leading you to understand why she might want to leave but once it was fixed why not stay 

it would’ve been easy to explain something about her longing for the realness she experienced  the “you’re so beautiful” line to the old lady i just don’t know that they explained it well",2023-08-06 23:11:31

"i was hoping and in hindsight i think it might have been a better message if for the vote they realised that there were equal barbies and equal kens and the deciding vote was allan who is just sick of both sides fighting 

but i guess it might have made it too preachy",2023-08-07 20:15:50
"i was thinking that and this is where i think it’s kind of a gotcha moment to the feminists

they said towards the end that the kens gotta slowly climb to be in the same position of power as the barbies

which is fair since in real life women has to slowly climb the same thing

feminists who supports how the barbies stay in power at the end is missing the point which is that equality is slowly gained",2023-08-07 19:38:25
"wouldnt the point be more about the choice of toystyle of doll depicted that a girl should have choices the fact that the original single option was very motherhood related would be why they went with showing some reject it

its okay for a girl or woman to not wanna be a mother

also the film isnt antimotherhood one of the key characters is one and shes the catalyst for it all and the reason its solved then the film culminates in a montage of girls and mothers thats who wants and who probably buys the toys",2024-02-19 14:14:49

ive never seen her laugh harder than at the guitar playing scene and immediately i was transported back to 99 and remembering all the different guys i witnessed play acoustic guitar at her and her bestie 

it added an extra level of hilarity to the movie because i was laughing at the gag and also laughing for her because i suddenly empathized in a way i hadnt before",2023-07-22 22:56:51

i loved the shots of the ken’s houses that were filled with tvs showing only horses,2023-07-22 16:23:46
i was a little surprised by how mean spirited they were towards ken at the end like how they didnt let him on the supreme court but made him settle for a circuit court first but then the narrarator said ken would have the same rights in barbieworld as women had in out world and it turns out the supreme court in the real world didnt have a single woman judge for the first 198 years the mean spirited satire illuminates the mean spirited reality were just not used to seeing it inflicted on men it makes me wonder why were  to seeing women treated like that,2023-07-23 14:05:42
"definitely agree with you re gloria initially her motivations are about not being connected with her daughter and feeling sadlost  but its not really clear that this is ever meaningfully resolved gloria and the daughter seem to have a better relationship at the end of the movie for no particular reason the daughter is a staunch opposer of barbie initially but drops this immediately upon getting to barbieland gloria is central to resolving the plot with her speeches but we never really get a great sense of why gloria even feels that way except a generic all women feel this way implied reasoning it doesnt seem to have a lot to do with either her quasisuicidal thoughts or her relationship with her daughter and then as you say we dont really get a resolution to glorias plotline

i enjoyed it in lots of ways there were lots of good parts and it was good fun worth the price of a cinema ticket but you have to kind of squint around the plot sometimes because too much is packed in and a lot of it goes somewhat unaddressed",2023-07-24 17:54:00

it felt very different from her other movies still well made but if didnt tell me it was directed by her i couldnt tell tbh,2023-09-19 03:18:29
"yeah it felt a lot like the film couldnt decide what kind of film it wanted to be or which audience it wanted to be targeted towards

every time will farrell showed up i was like oh yeah this is supposed to be a kids movie

i think its a good film just dont know if i thoroughly enjoyed it",2023-07-21 09:55:04
"then what idea does farerra pitch at the very end that is so great that farrell hates until he learns itll be profitable average barbie the thing that exists and we spent a whole movie on stereotypical barbie

stereotypical barbie isnt the average woman shes the archetypical barbie shes perfect her days are perfect her house is perfect her food is perfect she lives a life of leisure everything about her is the perfect encapsulation of what it is to be a classic barbie doll

average barbie is barbie with a job that shes working because she needs the money rather than because its what she aspires to in a house thats good enough for now whos just trying to get through the day with some happy thoughts

ken goes into the real world and learns about patriarchy but sees that the real world doesnt actually work like that kens have no jobs or positions of power in barbieland but women have jobs in the real world he runs into a doctor but he arbitrarily asks to see the real doctor ie a man because he just learned of patriarchy despite having lived a life where women are doctors he goes around and asks to do surgery but learns that he cant do that just because hes a man he needs credentials so how is he still believing in patriarchy and trying to push it in barbieland when most of what he has experienced condradicts it

most of what hes experienced hasnt contradicted it what he likes about patriarchy is that it makes him feel validated as a man hes not and ken under patriarchy he thinks it could be ken and barbie",2023-07-22 11:38:40
this is the most thoughtful criticism i’ve seen so far and i respect your opinions even if i don’t agree with all of them,2023-07-22 12:09:40
"ken is so inconsistent he wants barbies approval but ditches her in the real world for patriarchy

umm its exactly problem many young men have they were taught to define themselves by how good they can get a women ken thought he was nothing unless he could get barbie

but ditches her in the real world for patriarchy

ken didnt ditch her for the patriachy he thought patriachy would help him get her do you think young men love the patriachy and showing themselves as alpha because they hate women no they think patriachy will help them get the girls 

in the end ken is me is what barbie wanted ken and young men to understand we dont need to be men there is no single definition of men that young men have to try to be man is me is what the misled young men needs to learn

x200b

the movie shows the problem young misled men have as much as it show the womens side",2023-07-22 12:03:56
calm down bro it’s a movie about a doll,2023-07-22 11:29:09

if i had a criticism it would be that it maybe needed a clearer take home message i really appriciated the multiple layers of social commentary but from the reception by general audiences it maybe would have benefited by being dumbed down just a little,2023-07-31 17:23:26

this is such an excellent way of summarizing the problem with this movie",2023-07-22 11:08:40
its kind of the same choice she was presented with at the beginning but this time she chooses something flawed and real and beautiful over the safe and perfect,2023-07-23 04:34:33

my thinking is the girl who owns ken is a horse girl which makes him a horse guy kinda like the song in the car with barbie she likes that song so barbie likes that song,2023-07-27 06:25:57
"glorias speech at the end relied on the real world too much  no men treated glora bad in the movie only person who interacted with her was real nice to her and her husband seems cool too while it was meaningful it didnt feel that personal

yeah it kind of read like an essay rather than something from the character herself  


it was her own self loathing and doubt that messed with barbie lol we dont actually see gloria struggle at all or be mistreated its kinda like the joker complaining about society vaguely but its enough to resonate with people i guess",2023-09-08 03:54:35
"see i feel like these kind of speeches reflect on women as an entity but in the real world a single woman doesn’t experience all of this there are a bunch of subliminal messages that say women have to do it all but who in your life is pushing these messages onto you as an individual no one’s ever called me a  for rejecting someone and no one’s said you have to be thin but call it healthy and no one’s saying that you have to have a career and be a super mom and be a billion different things 

i don’t remember the rest but the only thing that i can see people actually genuinely relating to is the thing abt weight and that’s usually from family which sucks but like i’ll get over it",2023-09-07 00:14:53
i think its not about people being mean to each other more about people manitulating people or taking them into submission for granted,2023-08-30 11:33:09
there was a throwaway line when she appeared in barbieland from will ferrel’s character “her ghost haunts an office on the 17th floor”,2023-09-17 06:50:56
"yeaaaaah that was a messy bit of the ending ive seen a lot of articles have the take that the ken arc is about male fragility and yes there is that to a degree but also you got a society where the kens are forced to be all uneducated beach bums with no places to live and are literally just objects to the barbies which is unarguably bad and unequal

kens solution to this is of course bad but the state things are left in at the end of the movie is basically and then the barbies told them they were equal now but just made their matriarchy more subtle which its like given the rest of the movie it raises the question if this is supposed to be a the struggle for equality is an uphill battle in which even the most benevolent ruling class will always try their best to maintain power message ending or a actually this is how things should be message ending or a this will really  a certain group of men on the internet trolollolololol male tears message ending",2023-07-22 06:08:27
i agree the messages were inconsistent and as a whole incoherent together the movie was fun and funny and had great scenes and some powerful notions but didnt really tie together,2023-07-22 05:20:44
totally agree there was a few moments where i thought ken made kendom because he saw a world where he wasnt a second class citizen  it disappointed me when it turns out he was actually just upset barbie wouldnt marry him  also kinda weird the barbies took back democracy via voter suppression  that said the visuals and the humor of the movie more than made up for the heavy handednessbad messaging i loved it,2023-07-22 05:45:00
"my take on kens in barbieland isnt so much that they have to be suppressed for barbieland to be restored  im pretty sure there was someone there who said to restore the world but not like how it was before 

barbieland has had women working their whole lives and the kens have never worked a day in their life other than beaching they wanted equal seating with barbie in congress in the end the barbies offered an entry job so that they can eventually catch up 

in a presumed patriarchy real world women would be expected to work entry level jobs too and work themselves up it would be fair that way so i thought it was reasonable for it to happen to kens too

i overall liked the movie a lot though i did feel a little weird at the end too i think for me it was more about them packing too much in trying to tackle too many concepts associated with the barbie brand in too little time",2023-07-22 07:02:49
" the barbies insisted on resubjugating the kens

i mean the narrator told us theyd make progress over time and end up in the same position women are at in the real world does that sound like a bad end to people watching for some reason if so why

im pretty sure thats what the movie wanted people to ask when they chose to end that part on that joke

yet when the kens do the same thing when they are even more repressed in barbieland they are vilified and their work must be undone to restore barbieland

i did not have the impression that the original barbieland was considered to be an actual utopia either both versions had issues that were apparent by the end and i think thats a decent part of why barbie chose to leave 

in the new barbieland kens were eventually going to work their way up like women did to wield as much power as women do in the real world if it feels like thats a bad thing the whys should probably be examined 

plenty of inspirational movies end on a and thats how women gained the right to wear jeans typenote and thats typically considered to be a good ending in the context of the time and setting theyre starting from right

therefore it follows logically that… men in the real world should stop women’s efforts to gain their own rights and power or should men just be subjected in both worlds

they didnt give a speech about the contradictions men face re expectations like the barbies got but i think the subtext was there on purpose

the ceo for example was pretty sincere in his efforts to not put profits before legitimate attempts to advance female empowerment",2023-07-22 05:41:53
i also felt like the mattel guys were the weakest part of the movie,2023-07-28 21:20:43
you nailed my exact thoughts and feelings about it too kind of clever not very funny zero subtlety whatsoever and yep super random,2023-07-28 09:18:58
i was trying to explain this to my wife who loved it and grew up with barbie that they basically squandered a  brilliant possibility that sounds like an entendre maybe double like jesus christ the fact that that line made it into the final cut tells you a lot i felt that the overall message of the movie was good but the way they went about doing it was so heavyhanded ken is treated like a pos the whole time and instead of acknowledging that he is treated poorly they villianize him for bringing the patriarchy and then are very conniving in overthrowing ken like they missed the vote so its totally cool to have a governing body make a decision when half the people werent even there just so  and sending a terrible message and at the end ken asks for one supreme court seat just to be represented and they are like  no you can be an assistant it just felt very combative towards ken just for the sake of being combative it makes me feel the movie promoted  vs them mentality and not a we all can live together happily by respecting each other,2023-07-28 10:57:07
i teared up but felt it was achieved so cheaply with the real life montage and music its like a procter and gamble commercial,2023-07-29 06:28:50
the dialogue in the early barbie bits confused me quite a bit up until the reveal of who was playing with the barbies i really thought the dialogue was that of a couple of young girls playing because it came off as deliberately childish and aloof like the “beach off” scene i could see a kid mishearing “beat off” and thinking that it’s some kind of beach challenge but the person playing in that time is an adult woman,2023-07-28 14:55:26
on the first viewing i did feel like the movie was a bit hard to pin down like you did i watched it again  realized it’s more of a silly film with a mosaic of reflections on our society because the messages are so strong it feels like it’s supposed to lead you through a straightforward narrative but then it cuts into the fantasy of barbie world that doesn’t follow logic or reason anyways to me the movie is about barbie becoming disillusioned by what her narrative is supposed to be she was created to be an empowering feminist woman to humans  realizes she’s kind of irrelevant  maybe even harmful in the real world this leads her to having an existential crisis “what was i made for” the movie ends with her wanting to become human so she can learn what it actually means to be feminist,2023-08-15 19:27:46
i think goslings ken enjoyed his experience in the real world how he was treated and didnt know that was possible he goes back and shares it with the others others now know and want the same thing dynamics shift and whatever parallel magic between the two worlds happen,2023-07-22 06:23:47
it seemed like it was basically treated like a virus that caused the barbies and kens act the way they think theyre expected to act in a patriarchy of which ken could only bring back limited surface knowledge of to spread around,2023-07-22 06:39:48
"i think a lot of people didnt do their research and expected some cutesy kids movie instead of an absurdist surreal film which actually has some pretty mature philosophical themes 

i enjoyed it a lot but i could tell a lot of the younger kids in my theater were bored or restless this really is more of a movie for older teens and adults",2023-07-23 15:29:53
my friend and i were the only people laughing at jokes in 100 seat theatres mostly filled with women granted im in india and some of the jokes just dont translate well but still i expected women to get some of it but at least everyone was cheering for gosling,2023-07-23 16:10:30
i wondered toward the end there if the message wasn’t about equality or gender—that stuff was just distracting parody—but that you can be whoever you want to be barbie chose to be human ken chose to be ken,2023-07-26 06:48:36
"i think as you sit with it or eventually rewatch it youll find there was a smidgen of nuance hiding under the bright pink misandry and blatant toy advertisements 

there were the super overt themes that got monologued about there were also some others hiding in there in characters like allan and weird barbie",2023-07-26 07:00:05
"  don’t know why but i feel sad and disappointed that barbie became a human at the end

she had to  the entire movie was 2001 a space odyssey but in pink corporate overtones  the opening sequence made it obvious  but ryan g ken was hal  basically a machine that when it realized what was going on instantly decided that destruction of barbie world was the most logical choice given the information he was given at the library  barbie at the end evolves into her next form just like the main character in 2001 evolved into the star child at the end of 2001",2023-07-29 15:15:18
"barbie wasn’t trying to find a perfect existence she was seeking death 

gloria turned her into “irrepressible thoughts of death barbie”

she met an ancient woman and smiled big and said you’re beautiful she met a ghost and said make me like you 

love the whole  i want to be the creature that makes meaning but maybe part of that for her was experiencing mortalitythe path to death",2023-07-30 02:56:27
"hate to disagree with you but i was so so glad that the movie was not just barbie and ken having adventures in the real world that would have been such a much more boring movie that one expects it to be there’s plenty of movies from the 80s that has this you can watch we didn’t need to see that 

nobody expected this and just so original",2023-07-30 13:42:31
oh and one more thing i remember my friends barbie’s we played with ken having brown hair i guess from the googling i’ve been doing they released a new one in 2005 “the new ken” who had blonde hair but we were playing with them before 2005 i just don’t think gosling suits the blonde at all brown hair would have made him way more attractive in my humble opinion i think we had this guy as i definitely remember the plastic hair and this guy who was always mr friend’s barbie husband and i got plastic hair ken because my barbie was only dating not married yet we also had the magnet pregnant tummy midge and i played withkm her a lottttt great memories,2023-07-28 18:03:12
but if thats the message then making this movie is wrong or at least a waste of time would greta be happy as a ken complacent should she be,2023-07-21 11:22:23
way too much going on they needed to tighten it up,2023-07-23 15:26:04
its pg13 its not for kids,2023-07-27 12:53:41
"totally agree with this opinion i could tell i was supposed to feel emotional but i really had no connection to the characters because i guess they did well to make them out to be two dimensional toylike characters the old bird saying youre like a daughter wasnt enough for me to sympathise it really felt like there were no stakes i expected the lady and her daughter to have some depth to them but that totally fizzled into nothing

it felt like a shallow film i knew not to expect anything else and enjoyed it for what it was but i guess the hype gave me unreasonable expectations",2023-07-27 13:04:31
"i dont think people cried about the feminism stuff  it felt very tongue in cheek and campy to me 

there was also all the stuff about no longer wanting to be an idea about connecting with being human and all the good and bad that comes along with it  thats the stuff that made me cry",2023-07-27 08:36:48
i couldn’t agree more,2023-07-27 08:17:03
i am a 25 year old man and i was bawling kens arc was so moving i feel many men including myself feel that they arent enough prior to extensive therapy i used to feel i needed a partner to have value as a human i felt so much joy for ken and his journey i get emotional just thinking about it i am kenough,2023-07-27 08:46:38
i think you misread the ending the point wasnt that matriarchy is a corrective to patriarchy the point was that both the real world and barbieland are flawed and theres room for improvement the audience wasnt supposed to think that oppressing the kens was ok the movie was just showing that barbieland is the inverse of the real world similarly i dont think the movie condoned the barbies manipulation of the kens it was more about illustrating the dysfunctions that arise in any gender hierarchy and barbie even apologizes to ken for this,2023-08-22 21:28:43
"to address your first point barbie world is supposed to be an inverse of the real world they did mention in the movie that kens could start having equal influence in barbie world when women have equal influence in the real world 

as for your second point i get what you’re saying and while it was a jab at the “fragile male ego” to me it was also an inverse representation of all the women stereotypes constantly portrayed in media plus i thought it was hilarious that they started out “fighting” each other but then breaking out into synchronized dance  and ultimately it was that which made them miss the vote for the barbie land constitution 

honestly i thought this movie was so well done all around",2023-08-21 04:46:17
" the way barbies emotionally manipulated the kens against each other

i loved the movie and am a big time feminist but this plot point bothered me a bit too whereas your concern was that people might think those types of manipulative games are ok my concern was that people would think wow that manipulation is bad and of course its exactly the sort of thing women would do because women are terrible like that and even the barbie movie admits it

sure some women and men might do something like that to make a love interest jealous and get their attention which isnt good but can happen especially when people are younger but doing that specifically to get the men angry with each other thats a different thing in reality a woman doing what the barbies did would risk the spurned man turning his anger on her for flirting with another guy it would be giving the spurned man 2 potential targets for his anger either the other guy or her and itd just be bad strategy to put yourself in the mix as a possible target that way if the whole purpose is to get the men fighting each other   

the barbies were like oh of course were women so naturally well rely solely on our specific feminine wiles to manipulate these men i mean acting like that is the sort of thing such allegedly accomplished women would do didnt seem very feminist to me they could have gotten the kens fighting with each other over any thing that men might be inclined to argue or fight over like psst ken that other ken said that your favorite horse sucks and he thinks your take on the godfather is trash and that you  at guitar or something",2023-08-27 01:06:15
oh my  when the massive barbie came into frame and they all started smashing the  out of their dolls i nearly lost my breath laughing,2023-07-21 12:29:20
this sequence was released as an early trailer and when i saw it i decided i had to watch this movie,2023-07-21 15:08:58
i imagine all the kids in my screening were so confused but i can’t wait until they watch 2001 in a few years time and that scene looks so familiar to them,2023-07-21 12:55:39
"all the songs felt a bit unattached to me

including the ones where they just sang what was happening on screen",2023-07-21 20:56:11
"i was at the drive in and it was packed a lot of people and their windows down and we could hear the reactions of people throughout the whole movie 

i go to the drive in theatre all the time have for years have never been able to hear other peoples reactions like that have also never seen it packed during thundershowers until tonight",2023-07-22 03:18:36
same you could hear lots of sniffling and sobbing during it,2023-07-22 02:50:10
so funny how different my experience was at a theater in a conservative part of the south…no one cheered and the whole place was dead silent during that part ,2023-07-22 03:27:53
mine clapped it was  amazing,2023-07-22 03:11:32
i felt like it definitely could have been a cheering moment but my theatre stayed quiet,2023-07-22 04:44:50
aqua was in the credits,2023-07-22 11:28:09
the credits song with nicki minaj and ice spice samples it,2023-07-22 11:26:55
what was the message exactly the barbies went back to having a matriarchy and called it a win with no self reflection that it was just as bad as what the kens tried to do laughing it off and giving them a few token positions the mom went on a fair enough rant about the pressures on women from patriarchy but it was never acknowledged that it puts pressures on kens too trans men ive talked with have told me the set of societal expectations they encountered is a different kind of pressure but still a significant one the kens didnt even have homes to live in and all they got was you need to find your own identities and a pat on the back the writers could have done something with allen feeling alienated by the expectation of masculinity but he was just laughed off and not allowed to leave feminine men are still acceptable punching bags right the only positive part was the realistic expectations barbie toy at the end the movie sets back feminism if anything with its tired tropes of treating men like bumbling slapstick and presenting some kind of inverted power structure as a goal instead of having the courage to imagine anything thats better for everyone,2023-07-23 19:36:23
yeah i think the film would have been 100x better if it was just about barbie helping the mom and daughter connect all the ken stuff was a weird distraction,2023-07-26 01:40:02
"but doesn’t everyone feel how she was feeling in the speech at least sometimes

my only issue with the movie is how that speech gendered feelings that are universal to the human condition women don’t own feelings of societal pressures and hypocrisy",2023-07-27 12:34:22
"but it was like yeah i dont really get it but that must  im sorry youre going through that

yeah i had the same feeling  i spoke to my wife about it afterwards and she said only some of that speech connected with her but she felt overall it was a bit over the top  obviously different experiences across the world but it was eye opening at least",2023-07-27 08:33:31
don’t worry my guy i read what you said about you specifically not feeling that way over the speech i think the other comments missed that part,2023-07-28 00:40:19
i am a man and i 100 agree with you i was crying in the movie theater i found kens arc to be absolutely beautiful,2023-07-27 08:43:05
"i don’t want this to come across as being angry or vitriolic i completely understand your feelings but for a lot of us the guys who’s first instinct is “but i’m not like that” is part of the problem 

women rarely ever say “all men are like this” yet people seem to assume that we mean it that way when people talk about how female  predators get away with their crimes much more frequently than men my first instinct isn’t to say “i don’t understand that at all i would never do that” 

it’s really great to know that you wouldn’t be friends with guys who behave badly towards women but it would also be nice if in your online discourse it was less about how you can’t relate and more about empathizing with the women who experience it",2023-07-27 13:38:46
" i feel like its an attack on me and i feel like its unfair because i dont cat call and if my buddy catcalled he wouldnt be my buddy for long

so why do you feel its an attack on you if you dont do any of the bad things america says in her speech lol",2023-07-27 23:34:44
"i encourage y’all to get a diary so y’all can keep some things to yourselves 

this whole post comes across as…dumb 

if you feel targeted then you are one of the men they are talking about",2023-07-27 23:01:29
also the kens had an epiphany that they could be themselves instead of trying to please other people,2023-07-28 17:57:05
except ken dont have all the privilege women have in the real world,2023-07-28 21:57:39
"everyone knows it’s a satire  it’s just a downer and given the kens also just played the role of patriarchs it’s mixed messages how can we feel sorry for characters who just assumed the villain role  they were representing the patriarchy but now they’re representing women mixed messaging

people are mad that the whole film portrays men and kens as morons doing bad stuff nobody misinterpreted the ending they get it  it’s just that it’s a  barbie movie and people want a happy ending not that  i would suggest a dystopian sci fi type ending isn’t what a lot of people go to the barbie movie for it would be like if the flinstones movie ended with fred and wilma divorcing or something a downer",2023-07-28 19:06:56
that was mermaid barbie what do you mean,2023-07-31 02:56:36
"yknownow that you mention itthe monologue about womens struggle does feel more like a peoples pleaser problem than a womans i aint saying that those are not issues faced by women but likeif you wanna be a momwhy do you care about judgment for not choosing your career



as a man i have to mention that stuff like this happens to us as well if youre not a familist and focus on your career a real man spends time with his family if you are family oriented a man provides just pick one and fight that battle ok if someone wants to be an  they will find a reason to be",2023-07-30 23:24:13
"again totally don’t get why she chose to be a human

because she’s irrepressible thoughts of death barbie  wants to die let her ",2023-07-31 02:57:56
it’s because in 2023 this director simply couldn’t stand the idea of barbie actually having feelings for ken even though that’s been the way people have thought of them for more than 50 years,2023-07-30 14:05:45
"it played on a lot of gender stereotypes on purpose the men being into big trucks horses the godfather playing guitar at them did you listen to those lyrics the song was a hilarious spoof on romantic songs etc the line at the end when kens asked for more power was  paraphrasing  the barbies decided to give kens all the power women had in the real world thats why the power they got was limited and seemed tokenistic at best  its a reflection on how lots of women feel in the real world 

as for the relationship between ken and barbie i saw it as a typical friendzone kind of thing barbie never showed any romantic interest in ken but he had this idea in his head that his purpose was to be her boyfriend and didnt know what to do with himself when it became clear that he wouldnt get what he wanted his song also played on the stereotype of the nice guy who gets friendzoned and thinks he deserves something just because hes nice  all my life ive been polite but ill sleep alone tonight  but doesnt bring much to the table  im so great at doing stuff 

all in all i think the message of the movie was a bit convoluted and at some point i think greta tried to say too much and ended up saying too little i dont know where the idea that this movie is some sort of paragon of feminism and whatnot came from but i think its being held at too high a standard its supposed to be colourful joyful silly and entertaining with some serious moments thrown in there for good measure 

all in all i think the look of the movie was great the actors all gave a fantastic performance particularly loved ryan gosling and the soundtrack was really catchy im listening to it right now",2023-07-30 20:12:44
" the happy ending is the kens continuing to be oppressed just slightly less

its basically a jab at modern corporate feminism when they say they acknowledge your struggle and maybe even do some action but it barely changes anything for the oppressed",2023-07-31 07:58:59
i didn’t get that one bit,2023-08-05 04:30:57
i did not realize until this comment that brewski is a brand of beer i thought they were just being bros calling it a brewski,2023-08-15 03:23:38
the joke at the end is that barbieland exactly mirrors the real world,2023-07-29 17:22:40
"of course no reasonable man would want this movie’s ending  that’s the whole point  

the movie explicitly states kens will get the same level of equal treatment women do in the real world 

the whole point it to highlight to you a human being that no one would choose to accept the position women currently have in our modern society and that no it’s not equal or fair  

and if you’re upset at the idea of kens getting exactly what women actually get well that’s the whole freaking point 

that it’s an upsetting state of things",2023-07-30 03:57:30
that’s the joke mirroring our world…,2023-07-30 13:10:46
"i disagree i dont think this film has proper happy ending and thats ok its not a film for children in which the sistem with a predominion of one gender on the other can be easly resolved in the last ten minutes it looks more like a starting point

the film brought the kens from having nothing and living only for barbies to have a necessity to mature an indipendent sense of self and worth but that is not enough if the kens want to be represented and have power they have to actually work for it the barbie will not simply land them equal rapresentation because they saw their errors and asked nicely this time thats not how the real word works and barbieland is a mirror of that thats why it leaves you with a bitter taste when women started to ask for more representation men didnt simply give it away for free changing a sistem is hard and the barbies élite and leadership is no more illuminated and open to change than the real world élite",2023-07-29 22:26:17
i agree with almost everything you’re saying i don’t think it’s problematic at all because the movie agrees with you,2023-07-29 20:33:27
"the whole political and feminist point of the movie is that a gender ruling over the other is harmful with all that implies no matter which gender it is 

kens in barbieland are treated like women in real life the narrator says as much when the kens are given that position of power at the end of the movie you only get this much and then you can work towards a bigger position just like women in the real world

the movie says very explicitly that patriarchy is very bad for men too and when barbie is talking to ken at the end she is basically encouraging him to find his new identity into a contemporary era outside of the binary gender norms 

if you felt like the kens were being treated unfairly in barbieland you felt uncomfortable with it like you are just being treated for the ken you represent and not for the person you are then you know how women feel everyday",2023-07-29 22:14:38
its a hegelian dialectic the kens have a revolution the barbies mount a counterrevolution the world order is synthesized in the kens getting a higher degree of rights than before but still being shy of equality very emblematic of how social justice works in the real world,2023-07-30 18:54:53
yeah trying to make sense of the story is useless it doesn’t  what about the whole connection to the real world and travelling from the real world to barbieland what was that  she fears being put in a box to go back to barbieland as she had originally hoped to and then eventually just goes back anyways  and the whole box thing wasnt clearly explained  it’s a kinda fun movie at parts but you have to turn your brain off,2023-07-29 21:31:13
highly agreed the implication that kensmen cant run a land well enough to keep it is horrible,2023-07-30 17:02:02
what are your other two favorites,2023-07-21 11:42:00
aaaah i saw it last night and loved it but don’t actually remember the last spoken word  what was it,2023-07-21 12:40:12
no competition to elemental and hankypanky,2023-07-21 14:59:20
yeah barbie really does get lost in the shuffle once the second act is reframed around ken,2023-07-22 15:57:21
exactly thats the problem right there way to take a female experience greta and make it all about men  way to go,2023-07-22 16:35:29
men really don’t expect western women to be career driven leaders society at large doesn’t either maybe some women expect it and then get upset by their own expectations of themselves idk it’s just weird to me that this movie is insisting there’s so much pressure on women to be awesome leaders from who the same women who are complaining about the pressure,2023-07-28 18:57:11
"also the humour wasnt my cup of tea but if you think shows like friends and big bang theory are funny then maybe you might enjoy these onthenose jokes its not like i was hoping for witty jokes but these just felt so lame like is the flatfootgaggingscene funny the kens threatening to beach each other i just dont get what im supposed to be laughing at

also i personally didnt like the soundtrack billies song is great but i was expecting the others to be better idk and other movies with musical numbers have had amazing music off the top of my head grease la la land willie wonka and the chocolate factory greatest showman all disney animated and original movies etc i feel like if youre gonna put in a musical number it has to be exceptional",2023-07-28 16:58:51
look i cant criticize you cuz i am a male and you are a woman but most females watched this movie feel proud and empowered by the feminism again not manhating wisdoms of this movie,2023-07-28 17:22:14
" i felt the feminist stuff was too much

i didnt mind the feminist stuff they live in barbieland after all and it helped set up the patriarchy storyline

but then they decided to turn kendom back into barbieland to replace a genderist society with another genderist society and thats where i felt they missed a trick

they focused so much on making barbie human that they missed a chance to have a meaningful discussion about equality

i enjoyed the movie and will go see it again but i was confused what they were going for",2023-08-04 13:18:09
they say the kens can maybe have the equality of women in real life  sassing that yes they can be equal there when the real world reflects it until then women can have their space in barbie world,2023-08-19 19:59:38
yeah that cultural appropriation bit had completely bewildered perhaps spanish speaking people know better,2023-07-21 12:11:06
"i think the normalcy with which the mattel executives looked at the situation the dolls their company makes have their own world and can cross over into each other was abstract and of course all the logic om barbieland itself including how the kens interpreted patriarchy 

the narrative itself was very cliché but also purely a vehicle to move to the scenes gerwig wanted to tell",2023-07-21 14:31:40
"i think the reason people are saying this is because this is a movie produced by a toy company and distributed by warner brothers one of the largest movie studios in the world and had a huge marketing budget

"i think a significant chunk of them are lying to try to make their opinion seem more “legitimate”

"watched it with my girlfriend and her friends and one of the other girls boyfriends

we all loved it",2023-07-22 12:31:44
i think too many people forget that this movie is about a collection of barbie dolls it doesnt need to connect with reallife issues in any way little girls and boys played with these dolls and used their imaginations to create the scenarios in which the barbie dolls lived why must it be on the nose about realworld social issues i think adults sometimes forget about what its like to be a kid and to use your imagination to create a world separate from reality,2023-07-22 12:43:16

edit thanks for the explanation guys",2023-07-23 07:37:28
its hard to tell how self aware the film is about its own hypocrisy but it seems very barbie as a brand is bad corporate feminism and movie knows that so i feel like theres a lot of self aware choices that are great commentary,2023-07-23 12:16:20
i think because in barbieland women are allowed to be diverse whereas men have to fit into the same box of the female gaze of ideals just like women are pressured to do in the real world,2023-07-23 11:28:29
because there hasnt been a canonically manufactured plus sized ken so far while there has been a quite a few plus sized barbie already,2023-07-23 10:51:13
"the movie skipped over the main complaint over the years against barbie which is that it’s bad or girls body image so it could focus on gerwigs obsession with feminism and men doing stuff

would have been better if it just focused on women and the barbies more instead of trying to make some kind of comment on men which just came off bitter and unclear",2023-07-23 14:30:51
"if this movie tried to promote that its okay or should be okay for women not to be perfect why wasnt there any plussized ken people

because it turns gender norms on its head  man in swimming trunks no one bats an eye average day  
 woman in a swimsuit stares  why on earth as in this shouldnt be the case but its viewed like that not to mention how women are as a result more obsessed with how they look and present than men typically  


in barbieland this burden falls on the kens they have to fit into the perfect ideal of a man for the barbies and that is if a barbie even cares to look at them and making a barbie think they look handsome and acknowledge them is made to seem their entire days goal  


sounds familiar",2023-07-23 14:51:52

" are there really some guys who are  off that this movie makes a joke out of men

i think a lot of people get triggered over the word patriarchy

spent a while in another sub trying to help a guy understand while he was adamant that he did understand while also showing no signs that he did

i think some people see a film with men as antagonists and think its a criticism of all men the film isnt about men",2023-07-24 14:04:29
i’ve found in my experience that there are some ken men that cannot stand the prospect of being confronted on a system that’s mainly benefitted them  there are elements of patriarchy that exists obviously not as in your face as the movie is probably portraying,2023-07-24 16:21:48
" or is it that the movie claims the patriarchy to exist at all


im  that theyve conclusively proven that the patriarchy has nothing to do with horses

all of my dreams destroyed",2023-07-24 19:21:40
ultimately i see it as a comedy first and then social commentary second while it dealt with heavy topics the film uses it as a facade to deliver its punchlines it got laughs out of audiences and if it made them think about feminismsociety in general then i suppose its an added bonus,2023-07-24 16:14:42
kids in the cinema were screaming no barbie dont do that at the scene where she decided to become human i agree it made no sense and felt forced,2023-07-25 02:08:55
i agree i think they did it just for the gynaecologist joke,2023-07-24 23:14:50
"yes i did not understand this choice at all i thought there was going to be a big speech about how the meaning of barbie changes with time and she’s sort of a cypher for girls or whomever to project upon and put their hopes and dreams into like america ferrera did and how she wasn’t just stereotypical and basic and she was meaningful and blah blah whatever i thought it was going to explain why barbie was special and i thought that would’ve been much better

i did laugh at the gynecologist joke though but still 100 agree i thought this movie was really good but jjst good and not great but still really good",2023-07-25 03:42:44
the thing that set the whole movie in motion was her starting to become more human and less dolllike the flat feet waking up with bedhead and morning breath thinking about death then in the real world she is moved to tears by seeing people around her have a variety of good and bad experiences something that doesnt exist in barbieland and is overjoyed at seeing an old woman another thing missing from barbieland and calls her beautiful she starts to get into the box and mattel but then decides thats not what she wants  very on the nose barbie becoming human was literally the aplot i dont understand how so many people are saying it came out of nowhere,2023-07-25 03:45:51
"i assume alan turned into a fighting machine so that he could have some redeeming non sensitivitiesoft qualities in doing so he would help round out the other 99 of men in the movie that were portrayed as mindless misogynistic idiots alan was used as a scapegoat for “not all men” are like this 

really the only attempt at an explanation",2023-07-25 16:33:10
"i felt that the box scene is supposed to parallel the matrix much like the choose the high heel or the birkenstock scene if she gets in the box then everything can go back to how it was maybe she is reset or destroyed by mattel but she wants to continue to think freely and eventually become human 

barbieland was previously like a simulation where everyone thought they knew what the real world was like after visiting the real world barbie starts to wake up to what the point of her existence really is",2023-07-25 15:51:06
a great percentage of it the entire third act is basically where he shines the most,2023-07-25 23:47:41
at least 75 only robbie had more screen time,2023-07-25 23:45:37
yes but he is just a hook there is a lot more to love in it,2023-07-25 22:48:29
he carries this movie imo,2023-07-25 22:57:50
nope,2023-07-26 03:41:42
he carries the movie,2023-07-25 22:43:06
yes,2023-07-25 22:33:34
"i think it’s a little too simplistic to say ken represented women and barbie represented the patriarchy ken discovering patriarchy seemed like a red pill analogy here’s this guy that has built his identity around being attractive to women and he’s feeling very rejected and undervalued so he gets radicalized and swings in the other direction begins undervaluing women and projecting his hurt onto other people

barbie took accountability for how she hurt ken and apologized to him but ultimately he also had to accept that she didn’t have romantic feelings for him

the ending being a matriarchal society still is a joke about the real world sure a lot of people will say women are equals now and should be treated as such but the actual change that should come along with that never happened overnight and is still a work in progress when women first started getting jobs nobody was like “here’s a seat in congress” the movie isn’t saying that slow change for the kens is the way it’s supposed to be it’s just reflecting how society actually baby steps towards equality instead of fully embracing it",2023-07-26 23:14:43
"i think this movie couldve been really smart but just missed it by laying it on too thick with the tirade by the mom about how difficult it is to be a woman and a couple of other scenes

apart from that it points out exactly what you are focussing on in your comment girls and women coming out of this movie cheering on the matriarchy in barbieland tell on themselves they basically say if we were men we would want patriarchy too

the point that seems to be lost on most viewers isnt a subtle one but its apparently easy to disregard while nearly everybody describes barbieland and the real world in the movie as two perfect opposites in terms of gender domination it clearly isnt compared to our actual reality the patriarchy is portrayed much more extreme in the real world of the movie but it still isnt even close to the total inequality in barbieland

when this total inequality is being broken up in the end it happens in baby steps and kens are supposed to be happy that they get any rights at all this resembles many steps of the womens rights movement of the 20th century in which the injustice of inequalities was recognized by the maledominated society but advancements were slowed down due to a prejudicial underestimation of what women are capable of in the movie barbies recognize that kens have had no rights no jobs and not even houses but since they never had the option to prove themselves they are also look upon as not intelligent enough to do important work

when the barbiepresident shuts down the supreme court seat for ken the voiceover says
well the kens have to start somewhere and one day the kens will have as much power and influence in barbieland as women have in the real world

in that scene the screen shows the allmale csuite of inmovie mattel so there is some sarcasm to the statement but it also points towards a still existing discrepancy between the inequalities in barbieland and the real world i interpret the message as directed at men saying something like look at this alternative reality where men wereare the oppressed gender if you lived there how would you feel about being told that inequality is real and it will be fixed but not just now and maybe not too quickly and perhaps sometime in the future you will be somewhat equal but not really

im a man and as i hinted to above the movie was a bit too preachy for my taste but i think both men who vilify it as some woke radical feminist propaganda and women who hail a kmenoppressing matriarchy as a utopia are both missing the point and are presenting themselves as insecure and unreflected partisans",2023-07-26 23:52:48
"the executives  in general were a very odd plot line that went absolutely nowhere they weren’t really antagonists their motivations weren’t completely clear and they never did anything which might be a statement on ceos in general i guess they were goofy and fun but it was definitely weird seeing them pop up periodically and thinking “these guys are still in this movie”

the only part that bothered me a lot was the car chase scene that was blatantly obviously just a chevrolet commercial for that  blue chevrolet they kept hamfisting into every scene i know they do these car advertisement things in a lot of movies marvel does it pretty often but it felt particularly egregious and distracting in this movie for some reason

i think 7510 is a fair rating",2023-07-27 18:19:00
"while the explicit plan of the barbies is to turn kens against eachother the end result is breaking down their selfidentification through their relation with the barbies at the start of the film they identify as being objects to the barbies at the height of the patriarchal revolt they identify as being the rulers of barbies they enter in conflict as two camps both fighting to be the ones continuing to rule the barbies but they resolve the conflict by breaking their need to identify in relation to the barbies at all the fact that the explicitly stated aim of the barbies plan is not the actual result of their plan is not a dissonance its just a reflection of how neither side could imagine the kens having any other type of selfidentity before it happens

this then leads directly into ken on behalf of all other kens expressing despair at the notion that selfidentification as ken not being enough since the world dictates the natural order is barbie and ken only to then realize no the natural ie matteldictated order is wrong and it is enough to be ken he is as the sweater so well puts it kenough",2023-07-31 13:38:52
i really liked ferraras monologue and the rest of the movie too but i did feel a bit disappointed that she felt the need to tell barbie she was beautiful wouldnt it have been more meaningful to say her beauty didnt matter i thought that would have tied in better with the general feminist theme and would have kinda validated weird barbie somewhat,2023-08-03 01:29:37
man im a middle aged single dad  and dude i got teary eyed at the second to last scene i totally agree with your take about the real world parts though but the final chapters super sealed the deal for me it was hitting on all levels must watch in theaters also,2023-08-01 15:03:31
" america ferreras monologue was great

its true some people really do like being preached to when they already agree with the message reminds me of writing for christian audiences",2023-08-01 14:36:50
yeah you all missed the explanation they compare the idea of partriarchy to a disease that is introduced to a new population they had no defenseimmune system to it because they’ve never encountered patriarchy before so it spread like wild fire,2023-08-03 05:20:36
"this comment is my white whale  no extreme kneejerk reactions or lengthy essays about how you projected your own issues onto the movie  

just took it for what it is okay",2023-08-08 15:49:35
i think part of the joke was that the men make it about themselves the whole musical was very self serving haha ken realized he didnt need to be an accessory to barbie and barbie realized she had the agency to actually be anything she wanted what she was thought she was doing for little girls,2023-09-05 01:43:35
great another movie about a man and his struggles and needs thats what we need,2023-09-04 21:36:22
the movie really ended weak with that long  speech from old lady hasbro and barbie goes to gynecologist,2023-09-11 01:21:09
" i think the main goal of the movie was to promote barbie as well as make money

to be fair isn’t that almost always the goal i doubt nintendo or nickelodeon had loftier goals when they made super mario and ninja turtles 

 barbie probably doesn’t care at how you feel about feminism or men’s issues

i mean you might be right but how could you know that for sure it seems like everyone who signed off on the script was onboard with the messaging  

x200b

i think the confusion for me and maybe a lot of people is there’s multiple themes mixing around in here femininity masculinity equality capitalism and consumerism parentchild relationships to name a few all of these are heavy topics on their own and they are trying to do this in a movie based on a kid’s toy that’s supposed to be light and funny so they touch on all these themes some pretty well some not so much but they still have to tie a pretty bow at the end which they did i guess but it conflicts with the rest of the film‘s many messages",2023-12-26 19:35:11
it’s basically a 2 hour lecture on feminism with no real depth or nuanced observations that is sprinkled with some great jokes and  gosling working at the top of his game liked it a lot as i walked out of the theater last night but the more i think about the absolute  of a plot it had the less i like it,2023-07-21 10:34:06
the quote is long term distance casual low commitment girlfriend ,2023-07-22 02:26:28
" antifeminism kens didnt wind up getting equality unless i missed something

kens are a metaphor for real world women progress but not fully realized",2023-07-22 09:00:15
"i think its reflective of the film  ken learns about himself through an elaborate imaginative dance  its not realistic hes still a doll  and mattel will still profit off his selfrealization if you can even call it that  as you can see by his sweater im kenough  hes still a product  

barbie doesnt need a final dance number because shes on the verge of acquiring humanity  and no one becomes human through choreographed dance

its missing something i agree  i think thats part of the film though  its not meant to leave you happy or empowered its transitioning you back to the real world  the real world is gynecology appointments and all the messy stuff that comes with it",2023-07-22 15:04:08
the mom character is a woman all the things she said applies to every woman you dont have to display them its just true,2023-07-23 02:51:16
i couldnt even be mad at him as soon as he did something disagreeable he would follow that up with something hilarious,2023-07-23 02:17:14
can we add sublime to the notes,2023-07-26 08:58:58
yes that message is great but there are alot of other messages that were not done very subtlety which made it messy towards the end also literally every man except alan was a complete idiot i mean major idiot,2023-08-01 07:42:58
"it’s very anti man in my opinion also aside from that heavy handed messaging the plot seems to have add it picks up one theme or plot line and never really fleshes it out only to jump to another people are excusing that as satire but imo it’s just poor writing

the people liking and not liking barbie seem to be falling into a few categories feminist women who love the message love it most of all men who felt the movie was anti men hate it most of all then people who thought the movie was funny and the songs were good like it and people who didn’t fall out their seats laughing at the final “muh ” joke didn’t like it as much",2023-08-01 05:04:52
i almost want to say small soldiers was close,2023-08-01 20:29:22
when i force my fiance to go see it his first time my second time i am getting very high beforehand it was so trippy,2023-07-22 04:22:04
the kens arent really any smarter or dumber than the barbies its that everyone barbie or ken went along with their society without introspection or examination they just didnt think about how society was structured or their place in it at all so when they were exposed to a new social structure through beach ken they adopted it its only when they were inoculated through being forced to confront the paradoxical requirements society places on them for being women that the barbies were able to want something else,2023-07-23 00:18:33
its not that they were smart enough but rather that the barbies had never encountered any of these ideas before and thought it was all in good fun theres actually even a line in the film where the mother character says something like its like the native americans being introduced to smallpox they have no immunity to it,2023-07-23 02:18:25
i smoked before and it definitely felt even deeper than it was,2023-07-24 09:43:30
just got out of the cinema from watching it uk and pretty much every seat was taken cinema was very busy,2023-07-29 20:43:38
it’s impossible to find a 3 in my area even the late showings definitely gonna be good week,2023-07-29 17:36:35
i saw it on tuesday afternoon 115 pm showing and the theater was full even more people seeing it after i got out judging by the sea of pink,2023-07-29 17:54:32
the vibe i got from this movie and i got downvoted to  for saying it was that gendered systems hurt everyone place people in boxes that never feel “enough” and limit the way we as humans experience the world and interact with it i’m not sure if that was the point but that’s how i felt,2023-07-21 16:14:31
well said this summarized my feelings about the movie i understand they wanted to mimic the suffragette moment in the real world but i think the ending would’ve been much more powerful if they had done something equal,2023-07-21 15:20:24
agreed especially the manipulation point i figured the man jokes were supposed to be in parallel to female jokes in menoriented movies but felt this goes against the message of what the movie is preaching  feminism isnt about bringing other men down lol kinda funny until every joke is haha ken dumb and then its likedo we have an agenda are we accidentally projecting the current online dating situation in perfect barbie world but hey what do i know i came for the consumerism and stayed for the hyperfeminine pink d,2023-07-21 15:17:45
"you raise some valid points

i do think greta is a genius storyteller but viewers are overanalyzing every single scene or action to have a deeper meaning when sometimes its just this is gonna make people laugh

i highly doubt gretas political message was voting suppression is amazing if it prevents certain minorities from voting

i mean that is indeed the outcome of the barbies distracting the kens who are a minority in barbie land from participating in democracy but i dont think it was intended to portray that specific political message",2023-07-21 15:48:25
well stated,2023-07-21 15:05:38
i interpreted them taking back barbie land and making it their own to be an emphasis of the idea that people in positions of power rarely are going to make everything equal plus the emotional manipulation was simply parody not a lesson point,2023-07-21 15:12:44
the way i understood the end was that barbieland essentially becomes a true inverse of the real world women in barbieland have as much power as men do in the real world and men in barbieland have as much power as women do in the real world that barbieland doesnt become some egalitarian paradise is kind of the pointbecause the real world isnt paradise either,2023-07-21 16:40:24
i agree but also at the end the barbies didn’t want barbieland to go back to exactly how it was before they wanted change to happen which is also how ken got to go into barbie’s house,2023-07-21 15:37:16
"i didn’t hate it but the movie had problems i’m in love with margot robbie america ferrera and ryan gosling too but…the movie had problems unfortunately even with ryan gosling about 90 of his best moments were spoiled by trailers and promo 
and yuup the same things people ripped olivia wilde apart for with “don’t worry darling” are being celebrated here because they did it in “a funny way” that’s life i guess no one is a perfect feminist the message is you can’t win and you can’t lol you can say greta should have just gone at writing this movie alone she wrote it with her real life partner over alone or with another woman same with margot robbie’s husband being a part of her production company and getting a whole executive producer credit",2023-07-21 18:33:10
“patriarchy is bad” was so so so incredibly annoying and on the nose that it seemed like a parody of a satire very confusing message,2023-07-21 14:53:51
little women wasn’t gretas story though would any good director make a bad little women i’m not sure if that’s a good movie to judge her story telling ability off,2023-07-21 15:28:51
midnights edge shared similar feelings but sadly theyre more hateful and misogynistic,2023-07-21 15:07:08
the reviews it was getting made me think i would get at least some enjoyment out of it  but i absolutely did not i chuckled here and there and gosling did a good job playing a dumb meathead but i mostly just felt like i was supposed to feel bad for being a man,2023-07-23 03:36:26
you nailed it when a movie preaches equality people at either end of the scale arent going to be happy ive found that if the message challenged the opinions of some people they chalk it up as too political and disregard it,2023-07-22 00:31:42
i completely disagree and i mostly didnt like the movie because of how men hating it was as a woman i grew up seeing ken and barbie as a loving couple and never thought of ken as some accessory but a true gentleman and her equal she did not live alone this movie completely erased that and make it all about girl power why does girl power feel as sexist as what men have been doing to us why does one group have be feel superior to me barbie was always about being proud of your femininity dreaming of big things and finding love that is forever sad how modern feminism wont allow us to love anyone other than ourselves and other women unless of course we find a weak man that will follow us like a puppy and has no opinions or desires of his own  like alan in this movie,2023-07-22 01:00:35
"ryan gosling absolutely stole the show as ken and i found his arc and character much more interesting compared to barbie 

i honestly dont even know what was the point of margots characters once they go to the real world ryan just overshadows everything till the end",2023-07-23 16:07:02
i liked this movie but i am getting texts from friends that this is perfect 1010 everything works and i feel like i must be insane because i’m not seeing it and i’m overall positive about it,2023-07-25 03:38:33
i must agree with you about so many positive reviews about the movie being genius on twitter i didn’t see one negative or not completely positive review there’s no way everyone is so deep that they got some deeper meaning out of the movie absolutely some would be able to relate to the commentary more than others and i see how it makes us women feel seen but to say that it was perfectly done and was a perfect reflection of women’s experience is a huge stretch there were major plot holes that are impossible to ignore so i don’t get why so many people are making it seem like it’s the best film of the year,2023-07-25 03:07:24
"ferreras monologue was terrible not because of the message or anything monologues and exposition dumps are just awful whoever played her daughter did a great job and i foresee her being a cinema fixture going forward

i also didnt really understand the emotional connection that people on tiktok are claiming to have the movie didnt make me depressed or cry but i am a man so maybe i just dont get it on that front",2023-07-25 00:32:37
"i feel like the point of america ferreras character is that she isnt actually weird and dark shes just normal like everyone else is sometimes people get stressed out and are unsure about themselves but society forces people to pretend like everything is perfect all the time 

she mirrors barbie who previously did have this perfect life without issues and is now being judged by everyone else for not sticking to the status quo in the end both characters reach this happy medium where they can be ok with who they are even though life isnt perfect",2023-07-25 01:00:36
"i felt similarly i was so excited for it as a huge fan of margot robbie and ryan gosling less so greta gerwig the plot was scattered and unfocused the mattel company plotline was unnecessary and diluted the last third of the movie 

we got to see way more of the character development of ken than barbie that was weird barbie choosing to be human would have been so much more impactful if she had given the speech reflecting on her recent revelations and changing wants 

the motherdaughter duo was a lot of wasted time too it felt like the writersdirector wanted to do so much more than they could squeeze into the run time i wept so hard when it was revealed the mom was the one playing with the barbie i could completely relate to her abject loss of identity and missing the things that use to make her happy that was so much more powerful than her speech they could have delved more into that intersection and tied it into barbies existential crisis it was also weird not to go more into why the mom felt so horribly thats an intense alluding without ever circling back to it 

it was a beautiful movie though i adored the sets the outfits the little barbie nods margot robbie enough said the dance numbers and the music wish the titular character had gotten more love in her character arc",2023-08-03 08:40:55
"i think all of the different elements of  the movie did not organically spring from the narrative but were a series of conveniences meant to make certain points or serve one disconnected scene after another i don’t know if that sentence is a great description of my “analysis” i’m tired but i mostly mean it to say it’s unfortunately probably gerwig’s worst movie in certain ways it’s all pretty undercooked 

overall i really liked the message though i kinda thought she was gonna decide to stay barbie in the end maybe i’m crazy thought it was fun looked great and i’m pretty positive on it it’s just not that “good” maybe",2023-08-04 05:05:17
it was a narrative mess the script needed tightening for sure,2023-08-03 09:36:50
i would not be surprised if that montage was comprised of home videos from all the barbie actresses,2023-07-23 05:54:40
about that line barbie was saying how she does not feel beautiful and the voiceover states the irony of margot robbie delivering that line as she is absolutely stunning,2023-07-24 10:39:47
yes you can pull it off,2023-08-04 05:47:10
youll be chilling though if you want to grab snacks chat a bit and have a bathroom break youll probably make it right at the start of the film the first 5 minutes were basically shown in the trailer anyway tho,2023-08-04 07:51:22
as of today it is i just saw it and i need to watch it again,2023-12-16 01:11:03
“opening this conversation” really,2023-12-30 21:45:14
i mean funny but very very deep,2023-07-22 23:09:18
i gotta say america ferreras rant about how hard it is to be a woman is weird being a human is difficult everyone has expectations on them everyone is treated poorly sometimes everyone has anxiety about the different roles they inhabit during their lives the implication that men dont struggle at all with the very same things shes talking about seems shortsighted being a human is hard no need to separate an examination of why its hard into man vs woman lets be human together,2023-07-23 00:03:36
yeah it would have been better if greta gerwig wasn’t behind it,2023-07-29 02:52:16
i really liked it but i do agree it felt weird when president barbie rejected the request to have one ken supreme court justice i didn’t understand if it ended with everything back to the status quo or what,2023-07-21 05:56:13
the thing that made it incoherent is gerwig makes kens both the avatar for women in the real world but also the representation of patriarchal men  she needed to pick one and stick to it if the kens are the equivalent of women in barbie land then the barbies need to be clear villains like the real world men are  otherwise it just comes off as another women good and men bad movie,2023-07-21 09:23:15
great review,2023-07-21 09:24:50
i agree that the film didnt meet my expectations but i still liked it i just thought it would be in my top 5 but its basically in my top 10 or just out of it,2023-07-21 05:57:19
"did the marketing phase really set high expectations that this was going to be some classic piece of cinema

it’s a movie based on a toy historically and by all rights it should be an awful film i just can’t imagine what youmore than likely an adult male would be expecting from a movie about androgynous dolls",2023-07-21 12:54:33
i’m so confused on what it aimed to say,2023-07-21 11:26:49
"it was a mistake to make ken both the stand in for women in barbie land and the stand in for patriachal men basically it sends totally mixed messaging  why is the ken patriarchy portrayed as bad but the matriarchy good why is ken being an underling funny but the real world patriarchy tragic and oppressive the movie doesn’t know

for the movie to actually contrast with the real world you would have had to have made the barbies more obviously villains at the start like the real world men as it is it just kind of comes off as man bashing no matter the situation the men are in",2023-07-21 16:16:04
i agree with you on the supreme court part that was the only part that put a sour taste in my mouth because i wanted the barbies to be better than the men in the real world,2023-07-21 12:48:12
" i’m glad they didn’t go full villains here but ken saying he lost interest in the patriarchy since learning it wasn’t all about horses then doing the barbieland takeover anyway is  my dude

he lost interest after they took over he was just spiting the barbies at that point because he was still mad at his barbie",2023-07-21 14:09:22
i literally buckled with laughter at this point and my daughter was like why is that funny ,2023-07-21 18:18:13
i would say the message feels like it’s from the early 2000s,2023-07-23 23:40:50
ultimately this is what is bugging me about the film the kens criticism of the patriarchy was way more subversive and compelling than the more obvious preachy criticism from the female cast,2023-07-24 03:55:42
yeah but at the end it was ken who needed the comforting and be yourself message  to me that was the complexity that i dont think would be there had it been made 10 years ago its definitely not a black and white or pink and brown movie,2023-07-23 22:00:09
"yeah honestly when conservatives were screeching about how woke it was i was quite surprised because the message wasnt that revolutionary 

 i did think it was good to include the message that barbie was wrong to take ken for granted and that ken should find his own way to define his identity beyond barbie honestly there was even something slightly jordan peterson about that like the whole idea of men are in crisis and people dont take it seriously",2023-07-23 21:33:02
i felt that too but considering this movie had to be licensed and im sure every scene had to be approved by mattel i thought it was pretty decent and honestly more than i expected from them  i really appreciated the motherdaughter aspect and i would have liked to see more about the difficulty of raising a daughter in a patriarchal society,2023-07-23 21:43:21
well the people complaining about the movie are still in the 1950s,2023-07-23 21:21:39
which messages do you refer of the early 2010,2023-07-23 21:17:25
yeah same here super strong first half and then just kind of lost its steam good overall though,2023-09-19 09:08:34
"i think on some level all the barbies felt 
an immense pressure to maintain their ‘perfection’ just as real women do 

women can’t just be good or ok they must always be exceptional 

i mean barbie gives up being an ever enduring image of feminine perfection in favour of becoming a complicated messy human to become a woman that wears a flattering top and wants to get through the day feeling kind of ok about her self a chance to define herself make her own meaning 

i think ken coming back with ‘patriarchy’ offered a similar sort of reprieve to the rest of the barbies only with out the chance to define themselves but still an opportunity not live up the expectations of being barbie everyday 

it’s not that they wanted to submit to the kens they just wanted a break from living up to the pressure of barbies own standards",2023-07-23 19:23:52
"the birkenstock and heels is a direct nod to the blue pill and red pill unlocking knowledge that once you learn it you can never go back to the ignorant bliss 

i think the birkenstock pill was realizing life is messy and that there’s a patriarchy that still oppresses women barbie land is considered bliss but it’s a matriarchy so barbie never realized how bad it was — only ken did ken decides to take the birkenstock pill by going with barbie and then is enlightened that he doesn’t have to accept the matriarchy and can actively work against it once barbie takes the pill and lives the reverse society she realizes how messed up barbieland society is and how to try to navigate that and ken gets — his freedom and autonomy",2023-07-24 13:19:38
did you just compare barbie to the matrix,2023-07-24 13:26:42
exactly my thoughts they did a good job with the statement of the movie but a lot of it felt rushed i feel like they made barbie coming to the world because she connected with the woman the main plot in the beginning of the movie but it was not really developed the ceo coming to barbieland was anti climactic that was totally skipped over also i thought the plan to turn the girls away from the patriarchy was kind of lame and rushed the first hour of the movie was excellent to me but the last 3040 minutes fell flat in my opinion,2023-07-24 22:48:26
"basically yes at the end barbie is offered a chance to become a fully real physical human being and chooses to do so afterwards she is a living flesh and blood person who will age and die so yes she has female genital anatomy and appears to need the same routine medical maintenance care as any other woman

the joke is that the scene looks like its leading up to a first job interview which has been used as the final scene in many other works where the ending revolves around someonesomething becoming a normal adult person and joining society but instead its a gynecologist appointment which is maybe the most prosaic mundane uncomfortablebutunremarkable aspect of being a woman",2023-08-06 17:40:32
it subverted its own expectations the kens are the best part of the movie which is hilarious  the funniest and most enjoyable scenes were with the patriarchy,2023-09-25 12:02:45
im flabbergasted at critics praising this as a smart satire,2023-07-21 20:43:20

yeah i wasnt a huge fan the performances were fantastic but the writing was so buzzwordheavy and selfcongratulatory that i was cringing just as often as laughing i genuinely think mattel giving the goahead to write their company as haha were so evil and capitalist lol and everyone eating it up is unironically so dystopianly evil and capitalist,2023-07-21 07:19:41

and yeah the jokes werent that great for the most part either especially in the later part of the film some sporadic scattered laughter from my audience but not much more",2023-07-21 15:26:28

the whole barbiebecominghuman scene with random flashbacks was honestly the worst,2023-07-21 07:57:55
i really enjoyed it but i felt like something was off with the sound design that made some parts fall flat like there was no background music or ambient noise so some parts were kind of awkwardly quiet in the theatre for example the part near the end where ken goes down the slide felt unfinished and the convo with rhea perlman felt too long because of the silence weirdly i think it’ll be better to watch at home,2023-07-21 02:53:09
it was pretty all over the place and super on the nose i can see why people wouldn’t enjoy it but i can get past all that i loved it,2023-07-21 05:36:58
silent,2023-07-21 07:26:05
i also disliked it but for different reasons my main gripe was the editing i felt like everything was happening way too fast none of the ‘emotional’ moments had any impact because they went by in the blink of an eye this tiktokstyle low attention span editing really made the movie feel vapid empty and superficial to me and it’s a shame because the production design was great but you didn’t get any chance to actually savour it same for the story it could have actually been touching but instead it became something you forgot about the moment you left the theatre,2023-07-21 09:11:48
yeah im rather disappointed with it,2023-07-21 10:32:32
i thought the super long snl sketch was the best part the movie is like a 5 or 6 at its core but it had me laughing so much i had to give it a 7,2023-07-21 04:23:06

youre not alone idk why im inserting myself into this as i havent seen it but i have a lot of opinions based on what ive heard and seen in trailers it seems meta and surreal too surreal also maybe too adult ive heard theres some adult stuff too,2023-07-21 11:43:06
i may have a slightly pessimistic view but i think while this film is definitely about dominance and power dynamics it does also show that in reality this is perpetuated cause folks give into power more easily than we think kind of cyclic enjoyed your post though,2023-07-24 04:16:10
lets not pretend this movie does anything to critique captialism a dialogue casually thrown in as a cheeky admission of guilt is nothing compared to the tons of money its going to earn mattel through merch and tieins criticism of patriarchy yes but its actually ironic that people think this movie critiques capitalism when all its going to do is make you feel woke as you shell out your cash for the i am kenough tshirt theyre eventually going to print in hollywood patriarchy may lose but capitalism always wins,2023-07-25 19:13:19
the criticism of capitalism in this movie is extremely shallow and is only delivered by a oneliner from the daughter,2023-07-25 19:59:46
just a reminder that movie theaters are staffed with the purpose of having specific employees to send in to remove obnoxious guests with no respect for anyone else people that wait until the end of the movie to say something you might as well just keep your mouth shut because you’ve missed your opportunity to actually fix the problem,2023-08-21 14:37:21

"i felt it was trying to portray two messages at once

1 individualism is important people shouldnt be limited based on their gender
2 patriarchy and matriarchy are both bad in the long term since one gender ends up oppressed gender equality should be achieved

now it succeeded at the first one but the second is trickier since you cant dismantle the patriarchy in the real world or the matriarchy in the barbie world in a single day

the kens starting to aspire to have jobs and a voice in the barbieverse at the end of the film is the equivalent of the suffragette movement

sure they went about it on the wrong way but the ending narration says that eventually theyll work their way up to become the equivalent of working women in the real world",2023-07-21 12:45:18

surethere was a big ken arc but the movie was not about men,2023-07-21 12:41:39
"the movie also goes out of its way to show you how selfaware it is 

so consider that the movie is being deliberate in every way imaginable its also meant to be an exaggeration of reality even in the real world part of the film

why is every single man nothing more than a small collection of a glaring flaw in their character why are all of the men ostensibly unaware of their wildly obvious flaws

i dont know but my thoughts on this are that this fits into the films themes revolving around perception vs experience and this pattern ie all men are exaggerated character flaws tries to encompass both of those 

the perception aspect being the way men tend be perceived by women tons of unearned confidence no concept of the world beyond the tip of their nose blissfully unaware of obvious flawsis it accurate no but thats the point its exaggerating the reality because if it just showed what it looks like wed only see our own reality

as far as experience goes i think the experience of being perceived by others as nothing more than the worst part of yourself is being portrayed and then flipped to ask why we consider that a feminine trait in the first place",2023-07-21 13:33:52

" strong contrast between barbie world and real world but there isnt

i dont understand how they couldnt have been more contrasted you go from a pink wonderland to a black and grey looking dungeon city where color has been drained and men rule it the entire contrast is the lack of women barbie encounters in her first experience in the real world she literally addresses the contrast it gets resolved by her daughter telling her she likes her ideas and doesnt hate her job bc im sure the whole time she hated her mom worked for such a company but now she realizes she doesnt need to hate that company 

the teenage girl doesnt like her mom bc shes an edgy teenage girl the mom is thinking about death bc as she gets older she is faced with death more and what it would be like to leave her daughter behind 

this movie isnt about feminism its about the woman experience and highlighting that and sometimes feminism is a part of that and sometimes you dont need buzzwords like feminism to get important points across 

kens entire existence is to be pathetic and annoying that is the point of his character to realize he doesnt and shouldnt be seen as pathetic the entire ending of the movie matches feminism when they realize barbie can still respect ken instead of lead him on and treat him like  and he doesnt need to create a patriarchy to do so 

i just think a few concepts  important points were missed in your reflection imo barbie world couldnt have been more fun and satirical but it also needs to be serious because it lays the foundation for the entire message of the movie why would it be about equality barbie isnt fighting for social justice in the real world she just wants to be a real woman and have that experience which comes with the downsides inequality",2023-07-22 13:28:39

"no we get it  but when every man and ken in the movie is an idiot and there is a clear difference in the way the real world patriarchy is portrayed as so bad with women heroic in trying to overcome it whereas the barbie matriarchy isn’t really presented that way and kens are the butt of the joke when they go against it  it’s obviously gonna come off anti man

every man and ken in this movie is presented as a  or a  and a villain  even america ferraras husband for some random reason mens interests are mocked i’m sure this plays well in feminist circles but whatever good message gerwig may have been trying to send if any it’s lost beneath her obvious bitterness toward men which comes out in this movie

perhaps men can see something about this movie you can’t in the same way men might not be aware how rude they’re being about women sometimes  but women will see it   did you consider that",2023-07-24 13:06:15

"1 i see diverse representation for barbies dark pregnant weird plus size etc where is the representation for kens i dont see plus size kens

2 the movie did not portray a single good male role model the father who tried to learn spanish chastised for cultural appropriation

i thought it was so funny like embracing all parts of being a woman in such a comedic way like welcome to the real world barbie it’s time for your pap smear,2023-07-25 07:20:04
"i have similar questions to me my question is was ken’s musical number supposed to be a mirrormetaphor for the women of society when will women be seen for more than superficial things or was the musical number legitimately about kenken’s and the idea in the movie that men shouldn’t define themselves by the women that pay attention to them their car their clothes etc 

i can’t for the life of me figure out if we are supposed to care about ken because men’s issues or if ken is simply a metaphor for women in the real world

at any rate ryan gosling did a great job with the character they gave him but to me it’s unfortunate that in a movie about feminism the male is the one that “stole the show” don’t know if that was on purpose or speaks to the problem at hand i do not know what is realmeta many folks say “don’t think too much” but it’s hard not to think when such important themes are at hand and i haaaaate it when moviemakers go into a movie with the assumption that audiences are  which is exactly how this movie felt while watching it",2023-07-25 17:18:50
"my take on the song which could be totally wrong after doing a rewatch is that it starts off as the later male power  frustration and then ends with a sort of realisation from him it starts off about how he’s so polite but will sleep alone tonight but the chorus changes at the end from the original i’m just ken “where i see love she sees a friend what’ll it take” etc to the final chorus of “i’m enough i’m great at doing stuff” and then rather than i’m just ken it’s “my name’s ken and so am i put that manly hand in mine” so almost like a “sisterhood” moment with the other kens which is backed up in the choreography and i read that as less about a statement of male power and more about them having self worth but feeling crushed by the system 

where that might not completely add up is that we jump back to the film where he’s still in a bit of a crisis about barbie and how he’s nothing without her so i could be wrong it’s a little muddled and i felt like i really needed that rewatch to understand it all a bit better because it tries to do a lot of things and say a lot so the first time i watched it i was kinda overwhelmed second time i could actually think about it a bit more",2023-07-25 18:17:53

it’s not that it’s the overall portrayal of all men and kens as absolute morons in comparison to all the female characters for decades we’ve heard women complain that the portrayal of women in media offended them yet they are totally fine with portraying men as morons who need to be taught better in fact they love it,2023-07-30 18:35:36
tbh i was all for a equality movie and was rooting for the women throughout but near the end when the kens were asking to be a part of the supreme court with the women after they took back barbieland and they were just like “ew no maybe just a rank below the supreme court” like bro that comes off as antimen and not feminism feminism should be fighting for the equality of men and women not women just taking over men completely was pretty negative and antimen no matter what they say…,2023-07-21 11:14:33

i agree with this pretty much exactly the message could have been “here’s what’s wrong with masculinity men should change positively and things should become more equal” but instead it was essentially “men are pathetic and they ” it was a fun and funny movie that could have had a good message but there was just an undercurrent of hatred running through it that somewhat killed the vibes,2023-07-22 08:39:12
"i don’t know why you expected a promale message in a barbie movie…

as a man i laugh at all the nonsense the kens were up to didn’t laugh at some of the cringy jokes zsjl joke for example and just accepted  that the majority of this female audience in the theater was relating to some of the themes here 

barbie also apologized to ken at the end so its not like it was saying he was wrong to feel the way he felt that bottled up anger turned into him becoming influenced by the “patrichary” which is kinda played for laughs because its literally represent by a horse",2023-07-21 07:43:40

actually i think its soo soooo fitting that this barbie didnt want to change anything robbies barbie is literally the barbie that is just barbie she doesnt have to or need to do anything and she shouldnt want to either showing her not wanting to change anything just made sense because thats who she is sometimes you need a barbie that just does nothing theyre just them its so fitting that its the barbies with jobs and perspectives that help her get back on her feet and its fitting that its the real humans who help her see the beauty of not being the stereotypical one dimensional person that she believes she needs to be to live a good life her own revelation that she should be whoever she wanted to be is literally what barbie is all about that to me felt more like girl power rather than the same old we need to rise up and make change mantra that women are constantly pushed to achieve despite all the odds,2023-07-22 19:24:21
felt the same this movie was basically all about ken not barbie i dont get why he became the main character right in the middle of it it was fun all in all but the story def didnt go where i expected it to go,2023-07-22 19:14:53
im willing to bet that was by design  barbieland is our world but reversed  the struggle of the kens mirrors the struggle of women in the real world  they were secondclass citizens solely defined by their relationship to their spouses for the longest time,2023-07-22 21:58:11
because barbie isnt men bad women powerful and independent its satire barbie land is the complete opposite extreme of our world women have all the jobs and men just kind of exist to be cool ken tries to fix this by making it the complete opposite which is what people fear monger than feminists want to do and gretas commentary is that neither of these are right and she does it through a layer of comedy i think its quite clever,2023-07-25 12:20:57
holy  you really missed that its supposed to be comedic huh,2023-11-20 15:32:47
aw man i would totally buy that but 60 quid  ,2023-07-23 00:58:53
"to me the ferrellmattel subplot served a complementary purpose

when we first meet the csuite we see theyre all men and the joke seems to be of course its just callous rich men controlling barbie

but over the course of the plot we see that ferrell does care about feminism maybe he never says it outright but we get little peeks into his motivations maybe hes not a great ally but hes trying to be one

so my take on this was one more brick in the feminism landscape the movie was painting its allies who try without listening with a dash of rainbow capitalism do we call it pink capitalism when its about feminism instead of  rights bc when he finally listens to a woman america f he tells her the idea is  until he finds out it will make a lot of money

the movie feels like the best feminism 101 course a film could possibly be it treats the subject matter with respect and deference keeps the audience engaged by not going too deep to be an art house film and introduces a variety of issues under the same umbrella concept",2023-07-25 15:21:58
"i think it being resolved so easily is a comment on how the early days of feminism did not really solve anything and it was merely a stepping stone the narrator literally says kens have to start somewhere when they were denied a seat on the supreme court 

you could also argue that everything being solved so quickly it is a critique of white feminism some peoples interpretation of feminism comes from a very surfacelevel approach and by simply earning your right to vote you have won barbielands dynamics and politics are not meant to reflect the real worlds battle against patriarchy because as the movie repeatedly reminds us barbie did not solve all the problems women face nor did it create gender equality",2023-07-25 14:32:52
i think that was meant to be what the barbie’s believed about themselves but i guess in a mattel barbie film having the barbie’s challenge that narrative wouldn’t fly,2023-09-17 09:28:13
it is indeed not a feminist masterpiece but i don’t think the conversation about how different the fight against sexism is in real life for marginalized groups is… necessarily relevant here it’s a movie about a white doll we have to adjust our expectations for nuance at some point barbie only discusses one privileged aspect of womanhood it never claims to be an instruction manual for or reflection of how hard it is for disabled  women of color to fight against sexism,2024-01-27 09:33:00
 i felt something similar like it was created by ai to go viral on tiktok some strong one liners but also a lot of stuff that will lead to people talking into their camera while walking saying stuff like if you dont agree with x then youre part of the problem,2023-07-21 11:20:07

"barbieland isn’t an inversion of our world ken is literally an allegory for real world women the kens live in a society stacked against them despite making up 50 of the population where they have limited power rights and influence and are treated as pretty but superfluous objects 

the kens can’t reach true equality by the end of the film because they represent real women and real women have not reached true equality

the same fate is offered to the kens as has been offered to real women a path toward equality women were not handed equality over night 

barbie was invented in 1959 so there society can only be 64 years old 

there wasn’t a female supreme court justice until the 80s and the modern women’s suffrage movement started in the early 1800s  that is what the rate of progress looks like in the real world and barbieland influences our would as much as ours does barbieland

so it simply becomes a matter of time for the kens just as it is for real women

the film is as optimistic about kens situation as it is about the situation of the women watching the film",2023-07-23 20:29:20
"my biggest issue is that the restoration of the status quo in barbieland invalidates the resolution of kens arc there is no room for in barbieland or ken to be anything other than just ken

yea the line when the president says there cant be a male supreme court judge just made me think okay so then nothing actually changed except for stereotypical barbie leaving

the narrator does say that men eventually get a level of equality compared to women in our world but we dont see it",2023-07-23 19:55:53
"mansplaining to explain something to a woman in a condescending overconfident and often inaccurate or oversimplified manner typically to a woman already knowledgeable about the topic 

i dont believe it was mansplaining in la la land emma stone said she didnt like jazz and then agreed to go on a date to with ryan gosling to listen to it he is just explaining it to her as she does not know much about it and proving his opinion on why he enjoys it so much 

i know mansplaining is a real thing but la la land is not a good example",2023-08-06 16:11:07
"excellent insight    
theres some types of jazz music that i love especially for the piano  and some types of jazz that i just dont like but whenever i bring that up someone will explain to me why i should give it a chance  that scene in la la land where ryan gosling mansplains to emma stone is too relatable so i now also actively dislike la la land too    


another cross reference simu lius character in kims convenience does a lot of preening so it was funny to see him preening in barbie    


and last cross reference i spotted emma  ncuti are both in  education  their barbie  ken characters got to hug each other in the movie  and i bet they are good friends in real life too",2023-08-06 20:11:24
unsubtle satire has its place too yknow,2023-07-21 11:43:04
it metal gear solid but feminism instead of antiwar discussion and is honestly needed i  loved it,2023-07-21 12:55:07
the problem was because it was so pro female and anti male and the kens were made fun of they forget to make the barbies the focus of self deprecating jokes as well  and as such the barbies are just kind of boring while the kens are hilarious,2023-07-21 16:11:49
"its not even dealing with those issues or being overbearing about it i expected all that agree 100 percent on the barbieken real world that wouldve been a perfect spot for so much character growth

its that the heroes of the stories are the barbies who represent the patriarchy in barbie world so its like greta wants to have her cake and eat it too she wants a movie calling out the patriarchy and promoting feminism and also her woman heroes to come out on top even though they are the patriarchy and its supposed to be funny when the kens in barbie world make 0 progress

x200b

the audience is supposed to feel good when the barbies regain complete control of barbie world right

x200b

is the audience supposed to be happy when the teenage girl calls barbie a fascist i really dont know if thats a critique on barbie or if its a critique on people who call anything they dont like fascist",2023-07-22 19:25:13
"talk about matriarchy in the same light as patriarchy

it did thats the joke at the end the kens arent allowed immediate equal positions of power as they should in a perfect world but they are allowed lower positions that arent really powerful and being told to work their way up of course this means the system is against them because when they gained their rights it was the barbies in all the powerful positions systems biased against the kens and thats bad  


and thats supposed to be shown as bad because that reflects the modern world  


where giving women the least bit of power in the world is treated as something huge even thought it doesnt change that the system is rigged against them  


thing is if you find the movie mean to men which it is then thats because youre realising why women are  at the system and why feminism exists what youre finding mean in the movie barbie is what women find mean in the real world",2023-07-23 14:41:12
"i took it in the way that this is the beginning of the kens sensing what equal rights are that talk at the end with margot barbie and ken was literally her saying sorry and also telling him he has to go and find out who he is he shouldnt just just judge himself as barbies boyfriend or by his career i never took it as the kens being dumb but naive because of the matriarchy they live in

that final talk with barbie and ken was a really important part of the movie imo but people seem to just skip over it and think the message is a simple broad statement of men  bad the movie knows barbieland is flawed as well thats the point its a mirror of reality albeit an exaggerated satire of it",2023-07-23 11:57:36
i thought the same would be really interested to know arguments against this take,2023-07-23 11:09:33
" i was so happy when i picked up on america ferrera’s husband saying “si se puede” millennials and anyone that grew up with disney channel would get it

could you explain what it has to do with disney i looked it up but didnt see anything about disney thx

sí se puede is the name of the 6th episode in the 3rd season of showtime s tv series ″ dexter  and was a slogan used by spanish left wing antiausterity party unidas podemos in the buildup to the 2019 spanish general election held on 28 april 2019

 sí se puede  is a spanish phrase that means yes it is possible or yes we can it is the motto of the united farm workers of america and has since been taken up by other activist groups1 the phrase is often used at proimmigration events across the united states and at other political events",2023-07-24 00:32:43
" barbie should have been a vessel to explore motherdaughter relationships and the patriarchygender roles in the real world

that is literally what this movie was

 i was so happy when i picked up on america ferrera’s husband saying “si se puede” millennials and anyone that grew up with disney channel would get it

oh jesus christ…",2023-07-23 23:38:26
didnt like it either it was too preachy and messy and even quite boring at times the narrative is not engaging at all,2023-07-23 23:37:20
i feel like only feminist women are coming away with a message that this has a positive message for men in it  because their the ones who push the idea that patriarchy hurts men because they can’t cry and find themselves etc  whereas 99 of men don’t actually care about that at all so it’s like this movie has a positive message for men…according to feminist women meanwhile men notice every male character is an idiot doing something wrong and all their interests are mocked and see it as man hating,2023-07-24 04:13:29
"the whole issue with dolls and little girls playing with dolls and how that relates to the patriarchy is that the little girls are not stimulating those complex parts of their brains so even if you play with engineer barbie youre still just playing dolls youre not actively thinking through spatial patterns or building things with your hands that will later help you advance in science and math fields

not everything is about science and math when people play with dolls they create imaginary stories which involves creativity and human interaction they use their imagination the way writers do to create different plots for the dolls that is just as important as learning how to add and subtract numbers and playing with a chemistry set",2023-07-24 22:46:35
why is everyone taking this film so seriously it was satirical film the narrator said “this would happen one day” because it was trying to show that women literally had this happen to them 100 years ago when they weren’t allowed to hold jobs and they all “had to start somewhere” barbie world  the real world reversed 100 years ago,2023-07-24 16:01:53
they literally spell it out by the end of the movie how women take back control and instead of letting barbies and kens be equal they slowly let them in just like it happened in real life but with roles reversed its satire,2023-07-21 11:57:00
this is what i was trying to say in my downvoted post iam a foundational black american man and i was also offended by this movie narrative since my culture has always supported equality,2023-07-23 02:29:20
"yes the third act ruined it for me… like ferrera stop teaching toxic things to your barbie leading the group to become narcissistic and manipulative 

i low key expected main barbie to shoo the narc away and realise the faultlines and meet halfway but nope never addressed

the president barbie refusing to call the man “mother”  like… what the genderphobic  was that 

and almost everything ferrera mentioned in the rant… most of the men do that everyday… and they don’t complain 

 she ruined barbie land with depression and mid life crisis christ toys have to be about hope… positivity… not death  like there’s not enough negativity in the world already 

stop ruining everything weak nonadjusted people",2023-07-21 22:02:54
if you rip off that paint it becomes a different thing entirely you are right the difference is this movie had that paint and setting so its a pointless exercise to look at it through the lens of but if it was like this,2023-07-21 12:56:58
lmaoooooo,2023-07-21 11:28:08
"i feel like if this were made in the 90s the movie wouldve ended with the barbies realizing they had a share of the blame and instead strove to once again be something the modern world can aspire to

barbieland inuniverse was created by mattel

the barbies are not consciously oppressing the kens theyre programmed to do so by mattel how are the barbies to blame

mattel is the one who designed this society and gave everyone their roles to play 

its best to think of the barbieland entities as androids with ai programming margot barbie is the first one to glitch and refuse her programming",2023-07-21 12:53:04
"as someone who loved it i interpreted it a lot differently all of the barbies in barbieland do exist irl there are a few plussized barbies barbie in a variety of races barbie who uses a wheelchair pregnant barbie all exist irl that hasnt prevented most people from thinking of barbie as stereotypical barbie 

a big thesis of the movie the marketing proposition that made mattel bite is that being a woman in a patriarchal society is a contradiction and so is barbie barbie is every woman its all in her s 

barbie is feminist and barbie is kind of bad for women barbie was founded by women but is currently run by a man barbies come in all shapes but barbie has also contributed to unfair beauty standards 

the point is its difficult for women to be themselves in a society with so many contradicting expectations of them and there isnt a simple solution it isnt boys vs girls because mistreating men isnt the answer there isnt one i think i would have liked the movie less if greta tried to solve sexism it felt more true that it ended without a satisfactory fix

i get why people didnt like it and i 100 respect your opinion i just hope my explanation was helpful",2023-07-26 02:40:25
"ya i was enjoying it up until that point it really diverted from the main plot and made the motherdaughter pair pretty useless even the mattel execs were pretty pointless as well except for a few gag scenes

it started with a good idea about helping a girl come to terms with dying getting old and dealing with depression i thought it was gonna be about barbie and to some extent ken helping her deal with everyday human life and its problems then it went into a full men vs women war 

i just dont get this film it could of gone in such a different and better way also the ending was pretty bad",2023-07-26 04:02:01
is this real who do you think owns the barbie ip,2023-07-21 22:10:22
i went into it expecting the lego movie but instead it gave us the antifight club seriously outstanding stuff,2023-07-22 06:36:09
"  i dont think they communicated that ken was an incel for barbie til later in the movie 

i think its more supposed to be that ken cant conceive of himself except in relation to barbie he has no identity of his own this is meant to parallel the way women have been perceived irl as accessories for men rather than their own selves

the icing on this  cake is when the barbies humorously tell the kens they cant be in the supreme court and will have to start at the lower courts  this excuse oh sure we can be equal but you need to start on the bottom rung is used on women irl and it  blows

yeah i mean thats kind of the point the point isnt that barbieland is some kind of perfect society the point is that barbieland though they considered themselves progressive and equal was no better than the real world 

 when america ferreira suggests the idea of a regular barbie to help with womens self esteem issues its written off as not being lucrative

well the coe says that then the coo or whoever says it will be profitable and he turns on a dime heh and accepts the idea but as with all selfcriticism from major corporations you never can really jive with it because at the end of the day even if they admit they are soulless monsters theyre still soulless monsters it always lands a liiiiittle flat since of course mattel put the ok on that message in the first place 

to your last point basically i see barbieland as a construct created by ruth and perpetuated by mattel and after years of faux progressive corporatism barbieland is a place that is like a reflection of our world since in that world barbie got all the important jobs and personhood and ken got nothing so just like america ferreras character has to find a way to cope with being a woman in the real world eventually ken finds a way to cope with being a ken in barbieland both societies are unjust both are kind of working on it but both are also wayyyyy too quick to pat themselves on the back and declare the job done and everything perfect",2023-07-23 19:11:32
"i also think people are taking this movie way to seriously and framing it as some gospel for feminism and young women etc this film was a satire about gender roles in society and have could easily been an snl skit that was rated r stop trying to over analyze and politicize everything and just laugh and enjoy it

i think the problem is that they played with a really thin line while trying to make it a satire i dont feel the satire was portrayed properly because the movie left multiple interpretations for the spectator they had to define more clearly their purpose and they didnt and here is the problem

i honestly think that if they defined it more as a satire it would have been better for me at least because the moments where they talked about those political topics could feel kinda uncomfortable or simply weird and its almost the whole plot where they talk about it ",2023-07-24 17:31:11
"the resolution of kens story was intended to be unsatisfying its important to remember that the kens serving as little more than accessories for barbie and lacking in property jobs education voting rights and representation in positions of power symbolize the way women have been treated throughout the vast majority of human history

the ending mirrors the exceedingly slow progress men have made throughout history in empowering women the dissatisfaction you feel was intentionally cultivated by the filmmakers their aim was to encourage viewers to draw a parallel between the matriarchal society of barbieland and our own patriarchal world and to redirect this dissatisfaction towards our own gradual progress with gender equality",2023-07-26 06:14:47
"the whole movie was barbie not needing ken to be barbie why if that is good is ken not needing barbie a “bad” message for boys

am i the only one who thought all that  was dumb and they should have just had barbie and ken end up together instead of doing a lame “empowering” end

anyways boys aren’t watching the movie for the most part so it’s kinda pointless to try to teach them lessons with it",2023-07-27 18:42:32
"i wonder what the reaction would be if men made a movie “having fun” with the gender war stuff and mocking all women’s hobbies and portraying them as dumb
seems like the whole mocking the other gender for comedy in movies is very 1990’s with women mocking men and men mocking women  except then that became offensive at least to do to women but now gerwig has just gone back to that and the critics loved it and women have no problem with it so i guess it’s fine for men to as well",2023-07-28 03:18:25
i’m with you the humor hit hard for me personally  i was laughing my  off i was even for a lot of the message the movie was trying to send the sentimental scenes of like old home movies felt super bizarre and out of place ,2023-08-07 02:27:40
" by the end of the movies the barbie said that the kens going to have to slowly gain authority which eventually would equal the barbies

to be fair this was actually a joke  they said the kens would gain enough power to equal what women have in the real world",2023-08-07 20:02:25
midge is almost a mother but shes been expecting for about 50 years already,2024-01-06 04:53:39
"when they wanted to end it they worked together to end it if patriarchy exists it’s because women allow it and it’s their job to stop it if they don’t like it 

is that not a very feminist message i dont know sounds right to me each gain for womens rights has come from them not putting up with  anymore and doing something about it not to say that isnt difficult or that anyone can do it alone barbie tries to do it alone and fails",2024-01-13 03:05:47
it did seem like that was going to be the ending then the kens just ended the film how they started,2023-07-21 22:06:17
"same i thought the movie was great until the very last minute when mattel was like haha that was fun anyway we still made this thing time for the blandest ending imaginable

dont get me wrong i knew i was watching an ad the entire time but it felt like a pretty sharp swerve from the tone of the rest of the film kind of disheartening that corps still make these mindnumbingly boring creative decisions even when they give the green light for more selfaware projects like seriously cant you pretend at least for five minutes youre not  a bunch of lizard people who havent genuinely laughed even once in their entire lives",2023-07-21 22:59:26
the ending is clearly a reflection of the present day real world where things are evolving for women but true progress and equality hasn’t been achieved because women still lack to get their fair share even if they are more represented in the same way that barbieland has now evolved to give men more of a voice in their community but they aren’t equals it’s supposed to make us question how much more progress we have left in our own world to truly consider our society fair to women,2023-07-21 22:47:06
"agree the movie hit very hard in a great and validating way on why the patriarchy hurts women but missed on why it hurts men or the solution we want if we dismantle patriarchy

i did have a nice little pang of “ha now you men know what it feels like to be second class citizens as women have been feeling for years” but i dont know was a bit shallow that the ken men were begging women for jobs it’s not what we want",2023-07-21 22:27:31
why would the barbies give power to the kens who just tried overthrowing the government…,2023-07-21 22:15:55
disagree it would make the movie seem shallow on its “fight patriarchy” message,2023-07-21 22:23:21
in the movie itself they say the kens represent women in the real world,2023-07-23 23:24:05
"the whole point of the movie is that people put these things on a doll that dont make sense because shes a doll

i thought the daughter was a pretty realistic if caricaturized example of a daughter pushing back hard against her mom and trying to make an identity for herself",2023-07-29 12:28:47
"the fascism line felt so  to me until barbie was like “she thinks im a fascist i dont control the railways or the flow of commerce” 

that made it hilarious to me it mirrored people throwing around words they don’t understand like socialism socialism  ‘anything i don’t like’ to some people 

i think she was just supposed to be an edgy teen and the movie didn’t force us to endure any more ridiculous diatribes she fairly quickly started caring about her mom and barbie and became a tolerable character",2023-07-29 20:40:00

"“is his lack of character development to a degree meant to be a reflection of womens portrayal in the media with one dimensional relationship based identities being a prominent trope of female characters”

yeah i think so  i mean with ken it’s carried to an extreme but that’s the point of satire you make a common thing a little more absurdout of context to show how ridiculous it was all along",2023-07-30 13:13:25
"first part is the construction workers throwing some catcalls at barbie i forget exactly what but it started with shake it or some variant thereof and ended with barbie saying words to the effect of im detecting some entendres here possibly doubled so let me cut you off by saying that i do not have a  i have no genitalia nor does ken followed by ken protesting that he actually has all of the genitals

second part was sugar daddy ken the dog is called sugar but a sugar daddy is you can google this if you dont already know and earring magic ken an especially queercoded ken because wearing one earring was a thing back in the day in some parts of the community",2023-07-21 18:48:37

the scene where president barbie said fk,2023-07-22 08:03:42

i proudly owned the pooping dog lol,2023-07-23 00:48:06
yeah did you not watch the credits those were genuine ads lol,2023-07-23 00:53:49
they’re real i had pregnant barbie and pooping dog which was part of a set where barbie was a dog walker or dog trainer i can’t quite remember pooping dog was recalled because kids were choking on the ,2023-07-23 00:40:36
they are real they talk about some in the documentary the toys that made us barbie episode on netflix,2023-07-23 02:58:59
 same i have no idea what the actual main message was supposed to be but  it at least now the gears are turning,2023-07-24 13:16:12
i really don’t think it’s that complicate of a message  patriarchy bad makes men and women suffer barbie land is a reverse of the real world where men play the role of women and are  and dumb and useless much like women feel and are represented in media in the real world these things are bad  it’s not even saying matriarchy good but it’s asking for some kind of real middle ground,2023-07-24 13:14:50
"the will ferrell thing was sarcasm not sarcasm for the character but sarcasm in a meta way like of course ceos care about money more than the dreams of little girls 

it seemed like barbie could influence the real world like how ken making changes to barbie land resulted in the doja casa house becoming a real product like will ferrell said it could mean very weird things for their world",2023-07-25 17:25:47
i think allan can be interpreted in a number of ways hes not a barbie stereotypical woman or a ken stereotypical man seems to be closer to the barbies than the kens and generally just doesnt quite fit into the whole barbieland concept he could symbolize the  friend he could stand for nonbinary people for gendernonconforming people in any of these cases allan would have good reasons to dislike patriarchy,2023-07-26 02:11:11
also thought it was a bit extreme how barbie was treated in the real world almost every man showed disgusting behaviour and was a part of the patriarchy,2023-07-21 15:46:45

that’s a very superficial description of how jl 2017 was made and how zsjl came about executives at wb wanted to fire snyder for almost a full year before he finally left the production but they were overruled by kevin tsujihara who didn’t want to go through a protracted legal fight with snyder and his wife who both had guaranteed producer credits on several upcoming dceu films in addition to snyder’s directing jobs also snyder was the director with the history of exploiting female characters in all his films and using  and  assault against women in all his nondc films not whedon his passion project was sucker punch for chrissakes the fever dream of 13 yearold boys with  fetishes,2023-07-22 12:28:01
they weren’t mocking or making fun of snyder at all they were making fun of his lunatic fans  i loved that line,2023-07-21 03:02:18
youre wrong theres a specific kind of cult following for znjl and thats why the joke hit so good,2023-07-21 04:45:01
absolutely nothing about the snyder fans’ fervour for the snyder cut has anything to do with his late daughter the joke was funny and not in poor taste sorry to be this guy but i think you’re projecting,2023-07-21 06:43:59
"i loved it simply because i knew whose skin it would get under

edit aw i hurt the snyder cultist in the feels",2023-07-21 12:24:02
"they say the words    censored jokes about beaching each other off someone slaps barbies  women in maid costumes and provocative outfits and just general stuff about the patriarchy also the word  is in the credits multiple times

im sure i missed some other stuff but i really wouldnt recommend taking your young children to barbie its not a kids movie",2023-07-21 20:00:33
all the jokes are based around concepts like patriarchy toxic masculinity objectification things like that i don’t think a young kid would understand the movie that well,2023-07-21 18:58:32
i personally thought the theme of the movie was more mature i dont know if kids will enjoy it besides the colorful scenes,2023-07-21 18:54:22
here in finland its rated for ages 7 and up and after seeing it i dont think it would be a problem,2023-07-21 19:16:28
i took my 9 and 15 year old daughters to watch it there was nothing in it i was concerned that theyd seen,2023-07-21 22:30:13
agreed it felt really dated and weird in a specific way,2023-07-21 23:51:12
yeah that was my favorite part of the whole thing i think it was editors note it was a mistake to cast margot robbie to make this point i died,2023-07-22 05:50:35
it made all the males in the real world and the kens complete morons who were doing something wrong how didn’ demonize men,2023-07-26 19:20:35
it was a real barbie that was released and received poorly then made fun of on the internet then presumably swept under the rug by mattel they were poking fun at that controversy,2023-09-13 16:32:32
"it just felt like punching down by the end of the movie every male character is an idiot and serves a patriarchy yeah we get it 

the real empowering writing would be to let kens allen and the mattel guys actually recognize the barbies as equals and want to be a part of their world  and vice versa with the real world the mattel execs could have listened to the mothers ideas and designs and promoted her allen could have stood up for himself it could have been ok for ken to cry and feel the same negative emotions as barbie instead of being just another joke 

just felt like the movie stirred up a bunch of gender issues and then didnt actually commit to resolving any of them",2023-07-21 09:21:22
actually it was a lot more than a little bit some people are just afraid to say it this movie was absolutely laced with bitterness about men,2023-07-21 09:55:48
dont let a bit of silly fluff like this make you feel bad about yourself,2023-07-21 04:46:39
it made me depressed i have a lot of self loathing for being a man,2023-07-21 04:12:48
i know it is hard but that isnt a bad feeling it means you have empathy you dont have to necessarily change your entire life around this movie just be more aware of how you treat the women and men in your life,2023-07-21 04:54:35
" i felt like it was kind of  on masculinity a little bit

good tbh",2023-07-21 10:34:50
i didnt read it like that to me it was a pretty clear you gotta focus on yourself and not fixate on a girl who only likes you as a friend hence the whole im kenough at the end,2023-07-21 10:40:16
"that was one of those things that struck a chord for me only because its always been true for me but yeah with all these messages throughout the movie youd think theyd spare a little sympathy for ken

but really allan is the one whos suffering in plain sight",2023-07-21 09:32:49
"i think ken not getting with barbie tied to the entire message she acknowledged he wanted love and apologized for taking him for granted but she didn’t love him she shouldn’t be obligated to love him sometimes the people you lovecrush on don’t love you back and you have to accept that it’s part of life 

not to mention ken did a lot of  up  in response to barbie’s rejection",2023-07-21 11:14:40
"ken only became the villain when he tried to take over due to him not getting what he wanted  as well he wasn’t invalidated because he wanted love  there were multiple kens shown who had barbies who loved them he was shown to be wrong for hyperfixating on one girl who clearly wasn’t that into him  
  
the message was accurate  for ken to find love he has to find himself first no one can be happy defining their own happiness through someone else",2023-07-21 10:14:54
the first thing they say about him is that ken doesnt have a good day unless barbie looks at him that wasnt love it was obsession he needed to learn how to exist as his own person,2023-07-21 13:31:05
i second every word,2023-07-23 23:39:11
"ken being merely arm candy is on purpose the film literally compares ken to women in the real world this film isnt trying to be egalitarian its blatantly misandrist in barbieland because that is the whole point

this film never claimed to attempt to deradicalise misogynists and frankly why would it its a fun movie aimed at women of all ages in what way would trying to deradicalise andrew tate fanboys fit the theme",2023-07-24 00:45:10

i think you read the movie wrong the way i read itand i am a man myself actually nor am i at a high ground as another poster accused me on is movie is saying that feminism is equality of all genders and this movie to me isnt saying anything differently,2023-07-23 05:31:46
that’s interesting my partner said she liked the movie because it didn’t point fingers at men and demonstrated that in either world equality of all people regardless of being a ken barbie or alan is essential to harmony and selfidentity,2023-07-23 05:42:48
"i feel like ive just been beaten half to death with a feminist stick 

some of the speeches did resonate with me especially the were expected to do and be everything and then when we arent perfect we are at fault speech boy do i get that hard

i love the narrator line that the kens will achieve equality when women do in the real world i felt she was speaking directly to the men in the audience who might have been frustrated that the movie ended with the barbies back in charge of barbieland it’s a catch22 either he believes we’ve already achieved equality in the real world so no reason to complain about the ending or he admits that there are significant systemic barriers to women achieving equality in the real world and sad for the kens,2023-07-26 10:51:26
i want to be your friend and i want to read the thesis,2023-07-26 07:57:54
do you have any feminist theory to recommend following this up with i was curious how it tied into mainline academia whether it took a certain stance or followed the historical development of ideas,2023-07-26 01:26:17
1010 some of that satire must have rubbed off,2023-07-25 22:25:14
"yeah the barbie land matriachy was portrayed incredibly positively compared to the kendom or real world patriachy on top of that every male character is an idiot or an idiot villain while the barbies are clever and the real world women are heroically battling against the patriarchy

what we “brilliant” satirical points this movie is meant to make it’s clearly laced with a huge topping of anger and bitterness about men and it shows in their portrayal the fact those deep into feminism are unable to see how anti male the portrayal of all the men as dumb doing something wrong and their interests as  is  really says it all about this movie",2023-07-26 03:50:47
"guy here my favorite comeuppance was the bit just before or after it when a ken started talking about stephen malkmus hes the singer from the 90s band pavement that helped spearhead a whole era of indy rock that 9999 of americans who were listening to music at the time wouldnt recognize but greta was clearly one of his fans

i loved the reference because it is so gloriosuly obscure and it teased a whole  of indy music fans who wax lyrical about whatever obscure bands theyve obsessed with to strangers and ive def been that guy in the past  although ive always tried to avoid monologuing and usually learned more from the women ive talked to about music more than been the teacher",2023-07-26 14:23:59
"why is their masculinity threatened because they don’t enjoy mean spirited jokes at their entire gender when women complain about being sexualised or typecast as dumb in old movies is it because their femininity is threatened

seems like saying their masculinity is threatened is just progressive speak to try to stop argument by calling them weak men which is ironic coming from feminist types who are supposedly about men expressing feelings more and such",2023-07-26 12:23:51
"im a man and i did thought how they roasted men was by far the best part but as a whole i really didnt liked it more of that roasting would have been better it was just very unfunny at parts all the storyline about the marvel execs was completely unnecessary the randomness like the ken musical part was completely weird the “hi barbie hi ken” part went into complete cringe super fast… just felt very underwhelmed

it could have been a lot better while giving the exact same message it did

 about it being too feminist is indeed  and dumb",2023-07-26 14:22:56
this sounds about what i expected it just sounded like an exercise in metafiction not an actual enjoyable film,2023-07-21 11:41:43
"not every movie is a marvel movie where there’s an explanation for everything and it all makes “sense” this is satire they literally hand wave it away with “don’t think about it too much” because the why or how doesn’t matter they’re just using the framing as a way to convey a message 

melodrama and satire might not be your cup of tea and you may not have enjoyed this movie which is totally fine but step back from it and analyze why that is is it because it’s bad maybe or is it because it wasn’t made for you or you don’t have the tools to understand how and why the artists made the decisions they did maybe that too

was this a movie about barbie or was it a metaphor for the process women go through when they grow up was the final line a “genital joke” or was it one of the final big steps a young woman makes when she finally accepts she’s no longer a little girl",2023-07-23 04:11:47

"sort of

all the dolls are idiots including barbie because theyre dolls the big gag is that ken reads about some surfacelevel realworld theory about certain problems with the world and wildly misinterprets them as a guide rather than critique

id call them naive and misguided rather than toxic i dont even think theres a proper villain come to think of it not a properly malicious one

but the staff of mattel are portrayed as cartoonish bumbling idiots but their impact on the plot is minimal",2023-07-21 13:29:43

not socalled,2023-07-21 14:59:05
no if anything i would argue quite the contrary it ends with a good message for males to form their identity around themselves and not women that said my biggest issue was that the whole movie has a message for women that everyone is beautiful and it has  barbies and weird barbie in a way i think unintentionally i noticed all of the men were in really good shape so it felt like that message didn’t apply to men keep in mind i drank a lot beforehand so don’t take my word for it fully overall i liked the film a lot,2023-07-21 12:56:55
ehkinda its all a big joke and i thought anyone whod takes it seriouslygets offended by it is a loser,2023-07-21 12:31:07
its more so that it paints manhood from a womans perspective which is often times a bit ridiculous,2023-07-21 13:46:57
"kinda but i think you also have to look at every character on screen to see what greta was trying to say by making every man the worst version of his most glaring flaw 

that sentiment of only seeing your flawswell the fact that we consider that behavior feminine is sort of a big theme in the movie 

all of the male characters are their flaws but at the same time theyre so hilariously overthetop about itand the film goes out of the way to show you how selfaware it isi dont think for a second that this was a lets  on men characterization

i may not be spoton in my analysis that this is a way of mirroring the way women often feel they see themselvesbut id bet dollars to donuts that there was a deeper meaning than that",2023-07-21 13:18:38

i thought the quote was more like “you can come up with things like patriarchy” referencing the idea that patriarchy— the idea that men are superior— is really just a concept that society has made up not that we’re imagining patriarchy’s effects in todays age— it’s real now but it was made up if that makes sense,2023-07-28 02:50:47
but ken wasnt a villian ken was just doing what he saw around him in the real world  the message at the end to ken was that he needed to find who he was from within not barbie not his horse not the other kens or what hes told he is  and that its okay to cry and express yourself,2023-07-21 12:28:23
isnt there only one other movie with a ken in it,2023-07-21 13:55:57
ken is not the villain the patriarchy is it was all a big lie at the end of the day even ken admits this at the end it’s really a commentary on toxic masculinity and in general toxic entrenched gender roles ken fell prey to it because he felt misunderstood—in the same way incels fall down the incel rabbithole that stuff turns men “evil” but it doesn’t mean they are evil he only broke free when he learned he didn’t have to follow what the real world told him to be but could explore who he was as an individual,2023-07-21 12:53:23
uh what hes the antagonist sure but not really villainous just a flawed inidivudal who seeks his on selfworth,2023-07-21 13:49:21
"it definitely slowed down on the second half 

when they went back to barbieland with america ferrara the script was all over the place 

they didn’t know what to do with the mattel ceo and the mother daughter storyline was solved almost instantly",2023-07-21 02:42:20
"women get generally paid lower and are usually not in positions of power compared to men

absolutely  its going to take a long time to change because men are in charge and they think things like this women dont need to be paid as much because they have a man who is already getting paid enough for the both of them

 womens pay is for extras like shoes  haircuts  mens pay is for the house car  food on the table

 men get upset and feel bad about themselves when their boss is a woman  women dont get upset when their boss is a man

 if we recognize her success itll make the men feel bad because they werent able to do what she could shes not really in the dev org because she doesnt write code  me i dont write code either but thats different because im a manager

how do i as a woman know all this  i have been in management for many many years and different male managers were comfortable enough to tell me this stuff

my daughter thought there was enough equality in the world  and then she went to college she saw that the women professors understood her work a lot better than the male professors did  one of the women professors liked her work so much that she asked her to do an independent study project which is prestigious and can lead to graduate work  but then it turns out that ucla recently changed their rules so that only tenured professors can oversee an independent study  most tenured professors are men  the women professors that my daughter had a rapport with did not have tenure  after my daughter lost out on her first shot at a prestigious project she started understanding how the rules are quietly tilted to favor men",2023-07-23 01:52:42
" women have even less bodily autonomy in the us than men

how",2023-07-22 22:08:43
if that was the moral then why did the barbies oppose just turning barbieland back to how it used to be,2023-07-22 07:45:30
did you watch the same movie as the rest of us,2023-07-22 08:50:40
the way kens are treated in barbieland is supposed to parallel how women are treated in the real world the fact that they got some recognition in the end but only took lowlevel jobs at first because they had to start somewhere was a perfect representation of that in my opinion feminism and keninism had to negotiate their way into their respective worlds and have a long way to go,2023-07-22 10:17:59
try letting go of your insecurity and watch it again you might actually get the message which is empathizing with men as much as the women,2023-07-22 12:42:52
i think the issue largely is that i can’t quite pin down what the lead messaging was intended to be was it be yourself was it be an individual was it women power i don’t know because to be able to accomplish any of these would have meant to accept some fault or errors they do this softly with the ken is ken theory at the end but they are ignoring that the rest of the barbie’s aren’t ‘themselves’ they actually don’t get to pick what interests them at all doctor barbie is doctor barbie pregnant barbie is pregnancy barbie they ignore the entire part where what if doctor barbie wants to be retail worker barbie or lifeguard barbie idk the messaging was so sloppy i had no clue what it was trying to say let alone what it did say,2023-07-21 11:17:23
it’s not contradictory at all imo before she went to the real world she saw  cellulite as grotesque and a harbinger of death when she realized the old lady was also beautiful it was a moment of growth,2023-07-23 23:36:56
agreed,2023-07-23 23:42:03
yeah you just didnt understand the movie i guess on purpose anyone with open eyes couldve gotten why the cellulite aspect was in there,2023-07-24 00:34:09
i just watched and youve exactly articulated my experience were my expectations too high from all of the marketing hype i just dont get it,2023-07-26 21:40:12
i agree with all of this,2023-07-26 21:45:39
americas monologue was one of my favorite parts,2023-07-26 22:28:47
"i think the movie was just trying to juggle a lot of things at once there were a lot of potential plot points thrown into the film that were sort of just acknowledged at surface level and then never explored further

i did think that wait the barbies only experienced patriarchy for a day why did they resonate so much with her speech i figure that the small pox analogy works in the sense that no one in barbieland really understands the concept of oppression until the mother and daughter explain the real world to them the same way that ken suddenly has an epiphany that he doesnt like being abused by barbie only when he visits the real world the barbies have the same realization once the roles were switched also it doesnt seem like the barbies have a real concept of time so perhaps them only experiencing something for a day or longer is irrelevant

to your point about linking patriarchy to into mortality i feel they do return to that theme when barbie is talking to the creator at the end  she says something like we use words like patriarchy and barbie to make sense of the world and i felt they wrapped that point up up pretty nicely there although they didnt explore the actual theme of death

x200b

i feel ryan goslings ken had a perfect ending he needs to find happiness in his own identity and showing anything more for him kind of detracts from the point of his character at this stage his identity isnt defined by his love of barbie or horses or being a leader he just has to find satisfaction in simply being himself and i think thats a healthy conclusion for him",2023-08-06 00:29:39
but no one in barbieland besides barbie has any concept of death they do have an understanding of gender dynamics,2023-08-06 13:32:21
wow i agree with this big time i wanted to like it but felt kind of middling about it i too wondered why barbie was having thoughts about mortality only to drop those thoughts for pretty much the entire movie and then at the very end we are supposed to believe that she is still grappling with mortality but wants to be human anyway could have landed way bigger,2023-08-06 00:17:03
"how do they get redemption the kens are still second class the men in the real world are still the same sexist idiots they were portrayed as and ken himself goes off alone or is ken being able to cry supposed to be mens redemption because if so only a tiny percentage of men will resonate with that

the other thing is you may have a point if the barbie land matriarchy in which kens live was portrayed negatively but it isn’t the real world patriarchy is negative and the ken patriarchy is negative  which is weird mixed messaging if kens are the equivalent of women in barbie land

also if this movie is a message to men it’s a weird vehicle for it as most men aren’t going and if they do will probably just be with their family or girlfriend and end up mildly annoyed by it all",2023-07-21 16:06:16
"look before you judge i am a father with a baby girl i like the movie i shed some tears at the last part but the ending is not perfect

will farell ceo still the same douchbag the real life working mom still not earning the position she deserve the barbie president still oppressing the ken by giving minor position as compromise gender oppression both both end still remain

if greta could channel the strength of both gender to make barbie world a better place for coexistense it would be better",2023-07-21 13:15:45
i love ken being the villain because he basically turns into andrew tate after being radicalized by patriarchy  and i was not expecting that from him at all,2023-07-21 23:48:48
til i learn you can get nachos at the cinema i suppose in the us,2023-07-22 03:43:50
"it felt like they were directly spelling out some things while implying the opposite 

and the end resolution of no you cant have any remotely powerful positions in government  seemed to completely miss in terms of illustrating the yo patriarchy and matriarchy are bad point that was implied by the pain that ken was feeling at the beginning and barbie was feeling at the end",2023-07-22 22:13:04
i agree spiderverse was so amazing like i expected it to be a decent follow up first film like thats actually a high expectation and yet it exceeded those its just as good or actually i think its even better,2023-07-23 13:56:10
ironic that in a feminist girl power movie gosling’s ken was the heart of it the only character that had cohesive character development from beginning to end,2023-07-23 21:13:55
ken was the most interesting and complex character by far barbie was very underdeveloped,2023-07-23 21:38:27
i think the level of feminism was appropriate it felt like it was more like an introduction to feminism just like how it was barbie’s first time experiencing being a woman in the real world,2023-07-23 23:03:02
i liked the feminist message i just didn’t like the lazy delivery in movies you have to show rather than preach,2023-07-23 23:35:13
"there is a weird barbie in the movie because she was played with too hard she is barbie that doesnt look perfect with odd haircut ect reinforcing the idea that there is a normal way to look and a non perfect outward appearance is weird

the whole point of that scene was to critique this not reinforce it",2023-08-02 22:16:54
" the movie does nothing to address the undue pressures of beauty standards and prefection that barbie has placed upon women for decades now

this was called out multiple times during the movie america ferreras character calls it out in her monologue in the second half of the film her characters daughter brings it up when she destroys barbie when they first meet and its referenced when barbie has her breakdown in the second half of the film the narrator says that margot robbie is the wrong person to cast if you want to make this point about not feeling beautiful

those are just the few that come to mind but there were others",2023-08-02 17:51:06
they address the why cant barbie be a mother question in the movie at the end though america ferraras character pitches a barbie to her bosses and says maybe she could be just a mother or a working mother etc,2023-08-02 22:06:31
"barbie visits a gynecologist at the end of the movie after seeing a montage of women and their lives maybe now that shes human she might be able to carry a child which brings into the next generation of human barbies   


edit spoilers allowed so",2023-08-02 23:35:28
i think you missed the point of the weird barbie its not about perfect vs imperfect she was the barbie your baby cousin played with except her version of play was cutting barbies hair drawing on her face putting mismatched outfits on her and yes shed always be doing splits because your cousin would hold her by the leg and shake her up and down give a 3 year old a barbie and see what happens weird or not shes still barbie and i loved that nod to her in the film  im honestly surprised they didnt show a barbie with her legs chewed up,2023-08-03 08:11:28
not getting into your whole message but barbie was made to be a replacement for dolls that teach girls only how to be mothers and instead are toys that girls can be anything with a mother barbie would defeat the purpose,2023-08-02 14:01:22

star trek is a thing because of its timely social commentary back in the day movies like aliens robocop starship troopers and bladerunner are amazing films but have tons of social commentary in them

are you  serious please tell me you’re joking or trolling or somehow your comment was not genuine",2023-11-06 05:15:14
i didn’t find that it undermined their message i found that they were empowering young men that their value doesn’t belong in their girlfriend or car or belongings but the high value for a high value male is inside of himself,2023-07-22 03:03:41
yeah from someone who frequently watches snl in the last two or so years she was on the show she really started to outstay her welcome but she was really wellutilised here as opposed to her time on the show where at times it got dangerously close to being the kate mckinnon show,2023-07-22 04:38:25
"or maybe the kens are underdeveloped because gerwig simply went with the same ol comedy trope of “men dumb women smart” that’s been around for decades which she also used for real world men as well

imo a whole lot of people who love the feminist message in this film are reading a whole lot into this film and finding genius satire in everything when in reality it’s not that deep 

likewise i could speculate that perhaps the kens and men are monolithic and dumb because that’s how gerwig actually thinks about stereotypical men like 90 of the male population and alan isn’t shown that way because he’s not stereotypical  which would be very much in line with the kind of less obviously masculine and stereotypical men gerwig seems to portray as good or love interests in her other films the type she prefers or sees as less threatening or bad i guess",2023-07-25 09:36:06
you know how at the end they dont allow a ken to be judge and the voice says theyll have to work their way in little by little obviously this is trying to mirror reality but the funny thing is that barbies didnt have to work for anything barbieland is this magical place since day 1 where barbies are awesome and kens are accessories all the messages in this movie are hamfisted cringe,2023-07-23 01:37:28
i agree and with barbie and ken it seems like their whole relationship was very rushed and dumb i thought going in barbie did love ken but realized she wants more than just a relationship through that ken finds the patriarchy and comes back to control barbie land bc of he is hurt barbie is leaving him ken realizes later its not right to have power over anyone as the rest of them do and decide to share their power and become equal the kens just seem to be hot guys to look at and do nothing but be  and fight bc u know thats all men are right the barbies go back to rule over everything and barbie goes back to the real world bc she liked it there idk it just feels very much like girls rule boys drool type message you can have an empowering feminine message without trashing on the other ,2023-07-22 22:10:00
"there was just way too much going on what was even the point of mattel guys why did barbie want to be human how did all the barbies get brainwashed it felt like things just kept happening and classic barbie barely felt like a main character the barbie i grew up in movies was determined and wouldn’t just immediately give up

at the very least i expected the mom character to get a job higher up in the company but no i guess",2023-07-23 00:35:45
"what was so hard to understand  barbie apologized to ken for never once considering ken’s feelings from being literally an accessory for her none of the ken’s or barbie’s had ever truly considered the nature of their existence and barbie said she had never so much as compared herself to anyone else before

the rift that caused barbie to have these thoughts had ripple effects ken getting into the patriarchy because it suddenly made his existence as magical as barbie’s made a lot of sense  i don’t think they need to go further into how the barbie’s became brainwashed because they had never encountered outside ideas before so they would be easy targets for newfound philosophies having never dealt with complex thoughts before 

barbie needed to apologize because ken had probably held longtime deep feelings of being incomplete being an accessory to someone who doesn’t love him romantically  the ken’s needed to understand they are kenough and are more than just and ken the incremental changes of ken’s now occupying some minor positions of power is just a tongue in cheek jab at the real world and is much better than barbie creating a perfect utopia",2023-07-22 22:56:26
"i agree with all of this i also think it’s funny how the speech ends with “then i don’t know” like exactly… you just want to point out the issues but not develop them because there isn’t enough time at this point in the movie 

also side note i hated when they unbrainwashed that one barbie and she said “i would never wear this” and the mom goes “of course you wouldn’t you’re a physicist” like uhh okay i understand if you said it’s because she was brainwashed but because she’s smart she wouldn’t dress in revealing clothing that and the making fun of the pregnant barbie when the mother says a few minutes later to make a mother barbie… 

i liked some of the themes but it felt like it put women down weird barbie and just liking her at the end because she helped them is a worn out trope and was preachy as well as just making a joke out of men so they could get twitter users to really like it i also feel like people made their opinions about the movie before watching it and do not want to change it hate or love especially online we never admit we’re wrong online",2023-07-23 00:09:54
"and finally the ending you expect everything to get resolved but it doesnt the male ceo of mattel continues to make money off of women and also contributes to capitalism by making an ordinary barbie the patriarchy in the real world was not affectedchanged whatsoever 

late to this thread but would it not be incredibly insincere for these issues to be magically resolved when they are still ongoing and the mattel thing is probably as far as they could push that criticism without losing their licence 

totally take your point re the motherdaughter relationship though felt like it never went anywhere meaningful 

now i understand that all the barbies were like brainwashed or something but they didnt even explain that well and made it seem like women liked being part of the patriarchy unless someone snapped them out from it thats untrue no women likes the patriarchy and were perfectly aware that its happening

i think this is probably the biggest issue with the film or at least its most distracting plot point to the point where i feel like i must be missing some subtext  if anyone can explain id appreciate it how would ken persuade a community that doesnt take him seriously into a completely new worldview the fact that he successfully brainwashed anyone just infantilised the barbies and suggests that they never had any power or agency to begin with but then the entire movie relies on the idea that they do what gives",2023-07-23 23:59:46
"agree with this writeup 100 

i think at its root this movie is actually supposed to be a brain off movie its a dumb summer commedy that doesnt have much to say about anything and thats fine its good even for someone to want a movie like that to have a message i laughed at this movie it was fun to laugh

but unfortunately this is also an antipatriarch film its very very overt about this its the main conflict its the primary motivation for the villain its the inciting action of the film even and holy  it just butchers the attempt it makes at a message they shouldnt have done both it cant be a brain off dumb comedy and a feminist critique of society it doesnt work why the film even brings up critiques of capitalism when its the mess it is with everything else escapes me to seem cool seems like it worked general audiences seem to think it was a power move against mattel to make this movie  people in this thread are convinced of that on comments with thousands of points

i wish i could have also brain off watched this movie but just could not thinking about the movie after the fact and im mostly sickened that its pushing a promattel narrative on the back of feminism and they seem to have gotten away with that scott free im expecting a product line of relatable barbies real woman barbie depression barbie etc to be sold to adults for 60doll in the coming months",2023-07-22 23:54:15
"i disagree with all of this im going through me second bell hooks book right now all about love and to me it seemed like greta gerwig was very well informed about radical feminism the handling of the kens  thats straight up out of bell hooks book or some transformative justice talk men are also victims of the patriarchy and barbie helped ken realize it she began to understand her true value and set him on the path to discover his

the movie is not only about wanting to be seen and acknowledged it also pushes against the idea that the world can be neatly fixed so many young radical people activists etc work so hard for a year or two and then get burned out and quit altogether when really theyd probably be more impactful if the pursued less shiny endeavors and did what they could to finish the marathon instead of trying to sprint 

the world wasnt perfect at the end because in real life it never will be but all the characters moved closer to selfactualization  i just read a pema chödron passage about bodhichitta being the opposite of a path toward answers and more about being comfortable with uncertainty  along the lines of what ruth was telling barbie

idk this was the funniest movie ive seen in a while its also one of the few big blockbuster movies ive seen wear its radical feminist themes on its sleeve and handle those themes with the nuance deserved",2023-07-22 21:09:43
"about why barbie wanted to become human i feel there was a lot missing a real heart to heart with the mother and daughter duo where she not only remembers her visions of them playing with her but yearns for it not as a toy but a human having a childhood going to school growing up and figuring out who she is for example realising she missed out on that but that if she leaves barbieland she can still figure out who she is and grow old in a bittersweet happiness instead of the forever perfect plastic world then the moment barbie chooses to become human would feel more deserved instead the only thing we got was that short scene where she tells that old woman she is beautifull and a telepathic movie maker montage from ruth at the end to kind of hint that she wants that

honestly it was ken who had more reasons to stay in the real world after all it took him less than a day to realise he was more welcome there than in barbieland",2023-07-27 20:40:10
its a pg13 film but the  references are hidden enough id say its fine she probably wont understand all of the messages about patriarchy and gender roles though,2023-07-21 11:27:52
yes id say so,2023-07-21 10:57:00
yes but i dont know that kids that age would enjoy it i went with friends who both have 9yo daughters and they werent sure if their daughters would actually like the movie its definitely geared towards older kidsadults,2023-07-21 13:18:29
its rated pg13 is your 8 year old 13,2023-07-21 11:17:02
i would say so most of what got it a pg13 are play on words jokes that will go over most kids heads,2023-07-21 13:59:43
they could but it’s not made for them at all it would be very confusing and weird,2023-07-21 14:55:47
they can but the concepts the movie deals with are not aimed at kids hence pg13 so itll be more misses than laughs,2023-07-21 16:52:47
technically yes i just dont know how they will perceive such an adult movie perhaps the funny scenes will keep an 8 year old entertained,2023-07-21 14:53:30
i don’t understand that line   am i suppose to ,2023-07-23 21:49:15
jamie demetriou was a nice surprise and happy he got some screen time i have a hunch that may have been improv  you should check out his show stath lets flats if you havent seen it yet,2023-07-23 22:26:51
the fascination with ryan reynolds is an overwhelmingly straight guy phenomenon so im not at all surprised he wasnt in barbie,2023-07-28 13:08:38
marketing is basically the act of intentionally creating hype so saying “this isn’t hype” isn’t actually correct it’s still hype supported by marketing and particularly with this movie you can see how marketing and public hype can feed into each other,2023-07-21 15:14:49
tbh i think most companies are starting to distance themselves from reddit and twitter because of the negativity involved right now so it wouldnt be surprising if thats one reason they chose to stay away from here,2023-07-21 15:43:57
if you don’t think people are hyped for this movie you don’t have social media,2023-07-21 15:35:24

my absolute embodiment of kino friend like his whole life is just watching movies watch both openheimer and barbie today and liked barbie more

why are you so emotionally invested in convincing people there isn’t hype for a movie people are clearly hyped for ,2023-07-21 17:32:24
you’re 100 right it’s hardly just this movie though so much of reddit is ads and propaganda disguised as casual conversation,2023-07-21 22:56:54
finally someone that agrees with me i was so disappointed by this movie,2023-12-16 10:05:16
im not being argumentative here but im honestly shocked that anyone could come away from this bored i can understand having issues with the messaging or how its delivered but boring seems crazy to me,2024-01-04 11:21:15
humour is subjective to say that anyone who didnt appreciate the film must be  is as ridiculous as insisting a song you like is perfect and anyone who doesnt agree doesnt understand it,2023-07-23 21:29:42
painting people who dont get the jokes as  is itself pretty ,2023-07-23 20:13:48
it seems like anyone who has different opinion than you is wrong,2023-07-23 19:18:41
"there is a hack hollywood has figured out where if you turn a movie from being actual art with something new and fresh to say and present into simply a two hour film celebration of a groups values and beliefs it makes it almost critic proof and those whose values are being celebrated buy tickets and overlook all the flaws of the movie aggresively attacking any critics

take sound of freedom critics who pointed out the flaws of the movie have been attacked as being either antiamerican or prosex trafficking critics of barbie fear being called sexist and antiwomen since movie critics generally want to stay on the good side of those with certain values its easier just to praise propaganda for being good propaganda and live another day then to call it out for being a bad movie",2023-07-22 11:05:36
why do messages about feminism and the patriarchy have to be subtle  do you think the director wanted them to be subtle,2023-07-22 11:42:03
i’m shocked it has been so well received it was so painfully…bland,2023-07-24 07:44:34
"messages can only be good if theyre subtle

what momentum would the finale need it was a loving conversation between creator and creation and about not having to be who you thought you had to be   it was the emotional grip of the film 

why out of place

they werent supposed to be funny were they they were supposed to be the joke

the daughter literally spends the movie developing a connection with her mother that had disappeared and spent a whole adventure opening up her horizons she set out a goal to achieve and achieved itand thats not enough for someone to be happy

people liking things i dont means they  at rating and the things i hate are objectively bad and everyone look at me im  and i decided what is right and wrong in this world

 pretentious film bros i swear",2023-07-22 12:37:00

yeah its from the novel the shining but stephen king the shiningshine is psychic powers,2023-07-21 23:43:55
idk exactly cause i read the book like a billion years ago but i believe its in reference to the shining where there was some kind of telepathy between people allowing them to communicate,2023-07-21 23:31:27

have you ever seen nice guys gosling is a comedy gem,2023-07-24 09:41:20
i think the podcaster with two trees would be a reference to zach galifianakis and his between two ferns interviews which are hilarious and really fun to watch  where he takes a serious tone asking different actors really  questions and such and making fun of them only for it to almost always backfire in his face with the actor hes interviewing just hitting him with roasts as well,2023-07-28 01:18:21
i believe the first one was where she said she ‘doesn’t control the railways or the flow of commerce’ which i believe is a reference to benito mussolini,2023-07-31 17:03:13
just watched the movie and man i envy you i’d really like to be able to laugh myself to muscle spasms from a comedy movie it was alright tho,2023-09-19 18:31:51
no it’s not the woman on the bench is actually ann roth,2023-07-22 02:18:42
thats actually wrong info thats being passed around shes a costume designer that has worked with the director,2023-07-22 02:35:59
ryan gosling really creeped me out haha  his stares were so evil looking  him seeing his own value and an opportunity to figure himself out in the end was so good,2023-07-22 11:38:35
she went to the gynecologist cause she finally has genitalia now  i dont think that part was meant to be deep,2023-07-22 20:47:29
"the gynecologist was a perfect ending one its a joke and a confirmation she is 100 human genitalia and all and the other is that for a lot of girls that first gynecologist visit has a lot of emotional weight its a scary exciting and very vulnerable experience literally having a stranger poke all up in and around you that marks a transition into adulthood 

i think the reason why things werent magically fixed in terms of gender equality is because the whole point of the movie is that gender equality is huge and complex issue its not fixed by releasing more barbies nor is it fixed by a single moving speech just like in the real world instead we see there has been change and are told that the change will gradually have an impact",2023-07-22 21:22:10
i thought so too but at the same time it was a play on the real world women have to wait to get all their rights i think that was the goal was to shed light on women’s experience in the real world,2023-07-22 19:59:34
i thought that cheeky line of one day the kens will have as much power in barbieland as women do in the real world kinda brought it back to the fact that barbieland is a fantasy world where women will continue to be the ones with power in order to cope with the inequalities they face in the real world,2023-07-23 12:23:18
"now the kens know what its like to have freedom but are forced to go back into a life of submission to the barbies

theyre not in submission to the barbies theyre still superfluous but thats a function of what barbieland is which is a dreamland through which young women and girls playing with dolls can process whats happening in their lives through play women are the most important people in barbieland because the people playing with barbies are women and presumably some men but within the context of the movie everyone who plays with barbie dolls is female",2023-07-23 12:22:04
"i had the same initial thought until my friend reminded me that this film really can’t dismantle the actual patriarchy they start to give ken’s more rights at the very end and imply it’s similiar to what women get in the real world small steps but similiar to society

i would have preferred to have seen ken help barbie instead of her helping him i understand the intention was to mimic how women are always seen as responsible for men’s emotions but i would have liked to have seen the ken’s as being allies for barbie",2023-07-23 12:18:14
hmm that’s not how i interpreted it at all they were pretty clear that barbie realized under the old society of barbieland that the kens weren’t able to find their own identities which was bad barbie says at the end it “it’s barbie and it’s ken” the message was that the kens just need to find their own identities and not rely on traditional masculinity stereotypes which is harmful i don’t see that as being “men ” i see it as being “neither men nor women should rely on gender stereotypes as their personality”,2023-07-23 12:18:14
i feel like they shouldve done more with the mattel ceo will ferrell and shown more real world consequences of kendom just a more intense plotline overall wouldve been nice,2023-07-31 18:44:09
"you nailed it and the fact that your comment is being downvoted pretty much sums up this entire thread 

the movie seemed like it had a good overall message but it was a confused mess in terms of actually getting that message across in a way that made sense and they fumbled it so badly that by the end it seems like many of us were left wondering what the message was even supposed to be",2023-07-22 16:09:04
"id argue that scene was to explore judith butler thesis on how gender is a performative act  stallone  his outfits and sports are how men perform to show offsignal that they are are men in society

the act of performance leads into binary outcome and exclusivity ie blue is for boys and pink is for girls  that exclusivity filters choices and resulting limitation on options and forms the foundation of any hierarchy patriarchy in our society

x200b

anyways if youre interested in this topic  judith butler is where to start",2023-07-22 16:32:18
"the mansplaining scenes also just felt very mean spirited perhaps because i am secure enough to appreciate and value the opinions of the men in my personal and professional lives without viewing it as condescension scenes like that just make women look resentful

the film is made incoherent by tackling too much and shoving it in packaging that doesnt make sense kens start out as accessories that are afterthoughts to barbies and that starting point just doesnt make sense for any substantial appraisal of real world masculinity or femininity the message ironically reinforces menwomen go their own way that is really rather bleak",2023-07-22 15:52:12
to me the point was you’re supposed to be uncomfortable by the barbie’s treatment of ken and if you are you should be uncomfortable with how barbiewomen are treated in the real world that’s more interesting than a “we can all be equal” happy ending,2023-07-22 16:23:08
mens sports is seen as superior to womens sports  thats why that shot is in there,2023-07-22 15:42:45
i think the thing with stallone in particular was it was part of montage just showing men in a way that was celebrating just for existing as men,2023-07-22 16:00:03
"yeah but that was the equality or something according to gerwig i dunno this did feel very man bashing and bitter

like the barbie matriarchy was good and it’s good they won even though the patriarchy in real world is constantly mentioned as this terrible thing and the women battling against sexism in the real world are good but then when the kens do something about their situation it’s good the barbies put a stop to it

and this was supposedly a humanist film showing feminism is for everyone according to gerwig what",2023-07-21 08:13:45

my husband and i hated it wasn’t funny at all and all jokes felt awkward and didn’t make sense america ferrera’s entire speech about being a woman made me cringe into my hand and i am a woman i resonated with some but this movie made the men way too dumb and the story didn’t even mesh together too many questions and dumb scenes like the scenes of them leaving barbie land,2023-07-22 04:14:39
it was kind of funny that they basically went around converting otherwise fairly happy women with manhating drivel and propaganda it does kind of reflect how women are twisted by hateful ideology in the real world they like to throw around this trope of incel men being radicalized by extremist groups but thats exactly what menhating extremists groups do with women with movies like barbie its like this movie just told on itself without really meaning to,2023-07-24 05:29:31
"i agree with that i wanted to really like this movie because the production set was amazing and the director seemed to want to study incorporate several old film designaesthetics 

if it was just the “tedtalk” scene i would have thought it would be fine but they kept going even in the truck started to cringe me then and then it kept going when a certain grandma showed up later for barbies character arc conclusion",2023-07-23 17:46:30
lol the wikipedia page analysis section treats this movie like a phd thesis,2023-07-23 17:12:41
"because they’re adults who understand the type of movie that’s being made and the criticism the movie levels at them isn’t so sophisticated that they are probably very aware already of the things the movie points out

also apparently gerwig told them this would be a billion dollar movie and that’s way more important than not being the butt of a few minor jokes",2023-08-05 12:52:13
"the script also contains candid criticism of mattel which created skepticism among mattel officials when they received the first version however kreiz decided to trust gerwig

sounds like they just backed out of comments on the movie in that regard",2023-08-05 04:51:09
mattel didn’t choose anything gerwig and robbie were driving the ideas which they pitched to mattel some were met with skepticism but they were convinced and told it was very self aware poking fun and that it would be funny it’s my understanding that mattel didn’t have much to do with the story and ideas they just approved it,2023-08-05 10:41:11
they basically address this in the movie it will make money,2023-08-06 06:14:19

i was actually so confused by this quote in a movie about how women can achieve anything and be powerful  it was so sad to me that this quote about motherhood was basically once you are a mother you stop progressing did others have different interpretations it just felt like a very outdated way of thinking which is maybe why they had ruth say it but during such a meaningful part of the movie that really shocked me and made me sad when i become a mom i definitely don’t plan on “standing still” and in many ways i feel guilty about the lack of opportunities my mom and other moms have been afforded because she had me as a child i don’t think that sacrifice should be held up as an accomplishment but rather an indication of how far our society still has to go to provide equality to women and birthing parents,2023-07-21 20:13:22
i actually liked that it was long and exhausting it can be exhausting being a woman and a long monologue like that can really bring that point home,2023-07-22 02:32:47

mattel is owned by warner bro discovery who made the film just like the lego movies if anything  this movie makes it more socially acceptable to make new intersectional barbies like the transgender barbie that was in the film,2023-07-23 02:19:21
" poof barbie is human

i really struggled with this as soon as i walked out of the theater but it made more sense to me when i thought about how margots barbie was stereotypical barbie and that the barbie stereotype in reality tends to be superficial and something that girls are expected to grow out of and many girls end up completely rejecting think of how normal it is to hate pink so that stereotypical image of barbie being perfect skinny blonde and nothing more needed to transform into something else",2023-07-24 20:34:17
"i was expecting scenes to flow a lot more like elf or enchanted in which a “nonhuman” or someone from another fantasy comes to face reality

100 this the idea of barbie wanting to become human should have been explored so much further there are profound lessons and takeaways for the audience within this specific plot point too barbie who is perfect sees beauty within the imperfections and emotions of real lifereal people we see a 1minute glimpse of this as she sits at the bus stop but that is the only time its addressed then at the end boom she becomes human there just wasnt a whole lot of development to get us there",2023-07-24 19:39:42

see i actually feel like it was the opposite it feels to me like they were making a movie that was fun and funny and has a feminist storyline and thatsit maybe im wrong i havent listened to any interviews to know what the intent was but it really feels like the hype surrounding it was what made it seem like were supposed to reflect on it when really its just like lol it really do be like that sometimes",2023-08-15 15:22:01

i feel that men aren’t as satisfied with this movie because everything is made for you this movie was meant to make women feel the spotlight i’ve never seen a movie with that many women speaking to each other,2023-07-22 19:58:34
honestly i didn’t see barbie set a boundary with ken she was super unclear and i think it was kind of blatantly mean ken was made for barbie and she never told him she didn’t want that from him she just let him go on and embarrass himself and the whole movie was women laughing at him for being so  like if we want ment to not turn into hateful oppressors we can’t just laugh at them and set loose boundaries,2023-07-23 07:39:34
you do realize men have their own duality of expectations right its part of the human condition living in society but lets just dumb down the kens make them selfish and evil manipulate them and then have a good laugh at them in the end wonderful writing,2023-07-23 08:31:19
"  in regards to ken i started out in the first scene thinking man barbie should really be nicer to ken but in truth she was establishing a firm boundary with a man she didnt have feelings for 

i think the movie has a lot to say about gender but i dont think it is saying anything about unrequited crushes or setting boundaries  

barbie refers to him as her boyfriend  shes not setting boundaries because she isnt an actual woman she is a childs version of what a woman is",2023-07-23 23:52:21
the kens weren’t told they couldn’t have jobs…they were told they’d one day rise to the level women are at now basically like “no you can’t be president yet but we’ll let you have some positions of power” which is…exactly how it is for women…,2023-07-23 09:48:31
"the takeaway message is it feels crappy when a whole group of people don’t get equal participation right

but don’t worry the kens get as much as women do in the real world so if it feels crappy to imagine kens having less equality remember that’s exactly what women experience in reality 

it’s literally the exact same amount of inequality by narrative fiat",2023-07-30 04:06:22
having just watched it i hear what youre saying i suspect the filmmakers didnt want to end on an unambiguously positive note given how relatively subversive the rest of the film is esp for a barbie movie,2023-07-30 03:51:17
so i had to sleep on this because i felt the same way leaving the theater in the real world it would have made sense to end it on the equality note but in the context of barbieland ken really is secondary i think what could have fixed this and it would have been simply a change of one phrase instead of ken is me they had the kens say ken is barbie when i clicked that into place it made way more sense because barbie can literally be anyone,2023-07-30 13:26:24
it’s funny you accuse barbie of treating ken as less than because she didn’t center him or cater to him she literally just did her own thing,2023-07-30 10:41:15
its actually somewhat worse they deny a scotus spot to ken and think theyre better suited for lower court meanwhile the actual scotus has had women on it for like 40 years not sure what the filmmaker was thinking with that inclusion in the script or if she was even thinking at all,2023-07-30 20:30:27
sadly this is a morality concept a lot of people struggle with if you want to preach a lesson in morality you have to be better than your opponent not just reach the same level as them,2023-07-30 19:16:01
"i dont think that the barbies beign oh so mercyfull by giving to the kens would be a good final it would feel paternalistisc well maternalistic in this case it would feel like oh you  kens if you wanted a bit of rapresenterion and to be considered equals you only had to ask nicely it might work for the final of a children film that has to clearly show the moral in the end but it would not fit here also i disagree with this idea i see in many comments that the barbies in this film are shown to have learned the lesson and generally be better than kensmens etc they didnt have this journey the simply lost barbieland to the kens and the take it back and they arent shown as much more awear than the start the barbies as a group dont have this arc that is margot barbie arc in fact she is the one that make the not sure this is good a bit bitter face when she hears this
barbieland at the star of the movie is a mirror of the real world and at the end it still is barbie gloria and her daughter and a bit ken too are the only ones that were changed by the experience they are the only not strereotipical peopledoll in there",2023-07-30 06:12:53
they weren’t saying everyone believed barbies made everything perfect for women that was the mentality of the barbies at the beginning—the ultraextreme feminist viewpoint women should rule the world and in the movie barbies are fixing everything then barbie becomes self aware and eventually realizes that viewpoint is wrong i don’t think anyone was saying people thought barbie fixed any problem a woman’s ever had hope that was coherentmade sense,2023-07-22 09:53:52
spot on  really preachy and only like two funny jokes,2023-07-22 09:26:01
"personally as a man who saw this with my girlfriend i didnt feel the movie was man hating at all it seemed logical for ken to turn to patriarchy considering how empty his life was before

personally i was glad i saw it my gf she really enjoyed it and i think she really appreciated the messaging",2023-08-02 15:40:28
its pretty obvious its not man hating though ive not heard anyone say that in real life and we all know how the internet blows things out of proportion,2023-08-04 00:01:09
my screening was full of under 10yearold kids they all looked so confused and disappointed,2023-08-04 13:44:45
"somehow the messaging was heavyhanded and didn’t say anything at all at the same time

i’m all for movies exploring gender roles in society how what we play with as a child shapes our sense of self where our inherent self worth comes from…seems like they had all the elements there for an interesting movie but the messaging was just so obtuse and simplistic that it really doesn’t provoke anything 

also the music and dancing was meh at least make the fun parts fun",2023-08-02 15:49:05
"i get not enjoying the movie but i did not think it was divisive over gender and i am a man i invited my wife to go watch it with me and i enjoyed it more than she did

x200b

i wanted clueless meets the flinstones movie but i got a wasted night out  


this movie was the exact opposite of clueless and silly it was so incredibly meta and selfaware which is where most of the humor comes from makes sense if you were expecting a clueless comedy set in barbie land that you did not enjoy it much it was a bit deeper than i thought it would be it would pretty close to what i expected based on the trailers i expected it to touch on current issues in an over the top absurd way which is precisely why i enjoyed it i laughed more than all of the teens in the theater",2023-08-02 15:58:05
i dont think you are the target audience  it has a 12a rating i am also a woman in my 20s who enjoyed barbie while certain moments in the movie were clearly included for an adult audience i think it would really be best enjoyed by girls aged 1618 who might have frustrations with the gendered world around them and might feel understoodempowered by the relatively entrylevel feminist ideas within,2023-08-03 22:26:33
"because it is a political movie and people agree with the politics and got a few laughs so think it is good

it was alright i am not the target audience and had a few laughs but it’s forgettable",2023-08-04 20:28:33
but why though why bring all that baggage into the barbie toys why invent this lore that ken was mistreated by barbie as just an accessory he wasnt in all the barbie movies animated kens fine he was never treated as lesser than and barbie was never matriarchy why did greta gerwig get that from a barbie toy that was not the point of the toy little girls playing with barbies werent dreaming of a world where girls rule the world and men are secondrate citizens where is that coming from thats not the fabric of barbie,2023-07-21 17:45:11
to be fair every man in the film was a misogynist piece of trash i think thats a pretty unhealthy message for any kids movie,2023-07-21 18:17:03
i think its more about how men are portrayed as all trash in a feminist propaganda movie,2023-07-21 17:57:58
you up in here typing paragraphs at some imaginary outrage you invented and you cant stop laughing at it,2023-07-21 17:24:47

"yeah i felt dumb when i drove home and thought about on the intrinsic rule and values of the barbies for being so  to the kens

then i thought to myself if they make an action man movie there better not be any dolls on the marine council who ride around on  sharks ill tell you that much",2023-07-21 17:56:45
"people like thing upvote

people dislike thing downvote

not everything is a conspiracy",2023-07-24 11:18:42
this is a dumb comment because it’s valid criticism to you that doesn’t make it valid universally of course your gonna disagree when something you agree with is downvotedmost of the criticism i see is just men i’m a guy btw seeing this film as antimen when it’s literally just putting men in the place of women so they get it for a half second and it’s covered and baked around an incredibly funny film and visual style,2023-07-24 13:11:16
"at first i thought it was a joke about the absurdity of having a barbie whose thing is the french novelist proust but theres a deeper meaning 

i guess proust wrote a novel that reflected the human plot a bit also i didnt make the connection before reading the article but its also funny on a meta level since robert oppenheimer loved proust",2023-07-21 19:40:04
and they apologized to her and brought her into the fold she wasnt the only one ostracised in some way the discontinued crowd was a nice touch i love how the ending isnt a magical and everything was now truly perfect forever and ever but rather it showed that true and meaningful change takes time and encouraging the challenge to take that first important step,2023-07-23 02:50:46
i think they were disappointed in her because it countered the point of barbie being able to do anything she wants and working hard to get there but at that moment she resembled the resentment people have about barbie being perfect without doing anything,2023-07-23 06:30:19
"a good point i also thought it could also have a silly reading behind it – when ken is walking around la he spots policemen on horses his brain just goes horse  power and authority he says horses are just manextenders because he thinks horses make you look even more manly and impressive the funny thing is in modern society we have horse girl memes and being obsessed w ponies seems so feminine to us

  
i thought it a way of poking fun at how even when men establish their manly things it can still have feminine or  undertones ie wrestling also shown when the kens go to war and they just end up doing a cute dance number together",2023-07-23 12:48:18

"i heard that she requested script rewrites part of me almost wonders if it was that scene  it would have been typical for her to express shock at how people get old in the real world but when she called her beautiful i almost teared up it was a nice moment  
  
oh and ken was amazing in this movie despite him being “just ken” you have to look back and realize it would have honestly been only 50 of a movie without him",2023-07-21 10:11:33
america still hasnt had a female president  like they said one day ken can reach the level women are in the real world  it cant be magically perfect the whole point is the gender reversed society,2023-07-23 09:48:29

they said that the kens would one day rise to the levels women are at today",2023-07-23 09:46:35
i totally agree with you the delivery of the message is so lazy,2023-07-23 23:37:24
i dont think this movie or its promotions ever once tried to pretend like it wasnt gonna be ham  its campy its extra its hilarious its not supposed to be subtle,2023-07-23 22:43:32
it wasnt perfect by any stretch from a plot perspective but that wont stop me from buying an i am kenough shirt,2023-07-23 22:47:04
"my date wanted to walk out


hahah what 

really 

you went with a women to this movie and at the end of it the girl wanted to leave

impressive that says more about you than you think im not a women i went with my wife all her friends adore the film ive not actually met anyone irl that didnt like it one of the guys in our audience was a big bald guy that couldnt stop laughing the whole time it was a ride

i mean cinema is an opinion but critics love it audience clearly loves it you are the minority here and it might be worth exploring why

i get the other commentators theyre mad about irrelevant conservative political points but youve got something else youve managed to find probably the only women that would have walked out of a barbie movie of all things

tell me was your date bothered about wearing pink or dressing up for it 

jfc even the  conservative prime minister of the uk loved the film",2023-07-23 23:54:57
the cringey billie eilish wannabe was billie eilish lol,2023-07-26 11:04:50
the movie felt like it underwent reshoots i particularly feel like the chase scene from the mattel building is filler for whatever failed the audience acceptance screenings,2023-07-26 14:58:47
"yeah i agree with you for the most part it could have remained a feminist commentary without blatantly telling you it was a feminist commentary with every step some of the on the nose stuff was funny but there were parts of it that straight up ruined scenes for me 

there was a line from the narrator at the end that had me literally like how on earth did that get left in there because of how much it brought the mood down it was where the kens are asking if they can be part of the presidents cabinet and shes like no but you can have a more minor role to start or something like that and the kens get all excited and then the narrator goes that would give them about as much power as a woman in the real world like that line left me so disappointed in the moment like it was not only overkill by that point but it just made me sad that they couldnt have just let it be a harmonious moment where progress is made without reminding everyone of the fact that women arent treated as equals for the 100th time in the span of 2 hours it was just shocking to me that they felt it made the scene better at the point in the movie where feelings of resolution are okay and appropriate like the world isnt perfect and we all know that women arent always treated equally and we know that it was just such an irritating miss

there were elements of the movie that i totally enjoyed and thought were spot on and i would like to watch it again when its released on streaming services but right now i think its a movie that i appreciated more than a movie i totally loved",2023-07-26 16:46:31
completely agree with this,2023-07-26 08:49:43
one could hear crickets in out theater when they went into a preachy monologue people were expecting campy fun not far left ideologies documentary just hearing this words made me sigh so hard patriarchy fascist capitalism among others,2023-07-26 12:23:40
"you werent hyped you just want an excuse to come on here and 

im sure barbie and its 14b box office is crying itself to sleep over your lack of taste",2023-09-22 20:39:00
"i agree with all of your points i felt like it was very heavy handed and the gloria storyline was kind of meh 

i wish the end where barbie sees all the women and life and trees also showed suffering  attending funerals being fired getting into a a car accident fighting with your loved ones being heartbroken but it only showed the beauty in the world and i just don’t think it was giving what it needed to give 

gosling was absolutely favorite part of the movie there was one part when barbie comes back to town and he’s a  and they fight he says something hurtful to her i don’t remember what exactly and he is so upset that he is intentionally hurting her it really broke my heart

i think maybe they could have taken barbie’s story in a different direction maybe focus more on finding her purpose in life and helping gloria doing the same thing gloria was suffering and felt hopeless would have been nice to see that addressed in a different way other than defeating the patriarchy lol 

the whole things feels like a vicious cycle the barbie’s think they changed all of womankind by having jobs and  now they think they have solved all the problems by defeating the ken patriarchy did they actually do anything i dunno 

the message for men was stronger and more lovely than that directed at women",2023-07-25 02:22:19
"this movie is actually way too complicated for little kids i think it’s better to show as preteens because of some of the subject matter and because little children don’t understand concepts like patriarchy they have a childlike understanding that men tend to control the world but explaining systemic sexism is difficult 

i actually think barbie not showing interest in ken made perfect sense as a woman we’ve been told by the media since children our biggest accomplishment is to marry someone and then our story ends by not being interested in ken — a predetermined person for her — but wanting a life of her own choosing for herself gave her more agency than most films give women a lot of greta gerwigs films do not end with the girl getting the guy because just like men have stories that don’t revolve around partnership so do women 

and ken didn’t really like barbie — ken lacked self esteem and a sense of identity — something he wanted barbie to give him barbie actually does the more caring and loving thing which is to tell ken he’s enough as he is and he needs to love himself",2023-07-24 13:08:35
they didnt  the kens they let the kens play guitar at them for 45 hours and then talked to a different ken resulting in each of their kens becoming jealous of the other ken they went to talk to after listening to 45 hours of the same song being played at them over and over this resulted in the kens waging war against each other insecure children much silly boys only allen avoided the nonsense allen is the real mvp here,2023-07-24 09:02:08
i think the husband scene practicing spanish was kind of a nod to america ferreras roots as si se puede was a part of her big break in gotta kick it up one of the first films she acted in as a teenager the film was largely adored by both white and latinxlatino fans and even though white people often barely speak three words of spanish it is appreciated when they put in effort to learn the language and respect the culture being a part of the americas north central and south citizens of the united states could do better to honor our brothers and sisters to the south including learning at least some of the spanish language,2023-07-31 19:16:10

mucho texto,2023-07-24 10:05:58
there are “curvy” barbies but they aren’t that big tbh,2023-07-21 19:51:59
yeahish my little sister even has a “curvy” mermaid barbie theyre supposed to be bigger than standardbut i wouldnt even call it ,2023-07-21 22:18:39
" to me at the end of the movie i got the message was there was love and respect towards menken by the barbies in barbieland

ehhhh the state of barbieland at the end of the movie was more or less where we are in the real world with roles reversed some kens have learned to be their own persons but society at large still others kens and holds them back the whole point is that it is sort of an inverse of the real world granted that doesnt mean the movie bashed males the plight of kens is supposed to mirror the plight of women in the real world",2023-07-23 03:30:43
were men in barbieland allowed to be on the supreme court at the end were they allowed equal political representation they didnt show any men who became doctors lawyers teachers or respected career people they were mostly still caricatures of men,2023-07-23 02:57:59
the movie is just a bad movie the feminism is shallow and its unfunny if anything im triggered that people are impressed by this baseline feminism,2023-07-23 02:43:49
"you have the wrong interpretation of the movies message the barbies realized that a matriarchal society is bad because the kens can’t find their own identities

it doesn’t go back to the status quo though the barbieland they made is a better version but not a perfect utopia it’s meant to be a reflection of our current world just flipped it’s not like one day everyone woke up in our current world and women became president and doctors and lawyers and supreme court justices that has taken decades and decades of progress and we still aren’t there all of the way yet",2023-07-23 12:42:36
it doesnt go back to being the way it was though there were remnants of ken and also of weird barbie even after the barbies kicked the kens out power – notice her shell bed isnt allpink anymore and the pink lights in the house become a mix of dark blue green random colours that were found in the weirdhouse,2023-07-23 12:43:30
"i think the films point is that right now man and woman dont work together exactly remember we live in a world where our supreme court didnt have a woman justice for the first 193 years and one of the most popular figures in social media describes himself as absolutely a misogynist

its pretty offensive to see me mistreated in a fake world and maybe that could help us see how women are mistreated in our world",2023-07-23 14:14:18
barbie is a toy not a political statement,2023-07-23 22:04:36
wow i had a way different experience with the ferrera monologue part someone did a loud and short “woo” after it and like a quarter of the theatre goers literally clapped not for long tho like 3 claps average it was all good vibes,2023-07-26 00:52:18
agree i walked away from this movie actually feeling depressed more than anything,2023-07-27 20:01:32
it was one of those movies where it was too fun and deep in satire that it was hard to be mad at the fact the plot didnt really dig deeper where it needed to plus will ferrell and the executives felt completely unused lol,2023-07-27 20:37:53
yes pretty much what i thought it was fun and thats enough but something was lacking for me,2023-07-27 21:39:06
see i didn’t find it to be an in your face feminist message i found it to be a rather dry existentialist narrative wrapped in a feminist message if it had strictly stuck with the feminism angle i’d have been all about that but it bounces back and forth between that and “who am i and what is my place in this world”,2023-07-27 22:08:19
"i 31m watched it last night and had fun i heard that the movie was mean to men and i dont really see it

i cant say for sure that  like it but if he gets triggered by it then maybe hes not the type of person who needs to get a second date you know",2023-07-26 18:55:03
the movie makes fun of men in a lighthearted way but it’s message isn’t misandrist at all it’s a movie that highlights women’s experiences and is ultimately not for men but i think a level headed man would enjoy it,2023-07-26 23:20:21
i watched it with my wife and i loved it its honestly a good test of your boyfriend lol,2023-07-26 18:54:14
my bf went into the movie with me expecting it to be a 6510 afterwards i asked him what he thought of the movie he gave it a 910 and said it was hilarious and really solid,2023-07-27 02:26:25
as a man i personally dont think its misandrist the overall message which i dont want to spoil goes both ways for barbie  ken if anything its shows that men and women arent all that different from each other with genuinely funny bits of satire,2023-07-26 19:53:04
"ve seen a lot of reviews saying that it was “misandrist” which i find hard to believe but would this film trigger the average level headed man i want to see it regardless but i don’t want our first movie date to be a film that  end up disliking or getting triggered by i have a feeling i’ll enjoy it though

its not misandrist but misunderstood that way  


tell him to separate his brain from real life and what is in the movies real world  


the movies barbieland can be seen misandrist but the real world in the movie is extreme opposite of barbieland its suppose to be that way you need the glaring gender role swap to get the exaggeration of gender roles   


if you mention that first he wont feel hurt how dumb the kens are  


the kens actually learn about selflove when i finished the movie i talked it out about at first what i felt was misandrist but realized something very simple its movieland with movieland rules so separate that connection and enjoy the movie",2023-07-26 22:06:53
"  i want to see it regardless but i don’t want our first movie date to be a film that  end up disliking or getting triggered by 

it may trigger some gender dynamics discussions and you and your bf could be on opposite sides

youll notice in here that there are different interpretations on what happened and that there are some people that just cant see it from the other sides point of view",2023-07-27 02:45:30
red flag if he or any man gets and stays triggered after watching this movie,2023-07-26 18:55:15
seems like a great opportunity for a litmus test of how he sees women and femininity on a core level,2023-07-27 05:00:06
as a man who just saw it i bloody loved it if hes offended by being introduced to a few ideas about basic equality in a film about living dolls id say thats a red flag right there,2023-07-26 20:50:51
my husband would’ve hated this movie but i also walked out of it while laughing and having a good time not liking the movie itself,2023-07-27 07:57:58
yes it’s misandrist all the men in it are portrayed as idiots or idiots doing something bad that’s supposedly satire but the reality is the stark difference in portrayal of intelligence and morality between the male and female characters is obvious to any man not already into lbarbie feminism or greta gerwig movies,2023-07-26 18:55:00
i was of the opposite opinion on the real world thing really there are so many films based on properties sonic comes to mind where they show the imagined world for 20 minutes at the start and then disappear into our world for the rest of the film and its always super frustrating i already live here show me something else,2023-07-28 09:41:25
i don’t get why she wanted to be human so bad to me that plot wasn’t well developed so her choice kinda came out of nowhere i mean didn’t she hate the real world and she’s not even going back there to make it better or anything just to get a ,2023-08-01 05:49:22
i think that alan was supposed to be the nice guy who is not sexually appealing  he’s the guy whom young girls like to confide in but don’t want for romance or  closeness  he had a more insight than the kens and he had closet power he could take on the jocks  alan has potential and needs somebody to teach him how to be a man — that is he needs his own ruth handler  if alan decided to enter the real world he could grow into an actualized person,2023-09-17 11:01:09
"i just finished the movie and i agree with the backpedaling and overstepping it was hard for me to latch onto some of the moral messages and felt like i was swinging vine to vine instead of being taken on a smooth ride

this movie is about barbie finding herself and realizing its okay to grow out of things no wait its about a girl growing out of her barbie phase and the importance of imagination and hope no wait were back to the allegory of barbie not putting herself in a box no wait its about a grown woman not giving up on her childhood joys no wait the grown woman is voicing the hypocrisy of appealing to mens egos no wait were back to barbie realizing she doesnt need permission to be a person and have flaws

like the movie is about all of those things and theyre great messages in retrospect all of the themes connect but in the moment while watching it i felt like i was getting whiplash from what the narrative was considering to be its main focus

the manipulation tactic was such an odd thing to flex too i can get behind patriarchy bad but you can make them dance like puppets by playing to their egos because theyre  is just such a weird message to be celebrated to me normally you want your heroes to triumph with some moral high ground but manipulation is kind of underhanded so the victory doesnt feel very rewarding

i think i liked it overall more for the messages it tried to get across but i wanted to love the movie itself",2023-09-15 23:10:07
the real world was also campy so that threw me for a loop heh,2023-07-22 18:07:42
 that i wish the old imdb came back,2023-07-22 23:44:22
i decided to tidy my room then realised i didnt really have a room,2023-07-23 09:20:34
i liked it as a grandma who played lots of barbies  at times i thought it was slow and somewhat innocuous but overall i enjoyed it,2023-07-31 20:54:16
it was pretty nonsensical and a bit all over the place,2023-08-02 03:01:54
"i think a lot of your critiques were purposefully used in the movie as commentary  i won’t address all of them but for instance the treatment of the male characters as tropes or one dimensional characters was part of the commentary—in barbieland the men are treated like women in the real world in the barbie movie men are treated like women are treated in movies made by and for men read onedimensional supporting characters that further the male leads

you are supposed to feel sympathy for the plight of the kens and you are supposed to connect that to the plight of women in the real world  margot talks to ken at the end about figuring out who he is independent of barbie—that’s a nod to women who have had to fight to find a place for themselves in a world that historically has centered men  making barbieland a happy go lucky egalitarian society at the end would do injustice to the commentary because barbieland is supposed to be a mirror image of the real world not a utopian society",2023-07-25 18:17:46
if thats what youre taking away from this movie then i highly recommend some self reflection,2023-07-21 07:57:42
"oh no a movie criticizing men

anyways 

coming from a man",2023-07-21 12:14:39
if your take away is that this movie is antimen i feel sorry for you ken,2023-07-21 10:29:04
youre denser than the uranium core depicted in oppenheimer  if you view this film as antimen do you acknowledge the real world as antiwomen,2023-07-21 04:34:53
"if its good yes barbie has smart writing and isn’t doing it in a mean spirited way barbie’s are silly ken’s are silly they are toys in essence 

the problem is that men have always been in charge of society with few exceptions so making a movie about men being in charge just doesn’t seem like a good narrative starting point 

chaos walking with tom holland and daisy ridley is sorta that but not really",2023-07-21 07:32:11
what would you want out of this movie,2023-07-21 04:47:20
"watched doug from nostalgia critic review this movie and what he said about it i definitely agree they let the commentary lead the characters and not the characters leading the commentary

as a woman of color i’m already beaten over the head with certain messages so i don’t particularly enjoy that in a film about a doll like it came off very much in the perspective of a white woman’s brand of opinions",2023-07-23 13:22:02
no youre spot on im wondering why everyone is so in love with this movie i was stunned at how bad the movie was who wouldve guessed that greta gerwig  noah baumbach would give us this feels like the emperors new clothes in real life,2023-07-23 13:12:30
" “this may be one of the stupidest things i have seen this year in cinema”

this was the exact same thought i had throughout the movie",2023-07-23 16:21:03
"hurting someone to further your own gains is not right

oddly enough barbie and oppenheimer overlapped thematically way more than i could have ever fathomed",2023-07-23 03:02:06
"idunno i mean barbieland being a pink reflection of our real world it makes sense to end with the dominant  congratulating themselves for being so benevolent to the lesser  its similar to the ceo character patting himself on the back saying their company is built on women 

the big relevatory moment america ferreras character has isnt transformational its like treading water at best thats what is so bleak about the movie imo you have this great epiphany and at best it just helps you cope with the way the world is

so the kens in barbieland will eventually have to have their own version of that i guess or not but it really felt like the movie was saying there isnt an actual way to solve it it literally makes you feel hopeless and helpless 

if the movie ended with a pat true equality ending it would feel too preachy and saccharine imo the message isnt we can create an equitable society its its possible to survive in this unjust society kind of a downer lol",2023-07-23 03:28:06
"but the kens straight up brainwashed and took over the land with almost no remorse after it was the barbies that made the land were supposed to feel bad because the kens who made nobel prize winners and the president maids and completely subservient were manipulated at the end

performing a coup is slightly worse than not paying attention to a man and letting him come to conclusions imo",2023-07-23 03:28:48
glad i wasn’t the only one i fell asleep in the middle of the movie hahaha and my friends were super disappointed with how hyped the movie was,2023-07-25 14:35:43
im brazilian and find me disappointed too ken just wanted some attention and he never get it not even in the end and that thing about choosing to be human oh that was a terrible ending,2023-07-25 16:39:59
" there a little less tolerating to all that over here in asia

as someone who is asian this is  hilarious propaganda is literally everywhere and more overt in asia than it is in europe or america",2023-07-26 01:32:31
in what ways did the movie put down men if anything i thought the movie was really empathetic to teenage boys and young adult men who struggle with their masculinity and fall into altrightincel pipelines i thought there was a good message for men to take home from the movie,2023-07-25 19:47:33
i took it as the barbies and kens being dolls could only see life as one extreme or the other they were locked into one play mode at a time when beach ken came in and said “no actually i wanna play this other way” they followed along because they’re still just dolls and he was the only one with independent thought when america ferrera laid down the facts on how life can actually be many things simultaneously and they as dollladies could have multiple streams of thought at once it just made them think independently like margot barbie once they were able to do that they decided to go back to the way they played before,2023-07-27 01:44:44
men made their own situation this culture was made by men they set their own standards the movie was kinda about that,2023-07-27 02:15:45
i had the same thought too much exposition and this whole idea of “they make us feel this way” who is they while some people may think some of those things there are plenty of people who don’t or think the opposite i dunno that part felt victimy and a huge sweeping generalization instead of focusing on the characters’ experiences not saying those issues don’t exist i just don’t think it’s this big sweeping paintbrush of every person belonging to x group perpetrates all of those ideas and opinions,2023-07-26 23:18:40
it’s like you didn’t even watch the movie,2023-07-21 10:42:33
youve posted twice about this and i was just curious if you could elaborate a little bit further for us lonely guys cheers,2023-07-23 06:58:00
"…i don’t get what’s not clear 

the kens were told they could reach what the women of the real world have barbie land basically became the power structure of the real world just gender swapped they could occupy some places of power but the barbies would hold the reigns",2023-07-23 09:50:38
seems equality is reached boy thats not it,2023-07-23 09:37:26
i think this is sarcasm but im not sure bravo,2023-07-25 01:22:30
honestly the intro kinda bummed me felt very surreal i didnt know much about the movie and i knew its not going to be an ari aster horror film but it had those weird undertones like midsommar,2023-07-25 11:31:57
in terms of quality it wasn’t a 1010 movie  the plot wasn’t great though it is hard to tell a story about a toy like barbie i get what worked was the style vibes actors visuals except for the la scenes and humor although it was flat at times what was that joke about zack snyders justice league  though i did feel the screenwriting was weak  it had a lot going for it  there was a good heart to the story it just didn’t get executed as well as it could have,2023-07-25 04:23:47
imagine how being a woman feels — i’m sorry you were bummed,2023-07-25 04:26:24
"or are we just willfully ignoring that so that you have an excuse to hate on the movie

this discussion should be a place for people to express an opinion without fear of being attacking downvoted or insulted for it some people enjoyed the movie some didnt enjoy the movie some loved it some hated it thats life you need to grow up a little and understand the world has people who have a different opinion from yours their opinion is valid yours is too nobody is trying to silence you and you should not attempt to silence others",2023-07-25 05:46:49
yeah and some people don’t like the lack of nuance hence they don’t like the movie not everyone’s going to like it it’s not an “excuse” to hate it i’d say it’s a pretty valid reason,2023-07-25 20:21:06
right ,2023-07-25 04:25:03
i think ken is sorta meant to be a female character it becomes obvious that kens are treated badly in barbie world because they are men but thats how women are treated in the real world,2023-07-26 21:32:45
what does mini skirts and heels have to do with anything,2023-07-27 00:07:22
no it’s not weird if you realise that feminist discourse which this movie is based in is absolutely obsessed with men and analysing their behaviour but actually has relatively little to say about women and never analyses feminist women’s faults so as it’s drawing a lot from “academic” feminism it has to focus on men as that’s the main subject matter feminism doesn’t do a deep dive into feminist women’s characters the way it does men that’s why ken has this huge arc and america ferrara just kinda makes a speech about how the world sucks for her and nor her or barbie have a lot of character compared to ken,2023-07-26 19:04:30
its a film its fascinating that its affecting ppl especially men so much like just chill its not meant for everyone ,2023-07-26 17:26:23
" america ferrara’s monologue about women again made it sound like a thing that was purposefully done to them by men…when many of the things she talks about effect both sexes one ways and then women have some issues men don’t men have other issues women don’t…or experience the same issues in different wayslike showing emotions


oh wow no way the patriarchy which was created by men affect women badly oh wow men oppress women 

like are you  serious you missed the whole point",2023-07-27 22:49:29
"wow bro so toxic

  
but yes all of your critiques are fair and to be honest i did not find it that funny either",2023-07-27 21:04:42
you can make a movie that is prowomen without it being antimen but if you have to make your movie antimen to be prowomen youve gone too far at that point its just selfserving chauvinism and prejudice,2023-07-21 03:47:05
its undoubtedly a misandrist movie,2023-07-21 03:14:02
i’m glad someone else saw the same movie i did not clear on what the messaging was or the point of it so is it ok to repress people if it’s the kens or should we all be able to be who we want even though the barbies were all predestined to be a doctor if they were designed to be a doctor it was kind of like ‘just keep the status que’ was the messaging this didn’t work for me,2023-07-21 05:22:03
i did feel weird rooting for the barbies intentionally manipulating the kens on the beach,2023-07-21 03:03:55
" it’s so pro women that some men might see it as “anti men”

armond white already has called it that",2023-07-21 02:21:11
"meh

i think the joke at the end is that even though todays society has never been better in terms of equality we still havent had a woman president and theres still things to go before you can say men and women are truly equal 

of course the movie is pro feminism and women but i think the ending where barbie apologizes to ken goes a long way to show that neither side is or were right and that neither utopia is right",2023-07-21 02:32:43
they think an insufficiently  mm is anti men,2023-07-21 02:30:29
" it’s so pro women that some men might see it as “anti men”

like those seething youtube critics especially the ones that love to make multiple hour long review videos",2023-07-21 02:24:06
i got up and left after emerica ferrera’s speech i’d just had enough by that point and yeah people can try to pretend like this isn’t antimen but when you have a film that treats every single man as an idiot or a creep how else am i supposed to interpret that if the roles were reversed you know more people would be up in arms but since it’s all happening to men that makes it ok get the  outta here,2023-07-24 19:52:56
by the end of the movie the dream houses begin to take on elements mixing ken and barbie aesthetics together instead of one dominating the other thats the opposite of them being separated its a slow gradual process but theyre beginning the journey to becoming more nuanced and individualistic like the real world,2023-07-22 10:26:05
ehm if you watched the first seconds of the trailer you should have gotten it and the director is greta gerwig who is known to be a femministit was clear she would make an intelligent take on barbie and not some kind of weird live action barbie movie ,2023-07-27 21:40:53
it’s a pg13 movie directed by greta gerwig and the trailer is pretty clear about the tone of the movie that was your heads up barbie fairytopia is free on youtube,2023-07-28 01:42:00
"i thought the sexism message was fine but it became too much at times it’s a caricature of sexism i guess at times very artsy but i definitely wanted a fun barbie experience instead i got barbie crying and her going to the gynecologist 

the little mermaid remake i think did great in terms of the fun nostalgia i was expecting",2023-07-27 19:04:02
unfortunately for you someone with a point of view and opinions on the world made this movie why go to a movie if you just want to turn your brain off  get in your car and put the aqua song on if thats all you want,2023-07-27 17:16:43
you should hit the gym,2023-07-29 07:10:39
yeah my girlfriend said similar she thought it would be more nostalgic and bring barbie land to life in a fun way but the characters weren’t really barbie or ken i think she was expecting a flinstones live action type movie that was pretty true to what barbie had always been with some wacky adventure she really hated barbie becoming human would have been awkward for me if she’d loved the movie,2023-07-27 18:56:18
there was one ken that was a bit stocky that never took his shirt off,2023-07-22 00:44:20
my friend said this i suggested that in the ‘real world’ women can’t be anything but skinny and in ‘barbieland’ everything is in reverse therefore meaning men can only conform to one body type,2023-07-22 00:47:26
morbidly obese is a bit of an exaggeration but i agree it was odd there wasnt more varying body types for the kens,2023-07-22 00:32:29
bro you and your girlfriend missed the message of the movie if you don’t even know why people were crying,2023-07-21 23:56:03
wow your girlfriend is not like the other girls she is so different and quirky yay,2023-07-22 00:08:16
"which is funny because this movie defended both sides the girls could be whatever they wanted yet they were dickmatized by the kens the kens tried to run the world but failed because they where overthrown because they spent time fighting after the girls distracted them

there’s literally a men’s rights song",2023-07-22 23:48:49
i wish we could all just get along really i do i seems like theres so much hate towards anyone whos in a different group than us and its dividing us more and more every day,2023-07-22 23:42:47
im so glad it wasnt just me  i had the same expectation re lego movie like its barbie im here for escapism and a good time and hopefully have heartstrings tugged and a good message what i got under all the beautiful visuals and some fun jokes was being bludgeoned with feminist buzzwords and weird unnatural dialogue spot on about the tweets it just felt so heavy handed and im someone who is very aggressive about equity and this just wasnt the way to go about those themes,2023-07-23 05:16:34
so youre saying the teenager was an accurate depiction,2023-07-23 03:49:25
right i watched oppenheimer first and was absolutely mind blown and then halfway through barbie i wanted to leave honestly i cant really derive much value from the barbie movie and i have friends defending it left and right literally have no idea what i missed,2023-07-23 06:54:00
100 agree with you oppenheimer was way better,2023-07-23 06:56:45
i wont compare the two movies together because it still is a barbie movie were talking about but me and my friends also thought it was weird that they had all these feminist speeches instead of just showing what they were talking about especially the section withwe have to be thin but cant wish to be thin  yeah true but we also read that exact quote on tumblr in 2012 no one in the cinema was clueless about that issue,2023-07-23 07:28:13
it’s a lot more than that it’s saying the entire way the current society is structured is wrong,2023-07-23 07:22:18
wait was this said in the movie i didnt hear it,2023-07-23 10:59:08
wait what when how,2023-07-23 07:13:09
kingsley benadir as the very timid twinkish type who is not so secretly in love with stereotypical ken was fantastic,2023-07-22 11:05:36
"barbie doesn’t and never has had any impact on women’s rights no matter what bs mattel may be pushing 
was it really impossible to deal with gender in a barbie movie other than having a war of the sexes and men vs women storyline what does men vs women have to do with barbie really 

most of the conversation about barbie has always been about her looks and girls ideas about their bodies they totally glossed over that to do a deep dive into tik tok style radical feminism no doubt mattel was more than glad to gloss over the barbie and body image debate in favour of dunking on men as that will work better with the young generation of women on social media and not reflect poorly on their own past",2023-07-25 11:53:09
yuup immediately thought of spectacle as well,2023-07-26 10:54:50
"yo this is wild whilst i watched it last night i thought lol
wonder what debord would think of this",2023-07-26 08:45:49
to me gosling was fantastic it’s just that 90 of his scenes got spoiled in trailers and promo i felt like i already watched the entire first 10 ish minutes of the film like they generously left us the matchbook 20 serenade scene but i know watching trailers and promo is a choice if his scenes would have been kept underwraps it would have gotten people to the theater by word of mouth but they couldn’t resist using him in the promo,2023-07-21 22:54:17
"did you just compare this movie to pinocchio and truman show i mean i can kinda see where youre coming from comparing it with truman show which was still way more emotionally engaging for me at least but pinocchio just because they share one common trait that being a puppet coming to life which has been covered in several other movies does not mean they somehow feel the same thats like saying planet of the apes feels similar to godzilla x kong

pinocchio especially the gdt version is a essentially a drama with humour sprinkled here and there and a deeper meaning while barbie is in my eyes as shallow and lifeless as the actual barbie doll if you enjoyed it thats cool 

but doing a disservice to actual masterpieces like pinocchio which made both my male and female friendsrelatives cry without alienating the other gender by pretending barbie is on the same level is both cringe and baffling to me personally but you do you",2023-07-21 21:18:51
literally politics,2023-07-21 22:29:38
"i’ve never seen people more upset at others for not liking a film it was a lazy boring movie am i allowed to have that opinion

it’s cool if you like it but the fact that you think anyone who doesn’t agree with you has a “garbage take” says a lot",2023-07-25 03:30:31
using your analogy its a two hour party thats amusing for little spurts but after like 15 minutes i want nothing more than to leave,2023-08-06 17:01:38
there truly could not have been a more core theme or message ,2023-07-22 13:38:09
i thing the film showed how easily both female and male can be manipulated same as ken came to barbieland and made patriarchy and when barbies started to put ken against each other,2023-07-24 07:00:12
i heard that the genders are supposed to be swapped so barbie manipulating ken and ken being fun is a commentary on men manipulating women and…women being more fun i dont know what the movie even tried to do,2023-07-24 08:48:07
"the barbies literally are worshipping the kens listening to their every word wanting to do whatever ken wants having the same song played at them for 45 hours and then they get up and talk to a different ken just that 10 seconds of not paying nonstop attention to ken resulted in the ken war of 2023 this was not seduction this was talking to male friend that is all they did the kens then wagged war because how dare barbie talk to another ken that isnt them 

sad disgusting and frankly terrifying that so many men are here saying barbie seduced and manipulated ken",2023-07-24 09:14:15
big red pill vibes here,2023-07-24 13:31:05
while that is toxic and not something they should be teaching to young women or whatever the movie poked fun at extremes on both sides you could say the same thing for the men “do you really what to teach young men to be toxic and treat women as objects”  they were just juxtaposing the two extremes where the women did what the men did to them no one said the movie was for “young girls” it was rated pg13 i don’t think we have to paint this movie in the light of being a politically agenda movie it was a dumb satirical film that poked fun of gender and gender roles in society,2023-07-24 15:48:02
people dress up at comic cons for star warsmarveldc etc is that all particularly cringe too given that theyre doing so to replicate their corporately owned favourite characters,2023-07-28 09:43:46
watching the simpsons episode based on it doing it 30 years ago and better is a little surprising,2023-07-29 06:32:50
" and at first i thought “well ok maybe it’s just not for me” 

 its not ",2023-07-28 06:25:48
"i think that is the whole point it is messy society tells men it is okay to open up and be emotional but when they do they get ridiculed for it when they dont they get scolded for being closed off society tells women it is okay to be tough and strict at work when they do theyre too mean when they decide to not do that and be more of a homemaker theyre not feminist 

in the end we all have to decide for ourselves who we want to be society will never be happy",2023-08-08 22:42:09
i think that may have been the point or overall message to show how swaying one way completely is unbalanced how feeling amused about the boys is almost as bad as boys not taking women seriously i think its deeper than being a mockery its one step further if you take the next step to see how your perception may be unfair whether its patriarchy or feminism if that includes mocking and devaluing the other gender,2023-08-07 12:20:51
hence why it’s pg 13,2023-07-23 15:00:00
"my woman 
the chick

totally shocked you didnt enjoy this movie and found the themes confusing",2023-08-02 00:31:08
are men actually portrayed badly in the barbie movie i didn’t really get that how were they portrayed badly is it because the kens in the barbie world weren’t that important because i thought that was because ken isn’t really that important as a doll as a doll he is more of an accessory to barbie this is why girls will have about 15 barbie dolls and only 1 ken doll,2023-08-06 01:05:08
"i dont think this movie is harmful towards men but i really hate this lazy halfassed argument its just whataboutism

its not even the same industry and you talk like every men in the world watches  everyday and no woman has ever benefited from making  at the same time both subjects are completely unrelated

i hate whiny men but the solution isnt more whining",2023-08-05 02:25:00
"after we handle the way women are treated in  movies then i’m more than happy to look at how men are treated in the barbie movie

this is a horrible mindset okay so after we handle the way men have been portrayed in  romance novels written by women for centuries then i’m more than happy to look at how women are portrayed in  movies

actually wait first we have to handle the way women are portrayed in slasher movies then we can address the men in romance novels and then women in  and then men in barbie

oops i forgot about the way that old people are portrayed in comedies okay let’s figure that out first then it’ll be women in slashers followed by men in  novels then we’ll take care of women in  and finally men in barbie

or we can just address everything and anything that needs addressing at once",2023-08-05 12:46:36
"why is the the first thing i see when checking what reddit thinks about the movie 

whatever you’re talking about probably wasn’t ever going to be on my mind and now i have to watch it wondering why you even made this silly comment",2023-08-05 00:29:23
"  
  
why don’t you look at the way women are treated in the  you watch every day  
  
 

a lot of women feel empowered by  as well and choose to be  workers  so",2023-08-05 02:55:59
idk what drugs are you on but those women that star on port sites are fully committed into it and as you say it its their choice look at mia khalifa for example why is she still going by her stage name and not her real name huh,2023-08-04 23:56:53
did we watch the same movie,2023-08-12 17:50:45
agreed how did america ferrera characters speech unbrainwash barbies  they never went through or felt those things in barbieland i understand that it is a movie and it has to go to the extremes on either end to make a point but my gawd it went from a fun movie to shoving an agenda down my throat making me cringe,2023-08-14 13:07:14
a movie based on women toys had quotes to empower women no ,2023-08-12 22:48:26
it would’ve been better as a ted talk tbh it’s not that they’re wrong it’s just not fun,2023-09-16 12:28:32
did you leave before the movie ended,2023-08-12 20:00:21
so glad i went into it completely blind trailers just reveal way too much nowadays,2023-07-25 04:21:37
i think the point is that the men aren’t supposed to be interjecting in that moment the ending switches from strictly relating to barbieland to being a challenge to the real world it’s not barbies vs kens but women vs society if ken interjects on this he is once again taking away from the struggles women are facing be an alan he wasn’t speechless he just knew that it wasn’t his place to speak up and instead listened,2023-09-02 03:57:16
"it was basically a virus that none of them had any immunity to

ken brought it back with him but all the kens were mentally affected too both the barbies and kens were moreorless just acting like they thought they were expected to act in a patriarchy and they only ever had a surfacelevel understanding of what that would even mean

i assume ken just explained to everyone this is how it works in the real world and everything was great there and it sounded like it made sense so they all just started rolling with it",2023-07-26 02:07:53
i think he managed to join hustlers university while he was in the real world i think this is an example of the most capable women still occasionally falling to tate inspired dogma coming from a guy  tate managed to hit seemingly every teenage boy before i knew he existed he could spread through kenland in a day or two,2023-07-26 01:13:01
they seemed anxious and miserable when not in the gaze of a barbie,2023-07-28 16:10:52
grass is always greener etc,2023-07-28 09:39:14
grass is always greener and we always want what we dont have,2023-07-28 10:58:59
it is also really fun and also pretty funny at times there is a ken sequence near the end of this movie which is one of the cleverest and hilarious things i’ve seen in mainstream media,2023-08-20 21:36:31
i keep saying this it’s life imitating art,2023-07-22 22:16:51
too many storylines what storylines did you feel were superfluous,2023-07-24 06:33:09
well a lot of what youve read probably was written by chatgpt cant trust  anymore lol,2023-07-25 04:29:24
everyone in the cinema i went to was laughing hard the whole way through all of my friend really loved it,2023-07-25 04:40:47
solid 10 for me tbh best movie ive seen this year,2023-07-25 04:26:00
"mid 30s dude here and this movie did a fair bit of stuff that im still thinking about days later personally i really liked it in a way i dont feel like ive gotten hit with in a little while

when i saw it friday afternoon my theater broke out in applause at the credits i could see some of the stuff in the movie really resonating hard with some people",2023-07-25 04:44:13
i dont think barbie was suicidal she was just contemplating the concept of death for the first time more midlife crisis type thing,2023-07-27 04:42:28
think the problem with the film was how it completely discredited its own message by acting like 90 of the stuff in americas speech couldnt also apply to men and dismantling a patriarchy to reinstate a matriarchy its satire at best and an attempt to send a serious message at worst,2023-07-27 05:55:05
i don’t really care what political talk people have or problems with it at all but as a 20s year old girl i didn’ that great of a movie the plot was just all over the place but nothing compelling to keep me hooked the development wasn’t there some jokes were perfect like the note don’t cast margot robbie in this scene which is such great self awareness humor but it was a forgettable movie in general other female based heavy movies like mean girls for example was a masterpiece but not as successful or credited as barbie with by far better performances that stand the test of time this isn’t gonna age well,2023-08-07 08:27:00
i agree fun was attempted in the dance scenes but overall it was lacking,2023-08-14 04:20:24
i just got out of the theater too and you summarize very well my exact thoughts super disappointing,2023-08-13 17:20:28
well written did anyone understand the mother characters speech at the end about the expectations laid on women where are these expectations from we never see her character battling anything were just told she went through some trouble in the past i just didnt get it,2023-08-13 21:21:24
i havent watched it yet but all this buzz is getting me curious,2023-07-22 03:31:44
i disagree with the giant commercial part i didn’t once feel that way it was just mattel poking fun at itself,2023-07-22 03:18:01
i couldn’t disagree with your negatives more it never once felt like a commercial in fact it’s constantly making fun of the material it’s adapting and it never once pokes fun at men it does however constantly poke fun at men who engage with toxic masculinity it claims that men don’t need to engage with toxic behavior to prove themselves to women or other men that they’re already enough just the way they are it has a phenomenal message for men and isn’t hating on them at all,2023-07-22 04:08:05
same i feel like i watched a different movie than everyone else here sometimes that happens with me and comedies though maybe a rewatch later but for now i’m with you an exhausting mess of a movie,2023-07-22 12:22:51
"well what the kens had no problem doing to the barbies during their kendom was reprehensible

but i also didnt like the stereotypical manipulation of the kens by the barbies  very cynical classic manipulation that shouldnt be encouraged but also held out as the only way to defeat kendom aka patriarchy  its ultimately reprehensible that both sides would resort to that behavior

ps  overall however i enjoyed the movie and it made a lot of good points",2023-07-23 20:35:31
this scene made me uncomfortable honestly yes i empathize with being on a date where a man plays an instrument and it makes you uncomfortable but it just felt like such a terrible attack on men being vulnerable and that feels like it feeds into toxic masculinity unnecessarily,2023-07-23 21:47:14
"i think its cool that the movie was good enough to talk about and critique 

if you put enough people in front of the screen they will return with a wide range of opinions i may not agree with some of them but its enlightening to see the movie from their point of view",2023-07-26 14:34:43
"barbie movie of all movies for being too overtly feminist realistically even if the movies themes were more subtle you probably still would have taken issue at a womans issues being in the spotlight

i think what personally got to me was that i was excited about the feminism aspect but it fell short the speeches were just awfully scripted the message was cloudy too it felt jarringly like a 2013 tumblr post almost like a parody of itself like the speech would have been groundbreaking two decades ago but today it felt weirdly commercial 

very much tell not show with all the speeches they couldnt devote time to representing what she was saying in the movie no time given to developing the deteriorating motherdaughter relationship that was shown to be the cause of the entire plot no time to show her struggling with her job and being a mother or the restricive body standards finacial inequality balancing being emotional and direct all of these were stated in the speech and ignored the rest of the movie but they had time for a whole unnecessary plotline with goofy mattel men and a 10 minute ken musical number 

instead misogyny was shown as girls should wear booby clothes and serve men beer as if thats even slightly the what the patriarchy is they couldve had the women be encouraged to wear that but then be slutshamed for giving in they couldve had women want to be a server and be ashamed of it 

the solution was presented as women just need to realize whats wrong and believe in themselves and everythings solved misogyny eradicated yippee it all felt so hollow  it feels like they solved their cheap version of inequality and we should be grateful for it because at least the real world isnt as bad  but its worse way more pervasive and subtle and soul crushing 

i feel so sad that i feel this way because i am so easy to please when it comes to movies especially cinema blockbusters i just wanted to like it",2023-07-26 15:49:11
"this is the first movie ive watched of greta and i must say im impressed the film is a visual delight and marvelous to look at also while the plot was not the most cohesive it still kinda made sense

and yes kate mckinnon stole every scene she was in",2023-07-27 22:26:31
at the end of the day they wanted it to be profitable thats how it felt to me if they had a new take to share that would probably be less monetizable which i get it just comes across as more of a money maker than an empowering movie for me personally,2023-08-02 19:09:48
"glad to see someone else point out ken not having to apologise to barbie many dont seem to agree

" my problem is that the movie wasnt feminist enough

insofar as feminism means equality for all i agree with you what was with the barbies intentionally keeping all kens out of power at the end thats not equality at all",2023-07-23 01:50:26
" the barbiearchy is either a good thing or a inevitable thing that you cant really change

i dont think thats the message

the whole movie is about how onegender rule either reallife or barbieland and doesnt end well no matter which gender is in charge 

i mean if the us suddenly became a matriarchy by an act of magic  everyone still would have to deal with elizabeth holmes amy coney barrett mtg and bobert",2023-07-23 01:52:55
"the movie shows that the government that the barbies have at the end of the movie changed little from the beginning  but they did say that the men like the women in reality have to build towards equality  

to create a fairy tale ending where both men and women in barbieworld are equal just from one conflict feels patronizing to me when i know thats not how reality works nor do i think the director wants the fairy tale ending either  like america ferrera teaching the barbies how to dismantle the patriarchy this movie and the ending serves to provide discourse and make people question the status quo",2023-07-23 01:53:57
i couldnt agree more the feminism was almost insultingly shallow i felt trapped in a conversation where nobody knew what they were talking about but everybody felt like an expert and repeating it over and over and over doesnt make it any deeper,2023-07-23 02:38:40
"warner bro discovery own mattel thats the real ceo     
      
also my wife and i said the same thing after seeing this movie",2023-07-23 02:07:43

"how is this any different than patriarchy

it isnt thats the point

the barbie movies form of society in barbieland isnt an endorsement its satire",2023-07-24 13:38:56
"yeah i agree the desire to rip on men and have ken represent multiple things really hurt whatever the  point the movie was trying to make

i totally agree that gosling and liu’s kens are the best part of the movie it’s a shame that gerwig had to show all the barbies as clever and empowered because if they had of been able to be the butt of the joke more they would be more entertaining it’s absurd but it reduces the barbie character to the most boring character in her own movie when she should have been the most fun

it’s a wasted opportunity not to have the different barbies have radically different personalities instead of all being clever and empowered like if margot robbie’s barbie is kens equivalent why isn’t she a malibu  like ken they missed an opportunity to make the barbies funny instead of boring",2023-07-24 12:18:59
i agree with you but i think the point of the kens treatment in barbieland is that it’s supposed to be the reverse of how the “real world” is not saying i agree with that in 2023 but i guess there are times in history that could be considered accurate that’s why they joke at the end that the kens will gain rights eventually to be as “even” as men and women are in the real world now,2023-07-25 02:00:10
i felt like he addressed it towards the end when he tells barbie that hes confused on his existence because he knows he was created to be the love interested to barbie he didnt know how to handle who he was or his purpose with barbie not in love with him back unit she tells him he can a whole ken without her,2023-07-25 03:39:15
"there didn’t seem to be a place for ken’s in barbieland other than to be accessories

that’s the joke that’s the entire joke it’s a movie about a real life toy brand in which the ken dolls were just accessories to the barbies that’s why it’s funny the concept of a ken doll realizing that real men aren’t just accessories for women and getting really into horses and pool tables is funny

it is a comedy about a toy brand",2023-07-25 13:58:36
the point is… right there you’re so so so close to it,2023-07-25 05:14:24

" i didnt really want to hear the it preach to me about a topic that im very well aware of and have heard of a thousand times

this stood out to me too ive seen comments in this topic saying people dont like having their views challenged but i dont think this movie did challenge many views it was a movie that very much presented the same feminist worldview ive seen talked about and portrayed a million times in the past 15 years or so it didnt feel like it was doing anything daring or different apart from the fact it was about barbie obviously",2023-07-22 15:30:56
i think the thing a lot of people are missing is that despite us being preached to a thousand times about these thingsit still has yet to sink in so theyve got to keep harping on it cuz dear  so many people refuse to listen,2023-07-22 15:44:41

i agree that they missed the mark on upholding the equality side of feminism by making all the kens  however this is such an incel response that it sounds like you wrote it in satire this barbie was sentient so she did not want basic ken as a boyfriend the idea that barbie women should settle for less to elevate ken men would destroy the point of this movie you literally asked what the point of her having a  was if not to have  with a man i do wish they let ken surf a wave in the real world,2023-07-26 09:41:20

"barbie wasn’t intended to set beauty standards barbie was created because most of the toy market at the time was mother figures and babies barbie was made to help little girls and boys understand that you can be more in this life than a mom if you want to be a mom that’s fantastic there is a barbie that also caters to that audience 

society took barbie and sexualized her 

the daily by the new york times did a wonderful exposition on this",2023-07-25 18:57:25
i dont know if id go that far but it definitely felt like the script had some mattel ordered edits made to it theres zero plot related reason for the mattel ceo to be in barbieland in the final script there must have been something in an earlier version of the script justifying why they were there it wouldnt surprise me if originally the ceo was meant to be an andrew tatetype figure manipulating the kens into their revolution but mattel said no because they didnt want to be portrayed as too evil,2023-07-25 16:21:16
"the theme was about barbie and self discovery and ryans ken learned selflove or more so selfworth so he didnt have to chase margos barbie for attention thats why ken is me not barbie and ken the end where we waves goodbye with the sweater saying i am kenough

i feel like a lot of people who watch the movie try to connect it to real life when they should accept the rules in the movie and enjoy it that way the glaring opposites is meant to be like that for gender role swaps from barbieland to real world",2023-07-27 04:47:16
"just left the theatre and honestly didn’t love it i’m 100 a feminist and am a female in a male dominated academic field but i just found the movie to be too “woke” and almost trying too hard it wasn’t light hearted and fun like i had hoped definitely some funny moments but overall i just thought it was too much and the narrative was a bit extreme great screenplay though and super cool to see i just wish the theme was more about barbie and not about barbie is better than ken just my thoughts

i am a man in a male dominated field and i found kens arc to be absolutely beautiful he learned in the end that he needed to love himself and that he was more than the person he is in a relationship with",2023-07-27 09:00:17

at the end barbie becomes human  accepts all the mess that goes with it she chooses life  change instead of the dull repetitive prettiness of barbie land  she chooses emotion uncertainty insecurity aging death physical imperfection thats growth",2023-07-31 03:49:44
" the story line was  poor and made no real sense 

if youre framing it as another conventional movie youll enjoy it more if you frame it as an absurd surreal comedy i realized that quickly so none of the that doesnt make sense parts bothered me like it would in any other movie",2023-07-31 15:33:18
i really like your points you expected the movie to have depth and integrity and true meaning but it just kept falling short and everyone disagreeing only says that its best to view it in a much more shallow light but the messages are so strong and pure and the contrast between a movie about barbie dolls mixed with a deeper meaning wouldve been amazing its just too bad,2023-07-31 22:05:58
"i viewed this movie from a surrealist point of view all the barbies set that tone for me by playing their troupes like for example why is weird barbie weird well its because of how a kid plays too hard with her with that being said i then treated the story line like some kid just playing and even the moment where stereotypical barbie gets real and mentions death i recall that as a kid where you are playing with your friends and one of them just slips up and breaks the imaginary world with some real world stress 

regardless of what the true intentions of mattel had for this movie or their dolls what i picked up from the overall tone of this movie is mattel saying they see how they messed up but also how a doll cant take on such a massive task like representing women it was even stated by gloria about how impossible the standards are even for a doll that is just suppose to symbolize a woman to go further mattel tries to defend itself by explaining the history of dolls and how before the barbie dolls were meant to ease you into the roll of motherhood what barbie did is give a level of autonomy to these young girls was it perfect of course not but it was a huge leap from the baby dolls that were given to young girls to teach them how to be a mother to me it shows a more realistic portrayal of society changes which is not by leaps and bounds but by micro adjustments especially if youre not part of the group that makes those decisions more importantly we are the ones in charge not mattel in fairness it was also societies fault for imposing these standards companies like mattel can only succeed if their product sells look at all the more realistic barbies do you think they would actually be sold to children or whether children would really want them as a kid i want to fantasize about something amazing because i honestly felt like i was living a pretty bad reality mattel is at least honest and portrayed themselves as the villians and as imbeciles as well but they also portray themselves as the middle men they are the bridge between the film world and the barbie world you can totally view mattel as being disingenuous but we will have to wait and see i took the ending as saying that barbie will adapt with the real world throughout the whole movie mattel was portrayed as  power  and just wanting things to stay the same and i believe that what mattel is telling us here is that they recognize how  and out of date it is much like the baby dolls they are giving barbie to us but it also comes with some real consequences as well 

x200b

in the barbie world ken was the second class citizen it is a direct observation of how women are treated in the real world all the ownership and empowerment belong to the barbies and no one even thought of what the kens are going through since they were just meant to be a barbie companion i think for men this is a very direct message the moment that the kens felt empowered they were able to overthrow the barbies it wasnt because masculinity was toxic but the mere fact that any gender identifying itself based off that characteristic will oppress the other group  the absurdity of the film falls in line with how absurd gender roles are what i found interesting too was that the women knew how to gain power back which was by distracting the kens with each other while they swoop the government positions this feels like a direct warning of how men were able to no only get into power but stay even after all that stereotypical barbie understood that it wasnt right or at least she felt like something was off and she heard out ken for the first time and realized that he needs to be empowered as well but separate from her a funny scene that was definitely more of a message was when all the barbies are dividing the roles of government and they give the lesser roles to the kens while the kens were just happy to be part of it by any extent it really goes to show that they still intend to keep the power this is our society

perhaps we just saw it differently but i cant help but see this as a letter from mattel to us not just apologizing but also asking us to understand them because they thought they understood us but they were so off i see this in the relationship with barbie and the youth when sasha called her a fascist and just went off on barbie without knowing her it was just as bad as barbie trying to talk to her like she knew her this disconnect really spoke to me because we are just asking way too much for any toy to represent us but the role of a toy is important because it does help mold the vision of a child and who they want to be mattel may have done well by offering children the vision that they can be anything but they were dropping the ball by not addressing the hardships and challenges that they may face and i think that is a hard task to take on as well 

i genuinely enjoyed this movie from a writing standpoint i think this is absolutely solid they were playful yet deep with messages the fact that this had a surrealism tone helped me just focus on what they are trying to say with each scene and i honestly think they put a lot of thought and care into this film it felt my toys were apologizing to me for not telling me how hard life really is but its only because they didnt know how this is just how i took it all",2023-07-31 17:51:41
already all over this thread you have people saying the kens were portrayed the way they were because in the toy line kens didn’t have jobs and weren’t in charge etc  and it’s spin from the movie in reality when they made ken it was often with a “man” job to bring out a barbie with the “woman” job so there was president ken and first lady barbie pilot ken and flight attendant barbie and doctor ken and nurse barbie  all before there was president barbie doctor barbie or pilot barbie yet mattel is now pushing this line picked up on in social media that barbie was always fiercely feminist and ken was just there uh no mattel you had the exact same view of gender as 99 of the world back then that’s why you always made the barbie and kens when together with stereotypical “man” and “woman” jobs,2023-08-01 04:22:12
"i think the barbie movies is a good feminist movie but its not good feminism i dont think theres much that could have been done to make it fundamentally better its constrained by the limitations of the medium a hollywood movie

its great to see that message and representation on the screen but its not a substitute for actually engaging with the topic and nobody should be taking their philosophy from a hollywood blockbuster its the pink equivalent of those bros who model their lives after rick and morty",2023-07-31 17:35:19
"your critiques are valid its hard to disentangle a movie critiquing barbie from the fact that it could only exist because mattel gave it the goahead and mattels going to make a ton of money on it    


but given that limitation i do think gerwig pushed in a lot of valid criticism of mattel and that capitalist version of feminism something i think would have never been allowed 15 years ago or with a less prominent director and i think it was great to have a real interrogationcritique of the image of womanhood that barbie puts out there and which is a reflection of the images of womanhood societymedia generally puts out there  it could have been much edgier if it were made without mattels approval and using a satiricalnot authorized barbie type stand in    


but i think it was extremely powerful to have an interrogation of both the idea of barbie and the images of womanhood that media gives us within this context and i dont trust anyone else to do it as well as gerwig did  there were a few missteps but overall i think it pushed a lot of boundaries in great ways  

x200b

and maybe possibly mattel will flex as it always does to try to capture some new version of femaleness in its future products after seeing the massive response to this movie  im sure theyll go wherever the money goes  in this case even when the money went in the direction of repeatedly directly criticizing mattel  something they were willing to tolerate because they got paid off of it",2023-07-31 17:47:40
"i agree 100 you said it perfectly especially about mattel rebranding i see people defending that barbie’s on ebay are like minimum 100 as if that’s a good thing i also see people happy mattel is trying to make more movies when it’s all just for profit also mattel points out “hey we do things only for money and have mostly men in power” and that somehow makes it better instead of actually changing things they also completely ignore the point of body issues with barbie by the mom saying “well barbie helped me” and that someone just erases the complex stuff with barbie and young women’s body issues 

i agree it sucks everyone thinks 1 because i am a woman i had to have lived barbie 2 because i didn’t like barbie i am antifeminist 3 i must have bad taste and be a bad person 

like i feel like if you liked the movie liked the message thats fine the problem is people online and in person who are brainwashed and think any criticism of the movie or company is hate towards women it’s crazy because they successfully rebranded themselves as feminist company and if you go against them you’re against women the irony is many of these people online have post about anticapitalism but are eating it up when it’s barbie",2023-07-31 14:35:26

"the patriarchy line was overused and i think because of that people missed the point of the movie it was about discovering yourself and being true to your emotions the absurdity of barbie land was meant more for humor ken goes from being oppressed to an awakening in the real world and because the real world wasnt as easy for men as he thought it would be heads back to barbie land it poked fun at how things arent always easy for men as well

"i think kens arc is basically a representation of incels

1 he starts off insecure and unwanted like society doesnt care about him

2 he then comes to believe that a hypermasculine persona is going to make him happy and successful despite knowing its just a front

3 he then realizes that that forced idea of masculinity is hurting him and comes to accept that instead of trying to cling on to barbie or put on a macho facade he should just live for himself",2023-08-03 04:08:38
"i believe gerwig thought there was a positive message in it for men but when you portray all real world men and kens as halfwits compared to the women obviously it’s going to come off man hating whatever you think you’re saying even the main female character gloria is just casually disrespecting her  husband despite him not being shown to be sexist or anything

i dunno seems like this movie is a product of the whole “feminism is good for men to  according to feminist women” vibe which is highly patronising as well as a lot of casual man hating tropes",2023-08-02 08:10:30
" patriarchy

how else would you drive kens arc across him always having to say men ruling over women like in the real world would be a mouthful there exists a word for that just to be used like it was in the movie",2023-08-02 22:57:58
"to be fair all the dolls are goofy and a bit dimwitted  on both sides they are easily brainwashed except kens have a bit worse but that is the whole point of the kens

as a character ken is just an accessory to barbie so he doesnt have his own identity the arc of the character is for him to learn to forge his own identity in a healthy selfloving way which i think is a good positive message for the type of man he represents

i thought they did a great job at bringing the sexes together at the end at least to the point that it makes sense barbieland is intentionally meant to be an extreme caricature world of like if women controlled everything and men controlled nothing and the kens are the oppressed in that society it is like a mirror of the real world kens eventually decide they have enough of this dynamic and counterreact in an extreme way you can say like how people criticize the modern feminist so its this constant cycle of one side getting butthurt and overreacting

the kens dont get equal rights at the end the same way any oppressed group had to fight for years to get equal rights in the real world all the problems arent magically fixed by some momentary philosophical grandstanding",2023-08-06 00:44:18
im so glad im not the only one i just left the cinema and i was just so confused what the message was supposed to be i also dont understand why real humans even appeared at all they had no purpose honestly feels like the entire movie was just a build up for the gynecologist joke,2023-08-05 21:01:56
i do believe it will be worse for sexism than it is good because it’s written all the men as morons who need correcting and essentially the butt of all jokes  and because women are defending that and telling men they’re wrong to be offended by that i’m afraid the effect will be men thinking they shouldn’t bother to consider how they write women and just ignore when women say something is offensive since after all it doesn’t seem like women are bothered or care if men are offended,2023-08-06 14:57:13
man i agree on the beach part it kind of showed that the only way the barbies could win was by manipulation and deceit and by hurting every kens feelings which was weird because the kens actually didnt harm or hurt anyone to begin with,2023-08-05 20:41:03
he already knew it was okay to cry and be vulnerable  he was practically screaming from the start for barbie to allow him to be vulnerable with her only reason he and other kens found comfort in the macho masculine  was because he had nothing besides being a  to whatever the barbies wanted,2023-07-21 23:12:41
he does have a bit where he can cry though it’s literally a line in it,2023-07-21 23:53:15

did you

did you miss the part where barbie and ken comment on the way that theyre perceiving how everyone is looking at them on venice beach

maybe remember that there doesnt need to be a moral message both the barbies and the kens can be flawed narratives are written from the point of view of flawed complicated or contradictory characters all the time anyway part of the joke is that ken dolls were always superfluous to the play world that most little girls create with barbie dolls the conceit of the movie was to take that play world very literally with waterless baths outofscale furnishings twodimensional food in the fridge etc and then the movie to some degree examined how these undeveloped superfluous uninteresting kens would literally feel if personified kind of aimless seeking validation maybe and when they stumble upon it patriarchy doesnt feel toxic to them because it gives them all that validation and power that they didnt realize they were seeking one has to ask how much the kens are like men in the real world and how much they are the bizarro world version of men they were underrepresented in barbieland politics careers and economic participation just like women are in the real world but in the real world we just shrug at the relative powerlessness of women and carry on somehow though to see some plastic ken dolls treated the same way is really upsetting to people,2023-07-22 20:36:17
ken was trying to find self worth he thought he could do that by attaching himself to barbie in the real world a lot of men want to be with attractive women and brag about it so they can feel some self value she was telling him he is not defined by who his girlfriend is same with the kens fighting and the choreography its a common struggle men have where society might make them feel they need to keep competing against each other and never feel satisfied with who they are constantly comparing themselves to other men but the kens instead ended up forming a brotherhood i am kenough something women in the real world tend to have a supportive sisterhood where everyone is just boosting each others confidence thought it was a great message,2023-07-22 20:36:42

"a film so intent on individualism expression identity and humanity doesn’t fully reconcile that men have similar issues


to me it just reinforced a gender division

exactly you will get downvoted but what youre saying is true the movie was just an excuse to make white women who supposedly feel like they cant accomplish the things they want because of the patriarchy feel superior to men men also have limits to their dreams but there wasnt any egalitarianism in this movie whatsoever

thats sort of the point though like the movie says at the end the kens will eventually have as much power as women do in the real world ending up basically where they started with a few concessions made to make the kens feel like they were heard a bit is part of the satire,2023-07-23 21:07:43

my only issue really is that the barbies manipulated the kens that i feel like they could have played less into those stereotypes like guys always wanting a damsel in distress or manplaining i like that the speech from the mom and then barbie giving one to ken that he is ken and doesnt have to be barbie and ken he doesnt have to live for barbie

for me the gaslighting and manipulation that the barbies did triggered a sort of anxiety for me because of how abusive women use mental tactics and men tend to be physical or violent but i digress because its a movie and not a real representation of real life overall i enjoyed it and i hope other guys who go see this movie appreciate their partners and mothers and sisters more and that they also learn about coping with self doubt and learning selflove and self worth we are kenough",2023-07-27 04:56:40

"i dont know what to think of it the deprogramming by listing ways in which the world is unfair to women was something but i dont think it went anywhere or did anything to resolve the issue or to even address it

its not about listing the ways the world is unfair its about explaining how you cant win mens approval in patriarchy whatever you do youre wrong so trying to please men and make them happy is a fools errand

you can only be effective and regain control of your life if you dont try to earn mens approval

so it really makes sense that this is how they resolve the issue and that its how women regain power in the story what it means is that if every women had this in mind they could block vote against sexist men and vote for laws that protect women because were fifty percent of the population but some women will vote against their own interest to gain mens approval which is how you lose your rights",2023-08-05 19:17:45
"the point was that all women are beautiful you dont have to be perfect you just have to be you thats why the scene where she sees an old woman for the first time and tells her shes beautiful is so important and thats why the ultimate closure for her character is to become real to embody that imperfection 

once again at the end ken is the one who knows who he is  an extension of barbie

i dont understand how you came to this conclusion when she explicitly tells him he needs to figure out who he is apart from her i dont think they could have made that any more explicit

first shown experience as a real woman is that women have to go to gynecologists its a funny shocking joke  but whats the meaning

because the expectation is set that her excitement will be about some new career in the real world as if that will define her and youre waiting to see what that career is so we can judge it and put her in a particular box by not giving us that were reminded that just being herself is enough shes real she has all the parts she doesnt need to be career barbie to impress us she just need to be herself

edit also regyno theres a quote from the filmmaker where she explains that she was always ashamed of her body so if she could show barbie smiling and thrilled to go to the gynecologist then maybe at least some little girls wouldnt see it as something shameful",2023-08-06 02:30:49

ive kind of been reflecting on it and i can definitely see how the latter parts of the film is is really directed at young women  having the courage to turn down a guy in a pretty mature way after both barbie and ken did some growing is a good example to set for people",2023-07-24 00:49:23

"i think it def comes off across as being mean to men it treats them that way to show how women are treated in real life which i agree with however it doesn’t make it any better for the kens in the movie they’re still treated badly by the end of it so if that will bother you then don’t watch it i know it bothered me as well as most of the serious problems with men in the movie are not taken as seriously as the scenes with barbie it’s a joke when ken is crying about his issues then tries to do a 180 when barbie says it’s okay to cry and then it goes back to being funny when he cry’s more 

it also doesn’t show any positive to being masculine really like the kens are not masculine or very friendly in the barbieland and only semi bond when they’re being very toxic doesn’t show any positive example of masculinity or male friendships",2023-07-23 06:29:49

"well the issue is more that this film isnt particularly nuanced or clever in the delivery of themes its trying to promote the writing is quite poor allaround which is a shame given the team behind the script its a very surface level take on the issues of patriarchy and women in a maledominated world propped up by mostly cheap jokes and strange plot vehicles used to push it forward 

i thought heading into this that it was going to be something like a tongue in cheek dark comedy ala the favourite or have nuance tackling tough subjects like promising young woman except in a barbie skin a blend of the two could have been a very interesting film instead its just kind of a like an overly long youtube video or snl sketch grinding jokes into the ground and offering empowering oneliners here and there 

its a convoluted mess by the time the credits roll its partially meant to be a journey of selfdiscovery but barbies whole adventure into the real world consists of running across some stereotypical  on the boardwalk a snotty teenager being a  to her and a strange car chase before headed back ken brings back dumb ideas of patriarchy flips barbieworld in a day and then its fixed the next day with some hollow youre kenough gag to put a bow on it it all feels mostly unearned by the end ryan gosling hard carries the film with his performance really giving his all but everyone else is just kind of going through the motions in a very mediocre plot 

there isnt really anything that this film does on a high level that makes it stand out or leave a lasting impression which was the expectation heading into a film written by the mind behind lady bird and recent little women adaptation we know that both gerwig and baumbach are capable of very high level screenplay writing but that just was not the case here at all marketing drummed a fervor for this one but it just felt like a bland mess by the end of it trying to interject themes of empowerment but without any sort of emotional journey or arc to make it land effectively 

i just dont think this is a good movie",2023-07-21 19:54:06

i think this movie captured the way little girls play with their toys in a perfect setting my one or two ken dolls were just there barbie was the main character",2023-07-22 17:53:41
l take this is a clever and easy to digest feminist piece about fighting back against the patriarchy and flipping the script on men so they get it it’s not a political sob fest  it’s a critique of the gender experience just because things reflect the real world does not make them political and if it did that’s not a bad thing,2023-07-24 13:09:04

i think you may be missing the point  it isnt about putting down service jobs its that you shouldnt be forced to be defined as your service job or your looks or your motherhood or your relationship to someone else looking at you ken that seeing any human as one dimensional is wrong and ultimately hurts everyone fighting the patriarchy is not saying women have to be astronauts or president to matter where masseuses or flight attendants dont  its saying that every choice is valid and commendable and beautiful and that society especially a society that is predominantly run by men that decide what is or is not important should not be the arbiter of what a good woman is,2023-07-24 17:27:02

"warning long comment incoming

i think a lot has been said about the overall portrayal of real world men and kens as  and misguided so i wont repeat that but even if you excuse all the portrayal of men as morons who need correcting  theres  this one main sympathetic good female character gloria and the way she is written imo shows exactly why this movie is so anti  men

 in the movie you see her husband for a minute and he’s learning a language so his daughter mocks him then his wife the hero human character rolls her eyes at him then later she’s talking about how some old boyfriend or current affair taught her to drive wildly  again her husband is this lame figure of mockery none of this is relevant to the wider commentary on gender or masculinity its simply ripping on a lame male character for humour

i think one excersise to do to find out if something is sexist and bigoted is to reverse the genders and see if it’s acceptable would a male heroic character who mocked his wife learning a language and then laughed about some cooler old girlfriend be seen as a good guy would that go unnoticed 
no he’d seem like an  

and i know women will say lots of women are treated that way in film like glorias husband is well no they’re not not by the supposedly good guy and the character were supposed to have sympathy for  there is no arnold shwarzanegger movie where he’s the hero and him and his son are mocking his wife and then he’s reminiscing about some hot old girlfriend whose wilder than his lame wife because that would instantly make him seem like an  to both men and women

and yet  to women like greta gerwig or the feminist types who enjoyed this film  it doesn’t even register as a bad thing when gloria does it shes still the righteous woman battling in an unfair system 
she goes on the hero of the story her disrespect of her lame husband and the father of her kids just a small joke  the opposite would absolutely not be accepted by women in reverse and still see them think of a man doing that ad a good guy to root for

now i know feminist and some men will come out and say  actually this movie is positive for men because it teaches them patriachy and toxic masculinity is holding them back from expressing their feelings blah blah blah but really  that’s just a feminist talking point decided as true by feminist women men on the whole aren’t sitting round wishing they could cry more or whatever so actually that makes it even worse because not only are all men made morons you have this condescending vision of what is good for men according to feminist women being presented regardless of what men actually think

again imagine the same movie in reverse  since women claim so many male movies do show women this way let’s say it’s starring stallone  all the women are morons and femininity is on the wrong path and needs to be corrected  stallone obviously thinks his wife is lame and talks about old girlfriends yet is the good guy in the movie  oh and there’s a message delivered by stallone to a crying woman who loves him about how actually she needs to find herself and the overall view of how women need to change for their own good according to men is presented during the movie as a theme

the shot at snyder and the mansplaining the godfather jokes were funny tbf although maybe lacking a bit of selfawareness considering in every interview ive read these last few months greta gerwig has been at pains to explain the symbolism in her own movie before it was even out for review let alone the public  one of my pet peeves show dont tell  and basically encouraging thinkpieces all artists good  bad want their work to be appreciated and understood so felt like a bit of a lowblow cheap shot at a fellow creative  even though i laughed,2023-07-21 13:16:25

also wasn’t gloria meant to be able to influence barbie land you would think she could have made things better,2023-07-28 03:21:17
"i think that an important point thats gotten lost is that the barbies likened the patriarchy to a virus that no one in barbieland had resistance to ken was just as susceptible as they were

poor ken wasnt the villain he was patient zero",2023-08-01 20:42:47
id rate it higher but yeah i was a little disappointed at some of the execution,2023-08-01 07:39:00
" the message about ken is that despite legitimate grievances about society as a whole actually the problem is with him and he needs to mentally selfreflect and accept his place

you seem to have missed the whole point of kens arc at the start hes miserable because hes internalized the expectation that a mans worth is derived from possessing and being desired by women and hes living in a bubble where no one is focused on him the conflict comes when he discovers the real world and latches onto the patriarchal notion that the problem is women not being expected to fawn over him rather than the idea that hes worthless if he isnt attached to a doting woman patriarchy tells them theyre useless because women arent throwing themselves at them and they blame the women instead of the toxic societal pressure thats denigrating them

in the end the kens happy ending isnt going back to the status quo their triumph is accepting that they have friendship and passions talents and hobbies that they can have worth and respect based on themselves completely independent from romantic relationships with barbie",2023-08-06 17:52:51
i think it is actually a critique of feminism as well barbieland is a critique disguised as a utopia but that doesnt mean its messages about patriarchy are any less valid it is up to ken to complete his own journey of self discovery barbie is not responsible for him,2023-08-06 12:38:50
"other things i noticed was that while there was a very noticeable plussized barbie and a wheelchair barbie that all the kens are either muscular or skinny they all are under a barbie gaze which goes completely unremarked on

there never been plussized ken dolls the closest ken to be called this is still more like muscular than chubby",2023-08-06 14:37:56
"if you think the writers of barbie greta gerwig and noah baumback think barbie land is a reflection of how our world ought to be you have missed the point

all barbie land is is a reflection of the brand mattel has manufactured and little girls’ engagement with that brand it’s not supposed to be correct in its beginning state or its end state it’s supposed to be flawed because the actual barbie brand has a history of flaws and continues to be flawed that’s the joke you missed the joke",2023-08-06 19:20:28
"i think a lot of these things were somewhat intentional it’s a setting in dreamland which returns to a society where ken’s can maybe can a lower court justice etc 

i thought the whole “women’s monologue” was cringy and awkward and very typical of what’s referred to disparagingly as “white women feminism” generally emanating from the relatively economically privileged",2023-08-06 14:59:14
"trying to manage to try not to scare people or talk over them or be creepy

theres no way youre earnestly making the point that this is on par with the social pressures experienced by women 

toxic feminity

playing with kens feelings is not what toxic femininity is toxic femininity describes toxic behaviors that patriarchal societies pressure women into adopting just like toxic masculinity is that for men think being meek nurturing playing dumb being childrenobsessed etc in this sense the movie does address it with the way barbies get brainwashed into playing along with patriarchal social norms in kendom

men who feel trapped and confused by contradictory social expectations and general social atomisation

could that be what the movie tried to touch on with the ken bit in the final act i honestly didnt really get that part it felt so out of place in general the ken selfawareness storyline was muddy and imo should not have been part of the movie",2023-08-06 12:58:22
"i agree with your position about everyone confirming to society’s expectations of them even nowadays many women have to conform to being feminists and working because that’s expected of them and wanting to be a stayathome mom is backwards or unambitious men have plenty of expectations set on them such as being manly and not sharing feelings being the breadwinner and making lewd comments about women there are many men that are uncomfortable with this but they have to act like it comes a naturally to them as a woman i personally face more pressure by the expectations of being a member of the uppermiddle class of my country than from being a woman i am extremely limited in terms of what job i’m supposed to choose what hobbies and interests i’m supposed to enjoy what school my kids are supposed to go to even what city and what neighbourhood i’m supposed to live in i find that a lot more restrictive than the expectations on being a woman having kids and advancing in my career looking pretty etc which are things i personally am excited about

what i mean to say is that there are expectations coming from everywhere and in other countries outside the us those expectations are way worse and more restrictive than they are in the us and that men also face a lot of expectations in many cases even worse than what the women face it’s not a man’s world it’s the world of rich extroverted socially skilled intelligent powerhungry men who naturally have the exact same aspirations and interests than what’s expected of them",2023-08-06 14:11:34
its crazy that people are downvoting you for having an opinion  i think a well balanced criticism should be welcomed and people should understand that not all movies are for everyone,2023-08-28 10:08:37
you really just be making up whatever the  to manifest something negative,2023-07-26 07:01:48
which is honestly so sad youd hope they could take off the ego for one second and see the power of the message for themselves,2023-07-21 17:28:31
so glad i did not watch trailers,2023-07-23 00:54:09
"i felt the same way i loved the movie but when he came on it was just him playing himself

15 years ago its funny not anymore

i did enjoy the parts without him though ken and alan definitely were the better parts barbie was kind of depressing",2023-07-22 01:25:31
agreed his entire entourage was unnecessary after the chase scene they did literally nothing and added nothing to the plot itd only be forgivable if it was deliberate commentary on how ceos butt into everything while being generally useless,2023-07-22 01:16:31
yeah film comedians tend to have a short shelf life and he is far past his,2023-07-22 02:12:31
i really wanted more musical numbers they were really good,2023-07-21 14:30:25
you must not of really watched the movie in that case the closing monologue between barbie and ruth was beautiful,2023-07-24 11:20:29
"company guy saying yeah patriarchy but keep it on the down low none of it felt real at all

you really do need to research more on certain allegation issues and  harrassment within the top companies",2023-08-21 23:05:02
incel is an insult used by people who know the only value they have to world is  activity,2023-07-23 15:04:13
"i can see how you would interpret it that way but i don’t think it’s the intent  the movie uses the kens to make a statement about how women are treated in the real world

the narrator even says explicitly that as a result of the changes at the end of the movie the kens will be able to work towards the same rights that women have in the real world – because there’s no magic bullet to provide equality 

i imagine the filmmakers are hoping for us as men to take the discomfort we feel because of the treatment of the kens and use that emotive reaction to drive introspection – not to assume that the movie is making some ultra hostile or insidious statement about men",2023-07-25 08:38:23
literally nothing in that movie is radical feminist it’s like the most palatable liberal feminism you can het,2023-07-25 16:50:59
"its really annoying isnt it glad you feel that way because its a commentary on how women are still treated by men in todays society out of the 115 justices that have served the court only 6 six have been women were equal now though so thats all good 

also even if they are clearly radical feminist ideas does one film counter balance the ingrained patriarchal ideas that we have to deal with everyday 
dont think so",2023-07-25 10:14:25
" the idea they were going for was to have barbieland and the real world contrast each other with a matriarchy in the former and a patriarchy in the latter which they then completely abandoned in the end

the movie overtly disapproved by how barbieland ended up you didnt pick up on the sarcastic commentary the narrator was making about the kens have got to start somewhere and them begging for a scotus seat only to be told maybe one day theyll get a lower court position thats satire meant to show how  weve treated women for pretty much all of history",2023-07-25 15:47:01
you’re right if a miss is not making a feminist movie,2023-07-21 22:32:33
they do they have three other collab movies together and a kid,2023-07-21 18:52:02
yep 43 dadi took my daughter and her friends today and was very surprised at how much i laughed  gosling nailed it,2023-07-22 02:08:41
like most things it was exaggerated truth i liked the lesson for kens at the end about finding themselves instead of only being about their relationship to a woman,2023-07-22 02:38:41
as a man…i found it hilarious because the criticisms of men were true,2023-07-22 03:39:13
becuase wannabe reddit film critics who only think about nitpicking dont represent the real world,2023-07-22 21:47:27
i agree with the jokes i wouldnt call the message political but i also think it was executed badly because it felt forced and rushed at the same time,2023-07-23 07:41:58
"nah i think its very important to raise the issue of womens struggles and what feminism  really means men and women are equal and teach that to all especially the young kids

the movie also mainly tries to be just a silly comedy which unfortunately make some think this deep message came off shallow but its a comedy

feminism isnt political unless you are a trump supporter that got major issues with it what it is human basic rights",2023-07-23 05:43:45
"i think the scene at the end with the creator made people think it was deep but like it didnt have a deep message at all beyond the same  weve been telling kids for decades ie you can be whatever you want to be 

overall it was just an okay movie not too bad not too good 

if i could do it again i would have seen barbie first and then oppenheimer because oppenheimer was so good it did make me a bit disappointed with barbie",2023-07-23 16:57:08
i don’t think it was supposed to be deep,2023-07-23 17:10:03
im confused did you watch the movie,2023-07-23 21:01:45
" yay victory for women

everybody should be equally miserable ",2023-07-23 20:40:02
"yes it is a victory compared to having zero independencechoice as a woman the only way to not depend on a man wasis to have your own money id rather be in corporate  than being trapped with someone for financial reasonssurvival

i mean its a slightly less hellish option ",2023-07-23 21:57:14
in a capitalist society being finally independent  freedom,2023-07-23 23:44:32
i felt this and was conscious if that was the case but i think gosling just had a more fun job to do and hammed it up a lot more margot was fantastic but a lot more straight man in the double act she brought so much heart that i dont mind but people always tend to talk more about the funny stuff in big blockbusters like this i feel,2023-07-26 22:21:00
"i dont think theyre doing it in purpose gosling was indeed  awesome and the most surprising part of the film i got reminded of brad pitt when he did burn after reading and cruise in tropic thunder nobody was expecting them to do roles like that

on the other hand margot is already is in this michael jordan status specially coming from that monster performance in babylon we already know shes going to be great and maybe people take it for granted",2023-07-26 15:28:08
robbie acted less than gosling besides crying which weve seen her do way better in babylon gosling weve never seen him have range like this robbie weve seen her have way more range than this,2023-07-26 16:11:06
to be fair he had the one big musical number,2023-07-26 13:03:40
"it’s because even though the portrayal of men was negative  they were allowed to be the butt of jokes and dumb it would have been better if they had of made more of the barbies like that as well so a goofy malibu  barbie and others  then they could have conflicted with the scientist barbies and whatever else as it is the barbies are just kind of bland especially by the third act when they all just become a mouthpiece for feminism and say things that by all rights barbies living in barbie land shouldn’t know anything about

cos gerwig wanted to cast all the menkens as dumb and all the womenbarbies as smart and do the tired men dumb woman smart sitcom trope it means a lot of barbie on barbie humour is absent",2023-07-26 12:19:54
"i  think that gosling had more range because as supporting cast and the movies heel he was given more leeway in how he could present ken

barbie was an agent of  the movies message and also the most important ip in the film tptb protected that but it made barbie bland in comparison to ken",2023-07-26 14:41:45
"i dont understand it why are people taking this movie so fkin seriously 

turn your brain off and have fun and laugh at the goofiness 

everyone these days think every movie has to be deep and deciphering",2023-07-26 16:36:27
because gerwig showed women as so competent and clever in the movie they’re not complete characters they’re mouthpieces,2023-07-27 03:21:27
all of issa rae’s lines got laughs in my theater i love her delivery,2023-07-27 09:03:19
well they did steal the show,2023-07-27 20:38:50
i haven’t seen or heard anyone saying this except you,2023-07-27 01:08:32
i’m sorry that bothers you but he was the best thing about this movie,2023-07-26 23:31:14
why,2023-07-26 22:04:29
i think the reaction from will ferris toward glorias idea of build a new line of an ordinary barbies defines the movie  the consumerism matell is truly the force that driven these conceptual ideas slaveryantislavery sexism liberalismconservatism etc in order to create the needs and desires for the consumers  the movie can not elaborate anymore since itself is part of the culture to have us to shell out more ,2023-07-27 18:16:28
you really think society is mostly going in the right direction and that whatever is popular and touches victimhood is also true whatever the movie is the fact that social media promotes it like crazy and everyone is so pumped up about it should make you skeptical at least a bit imo one should run from those things as fast as possible lol,2023-07-27 13:58:05
i felt like it is more of an insult towards women i mean they won by lying and manipulating,2023-07-27 16:50:09
"that part made me a bit uncomfortable too and im a woman

 however thinking about it after seeing the film i think it was to demonstrate how women have feltbeen portrayed pretty much for all of human history  not just in films

 two wrongs dont make a right but i think the point of the film was to role reverse so men can understandwell the entire point of feminism so i do think its not just a film for women and girls but for men who are actually willing to open their eyes and empathize with women",2023-07-27 14:05:58
it’s because the toys are made for little girls and those barbie’s are so supposed to reflect those girls so they can see themselves the entire movie makes many jokes to say nobody from the barbie’s the children and the company that made them don’t care about ken so why would they put the effort beyond race swaps of ken,2023-07-29 04:21:18
"i could be wrong here but is this kind of how the toys are there are far more barbies than kens and the barbies come with a lot more variation

also within the world of the movie barbieland is a reverse of the real worlds patriarchy where women have all the opportunities and men are just useless eye candy",2023-07-29 04:11:57
only one stocky guy i noticed,2023-07-29 06:15:59
you’re right  that seen was so fast but a great touch,2023-08-02 03:36:22
why do any women oriented fantasy movie needs to be compared to real life i mean when john wick goes around killing 1000 people do we compare with how we totally wont do it in real life ,2023-07-22 12:58:56
"uhmm… af’s monologue was actually ruined the film for me… because everything she says… men have been doing it for decades 

i’ll have to make a separate thread after transcribing it point by point… but nope  whatever she was describing has been done by men for centuries now…",2023-07-21 22:26:59
i didnt think of this but the similarities are there  anyone downvoting is in denial i actually like the elf movie though barbie just couldnt keep my attention because i had the same issues as you there were a couple of the jokes i thought were funny but few and far between the boredom the barbieland set was really nice though i wish they did more with that i kept thinking while watching it would have been great if they did this or that instead,2023-09-19 12:41:09
haha when they were explaining how to get to the real world i was like ohhh do we go through the 7 levels of the candy cane forest too,2023-09-20 18:30:44
i feel like after having watched all of greta gerwig’s other films pretty much everything about barbie was intentional,2023-07-23 01:46:19
"i’m critical of this because i love barbie i loved playing with my barbie’s i had so much fun as a girl with my barbie’s the movie was not fun it was mean it pandered to girl boss culture in the most unbarbie fashion and ken steals the show

edit i don’t even think it pandered to girl boss culture actually i could’ve stomached that it’s is basically the antithesis to toxic masculinity culture destroy menken rather than realize that we compliment each other and build something better together",2023-07-24 07:00:59
wb is pretty shameless about ip flexing,2023-07-26 14:12:05
"especially with alphamales and toxic masculinity groups and incels talking about how wicked women are toying with men and stuff 

i thought it was less to do with that i didnt even think of that when it happened and more to do with the implied generalizationallegorical meaning of men essentially being more interested in power and oneupping other men and this often includes women as commodities to have power over if i remember correctly the montage of masculine things were all powerrelated whether or not they dealt with women i remember thinking at the time that the subtext was that patriarchy encourages power hunger for material and immaterial thingsone of those things being womenand their idea to put them against each other was a way to make that power structure implode

i def think using horses or something like that would have lessened the impact of that messaging i mean there is maybe something else that could have been done that could be as impactful on the other hand the women were manipulating men to regain their social power so in that sense it is a more substantial reason then being cruel which is what incels assume",2023-07-28 07:03:47
yeah that girl is there to introduce sashas character as a bully but she isnt really a bully well no she is its a character flaw sasha has character flaws because shes a complex human being who lives in the real world which contrasts barbieworld where nobody has flaws barbie is so unprepared for the idea that real people can be mean that a schoolgirl being mean to her causes an emotional breakdown then you have the other girl there to show that barbie has less resilience than a child that shes weak then she spends the rest of the film changing and growing as a character to a point where shes strong enough to live in the real world,2023-07-28 06:47:31
as for your second point wake up incels will literaly call this while movie antiman propaganda regardless of that scene lol,2023-07-28 05:21:27
i really doubt that the incels and alpha males would make it that long into the movie to get upset at that scene,2023-07-28 05:20:27
"its like no one has every heard of barbie and knows the toys

like who could forget aquas barbie girl song which i still sing eveytime i see a barbie commercial",2023-07-21 15:45:51
i’m not sure what people expected though the film obviously speaks to adults it’s also wrapped in a childlike tone of course with that tone the messages will be onthenose,2023-07-21 15:36:14
lol where do “kens live on the street”,2023-08-01 15:06:45
they dont live on the street they kind of just appear to service barbie much like how most female characters have been written since checks watch all of cinema history,2023-08-01 19:18:22
lmaoooo hilarious bait,2023-08-01 22:08:59
yes except that it wouldve been interesting to explore this world of patriarchy and feminism within attachment bonds the girl boss narrative the idea that women should be independent not rely on a man have their own money property career ambitions is exhausting fierce independence is a toxic part of feminism we were made to rely on each other we have to learn to coexist with men where men and women both feel valued for what they bring to the table and rely on each other not in a codependent or straight down the middle everything must be equal but in interdependent way,2023-07-21 23:33:45
walking out of barbie i just felt drained its awesome that this idea is a movie it was funny too but as you said it was just sad to see how much i related to every  thing they said a bittersweet feeling for sure haha,2023-07-30 14:10:18
i loved it and walked out with a positive feeling but i definitely cried a few times in it because of how real it was,2023-07-29 19:34:34
i think it was poking fun at the teen who thinks they know everything but really just throws words around like fascist,2023-07-22 08:24:12
very brave of you to adopt the opinion this corporateproduced toy advertisement wanted you to adopt or maybe it wasnt obvious enough for you that the teen was supposed to be the villain during that speech and barbie was supposed to be the innocent victim they had a random character warn barbie that the teen was a bully and they showed barbie crying,2023-07-22 08:31:42
"i completely agree the only scene i really liked in the movie is when stereotypical barbie  cries after the girls criticise her and she says in the real world men objectify me because of my femininity and women see me as a problem because of my femininity

i feel the movie was made by women that saw barbie as a problem but were paid to turn her into a movie and change peoples minds if you already thought barbie wasnt problematic this movie wasnt for you",2023-07-22 08:28:20
"i think that’s the larger idea of the film as in the prescription that barbie was counterintuitive to feminism might actually be the work of observation without considering the larger implications of how the “player” perceived barbie okay big picture—why do we look up to this model of a citizen both physically and figuratively why do all women have to be barbie when men can just be ken but as a kid you don’t see that you just see barbie barbie who is a doctor or president or lifeguard or just generic barbie and you never question it you just feel like this barbie is fun and you want to be her 

it’s the transportation of barbie into the patriarchy of our socalled real world century city that demotes the idea of barbie being everything into barbie being a literal object plaything in the way or accessoried too emotional or otherwise we as a society have stipulated the notion that barbie is a setback when she isn’t your comment is the true distillation of the film the common thought of barbie being such a step back for feminism translates to surface level interpretation that’s really more of a commentary on the frustrations of everyday women versus the actual dissertation that barbie is a patriarchal vision if barbie really were she would have acted as the kendom authorized she would just have guitar played “at” her and she would rub his feet and listen to how the godfather was filmed without questioning",2023-07-22 08:48:01
"i can’t say if barbie has any detrimental effect on girlswomen but i can say with confidence that action figures can have a detrimental effect in boysmen

to me it’s not about an impossible standard—it’s that there is only one kind of representation barbie is always tall slender and successful just like gi joe is always strong and confident it’s the equivalent of seeing the best version of everyone on instagram what about the boys and girls who aren’t at their best

it was played as a joke but i agree that there should be existential dread barbie and still living in his parents’ basement gi joe that way children are exposed to multiple lifestyles and forms of success otherwise every child without a six pack and a bazooka will feel inadequate",2023-07-22 08:33:50
the teen roasting on barbie has been at least to me the general consensus around barbie at least for the last 20 years,2023-07-25 03:40:07
"i think the ken situation is more nuanced and i kind of wish the movie had explored it more 

ken wasnt evil he was just misguided he lived in a world where he was a second class citizen and all men were oppressed and when he entered the real world and saw patriarchy he became excited because he got a taste of freedom unfortunately he went to far by completely overthrowing the barbies but they werent totally innocent either after all they were pretty awful to the kens and honestly continued to be after the resolution of the story not even allowing them a single seat on the supreme court for example

the end of the movie shows the beginning of change but its still a pretty oppressive society for kens when you look at it similarly to how women are treated in real life you can kind of understand why they rebelled against the barbies",2023-07-23 14:45:03
agree she was not in love with him and not reciprocating his feelings wasnt her wronging him,2023-07-23 14:27:02
"that ending let me frustrated yeah we treated the kens horribly and they revolted lets go back to the exact same system 

you had the right reaction to what happened there 

the audience is  expected to go thats  up when an outright request for equality is explicitly rejected no explanation attempted which sets up for the dont worry the kens will work their way up to the level women are at in the real world joke

ending on that joke was moreorless the point of that bit going the way it did its the sort of joke thats intended to make watchers go wait a sec after it hits

if a watcher feels like women have it great in the real world then that line should means they think kens will land in the perfect spot

if a watcher feels like women still have a more slightly raw deal than theyd like to see the kens have that might be something worth examining further",2023-07-25 06:19:50
"yeah we treated the kens horribly and they revolted lets go back to the exact same system

but that isnt what happened lol",2023-07-25 06:25:36
it does  for him but its a fair outcome  the guy gets the girl thing is overdone  this isnt the first movie to flip that but its still a fresh and realistic end,2023-07-24 07:45:52
i think they wanted to say that sexism against women is a big problem and then men play a large role in that however i think they made a point to emphasize that men face real issues too i mean most of the jabs against men were really just jokes and in my opinion pretty funny ones at that so as a man i really didn’t see the movie as sexist towards me nor i didn’t feel like i was being blamed for anything at all it seemed like a funny and thoughtful movie made to represent the female experience,2023-12-20 02:56:06
there was a ken at our theater and he was spot on in a matching button down surf shirt and shorts i really hope after this movie that he adds beach to his resume,2023-07-23 02:51:44
i thought it was to show what the reality of being a human woman is like after making the choice to be human the viewer probably expects her to go to a job interview or similar so this was a little subversive joke,2023-07-23 13:07:17
turning human presumably gave her a  thus the visit to the gyno there was a joke about the plastic genitals earlier in the movie,2023-07-23 13:44:58
" meta joke about barbie all dolls really not having genitals

 callback to the earlier i dont have a  setup

 a joke was needed to balance the imo slightly cheap emotionally manipulative gimmick that was the montage scene i know im being overly cynical

 shows barbie fully embracing what it means to be a real human woman  including the not so fun parts

 backs up the comingofagepuberty theme barbie dying as a doll  being reborn as human felt like a bit of a metaphor for a girl growing out of barbie dolls and entering puberty etc

 good message to girlswomen in audience to take care of their health etc",2023-07-23 15:02:04
i don’t think it needs a sequel,2023-07-24 19:52:13
really i thought he was one of the funniest parts,2023-07-26 16:04:16
huh,2023-09-24 15:39:50
what,2023-09-24 15:06:36
i know what you mean it’s either a mistake or he’s the original ken that starts the cascade,2023-09-24 23:11:04
"i feel like it was intentional

there’s a couple scenes where he’s like not sure how to react to something then jumps in like when he shakes his fists it’s subtle but he did that beforehand a big scene

you know kinda like that’s his moment of reality breaking through where he gets really jealous dolls shouldn’t get jealous so ken’s starting to feel act more human",2023-09-25 18:25:32
"he kinda learned men can be anything but they still need some qualifications skills diplomas etc which is supposed to show that even though white men the film doesnt say much about race but it really does show it might have it easier than other groups but its not and automatic thing where being white male equals success 

also what ken really takes from the real world is some twisted straightforward take on patriarchy where men are the coolest masculinity is the best and women are accessories or something",2023-07-25 08:38:34
" which i think weakened the feminist message a bit by conflating problems that are just innate to the human experience with gender dynamics

i think this is a common mistake people make about feminism feminism doesnt just liberate women it liberates men as well the reason is that feminism isnt about letting women act like men its about removing what we might call patriarchal requirements this is the dismantle the patriarchy stuff that cant possibly be treated carefully in a 6 second tik tok but makes a lot of sense when you encounter it in long form

i remember reading an essay in high school about twenty years ago that one thing feminism will deliver is men no longer having to shoulder the exclusive burden of providing for a family which is emotionally taxing and generally only gets lip service

the issues the movie discusses patriarchy toxic masculinity feminism allyship etc are all closely related the idea that its ok not to be excellent could probably be considered in relation to toxic masculinity that men historically are pushed to excel because men generally relate to each other through a power hierarchy so men are supposed to climb up the ladder

so when women start getting more rights they adopt the same idea one might consider this idea therefore a toxic trait of masculinity that is foisted on women who leave the home for work

the idea that its ok not to be excellent is therefore a different way of addressing the idea of needing to climb the hierarchy at workin society rather than women should be like men and excel its men should not be expected to behave in this unhealthy way

theres a difference between doing something because youre passionate and doing something because you need to win

now theres a larger issue around society needing people to do jobs that no one is passionate about or else society cant exist but thats outside the bounds of the movie",2023-07-25 15:36:58
im a man with no power am i a woman,2023-07-25 15:31:51
exactly this is a mainstream movie about a toy that is pretty much ubiquitous at least in the western hemisphere so only a certain cohort of the audience is going to have anything more than a very surface level knowledge about or interest in feminism or how the patriarchy actually works and the filmmakers had to address these more serious issues while also keeping the film fun and easy and accessible to everyone a lot of the criticisms ive heard have been from people who dont understand even basic ideas like women getting custody of children in divorces is not in fact some kind of female privilege,2023-07-26 02:29:14
i couldnt agree with this more for a film full of actors that can deliver such excellent emotion in other movies and a film with such a positive message i was quite suprised to find myself feeling no emotion in the serious moments of the movie,2023-07-30 20:43:19
i get what you’re saying  but as a 22 yo man who never played with barbie’s as a child i don’t think there ever was a message there for me despite that i throughly enjoyed this movie and thought it was hilarious honestly with a little deep thinking i am able to see how this movie could mean a lot to a lot of people,2023-08-07 05:23:51

literally reverse genders and you’ve got about 60 of all films ever made and their representation of women

" then why is ken like a dumb himbo beach dude but margot robbie’s barbie is using these elaborate terms like “cognitive dissonance” and quite clever shouldn’t she be a  beach barbie as well

this is explained in the movie when she visits weird barbie near the start much like weird barbie was originally a normal barbie but became weird because the kid playing with her starting cutting her hair off and drawing on her face with marker pens stereotypical barbie became self reflective because america ferreras character found her daughters old barbie and started projecting her own feelings onto the doll",2023-07-24 12:51:32

" the movie suggests that the power balance towards men is 90 which it just isnt its 63 if you want to use supreme court seats as representation

whilst thats true the first female supreme court judge was only appointed in 1981 many decades after it was normal to see women practicing law i think the point was that equality wasnt something women got overnight it was a series of small victories over many decades that got us to where we are now i agree though that within the context of barbieland it doesnt really make sense for it to work the way it did in real life",2023-07-31 09:32:49

that scene isnt about the criticism of the ordinary woman but rather critisizing capitalism and corpo murica typically an ordinary character usually doesnt appeal well in mainstream but bcoz the assistant says that in this case it will statistically make more money will ferrell greenlights it bcoz he cares about the money instead of the idea,2023-09-24 18:36:29

yeah i think the concept of like this toy to human thing didn’t work so well  barbieland was super fun needed that but needed a better story about interacting with the real world  also needed a more clear way of getting out of the real world than “wear roller blades in venice beach”,2023-07-25 14:33:53
i think the underlying theme was that the barbies believed they solved sexism only to learn they didn’t the barbies like the rest of us cannot completely solve sexism the movie was satire and purposefully subverted gender inequality to show that dominance of either gender is bad the conclusion was that things were made better for the kens just as feminists have made life better for women  but it is not perfect ken learned two things 1 he does not need a relationship with barbie a woman to have a life’s purpose and 2 he does not need to be more dominant or masculine to be manly barbie learned that 1 inequality between either gender is bad she realized this by experiencing sexism and 2 perfection emotions etc pales in comparison to a the full spectrum of human emotions,2023-07-26 05:59:19
"i dont think the movie attempted equality it highlighted the existing ageold systemic inequality to remind the viewer why we have to continue fighting for true equality and not simply trying to disempower other groups  

in regards to barbie dmbing down men men have been in positions of power way more than women have throughout the worlds history and men in power are responsible for the birth of capitalism war genocide global lead contamination and of course global warming so it is arguable that they have in some ways destroyed the world or at least established and enforced corrupt exploitative systems while historically abusing and dehumanizing women who knows maybe if more women had been in power throughout history wed  have a lot more women famously responsible for doing horrible  too but that doesnt change the facts now of course not all men are evil or dumb but they definitely can be dumb andor horrible for the record the same is true for women but i do think the barbie movie went a bit overboard with the men dumb stereotypes even if i did find a lot of it funny as a man myself i also thought the role reversal was rather interesting the kens being made sympathetic oppressed and limited under barbie rule and having to accept and make the most of their lower status after their uprising failed    

i agree that there was zero subtlety or subtext that a lot of the female empowerment was lamely hamfisted even if the message was still good stuff actually thinking about it i like how the complex issues and struggles women simply learn to live with are plainly stated since many women might not know how to fully articulate why life is so  hard for them or maybe no one around them would listen if they did explain it maybe that lack of subtlety of not skirting around the issues or merely implying but baldly stating was cathartic for a lot of female viewers  

and i did also want more for ken in the conclusion hed had all that leadup complete with an awesomely 80s rock ballad and then his arc quietly fizzled out without a definitive conclusion i liked that he was kenough but i wanted a scene that solidified or hinted at his next steps in life as we got with barbie  

oh well i thought it was a fun movie overall i hope my comment hasnt bothered you

"they based the dynamics on the dolls canon they have canon ken was created to support barbie he was always meant to be her cheerleader not the other way around

i didnt get the sense that she was leading him on and i think that was the point ken had it in his mind that they were supposed to be together but barbie always saw him and treated him as a friend she was clear about her boundaries sure you can come over but youll just be part of the friend group im having over no i dont have any interest in kissing you it was ken who couldnt take a hint and was obsessively pursuing her she never showed him any special interest it might have been a kindness for barbie to be more blunt in her rejection as she was in the end but as we saw she had to come to terms with not wanting to hurt his feelingsnot wanting him to hate her and ken also had to get a lifedevelop a sense of self so that he could receive the rejection and move on i think that aspect is very true to life there are men who act like their owed a womans affection because they like her and women often grapple with not wanting to be disliked for rejecting a man theyre not interested in,2023-07-25 23:06:38

from the google reviews it looks like many people agreed with you,2023-08-06 10:03:03
i agree the movie was terrible half the audience walked out before it was over it got great reviews because of the message it was sending but as far as quality film making this movie was ,2023-08-05 05:03:02
wrong impression greta also said women werent good either and in no way implied in anyway that men were evil,2023-07-28 13:10:10
you kind of missed the point of the film eep,2023-07-28 14:10:55
great job missing the entire point,2023-07-28 14:14:21
no you actually dont get it,2023-07-28 21:16:24
women would have the same reaction for jokes aimed at them,2023-07-21 13:28:00
look how many men were in the movie its obviously a joke and something they were trying to have fun with,2023-07-21 12:49:12
yeah those dance numbers really popped with the speakers turned up,2023-07-23 23:51:52
or is it that matriarchy is good but the real world patriarchy is bad weird stuff,2023-07-21 08:18:24
"the town wasnt literally a playset used by anyone its an alternate toy dimension its not physically real the residents are the idea of barbie ruth says that pretty explicitly

eta becoming a human was literally the resolution of the existentialism plot like literally literally she went from being an idea to existing",2023-07-24 23:47:22
"if so the town was super out of scale

can we really be sure of this the scenes where they go from barbieland to the real world have them crossing a number of different vistas where there are barbie dolls in the background mountains oceans deserts etc  

i will agree that the films thematic ambitions exceeded its actual reach which is probably the more substantive and salient criticism  the existential themes exist uneasily with the feminist ones but maybe that is what gerwig was going for",2023-07-24 22:33:57
"so the main character barbie was connected to one owned by the mother and if i understand correctly each barbie has this sort of connection to real life if so the town was super out of scale

you see all the scenes shot in color were from barbies perspective while the scenes shot in black and white were more objective",2023-07-25 03:47:42
yeah  forbid you take an interest or try to be helpful,2023-07-21 05:15:29
jesus i havent seen lain in 20 years i might do a rewatch,2023-07-22 05:22:45

i thought the same thing when i saw the stills of him prerelease but he was good enough for me to not think of it too much while watching,2023-07-29 14:22:59
i disagree and i think he played his part perfectly was funny even with the persona they gave him at times,2023-07-29 12:13:44
lol,2023-07-21 15:09:02
"how does it show that though the barbies are in charge and that’s ok but when kens in charge the patriarchy is bad for men and women and how did ken get better after patriarchy because he was allowed to go “find himself” whatever that means

i feel like only people who already use buzzphrases like “the patriarchy hurts men too” will actually think the movie is making that point",2023-07-21 09:17:45
"other than this one throwaway seen where a man was seen by himself depressed sitting on a park bench there was never a point in this movie where it showed anything negative happening for the men in any childish delusional fantasy version of what this movie considers a patriarchy 

in fact they even went out of their way to present this ridiculous idea that men just have it made in every version of a patriarchy it wasnt until the barbies brainwashed each other with misandric propaganda and purposefully manipulated the kens into fighting each other that things started to break down for the kens",2023-07-22 05:46:23
"are they really that bad

they allude to it in the film as a change but barbies more inclusive and realistic nature is all relatively quite new

the barbie model for a long time was standard dimensions official to make the clothes and accessories interchangeable between dolls which critics said created unrealistic expectations in early youth on body image for context that standard dimension model if scaled at 16 would equate to a 59 person at those dimensions barbie would have measurements of a 36 inches 91 cm chest and 33 inches 84 cm hips while having 18 inches 46 cm waist that was only changed in 1998 and different body types were only included in the late 00s

and on diversity while there was a black doll introduced in 1968 for example it was first not a barbie but given an alternate name as a side character a recoloured version of the same mould of barbie which thus didnt account for actual physical attributes more commonly seen in black women  instead just using a white model and thus more ethnically eurocentric beauty standards  already out of reach for most girls  concerning a la black is beautiful movement same with the first iterations of the hispanic barbie lines which were literally just the white barbie model  colour and all but with cinco de mayo accessories but moreover a lot of these racially diverse barbie were tagged as their ethnicity so while there was quite progressively when it started professor barbie and astronaut barbie and doctor barbie etc until relatively recently they were almost always white model barbies while for example the hispanic barbies were advertised and modelled as cinco de mayo barbie matador barbie carnaval barbie etc",2023-07-21 12:07:00

10 minutes of rwoosh,2023-07-26 19:49:11
i think people talking about their moms is because the general message of the movie is making them recognize some experiences and feelings they have in common with their moms the movie is not about motherhood though the motherdaughter relationship in the movie has some conflict but it doesn’t get toxic,2023-07-28 01:12:58
the relationship is strained but in no way abusive,2023-07-28 00:40:10
"how did it show the patriarchy hurts everyone the kens end up homeless and powerless again but somehow kens happy ending is that he gets to find himself and cry or something how is that showing the patriarchy hurts everyone that seems like such a buzz statement that doesn’t really make sense here at all 
if that’s the message they were going for they failed",2023-07-21 09:13:24
what the  why are there things women are not allowed to pretend to be,2023-07-23 01:47:21
sokinda like how women have been portrayed in films since film began,2023-07-26 20:55:54
i feel like a lot of people are going to watch this movie and say see feminism isnt about equality its about women getting revenge on men but after reading a lot of the other comments and interpretations i feel like its just trying to show men what its like for women if roles were reversed,2023-07-26 20:15:51
i think its telling how obviously wrong it is to treat men as the kens were treated in this movie thats how women are treated daily if you felt bad for ken in the beginning… congrats now you understand why sexism is wrong,2023-07-26 21:23:47
"i didnt feel sympathy for barbies struggle wondering if that was the intention to not feel sorry for a doll

of course you didnt barbie is meant to be relatable to women look at when barbie and ken first went to the realworld and they were recieving attention from men ken felt appreciated while barbie was leered at barbie was treated like an object ken an equal thats how many women if not all feel irl not to mention even if you didnt experience that you can easily tell shes going thru an expectations vs reality type sitch",2023-07-26 04:36:28
"how is barbie land democratic if anything what we saw in the movie was that ken were not allowed to vote for the barbie elections

so how are ken fascist and barbie democratic",2023-07-24 05:08:57
men werent vilified though toxic masculinity was the source of trouble because not all men have toxic masculinity tendencies this is represented in the movie by allan he literally doesnt fit in with the dudebros kens and is an ally to the barbies ken originally is played up as an okay dude but was tainted with the wrong mindset which he think is how he could get what he wants then spreads said mindset to the other kens,2023-07-23 17:21:43
idk i thought they handled this pretty well i think a lot of males wonder where their place in the world is after the downfall of the patriarchy are they just going to be tossed aside what is their role now i think the scene with barbie and ken at the end addresses that she apologized to him for how she was treating him and says that he deserves to go find a place in the world that makes him happy i think the movie acknowledged that we aren’t better off in a patriarchy or a matriarchy we need to find a more harmonious balance,2023-07-23 17:13:22
the script was so flabby in certain spots i wonder if they let some people improvise and for example mckinnon improv was great and will ferrells was meh but they left it in the mattel hq c suite scene was soooopp long and aside from the telephone style whispering around the heartshaped table and the glengarry glenross joke it wasnt funny and could have been 1 minute instead of 10 my guess is they were like ferrell will appeal to different people than gerwig lets just make this screenplay a weird mosaic same with the beach off scene so long and not her sense of humor but a grab for a wider audience and something for a commercial,2023-08-06 13:28:33
i was also let down by this though i dont think this movie had much feminism in it and i really dont know where people get this idea from,2023-08-06 19:22:34
wait… you’re misanthrope and nihilist and went to see barbie lol okay…,2023-07-28 10:38:51
i watched it after oppenheimer and thought it was bonkers good idk,2023-07-22 15:32:57
"i feel like you missed the point about this beauty is moreso a feeling you can be an extremely beautiful woman and not feel like you are 

her self confidence is knowing she’s beautiful is to show wisdom and that when you are secure in who you are that makes you beautiful",2023-08-01 01:21:09
i think that’s why it’s such a big moment when she tells the old woman that barbie came to the real world essentially because she’s afraid of cellulite then on that bench she starts to feel the weight of the real world she feels emotions sadness fear joy etc she turns to that woman and for the first time sees someone who is imperfect yet beautiful something she’s probably never considered possible i thought it was such a beautiful moment because up to this point she has been so afraid of shallow things but she sees the beauty in someone who she would have previously been terrified to look like,2023-08-01 05:24:10
her interaction with the old woman was barbie first realizing that physical imperfections and aging can be beautiful which is a factor in the choice she makes at the end,2023-08-14 19:29:36
dude we rock,2023-09-05 00:01:39
it’s great that you think that but the fact that it’s all you got is pretty cringey considering your claim,2023-09-05 16:45:03
bro i rushed out and bought me a horse after watching it,2023-09-09 05:29:17
amazing that you gave a pure analysis based solely on the elements of what makes a good movie and got downvoted,2023-07-22 10:44:58
"yeah i saw it yesterday and was pleasantly surprised with how much i enjoyed it

and just cause im curious

as a man who likes to believe hes a feminist and very progressive this film still made me very uncomfortable at times and i mean that in an extremely positive way this movie is going to make a lot of men upset and i for one cannot wait

which parts made you uncomfortable i only ask because i wouldnt say anything felt too out of left field in regards to its commentary plus it definitely had some promen or men empowering perhaps themes in there as well especially near the end felt like pretty healthy messages overall

for the redpilled dudes at there though for sure this will make them flip out lol",2023-07-21 14:57:26
why the downvotes,2023-07-21 20:08:39
there was a group of 20 mothers and daughters at my screening last night and the entire group was having the time of their lives sounds like the movie wasn’t for you,2023-07-23 17:15:51
"im sorry youre being downvoted 

i loved the movie but im still shocked at how much marketing they put into this movie seeing as how its one with something strange and complicated to say and with a specific way of saying it that obviously wont resonate with everyone or wont meet expectations that the marketing set up 

it just simply isnt a movie for everyone and good for you for admitting it didnt vibe with you youre not being  or an  or saying its bad or anything youre just saying it isnt for you and thats super cool if i had my way you wouldnt be downvoted and im sorry that you are",2023-07-24 05:24:10
if you scroll through this thread there are tons of men who still don’t get or understand the film,2023-07-24 13:21:55
yeah movies should be more subtle like the classics like dr strangelove  or inglorious basterds  or the land before time iii the time of the great giving  or i 3 huckabees  or avatar  or the passion of the christ  ooooo or like fight club  i like fight club,2023-07-24 14:24:08
im seeing this comment a lotare people just going into this movie with the wrong idea or something this is a slapstick comedy not some thoughtprovoking film or dramadey with a message we should all understand most of the head smacking of the theme is literally done for the laughs i mean i guess if you dont think patriarchy jokes are funny or cant see that everything is delivered with a hefty dose of tongueincheek you would feel that way,2023-07-24 14:14:54
i mean it’s because we live in an age where many people will misinterpret the point of any film they don’t get to justify their weird political vices imo it was perfectly fine the way they used the message here,2023-07-24 13:04:33
a film that bots and shills argued was great at the time but now years later all but a few zealots admit was actually dreadful ,2023-07-21 10:49:45
"yeah barbie has never had values centered around empowering women 

how dare they make a movie that makes the young girls who love their dolls also see a movie that makes them feel empowered",2023-07-22 05:53:35
is this some kind of a joke  microaggression towards men  you seem to have missed one of the major themes of the movie  one of the majorest was reminding us what misogyny and the patriarchy have actually looked like and done to women for the last oh i dunno basically ever total like bummer to have to like think about that huh upon rereading your comment it reads remarkably like wait a minute ken is that you,2023-07-22 06:13:48
did you…miss the ending of the movie,2023-07-22 22:36:59
barbie was called fascist after all,2023-07-22 22:01:03
my feelings as well they basically tokenized the kens while preaching about why that is wrong,2023-07-22 22:09:49
the movie deliberately points out that this isnt real equality and isnt good by comparing it to women in the real world this is clearly addressed and thinking its pro fascism is bending over backwards to find an issue with it it wasnt flawless but that was an absurd take,2023-07-23 01:59:54
yeah i also cried a bunch should have expected it from her other films but i was not prepared,2023-07-21 05:53:13
"i doubt you didnt get it as the movie is as subtle as a punch to the face with the social commentary

i also a man personally loved it but if you didnt im sure it wasnt because something went over your head",2023-07-23 03:51:47
if all you took away was “men bad women good” then you missed the entire point the movie highlights how we need to be more empathetic with one another in our society and that we need to listen to each others emotions to find understanding and peace,2023-07-23 04:17:21
im a husband but im also a dad to two daughters i loved this movie possibly even more than my wife and kids am i not the target audience,2023-07-23 05:32:36
stop,2023-07-21 22:36:45
its rated pg13 what did you expect,2023-07-21 15:40:39
parents should do research on a film before they take their kids to see it,2023-07-21 16:38:27
can you explain the ending it was a  moment for us,2023-07-21 16:24:14
congrats you just came up with the idea of separate but equal all by yourself,2023-07-24 22:06:38
"that just is the real world historically

i mean how on earth can you miss the point this badly",2023-07-24 20:25:57
no the movie was too complex for me to understand that basic  point,2023-07-24 21:13:24
men really cant express their views without chauvinists calling them insecure can they its such a played out trope at this point as if manhaters just cant come up with anything better its insane how you can have so many women see themselves as oppressed while simultaneously being so brashly condescending and antagonistic towards men its so inconsistent,2023-07-22 05:53:40
i’ve heard that it really failed to live up to the hype based on the expectations the marketing for it set,2023-07-21 17:53:52
snyder really lives rent free inside y’all’s heads eh like the dude was canned from dc over half a decade ago get over it,2023-07-21 14:15:24
imagine the writers room for this hey guys what jokes can we put in for our terminally online target audience of media critic losers ,2023-07-21 11:01:23
i liked it better the first time when rosamund pike was giving it in gone girl,2023-07-21 15:14:28
loved the part where everything she stated in that monologue men experience too and often in significantly worst ways but was presented as just being womens issues because apparently men just go around living grand because theyre men it really did a good job demonstrating the inherent fallacy and onesided nature of feminist extremism,2023-07-22 05:57:38
i can’t tell if you completely understood the point or if you’re clueless lol,2023-07-22 01:05:15
you mean how the kens were begging to have one supreme court justice and were declined did we watch the same movie,2023-07-22 01:30:05
when your misogyny is actually so close to the point lol,2023-07-25 13:27:36
you’re this close to getting the point,2023-07-25 13:08:22
"and ken grows to support the patriarchy because he misunderstands what it means all the while associating his own worth with who hes surrounded by and what he owns

ugh if only there werent so subtle and nuanced when speaking about the complex relationship men and women have with each other and the world theyre growing up in",2023-07-25 15:29:32
the message is that both patriarchy and matriarchy are bad tho the message is essentially about gender equality,2023-07-31 07:48:41
"what i see a lot of critical reviewers miss is that the feminist utopia of barbieland was explicitly meant to be a conception of female empowerment viewed both through a patriarchal capitalist lens mattel and a fantastical naive one young girls playing barbie it was not meant to be a literal example of what feminism should work toward 

obviously i dont speak for all  people but i felt allen was queercoded in the movie and the entire aesthetic of the film itself felt like representation again barbieland was constricted by mattels designs and if sugar daddy ken and earring magic ken had more than brief appearances they would have just contributed tired flamboyant  male stereotypes  i liked that weird barbie was the only one to express  desire for ken even though she was redeemed in the end it would have felt uncomfortable if there were homophobic undertones to the other barbies disgust toward her",2023-08-14 04:50:23
"i think you missed multiple points the movie was making the whole point was that feminism is that women are just regular people and shouldnt have to live up to the expectations the world wants of them not that they should have power above men remember when they said its barbir and its ken not its barbie and ken

the ferrera speech wasnt just her lecturing the women she was letting of steam and explaining the troubles women have in our male dominated society barbie getting a  at the end was her finaly becoming human and accepting all the nuisances that that entails on the point of  representation does barbie as a toy have that i am all for lgbtq rep but they were reflecting the real toys and their lineup",2023-08-14 05:32:17
" the notion that feminism is ‘women hold positions of power while men are inconsequential supporting characters’

thats not at all the message of the movie  in fact the movie pretty explicitly states that this dynamic is broken in the same way that the patriarchy in the real world is a broken system

the fact that you didnt get this tells me that you didnt want to get it because its impossible to miss  you just wanted an axe to grind so you misinterpreted the movie in whatever way you needed to in order to reach that conclusion  i also didnt bother reading the rest of your message since that statement alone made you not worth listening to",2023-08-14 11:36:36
"so when men dont go to see it and it makes less than estimated its bc of men quite possibly being misogynistic or sexist amirite

shouldnt  on or make light of half the population",2023-07-21 04:25:59
"2 didn’t validate men’s issues“but ken’s problems are serious too”

did we watch the same movie barbie apologizes to ken and the kens get treated with more respect with a potential for more in the future 

i liked it because it treated ken and his issues seriously and didnt just make him a big bad evil man lol",2023-07-21 02:32:48
"i didnt mind the apology from barbie to ken she did more than not like him back romantically which is not a problem and shouldnt be apologized for but she does disregard him make him feel unwanted i dont mean romantically and the whole barbie land relegate kens to inferior status while not liking him romantically she does consider ken her friend yet ditched him every night for girls night he was always an afterthought to her and she needed to apologize for that only thing id have changed is also had ken apologize for his toxicity as a nice guy and the feeling like she was his object to have i couldnt help but feel for the guy and then the next moment hed do something  like try to kiss her despite her objections and hed lose all my empathy 

the will ferrellmattell arc was pretty useless and should have just been scrapped it added nothing to the story 

i felt the gyno joke was just that she was a human and now had a  i didnt read anything else into it other than seeing it as a callback to the joke earlier in the film",2023-07-21 22:01:28
"when ken entered the real world and saw how it’s run for men i almost cried i just felt so validated

thats not how the real world operates or has ever operated so all this movie do was validate your biases and misconceptions its capitalizing on your insecurities and prejudices towards men maybe not too unlike what mattel did with barbie",2023-07-22 06:07:09
ryan gosling is so superior in this movie love his performance and song,2023-07-21 21:53:29
"i think understand what ur saying but i wouldnt blame greta or the people who worked on the film for the film having such a consumeristic marketing push

idk man at the end of the day basically all movies criticizing capitalism are hypocritical to some extent",2023-07-23 03:48:45
i felt like that was the point  one could argue its antifeminist despite that things at the end ruined it for me and i didnt like it for reasons i left a post if youre curious,2023-07-23 03:55:39
if a movie showing you the issues women face is already tiresome could you imagine how tiresome it is to be a woman and having to deal with it 247 i almost teared up at the ferreras speech because it is so accurate,2023-07-21 20:19:20
gosling was the only thing that saved the movie for me  the whole thing is kind of a mess,2023-07-21 20:07:41
to be fair it’s rated pg13,2023-07-23 10:40:44
not targeted at kids,2023-07-23 10:50:50
" i feel like mattel had a strong influence on what issues could and could not be included in this movie

what sort of thing",2023-07-22 12:16:27
isnt that inevitable when your making a movie that exists to advertise toys though i think its pure folly to try and make it super deep when its not really art its a corporate product that exists to push toys onto kids a directorwriter needs to work within that limitation which is what i think lego and mario bros movie did well  just make a fun adventure movie that includes the things people like about the product and then put a thin layer of relatable sentimentality to give it some depth,2023-07-22 13:08:33
that was the best part i couldnt stop laughing through out the whole thing,2023-07-31 00:09:06
that was my favorite part,2023-07-31 08:53:02
by far my favorite scene i couldn’t smile wide enough i loved how oldhollywood it felt it was like a scene from singing in the rain,2023-07-31 23:42:59
just because something is satire it doesn’t absolve it from criticism you can do satire badly,2023-07-21 14:02:27
satire can still be relatively subtle tbf  the parts that were on the nose werent the satirical bits for me it was more that for a film made for  marketed to a primarily adult audience some parts were written more like they were talking to children in an almost patronizingly hamfisted way i think some peoples not the  antiwoke grifters obviously problem might be more the delivery than the message cos for better or worse there was nothing particularly controversial or new in it,2023-07-21 12:32:21
the movie is careful to imply that balance is needed by showing us what happens to ken—but we have to be cognizant of the real world barbieland is a fable its unreasonable to expect a movie with a message to address everything take the message here and work it into your worldview,2023-08-05 21:35:20
men feeling put down by the movie is the point you’re being shown a matriarchal world that champions women over men in every situation where men feel disrespected ignored and worthless other than their looks no one’s saying that’s how men or anyone in the world should feel in life but it is simply allowing men after seeing the movie to get a glimpse into the emotions that women experience every day in a patriarchal society,2023-08-05 21:52:44
"i think youre missing the point that barbieland is the world of young girls imaginations as they play with their barbies the men in that world are unevolved after thoughts because young girls dont have any thoughts about men really theyre just there to be accessories for the barbies real world girls playing with their barbies only think about the lives of the women they fantasize about becoming its a matriarchy because that world was created in the minds of young girls obviously ken is upset about this even if he doesnt really know how to voice his dissatisfaction

after going to the real world however and seeing how dominant the lives of men are relative to those of women he decides thats why hes unhappy a woman actually asked him for the time and he was ecstatic so he returns to barbieworld to create the patriarchy there are no humans in the real world making this happen the kens are just trying to recreate what he saw while in la and like everything in barbieland its ridiculously exaggerated the movie is no more claiming that men all demand to be waited on by women in skimpy maid outfits than it is saying all woman are scientists presidents lawyers judges etc with barbie bodies

at the end it returns to a matriarchy not because thats better than a patriarchy but because again barbieland is the manifestation of young girls fantasies",2023-08-06 03:45:23
your post boils down to “what about men” when you can go see literally any other movie and have it end on an empowering note why can’t women have a movie that gives them that,2023-08-05 21:20:46
ken is the most complex character in this movie he is so many things during the story,2023-07-23 00:00:28
"do you know how many movies there are where characters who are women don’t have a personality or an arc and are only there to just act as a prop to a man a lot 

i’m guessing you’re a man but as a woman who has a mother i liked that sub plot and didn’t find it cringey or unrealistic 

ken had an arc 

i think this movie was just to complex for someone brainless like you",2023-07-22 23:50:20
did you manage to watch this movie and not realise that ken had a character arc they literally spell out his arc for you in the third act also ‘unethical’ ,2023-07-22 23:32:22

thats kind of the point though barbieland is basically a matriarchy so the barbies run everything and the kens and other male dolls like allen only get valued for being barbies boyfriend less attractive men are treated as invisible and unimportant like how women who are less attractive get treated in our patriarchal world,2023-07-29 23:29:24

now we have barbie amazing critical reviews an a cinemascore which is the top for any comedy movie and breaking box office records all over the world and we have reviews like these

"i think he seemed like a sweet guy that’s maybe a little corny but definitely loved by his family and there for some good jokes not manbashing just lighthearted ribbing of a kind of sweet dad cliche the women were kind of knowingly rallying together and i think that’s the more important aspect of the movie

i don’t think this was a negative portrayal it was barely anything at all and kinda seems to celebrate the relationships good fathers and husbands can have with their daughters and wives if they’re loving and supportive",2023-08-04 04:59:04
"the where did you learn to drive like that scene wasnt bashing glorias husband it was poking fun at the fact that the daughter assumes her dad was the only relationship her mother ever had as i suspect most children assume until they reach a certain age and gloria didnt want to disabuse her of that notion all parents go through a version of that conversation im sure i remember asking my mom if dad was her best friend in first grade they met after college

films have been making fun of dorky menhusbands for many years doesnt mean theyre antimen thats like saying ed helms characters wife in the hangover was overbearing and controlling therefore this movie is antiwoman",2023-08-03 20:30:44
apparently it’s her husband in real life who plays him too,2023-08-03 22:07:03
"its actually quite sweet if you ask me i think a lot of it has to do with perception a lot of men might read that as beta but i think women dont really see men through wrongly assigned wolf factions 

his not being the guy who taught gloria to drive like that is really for the daughter who in the future will likely learn about her moms past relationships and to extrapolate from the given info her husband likely knows about her exes as for the duolingo thing and him learning spanish for his wife and daughter thats just so sweet he doesnt have to they already have a shared language but he wants to and is taking the effort 

also i know they dont see him as a beta because right before the duolingo bit the kids like what about dad and theyre like  be fine his world is not going to fall apart because his wife and daughter are not around  be okay idk about you but if we had to assign beta status to any men it would be those who probably wont be able to take care of themselves assuming they are ablebodiednot suffering from any debilitating issues",2023-08-03 23:14:12
"i dont see how the film makes fun of him i think the duolingo thing is funny because its relatable to the audience either through laughing at oneself or loved ones not in a mean way but in a relatable way to me the only point the film was saying about the husband is that his role was irrelevant to the film which the film was very self aware about and that was the joke
also given the subject matter barbies dads are usually not invested in them anyways so theres that layer too",2023-08-03 18:16:17

"i dont know if its exactly the same man finding himself type of thing but 500 days of summer is often quoted as a romantic movie for guys so that would be my pick and it showcased the theme of males being confronted with unrequited love far better than barbie did 

guy here and i felt a little confused at the movie as well and my partner shared similar feelings when i explained my side to her the movie is a little selfcontradictory in several ways theres a theme of women not needing men and needing to stand on their own but barbieland is already a world where women have all the power and seemingly dont require the men that exist there i also really cringed hard at the scene on the beach which blatantly says that women should manipulate men into fighting each other which is absolutely horrible life advice in a movie about toys that influence children even if the intent was humoristic",2023-09-17 10:46:22
"the perceived misandry is the film reaching out to its male audience in a way they can empathize with at the end the kens are allowed to take lower positions of political power and can work their way up over time if thats offensive or unfair i encourage you to seriously question why

the real world is not fixed by barbieland and vice versa though both push for balance we can achieve equality but we cant fool ourselves into thinking it will be quick or straightforward",2023-07-22 21:53:31
uh the movie makes it pretty clear that what’s happening to the ken’s isn’t okay while using them as an allegory to poke fun at our own society see barbie apologizing to ken and the joke about ken’s having the same amount of power as women in our world,2023-07-22 22:07:08

dead  wrong this movie is absolutely for men as much as it is for women the world is filled with kens but its also filled with allens you dont need to be a woman to feel that our patriarchal society has winners and losers most women lose out in our patriarchal society but plenty of men are losing too especially young men that arent necessarily drawn to the gendered roles our society deems are a proper fit for men",2023-07-23 18:25:08

speak for yourself im a guy and i enjoyed the  out of this movie it was fun witty visually captivating and surpisingly philosophical i know plenty of other manly dudes who saw this and ended up loving it its a movie for everyone just because theres a feminist message doesnt mean its only for women lol",2023-07-23 19:18:12

agreed this isnt for us most things are so let the women have their fun and they still carved out a positive message for men by the end of it,2023-07-23 18:25:12

that is some powerful energy youve got there  what if this film actually did what was intended and angered you made you stand up and say that is not fair

while we all have different beliefs i doubt you’ll find many racial minorities that feel particularly hurt because a doll is both popular and white certainly never bothered me

so whatever mattel does is wrong do you think barbie creator ruth had in mind the girls of africa and asia and europe when she made a doll or did she create a doll with her childhood memories and families and friends in mind if nigeria created a toy that is famous worldwide and loved by all then i dont think it would be right for white girls in america to complain and be woke about any of that,2023-08-01 13:10:26
i think the barbieland being still barbieland is kinda meant to represent how long it took for women to have that kind of say in the real world even if the dolls arent meant to be represented as real world people they still do have some of the real world themes so those aspects will remain but i agree this movie was moreover harmful overall towards feminism as it is not very middle groundlike overall i think the films message is already muddled however and they felt adding intersectionality would make it worse but thats just the film having its issues and it was important,2023-08-01 12:47:28

it wasn’t his fault he was attracted to her while she didn’t have any interest in ken which is the default setting because barbie is a selfmade independent woman he’s on the other hand is her toy accessory like a dog or a house this makes her kinda responsible for him and her not loving him kinda hurts his feelings,2023-07-22 18:04:58

because no woman does but for barbie it is a new adventure,2023-07-21 18:12:14
i think to simplify it down without going into detail on a lot of the more nuanced bits would be to say that it shows how the patriarchy harms everyone it focuses on how it harms women because of course it would this is a movie made for women by women however at the same time it also shows how it harms men as well mostly around the ken battle and after its not saying men are inherently bad or evil but it does show how the patriarchy disproportionately affects women and encourages bad behavior among men while simultaneously harming them in other ways,2023-07-24 09:22:40
weird barbie did splits multiple times sometimes they were up the wall in her house so maybe that’s why you missed it,2023-07-26 14:21:15
"to answer your first question no i think that line made perfect sense in the context of the film and in the spirit of its selfawareness   


for one stereotypical barbie is pretty much the textbook example of a white feminist she thinks her brand of feminism has saved the world and fixed all problems with equality she’s blissfully unaware that early and mainstream feminism only helped people who look like her that’s why it takes two women dealing with intersecting identities of being latino and a women in the real world to shatter barbie’s lipstick feminist fantasy   


so it makes sense that a young teen bitterly aware of and learning to live in those dynamics would be the one to deliver that line it’s on brand with the speech she delivered in the cafeteria too   


also i don’t think gerwig being white is a fair critique of using that line i’m white and was absolutely aware of that concept and others like it before watching the movie not all of us are living in barbieland plus being white is probably made it more necessary to include that line if she didn’t people would be criticizing her perpetuating the white savior trope instead of being aware of it",2023-07-26 17:51:34

"the movie was very tongue in cheek about a lot of the subject matters though and im sad that you came to the conclusions that you did about it

the whole point of the film is how men are terrible sexist creatures that have ruined society

the point is that toxic partriarchy is bad for both sexes though the martriarchy in barbieland is not supposed to be portrayed as better but only a reflection of the partriachy if not they wouldnt have inserted the obvious equal but not really equal line the president barbie made at the end yeah its a sign of progress but is it a fair and equal move i think we can all see the tone it was trying to portray

what’s so terrible about cellulite why do women have to be amazing at all times

but thats barbie entire storyline and that at the end she doesnt want to be chasing the amazing but unachievable ideal barbie represents but embrace the imperfectness a woman has instead cellulite included had barbie stayed in her perfect world then yes the message of the movie would fall flat but that wasnt the case

yes womens place in society has been better but the fact that you are supposed to feel upset at the line men in barbieland has as much power as women in the real world is exactly the point the movie is trying to deliver

that just my takes on the movie but i respect your takes its completely possible that the movie just isnt there yet to deliver its message movies are also subjective to viewers own personal experiences anyways

it also feels that the parts that aren’t filled with overly politicized feminism were replaced by those dumb dance numbers and horribly  “beach war” scene

ok now this is a bad take and i have to disagree with your personal taste the dance numbers and beach war were awesome ok",2023-07-31 06:46:05

"the message seems to be women prefer living in a fake made up fantasy land where somehow all of their needs are met and there is never any need for anybody to put effort towards anything ever

that would be a bad message good thing it’s not the message

ken makes only the most minor effort to introduce the concept of logic to this world and immediately takes the entire place over not only does he become the ruler of the entire world but the people he is ruling over seem to be happy about it

they clearly explain this in the movie barbies aren’t people they’re ideas when a new idea is introduced to barbieland the barbies immediately absorb it and start acting accordingly so when ken introduces the idea of patriarchy and men ruling over women not … logic they all go along with it as the human mom says they’re like the natives with smallpox they have no natural defense against harmful concepts because barbieland is a paradise where everything is perfect when she gives the barbies contradicting ideas they snap out of it",2023-07-28 01:24:41

"to be fair from one perspective it can look that way but i do think that the movie critiques patriarchy as a whole rather than men 

men feel as empty in the system as women do is it problematic that they have more power opportunities favour ability to succeed grace etc yes and the film addresses this wonderfully through america ferreras speech to the barbies ken might seem left without a resolution and so you have barbies insistence that he figure out who he is outside of her his shirt i am kenough speaks to this journey the movie is poking fun at stereotypical masculinity not men themselves so many feel unheard and unseen we just see this through the lens of humor 

the target audience is women but this is not just a movie for women its for men too those who never got the chance to claim empathy and compassion as their own barbieswomen being the best thing on earth is also tongueincheek the pinkfilled constitution signing is supposed to be missing something and we do see the characters and story recognize that a simple reversal of reality and power is not enough or good

"the matrix and titanic are certainly not the movies i would think would have the “best” reviews on letterboxd but they’re certainly good examples of the type of movie barbie is right now and the cultural moment regardless of how “good” barbie may or not be it has created an experience where people feel like they are participating in something and there is a lot of enthusiasm and love for it beyond its objective filmmaking quality this same thing happened to titanic and the matrix two movies that are far from perfect but created a fervor

most people do no have positions “on the culture war spectrum” most people have values and interests that and barbie is honestly pretty middle of the road when it comes to these things the letterboxd reviews are not the product of liveral groupthink 

i think this movie knows who its target audience is a pretty lame term that’s for marketing firms not film makers or “critics” it’s lame the target audience is everybody it’s very broad 

it may turn of people who can’t handle the idea that a man is the butt of a few jokes but that’s okay and some people simply may not think it’s very funny but there are people who legitimately love this movie and it has nothing to do with this “culture war”",2023-08-05 12:39:36

" i know were probably not the target audience of this film

i think that you might have missed that people our age absolutely are the target audience for the film  the film goes out of its way to make that point by having barbie initially believe that its the young girl who is having thoughts of death selfdoubt etc  in reality the kids got it together and is already a strong feminist while it is the adult who is having the existential crisis

if adults werent the target audience of the film they definitely wouldnt have put that fbomb in there or the beating off scene",2023-07-24 14:13:47
i disagree i think both barbie and oppenheimr are 35 or 45 not great but not bad either the problem about barbie is its not made for kids and it was too upfront to the political ideology it is pushing but then destroy itself in its own logic but it was well made from a technical perspective like nolans the issue i have from nolans is that there are several historical themes that i wished were explored i hate that half of it devolves to a strauss vs oppenheimer film when oppenheimers life is more than that,2023-07-24 14:15:13
thank you  i feel like im the only one who felt this movie was one of the absolute worst  there was a packed group of us in that theater including adults and kids and no one laughed  ironically the power went out about halfway through and some people left  i stayed thinking the movie would improve and it didnt,2023-07-24 14:01:51

ive heard a lot of people trashing it for being lgbtq feminist propaganda but there was not a single trans or homosexual character however there was a  woman and someone in a wheelchair but i cant imagine someone seriously getting offended by that and the movie seemed to touch more on mens issues than womens issues to be honest if youre familiar with ludwig holberg i think youll find the message very comparable to what you would be able to derive from niels klims underground travels and his encounters in the matriarchal world of potu",2023-08-03 23:58:27

"the hatred shown to barbie is actually specifically what resonated with me the most as a girl who grew up playing with her lol

the target audience for this movie was absolutely those little girls in the beginning who were excited and inspired at first by a doll who wasnt a baby enforcing gender rules about softness and motherhood we then grew up into teens who chafed at the gender roles she did enforce the pink and the thinness and the makeup and sexless heteronormativity and then we became adults and moms and career women who were able to look back with mixed feelings to appreciate the good and the bad of what barbie represented for us our own flawed ideas of womanhood that we reshaped as we aged

theres a reason they made a point to have that scene of barbie complimenting the old woman and her replying i know it while the younger real women of the movie and barbie herself get caught on the idea of pretty and struggle its a common journey for women and our selfimage

definitely a bittersweet message rather than a fun one i can see why it doesnt play well outside that specific perspective",2023-07-22 22:08:18

i agree the commentary felt like it was being pushed down my throat and just made the movie boring the whole ‘real world’ was still a caricature of itself which ends up contradicting the ending of her wanting to be human the only times where we see a normal world is when she closes her eyes and imagines the world which doesn’t make sense its sad really because i agree with the  ideologically but the message felt forced and tacky if the writing was made to be fun and entertaining they should have made the message more subtle i feel like the message would have hit harder that way overall very disappointing film,2023-07-26 04:07:04

ok,2023-07-28 01:36:49
wut,2023-07-28 22:04:10
i think barbies apology to ken was the realworld apology that a woman who has been kept down from her potential her whole life will never get ken needed to get that because barbie was doing him wrong,2023-07-28 23:18:54
its meant for everyone who enjoys it  are you on about,2023-08-01 20:38:05
her lifestyle of being a plastic doll did you stuff your ears with wax while watching the movie,2023-08-14 23:17:46

i think it has more to do with the fact that recently some dudes really really cared about how important and good the zach snyder cut was and some of their partners found themselves needing to feign interest in this fact when really they dont really care insert bro explaining meme here not an indictment of auteur films in general,2023-08-04 00:21:32
it was a kinda lame joke but not everything is offensive,2023-08-03 23:55:59
"yes the men were dumb but you have to keep in mind that the majority of them were kens the irony that its pointing out is that for all of the  barbie dolls used to get ken is just as if not even more shallower 

he gets nothing he has nothing no job no personality no existence except to be barbies not really boyfriend the fight sequence was hilarious not because men are  but because these are the only things ken ever gets tennis racquets rollerblades and maybe a surfboard thats the irony hes the one who needs cheering up

now as for will farell and the mattel board yeah thats just there to be silly and funny and make the point that this character thats supposedly an inspiration for women has been controlled by men for most of her existence i think they did that because people would be  if they went too easy on mattel but they couldnt directly criticize them too much",2023-07-23 15:56:04
"i think youre missing the point if you think this movie was calling all men dumb or saying their interests are dumb it was mocking toxic masculinity and the ideal that men have to act a certain way to be manly which is what the kens did with their newfound knowledge of patriarchy however the kens arent meant to be evil villains they are just misguided 

all of the characters in this movie are complex and there arent really good guys or bad guys the barbies and kens are both very shallow and clueless at first and their society is very warped the movie is basically about what happens when the ideal barbie land gets unexpectedly mixed with the harsh realities of the actual world 

sure it pokes fun at some standard  guy stereotypes like the classic white guy with a guitar or condescending over explanation of movies or finance but it never says the things the kens enjoy are dumb or wrong what was wrong was the fact that ken with his newfound ideals decided to oppress the barbies instead of forming his own identity which is actually something that happens in the real world oppressed groups who suddenly find a lot of power become the oppressors in the end barbie helps ken realize he can be himself and his identity doesnt have to resolve around her or whatever toxic masculinity decides he should act like the kens should just be themselves",2023-07-23 15:24:12

she went to the gynae at a random point in time that you are not aware of  good have been straight away or after but lets be honest if you suddenly had a new   you had never seen or experienced you probably would want to talk to someone about it

but all in all it was mostly the kind of movie i was expecting where they leaned into the ridiculousness of barbie and played with it  it was never going to be a childrens movie",2023-07-22 13:16:48
the whole bit of the movie was about them not having genitals now that shes a human she has a  this entire movie is about the woman experience if you dont get that thats okay but dont confuse your ignorance as a bad movie,2023-07-22 13:17:11
"i dont hate what you said because i have some of those same questions i love movies that make me think and question but i think that a lot of people dont really want that in a moviewatching experience 

x200b

now for funsies

how did this get made  i found out that margot robie approached greta gerwig love it ive never been a margot robie fan but now she has my interest   
  
what the actual   i asked myself this when i first found out that gerwig was directing a barbie movie then i got excited  
  
who greenlit this  probably my biggest question i would like to give this person a high five finally a summer blockbuster that has nuance and style im not a superhero movie fan and i finally feel included in the hype  
  
will all barbies come with vaginas now  lol this is clearly a joke havent we all thought at one point or another how funny it is that dolls dont have genitalia  
  
did she have to go to a gynecologist at the end she couldnt have gotten a job as head of mattel her first priority was her    this is probably the most interesting question my interpretation being a human is not like being a barbie its not a beach party every day things arent perfect going to the gyno is a human woman experience not the barbie experience getting a job as a mattel executive is the barbie experience most adult american women go to the gyno hardly any are executives   
  
what was even the point of the husband  no idea probably one of the only parts of the film that didnt really jive with me  
  
this was by far the most rampantly sexist movie i have ever seen  i dont feel that way and im confused by this interpretation i assume it is because the kens werent immediately given high ranking jobs at the end of the movie feels kind of like men dont really like that idea and they shouldnt another reddit poster said that it was just the movie holding up the mirror and i thought that was a great way of putting it   
  
allen just straight up murdered a man  lol did i miss something ill have to watch again because i think that i missed something",2023-07-22 14:34:32
this is so obviously not written by an american that i cant decide if its satire about russian bots or an actual russian bot,2023-07-23 02:06:00
"think of it more like barbieland is a reflection of the real world  so yes kens were being taken advantage of but in the real world women are taken advantage of  

this wasnt a story where barbieland brings equality its where barbieland is reflected with the real world

edit which is how i took it",2023-07-29 23:02:13
seems like that was mostly teens who were caught up in the overblown promises of a twitch streamer it’s dumb for sure but i’m not sure it’s a product of the patriarchy and i’m sure teen girls are just as brainwashed by online personalities though they may not be quite as stupidly destructive,2023-08-05 12:49:42
what,2023-08-05 15:26:12

it was really bad people who love the message are overlooking how badly written it was,2023-07-30 03:17:31
it was a good movie it had a good message i think you just missed the point,2023-07-23 05:08:25
"pc bandwagon that’s a self report if i’ve ever heard one

there’s no bandwagon just people who aren’t ",2023-07-23 05:10:32
you sound radicalized and extreme,2023-07-29 22:36:42
pretty  wild how you can get the entire point of the movie so incredibly wrong and be confident enough to put that opinion online,2023-07-29 15:53:32
lol what the  you got some problems there,2023-07-29 15:53:08
you sound like fun,2023-07-29 17:51:16
the first 2 paragraphs you had a point and then you just fell downhill from there,2023-07-30 02:07:21
"i kind of disagree that the movie was misandrist if it were misandrist the whole plot would be about destroying all kens or dismantling patriarchy instead it focused on the identity of barbiethe identity of women in society 

glorias the mom whole speal on how hard and contradictory it is to be a woman sashas reason for hating barbie because it sets unrealistic standards for women and the comment from both kens and barbies that its hard to be in charge go through changes and be human everyone got a bit of a win barbie doesnt have to be perfect ken doesnt have to be barbies accessory

i agree that it was a bit of a mess really but yeah if it were bigoted it would have had a clearer message about hate",2023-07-21 23:53:10
bro did not understand the film,2023-07-21 23:35:12
"yea when barbie validated ken’s emotions it really drove home the point that “men are ”

some of y’all really can’t process anything out of your comfort zone without internalizing it as a threat huh",2023-07-23 19:30:10
kate mckinnon was one of the best things about the movie,2023-07-23 21:08:24
im a guy and went with a mixed group of guys and girls we all came out of the movie loving it and keen to see it again there doesnt have to be such a divide in how you see the movie depending on your ,2023-07-21 23:58:53
as a guy how the  was it antagonising i feel like the way the kens were portrayed as oppressed and disrespected in their own reality was the opposite of that,2023-07-22 00:02:33
the movie was antitoxic not antimen the whole being a woman monologue was also taking potshots at toxic feminism and kens arc was failing to understand that being a toxic man doesnt guarantee happiness or everything you want the whole message is about not being who society thinks you should be,2023-07-21 22:46:55
how did this film disrespect kubrick are you referring to the parody in the opening scene,2023-07-21 22:59:43
i dunno id consider myself to be pretty stereotypically masculine generally speaking i came out of the movie feeling great most of the stabs against masculinity were genuine and in a weird way it made me feel empowered as a man too not sure if that was their intention though ,2023-07-21 23:16:11
i’m very curious as to what you took as the movies overall message,2023-07-23 19:07:02
"feminism took place already in the late 60s

what",2023-08-02 16:01:28
yeah tell that to women when they complain about a movie in which their entire gender are portrayed as idiots and see how it goes down,2023-07-26 04:17:27
its not anti men its pro equality its just that in the fantasy world of barbie land they can only have equality if its achieved in the mirror image of the real world once women can be the president and be ceo and make up the majority of the supreme court the kens will do this too eventually there will be equality in both worlds its just its taking time margot was fantastic as was gosling,2023-07-25 20:30:25
shut up til you see it stop taking opinions from the media and formulate your own,2023-07-22 03:16:11
i mean it was clearly tongue in cheek barbie has always been saddled with the stigma that its vapid and the intention was to illustrate many stereotypically male fixations are equally so,2023-07-26 01:52:34
"rbg

you thought that barbie was a documentary on ruth bader ginsburg

i’m very confused with your takeaway",2023-08-02 12:22:42
"i dont know why you were downvoted

from a movie point of view its a bad movie the whole movie is overly political

was it good for the first 10 minutes yeah the decor and clothing are good sure theres some enjoyable dancing some popular actorsbut other than that there isnt much of an interesting story

when you filter out all the endless talk about patriarchy matriarchy and equality nothing is left because thats the only thing the movie focuses on

and the jokes arent really funny either maybe my taste doesnt match the humor who knows

my friends and i have never had such a strong desire to leave the movie theater watching it on the big screen also feels unnecessary with no impressive onscreen visuals or cinemaworthy sound design

the films target group isnt children either but as an adult do you also have a sense of being out of the target zone

overall a bad movie 410 at most

btw the credit song was horrendous",2023-08-23 09:05:25
did you miss the whole point of “where do kens live plot”,2023-08-06 08:20:40
" how is it harmful “at best” what’s the worst case scenario if the best case is that it’s harmful to children

talk about propaganda lol your eggs have been scrambled",2023-08-06 02:58:21
it’s hilarious and tragic to me that you think that was extreme feminist propaganda,2023-08-06 17:27:41
"“extreme” hahahahahaha

what on earth is extreme about it 

what positive message could you have possibly been hoping to find in a barbie movie if you thought this one in particular was extreme",2023-08-06 03:20:15
what possible positive message could a barbie movie have that was not feminist clothes are fun they are fun but you cant make a movie out of that,2023-08-06 13:30:57

went awry there in the end but your point about layers is true i’ve noticed many movies they maybe add a small plot to try and cover maybe controversial topics or mostly just mature topics many movies have done this for the longest time… but if it isn’t good then it isn’t good it still has to be written right which i just don’t think it was,2023-07-22 04:51:30

wasnt that meant to poke fun at people who say that,2023-07-23 05:02:27
as someone has mentioned in this thread its just a joke about people grasping at straws to convey they are inclusive and openminded,2023-07-23 06:26:53

the glasses scene was absolutely a satire of that,2023-08-02 22:08:49
if i were going to attempt to engage with your ranting in good faith i would point out that the movie went out of its way to point out that it’s okay for women to stay at home or do whatever they want as long as it‘a true to themselves but i think you just hate women and don’t care so,2023-07-22 01:26:28

if you found it sexist you missed the point of the movie any line that seemed sexist toward men was meant to display the sexism that women feel barbie world was made to display reverse rolls of men and women i said this in another comment but one of the scenes said that “ken’s mood that day depends on if barbie says hi to him” and i saw that as a parallel to how some men act  as if women think need validation from them i could go on,2023-08-04 00:34:24

also barbie has always represented the aspirations of young girls always from conception strong women became astronauts at a time where men were doing everything they could to keep them out of that space pun intended and barbie was an astronaut did barbie the doll inspire anyone to be an astronaut maybe not me personally but its a big world and probably theres someone out there who was inspired to follow a path because of barbie but thats not quite what it means it means that barbie the doll offered options when noone else did it means that barbie the doll assumed that women could fill any role a man can and sold millions of products as a result it filled a space in the market by offering an alternative that was previously unavailable and showed the world that there was in fact a demand for toys that didnt restrict little girls to playing house 

also if you consider a world dominated by one type of person will always hurt the people who are not that type of person pushing an agenda you really need to sit alone with yourself and work out why because thats so much paranoia its legitimately concerning ",2023-08-09 08:12:47

however i would say that most of this stuff would fly over a young childs head barbie is never framed as a  object theres like one shower scene but shes very well covered benefit of having a female director no male gaze for the cinematography and female agency is a very important theme of the film the romance elements in the film are very sterile and immature a childs idea of romance entirely devoid of sexuality",2023-07-21 06:25:01

i played a lot of street fighter fatal fury and mortal kombat trying to get better than my brother lol",2023-08-01 23:58:20
barbies still barely a baby step in a better direction though instead of lets train girls to take care of babies its lets train girls to fit into the roles we want them to be able to occupy in society this movie made me realize how stifling our culture is when it comes to childrens toys as a boy i never felt like my toys were being used to teach me what person i could be i just played with the  i thought was fun i never fully realized it wasnt the same for girls,2023-10-25 04:13:33
i mean that opening monologue then went on to say that barbie had caused total equality and made the world a perfect place so i dont think it was trying to be entirely inline with reality,2023-07-29 21:13:29
though i’m sure boys think this way too you have to get a wife and have a family i think it’s just how kids think but idk maybe that’s a flaw in my brain i thought i would have to be a mom at some point too but i sure as  didn’t practice or care about babies i just thought maybe one day i would ,2023-08-03 23:44:23
oh i meant more like the reason for the doll but you are absolutely right,2023-07-22 07:54:15
"dolls werent mass produced but theyve been made out of sticks and reeds since the dawn of human time lol as fully alluded to with the 2001 sequence

technically not true

theres nothing technical about that literally no way to prove or disprove such a vague statement",2023-07-22 08:34:51
"yeah that line felt like mattel tooting their own horn look guys there was never any adult dolls before barbie arent we such a progressive company

then again the rest of the narration goes on to say that barbies creation solved sexism and all women are happy and powerful so i guess that was part of the joke the entire narration was exaggerating barbies achievements",2023-08-01 05:05:36
yeah but those dolls were still suggesting that  a womans role in life was to take care of a home and be a mother barbie allowed girls at the time to dream about more than being somebodys wife and somebodys mother,2023-07-23 21:59:28
beat me to it ken,2023-07-22 02:38:31
thanks ken,2023-07-22 03:04:19

i just placed my order thank you,2023-08-05 23:13:50
many thanks ken,2023-08-11 09:41:56
they all beached each other off so hard in that scene,2023-07-21 21:38:52
they have it officially but it’s sold out right now sadly,2023-07-21 21:35:59
the sheer cartoonish absurdity of their lines made the suits work so much better than they should have,2023-07-28 17:18:26
i think most of the dance scenes were a reference to grease,2023-07-22 20:13:34
actually he was quickly in that snippet of grease that ken saw in the real world montage yeah,2023-07-23 05:22:57
i would have died,2023-07-23 05:22:23
"i always joke with my wife that if it werent for women pressuring us to succeed or demanding things of us men would all just get along and have no ambitions whatsoever and there would be no wars

a quick trip to your nearest gayborhood would disabuse you of that notion very quickly ",2023-07-29 22:20:53
i was too young to see hangover in the theater but that is a great comedy not a big team american fan though personally,2023-07-30 20:13:14
"“there’s something about this ken that really i think relates to that version of myself just like the guy that was putting on hammer pants and dancing at the mall and smelling like drakkar noir and aqua neting bangs i owe that kid a lot i feel like i was very quick to distance myself from him when i started making more serious films but the reality is that like he’s the reason i have everything i have”

“i really had to go back and touch base with that little dude” gosling says “and say thank you and ask for his help”

for real i think it did this whole article is great",2023-07-22 01:33:40
that musical number will be rewatched by me at least a billion times before my dying day this was like a career best gosling performance for me like star making and he’s already given great performances but he went from an actor i appreciate but not obsessed with like so many usually straight men consider him to be but the oscar hype is legit,2023-07-22 08:48:49
i think the cut to him wearing that sweatshirt may have been my favorite jokegag,2023-07-22 04:26:33
"i did d

ryan gosling is ken",2023-07-22 23:15:18
i laughed so hard at the  absurdity of bringing a drum kit to the beach but sadly it wasnt continued if a guy had a piano i would have literally died on the cinema,2023-07-26 06:50:40
"as a dude who has played a guitar for a girl

played guitar at a girl you mean

my wife stared holes through me when they kensplained godfather to one of the barbies",2023-07-21 23:13:24
as a white dude whos been learning spanish on duolingo i was cackling at the one or two moments with the dad,2023-07-23 04:27:18
i just started learning guitar this year and have been practising in front of friends quite often when that scene came on the entire group turned and stared daggers at me hahaha,2023-07-21 23:44:47
i leaned to my girlfriend and said “she’s gonna compliment one of the other kens performances of the song better that would cause instant animosity between any men” they nailed it  for all the jokes in the movie it really was an impressive critique of gender norms and i was all for it,2023-07-26 23:07:15
i was absolutely called out on the “i can show how it’s done” montage definitely used that on a date shooting archery,2023-07-23 04:14:00
i am the the godfather guy definite sideeye from my partner at that scene,2023-07-24 10:12:28
it’s ok ken,2023-07-22 13:32:21
have you seen the comedy masterpiece just friends it’s a plot point and is freakin hilarious,2023-08-01 07:07:48
i felt the same way when one of the kens is explaining godfather thinking back on it i did this to my gf ,2023-07-26 17:30:13
same my wife was laughing so hard about that because i have played guitar for her a zillion times,2023-07-27 04:17:36
theres a scene in euphoria where dominic fike plays and sings at the two lead girls for more than four minutes straight after 30 seconds it was like satire,2023-09-13 23:14:20
"my brother in law hated this movie and id never seen it nor did he really tell me why

i watched it tonight now i get why he hated it haha",2023-12-17 07:54:22
literally one reason i fell in love with my husband was he never tried to play guitar at me while we were dating,2023-12-23 19:31:23
what man hasn’t learned guitar and then played to a girl all to impress her,2023-07-22 17:24:25
i hope they make a matchbox movie and explain that it’s the boys’ side of the barbieland universe maybe do a lil crossover event,2023-07-25 19:35:53
it was very clearly a greta gerwig movie but i thought more accessible than her other works have been hopefully people check out stuff like lady bird and little women,2023-07-25 19:32:41
that was the only part of the movie i felt was completely unneeded but i’m glad it was well received by other people,2023-07-23 02:41:51
"i was eyesshutcrylaughing during the ken dance number and it was like noooooo pause the movie 

def gotta see it again",2023-07-22 05:15:19
"literally
i just saw and the entire threater was cackling so hard i was in tears",2023-07-23 00:57:57
besides the dark colors and subject matter i found oppenheimer really hard to watchfollow due to its constant jumping between events watching barbie afterwards with its coherent plotline was like a soothing cocktail for the brain,2023-07-23 03:17:11
"i like both movies barbenheimer has won cinema has won cinephiles had won

this official one even looks like a knockoff the text was way bigger and lower on goslings,2023-07-25 19:21:19
knockoffs on amazon better be careful barbie is known to be cutthroat when it comes to their trademark,2023-07-25 12:00:04

great theory its really impossible to make her not pretty shes even prettier with no makeup lol,2023-07-24 03:57:14
exactly what i thought probably added after doing some focus group testing and the audience not buying that scene due to barbie looking flawless still lol,2023-07-24 05:23:55
yeah they just stumbled upon how good margot robbie looks,2023-07-25 00:42:27
probably gerwings too  smart for that to be a coincidence,2023-07-24 04:54:41
i believe margot is an executive producer and hired greta to write the movie with the knowledge that margo was playing barbie greta is such an incredible writer i see this as something planned before hand  especially because the shot stayed on her a little longer to accommodate the 4th wall break but also could totally be unplanned and also why greta is a  genius,2023-08-06 03:38:16
the barbies consider anyone who isnt absolutely perfect to be  weird barbie looks just as attractive but her clothes are mismatched her hair is a mess and shes covered in scribbles which makes her hideous in comparison,2023-07-31 13:49:24
apparently greta is somewhat of a script loyalist so thatd be too funny,2023-07-24 13:43:24
i didn’t put this together at the time but makes sense when she’s showing off her flat feet to the girls her hair was just so noticeably off that i was confused why it had passed everyone… but this is why,2023-07-27 03:10:48
i was wondering if i imagined that but by the end of the movie i noticed that her skin wasnt perfectly concealed like you could see freckles on the front of her neck and all i thought that was a nice touch i didnt think of it the way you did but actually thats a really smart take i think i only noticed it when she was considering becoming human so i thought it was related to that,2023-07-31 00:35:20
i have a strong feeling it’s cleverly planned they could have tried to make her way “uglier” but instead they opted to just make her a little dishevelled because they knew even if they did more it wouldn’t convince us margot was ,2023-08-16 03:35:02
sorry to necrocomment but i think it also speaks to how conventionally attractive womens mental health can be dismissed why do you care so much about how you look youre gorgeous but regardless of how attractive someone is everyone struggles with selfimage and societys idealised vision of what beauty looks like arguably for women who are considered attractive this comes down harder because they are more scrutinised objectified and has so much of their societal worth tied up in their image so while it was a funny joke i think it does speak to real mental health issues re societal expectation and selfimage,2023-09-04 11:58:01

,2023-08-23 04:59:53
its okay well get that fourth wall back up and operational as soon as the kens figure out how to build it sideways and not just up,2023-07-21 15:15:16
4th wall break implying the movie built a 4th wall in the first place ,2023-07-21 23:10:18

how did you manage to get it exactly backwards,2023-07-22 20:13:16
i have to assume ken was devastated by the iconic horse scene,2023-07-22 01:54:07
i don’t know if i’ve ever felt so attacked as i did when stephen malkmus came up this movie had me dead to rights,2023-07-22 04:35:24
i wonder if that scene was parodying this subreddit ,2023-07-23 07:26:29
my wife punched me at the scene because i made her watch the godfather when we had first started dating  i didnt mansplain it to her though,2023-07-23 01:34:04
fwiw i feel like the way she said it in the interview she was intentionally quoting the scene from the movie rather than the other way around,2023-07-24 08:09:10
there was also one scene where a dj ken was telling a barbie about the postpunkpunk origins of synthpop which is very accurate as new wave has the same origins,2023-07-27 00:02:31

same i would have been obsessed irl,2023-07-21 16:24:03
i would’ve liked to see more funny encounters of them in the real world less mattel executives,2023-07-24 01:17:04
that was funny to me because i been to venice a fair amount and i’ve seen people wear weirder stuff than that of course you’ll get some people laughing but i don’t think it would be as bad as that,2023-07-26 21:22:24
i don’t know i feel like if margot robbie and ryan gosling were rollerblading on venice beach a lot of people would be staring at them,2023-07-23 20:59:08
“i’m definitely feeling an undercurrent of violence”,2023-07-27 12:29:06
as a  man i would probably have reacted the exact same way if i saw ryan gosling rollerblade past me like that,2023-08-09 18:19:29
i felt like that was a great theme about how patriarchy affects men too ken was a perfectly fine guy who lacked a sense of selfidentity and the second he encounters strong male role models he gets way into the toxic masculine rabbit hole similarly to how many young impressionable men start watching andrew tate and these altright influences and get a terrible idea of what it means to be a man it’s weird growing up for anyone and forming an identity in society there’s so many good and bad images from barbie to john wayne that people model themselves after for better or worse,2023-07-23 04:30:48
"yes like barbie was supposed to be this thing free from all the confines of “the real world” she could have a job own a house do whatever she wants girls can imagine anything with barbie and yet… it’s still not good enough 

and i’m not saying that the barbie doll and brand is above criticism or change i think one of the driving points in the movie is that “stereotypical barbie” doesn’t want change so she tries to avoid it instead of seeing how to grow in positive ways so change is good exploring and being curious is good but the ripping apart of something like a doll or just ignoring the problems and calling it “taking back agency” isn’t right either",2023-07-25 02:30:07
one doesnt need to be a victim to make a point,2023-07-21 12:34:26
one part that i liked is that mattel while clearly advertising their own product still recognized the damage barbie could do on an impressionable girl sure it’s their own movie but they didn’t beach themselves off the whole time,2023-07-22 07:36:23
theyre flying off the shelves,2023-07-21 15:12:17
i dont think its about repetition i think its about coolness ken gave his house that name because it sounds cool have you seen the dumb things men dowear or name things when society isnt around im positive he thought that double sunglassesmany watches mojo dojo casa house etc are all cooler,2023-07-31 09:49:39
the watches were probably because of that woman in the real world who asked him for the time it’s a symbol of the first time he ever felt respected,2023-07-25 19:41:00
in an interview he did he said he tried out a few random wordsphrases and that stuck,2023-07-21 06:58:00
i was also the only person who cackled at this in my theater we just have a special sense of humor i guess friend xd,2023-07-23 00:46:44
i dont remember the dialogue right before but its near the end and barbie says something that makes ken happy and hes like one moment please and just awkwardly walks around the corner to hide and a second or two later all you here is him say sublime and then he walks back like nothing happened,2023-07-22 00:36:29
no it was just a really random word for a ken to use that’s why it was funny,2023-07-23 01:38:10
this makes me so happy to hear i was laughing so hard and at this part especially i lost my mind but it was like dead quiet in the theater except for my partner i felt so bad for laughing so hard feel like i interrupted something ,2023-08-07 02:14:54
i thought it was really special that it was the hari nef barbie in that scene too i hope gerwig did that on purpose but i found it meaningful either way,2023-07-26 01:46:11
"i went with a friend of mine and after that she laughed and audibly rolled her eyes going oh  so true i could feel how she felt about that one

cringe af and my boyfriend was ",2023-10-10 02:29:54
dude the entire godfather distraction scene was especially hilarious because that’s literally been me that was practically a shot for shot recreation of what it’s like when a cute girl tells me she hasn’t seen a really good movie and i am just ready to show it to her while telling her random tidbits all throughout they got my kenergy down pat,2023-07-21 09:43:22
"they truly dont its even in the movie  the ceo says that ordinary barbie is a terrible idea another exec says it will make money the ceo is instantly on board

theres also a scene where an exec says that kens who took over barbieland now sell just as well as barbies did so maybe they dont have to intervene the ceo brushes that off saying something about the importance of the girls dreams i took that as an implication that the ceo might be afraid of ruth handlers ghost who resides in the building",2023-07-22 03:18:34

capital has the remarkable yet frustrating ability to subsume all critiques into itself,2023-07-24 07:12:22
agreed especially because they kept making jokes about how the casa house and the mediocre doll would make money,2023-07-30 14:21:30
capitalism loves nothing more than to criticize itself especially because it makes money,2023-07-22 08:59:59

"what impresses me is that a company is aware enough to pull it off most companies would be too scared to be shed in a bad light but mattel was smart enough to pull the anticapitalist capitalist 

not sure how to feel about it but i did love the movie",2023-07-24 06:56:59
yea dirtiest part of modern democratic party  they are all capitalists pretending to care about what a liberal does  same for the other side  its always capitalism  the ways they manipulate change but its always there  painful to see as an adult the kind of things you buy into when your younger and dont know better,2023-07-21 20:42:16
righteous indignation dollar that’s a big dollar a lot of people are feeling that indignation,2023-07-24 01:30:24
but you really wouldnt know about the anti capitalist sentiment until youve seen the movie its not exactly a selling point in the trailers,2023-08-02 16:51:19
"the barbies were rescued by having a character preach on screen about the contradictions inherent in patriarchy 

it was a fine movie but thats literally preaching feminist philosophy",2023-08-08 14:56:45
that wasn’t her daughter on the bus bench,2023-07-22 05:10:17
when barbie said youre beautiful to the bus stop lady i definitely felt my throat hitch and my eyes dampen,2023-07-21 22:26:19
was so sweet followed by her quip “i know it”,2023-07-21 22:39:24
correct tbh the scene kind of gave off a cameo vibe so that’s why i didn’t question it,2023-07-22 06:38:48
yes because corporations are known for their transparency and spending lots of marketing dollars with no regard for roi,2023-07-28 06:07:53

fun fact the mattel exec is played by jamie demetriou the real life brother of natasia demetriou who plays nadja in what we do in the shadows,2023-07-27 04:32:15
we also had a random two second rob brydon cameo and one of the derry girls i havent looked it up but based on the number of brits rounding out the cast in smaller parts i assume they shot the barbieworld stuff at leavesden,2023-07-29 02:09:41
i knew hot lawyer sounded familiar,2023-07-22 09:27:04
they even paired ncuti and emma as barbie and ken,2023-07-21 19:34:30
apparently they were originally going to do a joke like that but ditched it because they didnt think they looked that much alike when they were actually standing next to each other,2023-07-22 06:21:23
what makes you say that do they know each other,2023-07-23 10:47:46

hes just grasping at straws about being progressive,2023-07-22 13:12:35
it’s a joke that people like to say “i have a jewish friend” to prove they are open minded and often as an excuse to say antisemitic stuff also “i have a black friend”,2023-07-22 16:20:28
also the creator of barbie was jewish so i took it as that was who his friend was,2023-07-23 06:01:14
the horse lampshade in the background while he was crying on the bed got me,2023-07-21 03:36:51

i had the exact tv they were referencing with that sticker on the tv haha,2023-07-23 08:01:39
like you can tell he has no idea about the socialsystemic implications or what any of it really means he just knows patriarchy means “guys rule and horses too ”,2023-07-21 14:11:57
i no joke believe he should be nominated for his role,2023-07-23 19:13:35
i think it’s the absolute sincerity in that statement that really nails the joke,2023-07-23 16:29:11
" ken is exactly the type of shallow himbo to throw around a word like patriarchy without knowing what the heck it actually means

i mean thats probably true of most of the men in positions of power which i think is the point",2023-07-23 01:29:08
i love the way she’s pointing out how it doesn’t make us happy either,2023-07-30 05:57:29
anarchy anarchy i dont know what that word means but i love it,2023-07-24 15:21:45
such perfect casting,2023-08-19 06:39:02
so does that make horse girls patriarchy girls,2023-07-21 03:45:44
"when i was a kid i wanted a mustang convertible because it was named after a horse 

now i just want the horses lol",2023-07-23 21:15:17
"horses are cool and is associated with many men stereotypes the most famous being the cowboy

or ken just liked the horses and associated the two that noggin isnt suffering from an overcrowding of thoughts",2023-08-02 22:58:51
horses are the extenders of men ,2023-07-24 03:52:56
simu liu’s arms a close second,2023-07-29 05:28:06
anywhere else he’d be a ten,2023-07-23 06:18:19
i dont think he understands the concept of being hot every ken is supposed to be a version of hot,2023-07-21 16:23:33
its back up instantly bought it ,2023-07-22 01:33:50
speed racer is so wildly dumb that it’s great,2023-07-25 20:13:29
my husband and i both wore pink and in the car he asked me do you think well be the only people wearing pink and i cautiously replied i think there will be at least one other person in pink turns out my estimate was a bit off because about 75 of the people were wearing at least one pink thing,2023-07-23 18:17:56
as a guy who happen to like pink and owns a few pink shirts i felt really at home lol  pink be pimpin,2023-07-23 06:00:11
black panther was the last time i saw everyone show up dressed to the nines,2023-07-21 16:08:34
some of the employees at the theater i went to were dressed up as cowboy ken it was so fun,2023-07-21 18:45:23
"yeah my theatre also decorated and a bunch of the workers were also dressed up

x200b

me and my roommate assumed it was something like maybe the last harry potter where people dressed up and stuff but maybe some of the marvels too",2023-07-21 23:45:48
my theater had a life sized barbie box to take pics in was really neat,2023-07-23 04:27:15
the entire thing gave me end game vibes  this wasnt a movie so much as an event  so much fun,2023-07-24 07:12:57
i work at a movie theater and my boss is  we’ve never gone as all out for a movie as this one he even made me bring in my old childhood barbies and we placed them all over the concessions and bar it’s just been so fun in fact i don’t remember a movie that has been selling out theaters like this one has i’m talking every showing sold out not even top gun or avatar,2023-07-25 06:36:26
" the theater i went to decorated the entire lobby in pink balloons and covered the bar in pink table covers

well that must have been an interesting juxtaposition for the oppenheimer crowd",2023-07-22 21:30:58
infinity war and end game had costumes everywhere,2023-07-21 07:55:03
just saw it now the theater i went is a dinein theater all the staff referred to us all as ken or barbie and had nametags that said ken or barbie lol,2023-07-23 06:39:13
my theatre was the same and it totally took me by surprise the most full theatre ive seen in years,2023-07-23 16:44:55
love this i think part of the movie’s message is to embrace cheesy bc it’s the most human experience we can have,2023-08-26 02:31:47
same just got back every seat was full so much pink,2023-07-21 05:13:20
everyone was so cute and fun it was such a nice and heart warming experience ,2023-07-22 21:41:02
" watched this with my bfs sister 11 it was us and maybe 3 other groups of 35 everyone else was silent for 80 of the movie while i was giving a full belly laugh for depression barbie and the rest of the movie and she had the gall to say you were laughing way too much i couldnt even hear myself think

shes just pushing her boundaries i did the same thing at her age but i thought that was such a weird thing to point out lmaoo",2023-07-21 14:11:52
that is insane my theater was laughing so loud i literally couldn’t hear many parts the girl behind me had a full blown laughcoughing fit at one point,2023-07-22 04:43:11
i went at 930 this am saturday totally packed,2023-07-22 17:29:36
same my audience was full of dead fish,2023-07-23 00:41:39
i rewatched it today and it was packed too,2023-08-10 04:15:16
"i really hope the academy takes this movie as seriously as it should because if this film doesnt win best production design ill be furious

  


spiderverse needs to win best animated feature and barbie needs to win best production design the academy can be  but please dont be that ",2023-07-21 15:58:42
that’s kind of the point it feels jarring to go to reality,2023-07-25 06:38:25
that must have literally been the first old person barbie has ever seen right,2023-07-23 21:42:25
not dramatic at all it was a stunning scene the fact that so many emotions were evoked with only a few words spoken is incredible,2023-07-22 21:47:02
that was the scene of the movie it’s a moment where barbie first sees what it’s like to be human people laughing fighting playing etc and then finally growing old i found that moment so incredibly profound for a movie about barbie then the movie continued to be poignant and relevant without being preachy and i am just blown away,2023-07-21 15:51:01
theres a similar scene in the movie soul which i also love,2023-07-22 03:27:26
this movie all around would make a good double feature with soul i think,2023-07-22 11:28:13
yeah that scene was definitely standout for me as well the soundtrack coupled with the beauty of the scene just made it feel so real in a movie about a plastic doll,2023-07-22 06:17:42
i cried off and on from that point on the whole movie lol,2023-07-24 03:55:34
the first scenes in barbieland were so smotheringly plastic and weird that coming into the real world made me feel more immersed it reminded me of wizard of oz when dorothy steps into the color world,2023-07-25 11:31:05
like from the bear “every second counts”,2023-07-31 05:08:48
"i’m so glad it was the standout scene for me — there was just so much meaning and heart and emotion and humanity wrapped up in it

it’s weird i’ve seen all of greta gerwig’s films and as prestigious and gilded and serious as they all have been it wasn’t until barbie that i really understood her genius fan for life",2023-07-22 05:00:13
it doesnt move the narrative along but it sure as  adds another layer to the ending with barbie wanting to experience everything that comes with being human not something that clicked until reading this thread but its a great detail to stumble on while thinking back in the movie,2023-08-01 02:15:14
wasnt the old lady at the bus stop costume designer ann roth,2023-07-21 10:06:11
rconfidentlyincorrect,2023-07-21 14:52:01
"its actually not 

",2023-07-21 10:46:41
even thought they apparently didnt do that i honestly think it would have been really cool if they had i feel like it would have given that line a lot more weight although ann roth is cool too,2023-08-01 08:27:22
no the bus stop woman was costume designer ann roth and ruth handler was rhea perlman,2023-07-25 00:39:21
and i love that while the narrator said that everyone even people who are perceived to be the hottest people in the world feel  at points it’s universal we all feel  at points in our lives,2023-07-22 07:49:41
human beings have that feeling no matter the look but you are totally right,2023-07-21 16:49:08
meanwhile on twitter “margot robbie is mid”,2023-07-23 10:51:05
yep hardly anyone actually feels beautiful were all taught to look at ourselves at never quite good enough looking beautiful and believing it are two different things,2023-07-23 04:22:17
i think that’s kind of the point of the narrator saying that too though it would a very easy criticism to say “well margot robbie is still beautiful so that story beat falls flat” but helen mirren making that critique instead forces the viewer to appreciate the subtext of that scene which is that the patriarchal pressure to be “perfect” is so oppressive that even someone as attractive as margot robbie still will never feel like “enough”,2023-07-26 16:19:53
yeah even if they were homeless beach boys it would have been hilarious to see how they would show that,2023-07-23 03:48:56
well i mean the whole point was that no one gives af about the kens and they dont have houses because theyre treated as second class citizens,2023-07-24 02:22:35
that seems intentional and at the end of the movie kens and especially ryans ken get more autonomy,2023-07-25 02:40:17
he did he became close to my favorite side character at the end from the unexpected beatdown he gave to those buildingthewall kens,2023-07-21 03:50:16
him trying to jump the fence instead of running around was hilarious too,2023-07-22 13:40:42
"i expected goslings ken to be the precious puppy of the movie

  


but no it was absolutely allan",2023-07-21 15:11:43
i did not expect michael cera choking out a ken and i now wish it happened more,2023-07-21 20:51:16
"i’m invited to a barbie party next weekend where everyone has to go as barbie in a profession or as “just ken” despite being a blonde 25f… i really want to go as allan 

allan wasn’t everything but he was something",2023-07-25 02:30:24
nice cheering kens,2023-07-21 04:30:42
i thought he would be in the show for like a moment and he was so good,2023-07-22 13:38:21
i’ve never seen him show so much emotion,2023-07-22 04:20:53
i kinda wish they had allowed allen on the barbie supreme court  just allen no kens ,2023-07-27 02:03:08
theres some roles that 100 only work with a certain actor and thats one of them,2023-07-24 15:28:27
michael cera honestly deserved award consideration for mollys game and im glad he is getting the praise for this that he deserved then  hes also incredible as a voice actor in the lego batman movie,2023-07-24 16:24:41
when they introduced michael cera as allan i lost it,2023-08-28 03:26:51
the dance choreography from the kens was on another level the loveliest part is how they all resolve their differences through dance,2023-07-21 13:04:25
put your manly hand in mine,2023-07-24 08:26:10
also its brilliant because barbie the toy has never ever included weapons so they have to improvise with very extremely silly alternatives so funny,2023-07-23 14:45:00
allan could fight extremely well at the border i assumed whoever was playing with his toy at the time was using him as an action figure,2023-08-09 18:02:49
are you trying to tell me that  twisters are not a legitimate fighting technique,2023-07-27 04:08:08
nothing about that dance sequence was ,2023-07-22 05:30:10
between this and “naatu naatu” from rrr it’s been a good couple years for danceoffs,2023-07-25 20:02:51
i took three 150mg edibles and i was higher than rent in san diego made this sequence a work of art to me ,2023-07-29 23:14:34
as someone having gi joe figures and comics since as long as i can remember thats the cinematic crossover i want  lets have a subversive gi joe flick that lovingly honors and tears apart the property at the same time,2023-07-24 18:26:10
incitatus was caligula being well before his time,2023-07-24 17:48:33
i believe this was a john mulaney bit,2023-07-28 10:20:32
,2023-07-29 03:03:51
i was the only one in my theater to laugh at the joke,2023-07-23 05:04:39
"that was the best one imo she said it multiple times and it’s obviously not a common term it was like gerwig threw it in there as “this is for all the movie fans and here it is again in case you missed it the first time”

really after the opening scene i was thinking oh  this is not going to be a normal movie at all lfg",2023-07-24 00:48:11
i was surprised given the daughters age that she brought up that reference,2023-07-24 23:41:15
what was this one a reference to,2023-07-24 02:17:44
i laughed so  hard at that line,2023-07-29 04:54:23
also toward the beginning i believe theres a shot of the kens that appear the same as the welcome shot from fight club i think they said welcome though could be mistaken,2023-08-18 03:22:13
 i was wondering if anyone else would notice this i loooooove gotta kick it up lol,2023-08-06 05:07:55
i didnt know america was in that movie but i did think of that exact film the minute i heard the father say the line,2023-08-14 03:16:33
the dude doing cpr on the horse is what made me think of spr it’s a callback to one of the medics trying to save a kid,2023-07-25 21:46:18
such a trope i dont think i could even say its the matrix though,2023-08-04 10:22:08
thats exactly what i thought,2023-07-28 04:52:46
i got troy from that as well they straight up copied saving private ryan for the beach landing scene but the arrows being shot at the landing kens is unique to troy,2023-08-05 10:35:42
i thought the discontinued kens and allan were a great way to represent the men who are either discarded by patriarchy or want nothing to do with it,2023-07-21 06:20:33
because the patriarchy doesn’t benefit outwardly  and feminine men,2023-07-21 17:29:25
i loved the whole corporate part just will ferrell and the suits dissing in a barbie meeting room playing with barbie drumsticks doing everything in suits it’s was perfect,2023-07-22 04:11:30
that line hit so well in the abstractness that was the movie,2023-07-23 03:36:41
i heard in an interview with margot robbie that cena was shooting nearby and so robbie took a long shot and asked him if he wanted to shoot a cameo for barbie as a merman and he was down,2023-07-24 05:13:52
…how did you not recognize john cena,2023-07-22 00:28:33
and using the mattel logo as the bleep comedic genius,2023-07-24 01:55:13
im thinking hes meant to represent the true male feminist ally the one that doesnt subscribe to all the alpha male bs and as a result doesnt belong to any group but doesnt really care to but also doesnt want any part in toxic ,2023-07-23 04:23:38
i didn’t even recognize allan as  tbh  i just thought he was someone comfortable with himself that knew what he wanted  maybe i missed how  he was but either way i loved him for how thoughtful he was,2023-07-22 13:43:38
i know they had a story to tell but i wish they would have explored barbie and womanhood through a  lens for a second or two there was a lot of subtext and some oneoff jokes but i needed a little bit more,2023-07-21 07:58:33
as a vaguely bi man who works in a woman dominated field i want to be a ken but im more likely an allan,2023-07-22 14:09:18
also scott pilgrim,2023-07-21 04:53:34
to add for those who don’t know this line matters because that was allan’s marketing strategy when he was released,2023-07-21 05:35:14
didn’t they do this too in the movie one of the execs tries to understand the way the real world and barbieworld works and they basically just say “who cares” ,2023-09-23 15:17:17
the rhythmic gymnastics of it all ,2023-07-22 05:57:20
maybe you meant cadet kelly where hillary duff and christy carlson romano were twirling ribbons in military suit with straight faces,2023-07-23 11:58:15
all his time doing kims convenience and shangchi were really just preparation for his destiny being a kinda dickish ken,2023-07-29 02:16:16
thank you for reminding me of this just saw the movie last night and have been trying to think of all my favorite parts and this one escaped me,2023-07-25 15:27:23
i  lost it when he was twirling that ribbon,2023-08-08 16:45:52
this was easily one of my biggest laughs,2023-08-26 04:44:25
i loved that in the credits everyone was credited as just barbie or ken made the credits sequence hilarious as you see a dozen names all playing the same role,2023-07-23 23:16:30
i think gosling can dance better but his character is a bit more bumbling meanwhile simu liu is supposed to be the cool ken in this one,2023-07-24 05:56:55
nah,2023-07-27 04:41:22
i totally agree this movie shows his acting chops and charisma i thought he was meh in shang chi even though he was the main star in that film,2023-08-13 18:23:28
"i got very turned on by that scene 

it was  as  i felt like luca guardandino took over directing for a second",2023-07-22 10:43:04
i need an hour of the kens fighting in short shorts ,2023-07-22 07:53:25
" 


what ",2023-07-31 10:27:40
what was unfortunate about it,2023-07-21 12:39:03
his face during the first dance was terrific it was like talent show ryan brought into the future,2023-07-21 02:47:34
i noticed he had 2 watches on his wrist in the third act and when he threw that punchline about being asked the time and revealing the third watch on his other arm was priceless,2023-07-21 03:03:48
him coming down the slide triumphantly was magical,2023-07-21 02:54:09
gets in car to step onto hood to sit down and slide off ,2023-07-21 10:47:05
margot also did great with the physical comedy as well when she was flopping around on the ground during her depressive episode and was completely stiff except her shoulders and hips i was cackling,2023-07-23 22:31:59
weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee,2023-07-21 04:04:02
"bladerunner 2049 and the gray man were both action films but it definitely felt like he was way more physically active in this movie than both those combined lol 

the amount of emotions and  expressions displayed arent even debatable lol

gosling really carried this movie",2023-07-23 10:13:30
give this man the nice guys sequel we deserve with horses,2023-07-21 05:13:23
 the nice guys was so funny,2023-07-22 19:48:55
he was quite funny in crazy  love too,2023-07-22 17:44:41
its funny because i dont really like his dramatic work but every time he does comedy im absolutely taken with him,2023-07-21 06:02:02
i still quote crazy  love weekly that movie is just my so good and ryan gosling and steve carell  it,2023-07-25 03:08:20
"your last sentence reminds me of that jimmy butler copypasta so ill adapt it to this case

 at one point in a shoot sources said gosling turned to director greta gerwig and screamed you bleeping need me you cant film without me gosling left actors and staff largely speechless he dominated the set in every way goslings back",2023-07-21 02:44:34
a lot of it is because if you are mature enough to not get offended by a pro women message it is also very empowering to men,2023-07-23 16:38:07
because it also has a very strong promen message and i loved that,2023-07-21 08:11:12
"i must say i resent this sentiment quite a bit because while gosling was given the most to play with of any actor in the movie margot robbie was perfectly perfect if understated as barbie but what i took away from the movie is that it was very much a group effort and an ensemble cast i feel like all of them were great with what they were given the mother the daughter michael cera simu liu kate mckinnon were all in their right place and deeply enjoyable

what i want to say with this ryan gosling walking away with this movie’s only oscar would be a definite net loss and a terrible irony a wonderfully feminist movie and the man gets all the praise",2023-07-21 23:37:04
it was kenheimer all along,2023-07-23 20:32:23
i can’t help but wonder how intentional it was to let ryan gosling end up “stealing the show” and being the highlight of the movie the irony of that is so overwhelming that it almost has to be intentional which is just chefs kiss,2023-07-23 20:58:43
i dispute that he was the mvp he was terrific but the mvp was the person who wrote his words and directed him,2023-07-21 02:41:44
sometimes his eyes were so scary lol,2023-07-22 13:26:25
big johnny lawrence energy,2023-07-24 15:36:20
the  ocd sold separately killed me ,2023-07-21 20:24:03
tammy craps,2023-07-21 14:17:01
me too   em,2023-07-23 11:02:26
 the script was incredibly self aware,2023-07-22 01:30:02
i can’t remember the exact interview because i’ve watched so many but the interviewer asked margot if ryan ever made her corpse and she explained what i mentioned above making her laugh while filming,2023-07-24 02:53:38
we mothers stand still so our daughters can look back to see how far they have come my wife went from smiling to sobbing in 0 seconds flat,2023-07-21 23:52:38
that part was painfully real,2023-07-21 23:00:42
people who say oppenheimer is the movie that gives you an existential crisis hasnt been a married couple that has two boys and is trying to decide on whether its worth it to take the coin flip and try for a girl my wife is a bit of a wreck right now,2023-08-08 01:52:10
i hope so too ,2023-07-21 22:38:54
lol that is hilarious,2023-07-25 03:19:34
"i havent seen superstore so i wouldnt know 

is it worth giving a watch",2023-07-22 19:41:17
her husband in the movie even said “si se puede”,2023-07-22 22:28:58
you are me because that was my thought process i still thought maybe somehow america was like her older sister a la nani in lilo and stitch but no betty suarez is the mom i wouldve died if the guy who played daniel meade played her husband ,2023-07-30 01:35:04
me too i would actually buy those,2023-08-14 03:34:08
i think i spotted an ad placement for mattel,2023-07-24 02:27:22
ads dont hurt the movie unless if characters suddenly go out of character to talk about the ad in question the chevrolet was just a car that was driving by and birkenstock is totally a brand that a girl would use at least its not like infinity war where doctor strange mentions the taste of ben and jerrys ice cream,2023-07-24 02:48:41
i think it fits honestly the movie is going to have consumerist undertones no matter what you do because it has to be okayed by mattel so instead of just leaving it at that greta went all in on product placement in a way that forces audiences to be aware of it and have their mind on the interplay between the history of barbie and capitalism,2023-07-27 04:56:52
totally complimented a friends birkenstocks the other day  i thought it was funny when it came up in barbie,2023-07-24 05:23:47
i am kenough rainbow hoodies,2023-07-21 02:51:02
i am kenough,2023-07-21 15:04:56
literally my favorite joke of the movie,2023-07-21 04:54:12
i need the hoodie ,2023-07-21 06:01:41
i involuntarily blurted out “i need that sweatshirt” to my friend the moment i saw it,2023-07-21 03:55:32
bitter upvote and realizing i am 4 hours to late to beat you to it early ken catches the worm,2023-07-21 06:00:31
"i wouldn’t even call him that since at the end of it he literally says he stopped being into the whole
patriarchy thing once he realized horses weren’t as involved in it as he thought they’d be in which case same",2023-07-21 09:35:37
like a kencel,2023-07-21 20:48:40
i described the plot as barbie vs andrew tate to some family i met for food after,2023-07-21 15:01:55
that montage of him getting radicalized had me coughing laughing,2023-07-22 19:26:29

you mean kenadian excellence,2023-07-21 02:54:35
"it’s genuinely sweet and nice to see gosling an otherwise serious actor “method acting” playing a character so goofy and silly like ken 

we all need kenergy in our lives",2023-07-21 12:56:43
we are all kenough,2023-07-21 09:34:45
wow that was epic,2023-07-21 06:38:02
priceless,2023-07-21 06:44:40
that was fantastic  i feel like i just watched a dvd bonus feature,2023-07-21 14:27:35
hilarious,2023-07-21 13:02:17
haha wow that was so fun,2023-07-21 06:20:56
comedy tends to overshadow drama maybe,2023-07-21 06:46:02
"i think a lot of that is that everyone knew margot robbie would  this shes exactly in the wheelhouse for this

gosling is not with the sole exception of the nice guy hes never really played a comedy role hes very good at brooding and smoldering leading men and this just isnt that but he nailed it so i think its getting more press because of that",2023-07-21 21:35:52
totally agree i never felt he stole the show from her even though they were both great,2023-07-21 05:28:37
i felt the exact same way reading through the comment section so much upvoted love for gosling not much for mr it feels dramatic to extrapolate from that then again it can be less insidious ryan gosling is kinda a culturalmeme icon right now,2023-07-21 16:13:27
she was good as she always is but he was far and away the standout for me i imagine that was the case for most people and thats why hes getting so much of the recognition,2023-08-01 10:02:01
wow thx for the gold ,2023-07-30 12:12:50
ryan gosling is a pretty talented actor imo hes pulled off a pretty good variety of roles through his career ive enjoyed him in lars and the real girl drive the big short the nice guys la la land blade runner 2049 and now this off the top of my mind,2023-07-21 02:38:34
"i really dont think gosling has ever taken himself too seriously hes just a talented weird actor

even his voice was from him as a kid trying to sound cooler which is peak kenergy",2023-07-21 04:02:23
if you doubt him as an actor or thought he took himself too seriously you should watch the nice guys the dude is hilarious and phenomenal at physical comedy,2023-07-21 03:33:43
gotta watch the nice guys his physical humor is so good,2023-07-21 05:04:28
he’s never been in a bad movie,2023-07-21 03:44:06
he is kind of in a rare position where hes takes a few money roles here and there while also doing whatever roles he has found interesting for the  years or so not that these are always different movies of course,2023-07-21 11:32:58
do yourself a favor and check out the nice guys he absolutely kills it in that movie,2023-07-21 03:31:32
did you watch the nice guys i feel like at least now you would like it,2023-07-21 08:16:13
i never took him seriously cuz of the notebook just not my cup of tea but my view on him changed completely after watching the nice guys he played the  out of that character,2023-07-21 13:29:24
when his casting was first announced there were a lot of people that said he’d be too old to play ken since he’s in his 40s and ken is typically younger,2023-07-21 05:07:04
who tf is downvoting this,2023-07-21 06:46:07
wack comment,2023-08-06 04:58:20
also the kens will the the same power as women have in the real world,2023-07-21 14:44:23
that’s so crazy cause the theater i was at was dead quiet after that joke and i was the only one who laughed,2023-07-22 01:20:46
my theater didnt laugh but went oooooooooo in pain,2023-07-25 17:36:12
my theater gave an audible unanimous gasp it was hilarious,2023-07-23 05:05:34
its funny because my theater was absolutely silent on this one very interesting,2023-07-28 23:59:21
lmaooo,2023-07-22 03:39:52
,2023-08-23 05:04:25
i was also hoping they would acknowledge that she modeled barbie off a german  symbol bild lilli but that was too much for mattel i guess can you imagine if she did make an appearance in person,2023-07-22 21:04:16
ryan gosling’s comedic chops are so good it’s insane i was belly laughing through this whole movie,2023-07-21 02:40:17
" childish mentality and behaviorisms that ken had 

that really worked for the movie imo because i feel like goslings ken really was supposed to represent that young boy thats kinda lost about their place in the world and tumbles onto redpillincelwhatever other nonsense and then makes that their identity it made for some great humour but also an antagonistist figure for the movie that isnt all evil",2023-07-21 02:51:54
i know he won’t but it was seriously best actor nomination worthy he truly became ken and that kenough for me,2023-07-21 05:00:39
"my favorite joke was allen trying to escape saying that once the kens figure out how to make the wall sideways and not just up no one can escape

then it cuts to them making a huge tower with a big “ken at work” sign  had me wheezing",2023-07-21 14:14:27
bo would have played ken as so insufferably mopey lol it would have been so much worse,2023-07-21 03:03:41
peak reddit to think that next in line after ryan gosling should be bo  burnham,2023-07-22 04:22:36
im sorry i can tell your a bo burnham fan and i am too but that would have been the single worst casting choice in the last decade,2023-07-21 14:00:15
he nailed the mannerisms of a little boy trying to be overly manly,2023-07-22 01:59:27
oh my  bo could work but i imagine he would be more like his zach stone character not that much of a himbo energy kenergy more like just insufferable theater kid,2023-07-21 22:26:38
i watched it in a theater in madrid in english with spanish subtitles and i think the biggest laughs were from america ferreras husband speaking spanish bo  lí  gra  fo,2023-07-26 22:27:36
to be fair to mattel i do think they’ve done a lot of work over the past 1015 years on this  there’s several different body molds now including a plussized one that i see pretty regularly in stores so it’s not like there’s only one plussize barbie that’s impossible to find  and even the stereotypical barbie body is much better than it used to be and it’s so much better than that crazy 80s90s body with the  that were even bigger and the waist that was even smaller lol  and they’ve done a lot of face molds skin tones hair textures… people say they’re only doing it to make the brand look good but hey if the result is a more diverse set of dolls i really don’t care what the motivation is…,2023-07-21 12:44:20
what they bring up the unrealistic body image countless times the daughter does it during the lunch scene and then they bring it up again during the final talking out,2023-07-21 03:04:40
"100 the mattel execs were solely in the movie to show the audience that mattel is in on the joke not relevant to the plot but absolutely crucial to the marketing strategy of the brand not the movie i cant believe mattel allowed this is exactly what mattel were aiming for and that only works if they make sure you know they allowed it

id guess thats even why they cast will ferrell in the same role he played in lego movie that film was wellreceived critically despite the whole iptoy commercial thing  lego has maintained a cuddlyfeelgood image casting ferrell was like a calculated nod back to that film as if to preemptively neutralize the same discussionaccusations

still an excellent movie in many aspects much less so in others but its basically the pottery barn episode of friends thing and i wish people were more ablewilling to recognize that while still enjoying the movie for what it is  not to spoil their own enjoyment but just because the implications of this being the standard for subversive filmmaking is beyond bleak",2023-07-21 11:23:54
i don’t think this movie was trying to talk about capitalism it was trying to talk about gender roles and patriarchy and how society starts sending children messages about their identities from early ages and how hard it is to just be a person when you’re bombarded constantly with messages about how you should be barbie the doll has been a big part of that messaging in both positive barbie showing girls they can do and be anything and negative body image issues among others i don’t think this movie shies away from that at all just because it’s a mattel sponsored movie this could have been a cheap piece of  see the bratz movie from a decade ago but they put some thought and heart into it yet it makes them look good but they let greta gerwig have a serious conversation and also a fun wellmade film,2023-07-23 05:10:10
using the teen daughter to call barbie a fascist to completely undermine any surface level criticism of capitalism was  ,2023-07-21 05:10:33
you could say similar things about the lego movie the world just kinda caught up to it more now i really liked the movie,2023-07-21 04:45:06
i mean mattel has been making moves on those issues for almost a decade though i do think as a company they’ve been trying to transition somewhat there was a documentary called tiny feet several years ago about them trying to relaunch dolls with better body shapes and diversity,2023-07-21 03:51:52
the whole point is why and how does barbie give women an unrealistic body image and should we be that harsh about a doll,2023-07-21 05:42:09
"copying another comment

its not shocking that a corporation would crunch the numbers and realize that saying to your audience were on your side is going to sell more products nothing about the movie will undermine their profit

what is shocking is if you know how much of corporate world is run by rich dudes feelings its surprising how selfeffacing the movie is disney would never ever make a movie that portrayed their ceo as a bumbling sexist hypocrite even if it made them money",2023-07-22 18:49:19
thank you for the nuanced comment i didnt hate it all but despite its fantastic aesthetic and relentless comedy that lands it could never get over the fact that its a toy commercial after all and for a bizarre 10 minute scene a chevy commercial too it felt corporate in a way i was suprised to see from something with grewigs name on it mattel takes some softballs to solidify their brand as selfaware without actually taking responsibility for anything it is working out really well for them considering the reception the movie has had,2023-07-21 09:10:19
well yeah because people went to see a funny movie not a chomsky capitalism bad  session,2023-07-22 22:44:22
also at one point i think they tried to conflate communism with fascism,2023-07-21 04:39:01
except the reason barbie is shaped as she is is due to the clothes needing to hang off the body realistically,2023-07-21 11:28:21
they’re also going to make a lot of money off of this i’m sure that helps,2023-07-22 22:44:23
that’s better than humor,2023-07-25 03:36:17
wdym facists believe in dictators that’s not good therefore it’s insulting,2023-07-25 20:31:47
this would bump those ratings right back up,2023-07-31 02:58:40
best fight sequence ever it was so fun,2023-07-22 20:47:22
i have to think that was a monty python reference,2023-08-13 05:21:03
wait was there a pavement joke that i missed,2023-07-21 03:30:43
i’ve never listened to a single pavement song but i love yasi salek and her bandaplain podcast so the malkmus mention made me perk up,2023-07-23 20:26:18
i was cackling when they zoomed out to all the kens singing around tiny fires,2023-07-21 02:40:35
the line about the zac snyder cut had one particular guy in the audience absolutely on the floor like they were pushing some very specific buttons here and it went over perfectly,2023-07-24 13:40:05
i’ve seen people say that the movie is not subtle and it’s heavy handed and i’m so surprised they think this is a criticism  it is clearly very on the nose… in your face about these things lol,2023-07-22 13:25:03
i was so called out during the bonds part my girlfriend literally turned and stared at me during that part got a good chuckle,2023-07-24 04:06:30
a stephen malkmus joke lol,2023-07-21 05:36:56
i was hysterical and told my wife it would 100 percent work on me,2023-07-22 01:27:14
i definitely laughed the hardest in my theater at the zsjl line my friends didn’t get it,2023-07-21 11:26:52
it got a good laugh in my theater,2023-07-21 05:32:51
yeah i let out a pretty large laugh and my wife just gave me a weird look,2023-07-23 19:45:20
the bear also references the snyder cut in much the same way and it’s phenomenal,2023-07-25 21:42:24
zack snyder’s justice league is a real thing that is said in barbie,2023-07-21 04:14:25
you just gotta watch it lots of things in the movie sound like its straight from rmoviescirclejerk if you explain it in words but it 100 works in the movie,2023-07-21 02:35:46
it is in the movie and it is  hilarious  my favorite part of the movie hands down,2023-07-21 02:38:55
the entire movie feels like it was written and directed by rmoviescirclejerk it’s why i loved it so much i’m convinced greta gerwig lurks or even participates in that sub,2023-07-21 09:54:42
it is in the movie,2023-07-21 02:36:06
it’s actually in the movie and it’s hilarious everyone was cackling throughout the entire scene,2023-07-21 03:38:23
who hurt you,2023-07-21 12:39:31
was kind of sad when it all fell apart it seemed great everyone had like 5 tvs in their house,2023-07-21 03:06:18
"armond white everyones favorite troll critic seems to be personally offended by it and calls them out for it 

 how could any decent industry professional attack another filmmaker this way it’s the ultimate sign that gerwig and baumbach know nothing about making pop entertainment",2023-07-21 06:06:30
im a self confessed snyder stan and that line did nothing but make me laugh real hard it was so  accurate,2023-07-22 00:22:48
i mean zsjl was directly mentioned as some kind of beacon of toxic masculinity and incels and it hit i was surprised wb allowed that joke,2023-07-21 05:24:39
well in the godfather anyway,2023-07-22 12:05:22
you’re allowed to laugh at the theater were people not laughing,2023-07-31 13:01:10
it’s for the guys who are self proclaimed cinephiles and love to talk about the godfather’s brilliance as a way to make themselves feel smarter for pointing out how great of a movie it is despite being 50 years old i am one of those people,2023-07-21 08:08:03
it insists upon itself,2023-07-21 16:18:02
that’s pretty common not an actor but i’ve heard villains are the most fun fun to play because you get to push boundaries further than you could in real life and go wild,2023-07-30 07:07:49
they referenced a joke in the film it wasnt a comment on robbie and gosling was absolutely excellent and if you think he was just comic relief youve missed the point,2023-07-29 12:09:59
dude i was praising a joke that greta gerwig and margot robbie jointly decided to put in the movie its really not that deep,2023-07-27 07:40:21
to be fair… i think greta did this on purpose to make this more palatable for the men watching it a spoon full of sugar and all that i feel like this was very strategic,2023-09-16 04:15:05
"adding to this the older womans response saying i know it after being told she was beautiful and both of their genuine smiles just really adds to the greatness of the scene 

you easily couldve had barbie being taken aback by the older womans response but margot robbie just gives this perfect genuine look of kindness instead",2023-07-21 19:41:43
i found the two films to be thematically identical the friction between one’s place in a community vs individual experience and self affirmation,2023-07-21 14:53:45
ill probably watch it at some point but thats why i dont wanna rush and see oppenheimer i dont wanna watch a depressing movie for 3 hours,2023-08-02 15:54:36
"i’m not sure if this was intentional but i think the movie also subtly called attention to the fact that even as barbies become more diverse they’re still always the “perfect” representation of their type

that is definitely a thought i had watching the various black asian latina and even trans barbies bopping around its like how society says we accept you for being x but you need to be this type of x",2023-07-21 21:31:23
the cellulite happens before she has experienced the real world cellulite doesnt fit into barbieland the way it does in reality,2023-07-23 08:07:55
i was exaggerating a little bit thats basically who ken turns into when he gets on the patriarchy bandwagon  his entire arc is getting redpilled and then recovering from becoming the  that turns you into,2023-07-21 23:12:50
i watched a tiktok video that someone broke up because of a barbie movie date ,2023-07-24 15:19:54

ken is my next sigma male character to latch onto,2023-07-23 13:22:10
i have that kenergy,2023-07-25 23:32:28
they followed that up with the narrator saying one day kens will have the same power in barbieland as women have in the real world it was supposed to be a joke but also kinda make a point was that you dont just get equality magically overnight like how it doesnt yet exist irl,2023-07-21 15:13:58
"well i think theres something to the notion that the real world in this movie is still a girl playing with toys its why the car chase was so absurd why everything mattel was so ridiculous there were no real consequences for being arrested twice in one day m

which also would imply that this girl is probably coming to grips with the hard realities of being a woman in the real world while still being young enough to not really know much else about the real world",2023-07-24 08:46:40
it would have been great if right after the ceoboard gets injured they after a short while feel 100 better again like ken did when he fell while surfing it would confirm the theory of the board being escaped kens while not having to waste time explaining that,2023-07-21 23:43:18

the fact that it was about her finally having a  and beinh a true woman was both hilarious and powerful",2023-07-21 15:51:08
im still shocked wb let her do that especially with zaslav at the helm who just kinda seems like a  ,2023-07-22 03:39:30

can you remind me what the final line was,2023-07-21 15:02:23
"ive never seen a car chase scene that was more obviously directed by someone whose day job is directing car commercials

dont forget that barbies convertible is classic corvette,2023-07-21 02:37:44
plus the hummer and they were both the yet to be released evs,2023-07-21 03:01:27
birkenstock i feel like was even bigger,2023-07-21 03:59:43
don’t forget the massive gm skyscraper on the background of the ceo’s office next to wbd’s lol,2023-07-22 03:00:58
that really took me out,2023-07-22 15:49:20
and then there was all the chanel stuff barbie wears in barbieland,2023-07-23 07:10:26
the two buildings visible from the mattel board room were warner brothers discovery and gm i thought it was hilarious,2023-07-23 17:43:16
my only complaint about the movie really i know they gotta pay the bills so i get it but that little chase into powerslide they did was a little gratuitous lol,2023-07-23 07:47:26
ope that’s what i meant,2023-07-21 02:32:17
was the chevy an electric car too i couldve sworn it was if thats the case that was a nice nod having an electric car beat out all the stereotypical tough giant black suvs,2023-07-23 23:19:50
there’s a big gm logo on a building outside the mattel executive office next to the wb building the product placement was not subtle,2023-07-26 12:33:14
yes you can,2023-07-21 09:35:20
none of the stunts are possible irl because it has an electronic ebrake   travesty,2023-07-21 06:40:00

antagonist then,2023-07-23 23:19:41
also because everything about the scene is implying shes there for a job interview or somesuch and then it turns out nope shes just there for a gynecologist visit much funnier,2023-07-24 15:43:12
yup she has a  now,2023-07-23 17:53:12

the scene plays on a stereotypical movie ending where we see the main character achievestart their big dream but this scene shows us that barbie is now a regular woman going about her day and today just happens to be her obgyn appointment ",2023-07-30 23:08:49

that one was referring to justin timberlake a member of nsync who was obviously gone on to other things but cant escape his intrinsic allanness case in point the trolls 3 trailer that was shown before barbie in my theater in which justin voices one of the lead trolls who sings all the time for no reason— peak allan behavior",2023-07-22 00:53:14

i think the joke just simply is that barbie doesnt know what things are,2023-08-10 15:25:16
i think that being the joke was making that point  people who are fascists dont know theyre fascists and sometimes people calling them fascists dont know what fascism is,2023-08-10 13:29:33
i mean its just that a joke dont look so much into it,2023-08-10 12:08:22
i mean the scene with the girls playing with dolls  smashing them then throwing one up into the sky and it transitioning into space barbie is the most obvious 2001 reference ever made,2023-07-23 14:58:20
it was like a ted talk that was good plus her speechifying pushed the plot forward when it became the way to deprogram the barbies,2023-07-21 02:16:29
i’m glad the movie whacks you over the head with the central themes in a very onthenose monologue barbie has never been subtle it wouldn’t make sense for the film to be either,2023-07-21 03:14:53
dead silent in my theater too only at the end did a guy let out a yeah in my showing ive loved america since  betty and i really hope she gets even more attention after this,2023-07-21 02:42:07
honestly i don’t think it would’ve worked for me if america ferrera’s delivery hadn’t been so utterly sincere yes it was very greta gerwigesque but she felt the words she was saying very genuinely and you could tell and the way she goes from passionate and mildly enraged to heartbroken that her world’s problems are bleeding into a doll it was really effective for me,2023-07-23 13:43:26
my entire theater clapped and cheered after that monologue lol,2023-07-21 04:29:43
a comedic break like the margot robbie line shouldve undercut a brilliant monologue like that but it didnt it still flowed brilliantly made its point and made me laugh,2023-07-21 15:18:02
"this is the second straight movie maybe third i didn’t see ladybird from greta gerwig where a character gives an impassioned monologue about how difficult life is for women 

and it’s a incredible showstopper every time",2023-07-22 22:39:49
"a little part of me couldnt help but feel the entire message of the movie was that monologue and that it was a little on the nose and preachy 

but then it was for a purpose to get barbies unprogrammed and i was okay with it",2023-07-21 02:43:04
"she really did and it really resonated

actually it was interesting because a friend took her boyfriend to see the movie and he actually expressed doubts after hearing the monologue he implied it was not exactly complaining but something close to that and i was just thinking huh she really nailed it then if you point it out you get told youre complaining and sure enough a man takes it as complaining",2023-07-31 02:08:05
and i think she keep coming up with new material for every subsequent “awakening” just legendary writing and delivering,2023-07-23 09:20:07
half of the theater i was in clapped and let out little cheers it was a really powerful monologue,2023-07-21 02:18:51
i had a woman scream amen after it lol,2023-07-21 03:38:09
i found it absolutely hilarious but all for the wrong reasons there was someone in my hall that started a slow clap after her monologue finished but i think it was too emotional of a scene for anyone else to join in as well the way the persons clap fizzled out so quickly because no one else joined in made the entire theatre lose it,2023-07-21 02:16:11
"i had people cheering afterwards at my showing 

i wonder after  betty an superstore this movie will help her career she really deserves it imo shes been so funny for years and deserves it",2023-07-21 04:37:34
my theatre started to clap right after that scene,2023-07-21 14:08:05
the same thought process occurred in my mind but i was in awe of her delivery,2023-07-21 18:25:15
my theater erupted into cheers and applause at the end of her monologue i was i think one of 3 guys in my theater and was happy to be in an audience that her monologue really resonated with,2023-07-22 05:39:07
reminded me of sasha cohens speech in the dictator  its like someone wrote that monologue and they made a movie around it,2023-07-24 15:59:56
brought me to tears,2023-09-23 15:07:36
it really helps that the monologs is grounded in reality,2023-07-23 18:32:46
it really did and my theater clapped earlier i watched oppenheimer and during the blast scene the theater got as quiet as the monologue scene in barbie crazy what a good film can do to an audience barbenheimer was real,2023-07-24 05:30:18
america’s monologues are incredible the one she did in sisterhood of the travelling pants always brings tears to my eyes,2023-07-24 03:01:54
my theater had everyone clapping at this scene and then a guy started booing,2023-07-26 05:00:42
she was just spitting facts,2023-07-23 16:12:13
my theater actually clapped after the monologue,2023-07-23 03:18:11
"it was very michelle wolf woman who has it all its all i could think of and she nailed it

for reference ",2023-07-23 03:23:58
"it is literally impossible to be a woman you are so beautiful and so smart and it kills me that you dont think youre good enough like we have to always be extraordinary but somehow were always doing it wrong
you have to be thin but not too thin and you can never say you want to be thin you have to say you want to be healthy but also you have to be thin you have to have money but you cant ask for money because thats crass you have to be a boss but you cant be mean you have to lead but you cant squash other peoples ideas youre supposed to love being a mother but dont talk about your kids all the  time you have to be a career woman but also always be looking out for other people you have to answer for mens bad behavior which is insane but if you point that out youre accused of complaining youre supposed to stay pretty for men but not so pretty that you tempt them too much or that you threaten other women because youre supposed to be a part of the sisterhood but always stand out and always be grateful but never forget that the system is rigged so find a way to acknowledge that but also always be grateful you have to never get old never be rude never show off never be selfish never fall down never fail never show fear never get out of line its too hard its too contradictory and nobody gives you a medal or says thank you and it turns out in fact that not only are you doing everything wrong but also everything is your fault
im just so tired of watching myself and every single other woman tie herself into knots so that people will like us and if all of that is also true for a doll just representing women then i dont even know",2023-07-24 12:06:33
the little girls in our theater were hilarious there was a scene where ken was going for a hug and they gasped ew dont,2023-07-21 03:31:41
let me know if you find the transcript of that monologue amazing stuff,2023-07-21 06:31:18
i need it too ive come here looking for it best part of the film for me,2023-07-21 08:12:35
ive found it,2023-07-24 12:06:24
he was so cartoonishly incompetent and yet still in charge and respected and then im like oooh thats the point,2023-07-21 15:21:30
took my daughter and she said “is elf in the barbie movie yes” with a little victory fist ,2023-07-23 05:56:03
idk i’m a woman and also thought it was too on the nose the subject matter is important i can’t put my finger on why it bothered me that it was so on the nose,2023-07-23 01:22:49
nothing much they show some of the discontinued models they discussed in the film like the pregnant barbie and the one who grows  but theres no tag or anything at the end,2023-07-21 09:25:32
that specific scene is a touching scene for a lot of girls the music really made it more emotional i guess you can really only understand the impact if you’re a woman,2023-07-23 21:29:57
also a foil for barbie to realize her whole world of women ruling the world is a sham built by yesmen losers they aren’t the villains they are just a product of the social ladder and have it easy live luxuriously just exaggerating the narrative that leads ken to believe he’s the top of the food chain and doesn’t even have to do or know anything with critical thinking,2023-07-22 03:39:51
the cd joke was really funny to me because barbie says “no one uses cds anymore” and ken interprets it to me compact discs but before interest rates shot up after this movie was written no one used certificates of deposit anymore either lol,2023-07-21 14:21:13
i think every man in the audience identified with one of those ken scenes for me it was the savings account for sure,2023-07-23 07:59:45
lol fixed,2023-07-21 15:24:03
people still talk about movies and pop culture from 50 years ago all the time,2023-07-21 06:16:41
"good thing it wasnt made for people 50 years from now then huh

movies are allowed to be made to be enjoyed right here right now",2023-07-22 20:50:56
agreed jokes about 2023 movies like the godfather and 2023 songs like “push” by matchbox 20 nobody who watches this movie on tv in a couple of years time will get them,2023-07-23 06:25:00
ritu arya was journalist barbie but she was one of the least visible of the core barbie crew,2023-08-03 11:21:21
exactly this you put it way better than i did,2023-07-22 04:41:14
its barbieand ken,2023-07-22 04:40:12
was he already cast as the doctor when barbie was filming,2023-07-28 14:32:12
cuz she played the main character in the movie she’s all that  where people thought this girl was  when wearing glasses  but when she removed her glasses people switched up real fast  acting like she had a whole makeover,2023-07-22 20:49:08
"thats exactly it 

we were waiting for the shoe to drop and will to turn but him just wanting to tickle other execs and taking pride in empowering the girls in the least creepy way through barbie made them endearing",2023-07-21 02:47:53
yeah i expected ken to go back and get the kens and barbies and bring everyone to the real world and they have to save margot from mattel then when they got back and you realized ken took over it got 1000x more interesting,2023-07-21 02:57:59
my favorite part of the movie is the twist where will ferrals character reveals himself to be genuinely invested in the hopes and dreams of little girls everywhere,2023-07-22 13:07:26
definitely  i wasn’t expecting the kens to be the real bad guys  the moment he realized that men are the ones on top in the world is like the moment little boys realize it and the way going along with that power fantasy can be appealing to them  i’m glad he chose to actually find himself in the end instead of being a lost cause to the patriarchal mindset,2023-07-21 10:40:53
"they still successfully represented the patriarchy of the real world it was just in a more cartoonish way which was appropriate for the way the movie tackled some of those pretty heavy issues 

they drive home the point that when you just put a ton of white guys in positions of power you are not always getting the best and brightest in the biggest jobs if it’s not a meritocracy with reasonable societal mobility you often get a bunch of knuckleheads running an old boy’s club 

it’s a caricature but there are tons of companies that are like that",2023-07-24 00:58:44
i thought maybe they would still turn about to be the villains representing capitalism as the overarching evil but that would have been too convoluted in the end and i like the resolution they reached with the kens,2023-07-23 04:41:52
"i made two predictions during the movie one that the girl playing with margot barbie was depressed and two that will ferrell was also ken that had gone to the real world and took over mattel

i was just as happy to be right about the former as i was disappointed to be wrong about the latter 

i mean his im a son of a mother a mother of a son speech really suggested he wasnt either dammit",2023-07-21 16:34:22
have to agree with this if felt so odd tonally they came off as toys to me too and i was waiting for a reveal that they were somehow another part of barbieland it just didn’t quite land,2023-07-21 04:29:20
i think you are right maybe there will be a sequel for ken and this will be a bigger plot point the uniformity of the business execs with the lowlevel cubicle worker in tow paralleled the kens at the beach with alan the references to the last time barbie came to the real world and how it terrified them that barbie was on the loose but not ken also the fact that one of the mattel execs got hit with a toy and needed a sling,2023-07-26 14:51:41
the running at the headquarters had scooby doo chase vibes,2023-07-21 14:55:31
dolls are just tiny reflections of human beings after all,2023-07-21 06:04:38
all of the cubicle workers are dressed identically theres definitely some sort of suggestion there but im not sure if its the toy type environment and character design or if it was meant to be something else,2023-07-23 23:10:54
the way they greeted each other was similar to how the barbies and kens greeted each other in the beginning,2023-07-26 02:21:08
jamie demetriou had some solid moments i thought,2023-07-21 04:14:27
well the others were barely characters at most the one with the most lines had what three lines four,2023-07-21 05:33:42
it’s honestly kind of a funny message about how uselessunimportant ceo types are,2023-07-21 04:17:32
" barbie was the one making stuff happen

  


which is more or less how it should be for the protagonist its their choices that should move the plot forward

  


she made the choice to go see will ferrel and he was the final thing she needed to see for it to finally click that barbie hadnt saved the world

  


plus the chase he instigated led barbie to americas character in an exciting way so while he was the weakest link i dont think he was unnecessary or wasted and i still really enjoyed him 

  


i also think he was there to show that while there are obvious problems in the patriarchal society a lot of the time the stronger issues can be found closer to home",2023-07-21 15:47:24
the queerness was actually the friends we made along the way,2023-07-21 19:40:11
i hate your mocking tone,2023-07-21 03:11:27
im just ken its on youtube,2023-07-21 08:50:45
i love it towards the end of the number when he literally counts to 10 on his fingers,2023-07-21 06:36:01
think you mean season 1’s brilliant ending season 2 ended with it’s head up it’s own  we don’t need to see rue’s eulogy for her dad 5 different times sam,2023-07-21 04:10:59
i really did love the whole ‘it’s ok to be a ken without a barbie without a horse without a horse’ etc,2023-07-21 23:23:43
i think it was “i’m a liberated man i know it’s okay to cry” which was just perfect delivery,2023-07-24 00:10:04
yeah  i am shocked they are not selling officially licensed mattel barbie movie merchandise,2023-07-21 02:39:32
they need to make it hopefully they can start up production given how many people like it,2023-07-21 02:46:40
that literally was my immediate thought when i saw it glad to know i’m in such good company,2023-07-21 02:46:28
i found a cool kenough tshirt  it looks pretty nice and close to the hoodie,2023-07-23 20:35:22
there was actually an interview where robbie and gerwig share that there are so many things in the script that the studio and corporate might find issue with that eventually they got desensitised and allow them to keep it in the film,2023-07-23 09:26:48
"i’m a barbie but i need one and would wear it proudly

edit i would also like his hardcore ken  pack",2023-07-21 08:22:38
i had never even heard the song before  and i’m 30,2023-07-23 22:46:24
i thought it was a song they made for the movie cause the lyrics were so weird,2023-09-17 05:28:54
"and also the irs but thats for another time  


lol incoming biopic about ruth handler",2023-07-21 03:43:48
yeah greta gerwig has some interesting insights about motherhood,2023-07-21 02:26:26
this line made me think of laurie metcalf and saoirse ronan in lady bird ,2023-07-21 04:11:49
it got me and im a dad i just thought about my little girl and her relationship with her mother it was beautiful,2023-07-21 06:50:12
"i always loved how despite sasha trying to be different from gloria she looked back figuratively and literally and realized that they were pretty similar in how headstrong and steadfast they are

there’s this scene where gloria chastises sasha about how she’s never given a break due to her busy life when sasha calls her out on her suddenly wanting to follow barbie and i thought “oh it’s a ‘haha parent guilt trip’ joke” but it becomes one of the steps that lead to their reconnection since sasha complained about how the barbie dolls set unrealistic standards for kids like gloria


then when gloria and sasha leave kendom lol and scott pilgrim fights the kens we see sasha have a change of heart and her being like “well i may not approve of what you do but this clearly means a lot to you so let me help” 

the daughter acts more like the parent while the parent acts more like the daughter",2023-07-21 04:39:21
 man that line it took my breath away,2023-07-22 05:42:20
i saw it with my mum and sister and brother and that had me tearing up,2023-07-22 02:27:18
that just made me feel really sad haha  it really is the same but i’m a man and my dads been struggling  i think about what he gave me,2023-07-22 13:33:58
i watched the movie with my mom and this line made me cry barbie truly is a reminder that your mom is still just a girl,2023-07-25 20:57:48
i’ve been scrolling this whole thread waiting for someone to bring this up this hit me like a ton of bricks i’ll never get over it,2023-07-27 03:12:05
that old lady was ann roth she is an academy award winning costume designer she worked with noah baumbach and greta gerwig on white noise,2023-07-21 02:40:49
well said i was deeply touched by this movie it was just a perfect cinematic experience right down to the sense of camaraderie i felt within the theater,2023-07-22 05:45:07
"i just want to say you articulated this so well describes my experience perfectly

so glad everyone else is having such a strong similar reaction as me because its really something special",2023-07-22 19:06:57
"the waterworks have been pouring since i saw it this afternoon was not expecting all of that but i just loved it loved every bit   

just amazingly done",2023-07-23 02:58:42
i could not agree more i also watched it with my mom and we were both crying so much at the mother daughter scenes,2023-07-22 15:00:27
yeah it was a weirdly religious scene but somehow it fit pretty well,2023-07-21 02:51:42
very biblical when she passed the cup to barbie it was the spitting image of “the creation of adam”,2023-07-22 15:52:48
yeah that happened too,2023-07-21 02:19:10
and perhaps even more ronald reagan cowboy actor turned president,2023-07-21 05:56:05
and collecting and holding books the whole first act…but we never see him reading any of them or referencing them later to push his points,2023-07-24 02:05:13
“i feel… conscious… but about myself” was a great line,2023-07-22 02:42:30
“and it’s because kids don’t take it out on their fathers”,2023-07-23 10:50:04
that line stood out to me its easy to miss threats of violence if you  as a man arent in danger theres been a lot of discussion in my hometown about how unsafe it has become i always felt these concerns were overblown but my sisters and friends who are women and even some of my lgbt friends beg to differ,2023-07-23 22:02:18
these approaches in the real world though werent influenced by gender and the movie makes a point to show that in barbieland ken wasnt listened to or respected and was this empty vessel being filled with identity for the first time as someone above pointed out whereas barbie came from somewhere where she was treated like an adult cultivating that behavior which would definitely explain the calm observation approach,2023-08-10 18:20:04
i also think that allan represented that a fair bit he wanted to escape from the new kenuniverse,2023-07-23 13:42:31
i’ve heard this a lot but as a man…this doesnt seem true at all for me or others experience and just seems so demeaning,2023-08-30 05:11:02
or say why didnt you just kick them in the ballspunch them knew a girl who had a male boss say that to her when three dudes twice her size cornered her in the store she worked at,2023-07-23 12:37:15
oh do tell,2023-07-25 22:40:24
oh was it oh no,2023-07-23 12:37:47
yeah the way the kens are treated was the one issue i had it felt like there wasnt that much resolution at the same time i dont mind it too much because it felt a little like payback for allllll the movies where women are basically props,2023-07-25 01:38:37
its a generalisation about the types of messages women and men receive and how they differ,2023-07-23 12:38:11
right it offends me as a man for them to imply that i cant empathize with others or that feeling sadness anxiety or fear is a uniquely female experience and clearly others agree with op as their comment is highly upvoted and yours is in the negative ridiculous,2023-07-22 04:40:44
do you think red flags walk up and say hi im dangerous heres 10 reasons why im a bad person,2023-07-23 12:38:45
its almost as if you have to go through those situations to find out those men are disconnected you know  almost as if you couldnt know a persons whole personality just by looking at them,2023-07-21 21:26:29
there will be so many ken and barbie costumes this halloween and a few sad allens,2023-07-23 07:47:20
also the space baby in the opening,2023-09-29 22:11:50
the previous generation of children us had the same moment with the recreation of the monolith scene in  wonka and the chocolate factory in the tv room scene,2023-07-21 08:25:24
maybe so but the magic of this movie is that it actually does work for audiences of all ages and perfectly executed references like that one are part of the special sauce theres plenty else in here for younger viewers to enjoy too lots of visual gags and silly humor,2023-07-21 11:56:28
that’s fine  little girls smashing dolls is funny,2023-07-22 14:16:33
thats just not true my generation grew up watching early simpsons which was packed with old movie references that none of us would recognize until many years later and it still worked because it was funny references work when theyre funny in the context in which theyre used not just by relying on the source material,2023-07-22 00:46:47
if you have no idea what it references it’s not confusing it’s just dramatic music while a kid waves a doll in the air and then smashes it which is funny by itself that’s how you make a four quadrant movie you put in jokes that parents can laugh at while they’re at the movies with their kids,2023-07-23 06:32:02
good thing it’s not a kids’ movie then,2023-07-25 22:35:18
"since women raise children it could be said that women control society 

but if boys and girls are taught to constantly compete and to use each other to get ahead they learn that from their parents both their fathers and mothers thats what society is parents passing on their values to their children luckily children are able to reject their parents values if they are totally toxic",2023-12-05 16:11:30
that’s a good point,2023-12-18 02:26:43
movie telling ken he is not defined by just being barbies bf,2023-07-23 04:14:21
she wasn’t interested but she also recognized that she was still treating him poorly so she apologized while also telling him he’s enough define himself outside of her,2023-07-23 13:16:51
me too,2023-08-01 16:06:49
no way thanks they keep it,2023-07-23 05:04:10
no i think she is ann roth,2023-07-24 17:15:22
i  love that the dads lines in the entire movie were beginner or bungled spanish,2023-07-21 03:51:42
"imagine their talk after the events of that adventure

hi honey how was your day

well you know followed a barbie into barbieland with my daughter and liberated it from the kens

thats nice dear in beginner spanish",2023-07-23 00:46:43
yeah i loved when we learned that the dad is totally fine and is still around just utterly unimportant to the plot,2023-07-25 01:05:15
“single mom stereotype” lol what do you even mean,2023-07-21 11:35:13
loved it you can be in a happy marriage and have an overall happy life but its still natural to be unable to escape those dark thoughts altogether,2023-07-21 16:04:50
wild misinterpretation of that scene,2023-07-21 09:50:09
that is not whats said in that scene she just answers yeah it was your dad with a doubtful tone to signify that she had an affair with another guy or a previous relationship,2023-07-21 10:08:52
"oh that 100 makes a few things make a lot more sense

i guess they pivoted late and added the father back in to be alive so it wasn’t as big a downer but it makes a lot more sense for the script in places if the original story had him just after dying",2023-07-21 15:14:34
"that was too real

i hung out with my ex last weekend  i know and while at a bar with her friends she started answering the phone as some guy she knew was calling her also at that bar it drove me absolutely nuts in exactly the same way i was similarly ready to go to wardance sequencebeach off",2023-07-23 12:29:01
for real when gosling ken growled that they have to go to war and another ken yelled we dont have any guns here i got a really disturbing vision of pink plastic guns in the hands of the kens,2023-07-21 03:43:15
yeah when he mentioned stephen i said “oh my ” out loud how out of no where haha,2023-07-27 02:52:32
keep being you  idk why the other person got pissy the mockery was clearly not meant to be mean but good natured theres nothing wrong with being a certain type of person ,2023-07-21 14:16:45
push by matchbox 20,2023-07-21 04:05:03
it’s your job as a friend to find a clip of it from the movie to send to him,2023-07-21 07:27:02
that’s completely not the point of the scene,2023-07-21 05:37:43
"i loved the film but i found the implication of this scene to be a little off putting 

im just going to reframe the scene in my head as something close to stuff white people like that sort of calls out the things we take for granted but are actually a particular type of cultural thats not actually universal",2023-07-24 01:29:49
it was a funny little jab i saw part of myself in a couple of those especially the pavement one i didnt take it personally,2023-07-27 04:47:22
thank you sadly sold out for now,2023-08-07 22:44:24
sold out already but will be restocked,2023-07-21 19:58:12
i’m 29 aka a young millennial lol if i was 27 i’d refer to myself as a older gen z,2023-07-22 21:49:15
also men ryan gosling can cry and show emotions and it wasn’t even the punchline of that scene,2023-08-09 16:43:35
made even funnier by her association of fascism with running trains and the flow of commerce so the barbies have knowledge of mussolini,2023-07-21 15:18:26
yes that was great iirc she said ideas like patriarchy and even barbie,2023-07-22 15:59:18
that line helped tie the movie together a little for me it kinda lost me in the second half just because it felt like there could be so many interpretations of what it was trying to say about social politics in the real world but with that line theres a realization that all of the crazy overphilosophizing in barbieland isnt real its just a representation of how hard it is to be human dealing with issues like identity and ,2023-10-25 04:28:21
conversely the barbies didnt really reject the idea of a fully barbie controlled society,2023-07-21 16:59:32
thats another excellent point and im ecstatic that were having this conversation about a barbie movie,2023-07-21 04:17:20
i never thought id be having such a profound discussion about barbie i love it,2023-07-24 07:43:08
true i phrased that badly,2023-07-27 22:57:25
same there was a couple where i was the lone bark of laughter but for the vast majority of jokes it was a very strong reaction ive seen a few movie reviewers say their cinema was crickets but thats very very far from my experience,2023-07-21 05:27:53
i lost it,2023-07-25 23:21:47
honestly kens arc is super close to sigmamale or mgtow rhetoric dont let the pursuit of a woman consume you define your own worth except that those movements usually become toxic pretty quick with only their contempt to unite them,2023-07-26 21:24:36
yeah several days after having seen the movie thats the point which continues with me when i see the altright saying that this film hates men no it instructs them how to better themselves but is perhaps a bit too subtle,2023-07-24 05:39:55
thats what i was wondering people seem to go out of their way to get mad at dissenting opinions,2023-07-21 03:41:50

given that the entire philosophy of feminism is that men are inherently evil and will forcefully subjugate women and harm them without a powerful centralized government making them not i dont think you understand feminism,2023-08-11 01:26:26
yeah this was my takeaway from the film as well it’s especially interesting because the film frames the conflict in a way that makes you root for the barbies oppressors and look down on the  kens for trying to rise up and take power,2023-08-16 21:39:22
"definitely either cut the mom and daughter or spend the time it takes to properly develop them

"yeah saying things like this out loud can be a good thing and very satisfying to watch the speech just didnt feel natural compare it to laura dern in marriage story theyre equally explicit about the problem but with laura dern it felt like something her character would believably say out of frustration we like lauras character so we love to see her rant like this


the character of the mother in barbie was underdeveloped onedimensional and the monologue was overwritten it didnt feel like something anyone would believably say naturally


her character in that moment felt like a megaphone not a threedimensional human being that we were rooting for",2023-07-25 12:05:38

i had a 5 year old yelling through the kens dance sequence and yeah i was annoyed but i didn’t blame the poor kid they didn’t understand what was going on and it wasn’t interesting to them i was irritated with the parents forcing them to finish the movie though,2023-08-27 03:41:23
as reflected in will ferrell’s line about ordinary barbie,2023-07-24 01:19:27
when she meets the girl who she thinks is playing with her one of the insults the girl throws at her is calling her a capitalist and in america ferraras speech towards the end she mentions how our rampant consumerism is destroying the planet,2023-07-31 16:07:30
i liked barbie a lot but you are not wrong but that speaks more of the lego movies quality than barbies imo,2023-07-25 02:50:10
tbh i think this was a step beyond postmodern and more metamodernism,2023-07-21 14:25:19
i believe this is the direction they’re taking with barney it was described as “a24 like”,2023-07-21 06:47:33

ken did it better barbie obviously couldnt out dance ken,2023-08-04 06:31:36
yeah that tandem bike scene was cute but they really didnt add much to the story felt like they were only in the film because will ferrell was cast and they had to use him albeit poorly,2023-08-04 16:25:10

the shining is a weird one its so creepy and unsettling rather than scary at least to me its an amazing movie if you can muscle up the courage,2023-08-14 03:26:44
when barbie realized her memories were the moms not the kids and they were communicating telepathically the daughter goes are you shining right now,2023-08-21 00:10:18
well put about people deliberately missing the point just to be upset,2024-01-06 07:49:33
really because it seemed to me the movie showed the negative impact on the ken’s when only barbies were in charge and the negative impacts on the barbie’s when only ken’s were in charge,2024-01-08 08:05:09
the point was that margos character chose to be able to change and grow rather than stay in a place where everything is perfect and fun and happy forever she wants true equality and that will happen faster in the real world than barbieland the point was equality is the only way to fix some of the issues in society when ken was in the real world he found out about the patriarchy both are not good for society and that was the point thats why margo went to the real world and became human she wants true equality and thats more likely to be achieved in the real world before barbieland,2024-01-24 14:24:30
not that i agree with that,2024-01-07 22:06:46
 i didn’t notice that,2023-07-25 13:20:16
it’s definitely funny because it’s a joke because we as an audience know that men in the real world take for granted the fact that we’ll be respected but it is sad because in the movie we feel for and like ken it’s funny it’s a joke,2023-07-25 03:34:02
as a woman i found it both funny and sad for different reasons the way the movie played with the nuances of gender in both realities was so simple it was brilliant,2023-07-25 03:08:11
it is a joke about a doll,2023-07-25 14:08:32
"wait so does this mean the skipper incident was one where a little girl was playing with her babysitter barbie wishing that she had a real babysitter instead of her parents just abandoning her and her siblings at night

this movie played really fast and loose with how much you were supposed to actually think about the relationship between the barbieland and the real world",2023-07-24 09:12:29
im curious to know why you related to ken more than barbie,2023-11-12 16:45:20
i loved the film as an allegory of what boys and girls go through in adolescence even though ken and barbie are “adults” whatever that means since they’re not human they obviously are adolescent and boys and girls tend to have very different journeys of finding themselves and what’s right really stuck a cord for me,2023-07-21 16:28:15
being fed hyper masculinity is not actually what is going on the reality is that women reward and incentivise this hyper masculinity most men would get 0 love and 0 girls if they didnt try their hardest to be as masculine as possible,2023-07-21 16:43:31
" there was not one single relatable normal good man in any of the realities

allan would beg to differ",2023-07-21 17:24:29
its not surprising i can see how those dots connect but it is disappointing i dont think you leap to the all men are bad conclusion without bringing prior baggage and practically expecting the movie to have that message,2023-07-25 21:36:28
yeah i didn’t really get what you are describing there was a whole scene about ken needing to be his own person and the majority of the kens agreed one of the kens did talk about wanting to still define himself by his relationship to barbie to be fair though there was a barbie who wanted to be defined by her relationship to ken and i think that was the point you are free to be whoever you choose to be astronaut president house wife betacuck ultimately your life is in your own hands and there are no wrong choices that to me was the message,2023-07-21 17:09:03
"this whole issue couldve been avoided if the barbies and kens formed a united front to topple the mattel execs and establish a kentatorship of the barbietariat 

i am honestly not kidding that wouldve been the only politically sound way to end the movie i really liked the sympathetic reconciliatory tone of ken coming to terms with his identity but ofc it was all botched by the barbies still having absolute power in barbieland and the male mattel ceo still having absolute power in the real world super ",2023-07-21 23:37:51
that was not the point at all,2023-07-22 22:21:13
"to be fair the ken are promised some lowercourt judge positions and the narrator states that the ken will eventually work their way up to positions of power so that have an equalish place in society though i know i thats a very tell dont show moment and i wish we got to actually see that a little more

i also think its a bit hyperbolic to call them slaves secondclass citizen i think would be a better way to put it",2023-07-21 18:02:46
good point,2023-07-21 17:07:20
i think its more that kens are deeply mistreated and outright oppressed in barbieland and him realizing that it didnt have to be that way was making him happy,2023-07-30 00:13:39
see i think the movie to an extent at least agrees with you i think you’ve run a little long with it but there were very clear undertones of “two wrongs don’t make a right” the whole ken storyline was a juxtaposition of modern feminism over the past struggle faced by women ken was taken for granted and ken was hurt but that doesn’t make it right for him to return the favor so to speak we as the audience are meant to realize that a future must be forged together not every night needs to be girls night after all,2023-07-21 17:27:42

"its a major self report that you consider feminism political and if you think the feminist rant towards the end is fringe youre in for a surprise when you start hearing from women what they think of it 

there is absolutely a shared human experience especially for people in countries like the usa experiencing late stage capitalism but again usa where presumably much of the movies commentary is targeting is a country where only one gender has multiple aspects of their healthcare regularly publicly debated and made outright illegal in some states 

men absolutely dont go through what women go through",2023-07-21 16:31:01
nah,2023-07-21 16:29:45

did i say anything specifically about praise or whether one reaction was more positive than the other no this thread is treating it like a movie while tiktok is acting like a huge cultural tectonic plate has shifted and the patriarchy has been outted,2023-07-23 20:59:12
ok thank you i felt crazy for feeling like the ending was 23x longer than it needed to be the emotional returns on barbie crying diminished every time,2023-08-06 00:03:05
that’s the best kind of movie to experience as a kid one that you love but don’t totally understand and you can have a relationship with it for the rest of your life as you catch up with the movie,2023-08-05 15:04:26

i didnt ask them          my dad used to take my brother and i to grown up movies when we were kids we liked it but i recall some shoot outs on screen that really scared me    i guess its just something parents do maybe i did i dont remember     but the problem with barbie is that a barbie doll is for a wider kid range of ages while the movie is for older kids and really their parents  so parents may be tempted to take the little ones,2023-08-06 12:09:55

its not that deep allan is allan,2023-09-11 01:22:21
i think allan is a standin for the platonic ideal of the audience barbieland and the kendom have deep flaws that reflect the flaws of our own society how do we percieve our own views in the movie allan whether audiences agree with the barbieland matriarchy the kendome patriarchy or agree with something in between allan occupies all of those spaces and gives audiences an outlet for agreeing with the messages they perceive in the movie allan lets us associate with the plot despite competing views,2023-09-09 06:18:40
i think he was just supposed to be a gag no one notices him and hes just there in the background like the actual alan doll that most people dont even realize existed,2023-09-09 02:23:47
what she probably meant was “i don’t like movies that are political in a way i disagree with” i get what you’re saying but there’s plenty of people who transparently hate the feminist message of the movie that’s why so many right wingers particularly right wing men absolutely hate it,2023-11-06 05:11:46
"anyone getting upset over it is self reporting this film will be a massive red flag for anyone that actually hates it

"from my perspective it was a fun heavy handedness and honestly i think sometimes that’s necessary when making a point you feel really strongly about so that it doesn’t get taken the wrong way  a la fight club

but when they just started literally stating everything out loud  ie the america ferrera monologue  i couldn’t help but cringe maybe it would’ve felt more authentic if it came from a better developed character but that and the whole ruth sequence just really didn’t work for me at all",2023-08-04 10:36:04

possible but the ending of the movie is a very neutralgood kind of ending at least for barbie world  its kind of a happily ever after one where no men in the supreme court is okgood not a kens shown working to improve their self worth and rising through the ranks even the music choice is more upliftingempowering not sombersad 

part of this may just be that ending movies on a sad note is not good business but the message it gives isnt the best",2024-02-21 19:53:40

it was just a tongue in cheek reference to the whole we dont have genitals scene earlier in the movie and the other jokes related to that",2023-12-24 00:57:43
"the end was literally just a brick joke from the genital comment earlier in the movie that used a mundane and relatable but also slightly embarrassing medical necessity that women share and can relate to  no it was not an attack on transwomen 

and to your other comment down the chain about what happens to people who go through the portal to barbieland  its not confusing youre just overthinking it  go with the flow",2023-12-24 16:37:25
3  they needed to do some stuff  so that fans of the movie could say its deep,2023-12-22 06:10:30
on the kens crying being mocked  you often see that from these feminist type women like gerwig they’re all about claiming they want men to cry more and claiming men apparently want that yet there also constantly on about male fragility or fragile masculinity and use it basically as a schoolgirl style insult to belittle men as emotional  either because they actually are emotional or because it’s used as an insult,2023-07-30 10:01:54
"except everyone in barbieland is portrayed as an idiot too not just kens the woman president literally ends up being a trophy wife after ken tells her she should just be a trophy how is that not any different from how the kens were taken down their competence is only surface level its not the barbies who were smart either someone from the real world had to explain to them why they were being ridiculous of course its not a 11 because barbieland is the manifestation of how children think the world works if it wasnt clear by how juvenile it literally is 

also id argue will ferrell isnt even an idiot just a caricature of an old fashioned big businessman for example he was smart enough to realize that the kens showcasing the patriarchy as rad and cool was a bad thing despite the high sales so hes not just profitdriven hes also clearly familiar with barbieland he was genuinely invested in inspiring little girls in the least creepy way possible not to mention it wasnt just rebel barbies there were also rebel kens who understood the flaws of the ken patriarchy

as for womansplaining it makes sense in context for ken who again is just like barbie both are naive and have no idea what to do with their lives they need someone who can help them along it had to be barbie explaining to ken because barbies attention was the only thing he cared for same as barbie only listening to her real world owner

also the barbies banking on kens turning on each other was true until they naturally ended up being friends again showing that despite their flaws kens are totally capable of more 

as for the real world women theyre not even perfect in fact they are blatantly not perfect theyre just normal however the reality of normality is what shocks the childish and naive barbie into thinking deeper about herself could there have been more smart men sure id agree with that but only as an it would be nice thing not a dealbreaker for an ostensibly feminist movie about one of the symbols of childhood femininity",2023-07-29 22:03:48

"eh i think we can agree to disagree here because i don’t consider the ken’s incels 

i saw them as men who wanted to be considered important and valued the problem was that they got all of their self worth from how the barbie’s responded to them their initial inability to process their feelings and emotions in a healthy way resulted in the “kendom” 

the “i’m just ken” song was the shining realization that they don’t need other’s to tell them that they are awesome and that they just need to be themselves to achieve that inner feeling of fulfillment",2023-07-25 01:27:35

"i dont agree but thats fine

for one allan

for another ill refer back to one of my original points that ken was a sympathetic character on purpose that people like and relate to ken is not an accident

if the genders were reversed they are thats the point we do exist in a patriarchal system and as far as movies go so many come out that treat women as objects that exist to further men or teach them lessons oppenheimer came out the exact same day if you can see the sexism in barbie but not in oppenheimer that is the point of barbie",2023-07-26 03:43:37

greta gerwig said that scene was the heart of the movie when she was asked to cut it  the old woman is ann roth a costume designer,2023-07-31 04:47:56
i think the scene is funny too and i understand why people laugh its just more touching than funny for me we are just moved by different things,2023-07-31 04:01:09
yeah thats it exactly the second half was still good but the first half knocked it out of the park to the extent that the second half felt a bit disjointed and confused i wonder if they didnt really know how to end it and just had to pick something,2023-08-07 17:57:07
i had a completely different take namely the kens werent too busy fighting each other thats what the movies showed they fought each other and quickly realized hey why are we doing this for a woman what is the point it is a message a lot of younger guys get these days namely that they need to find and build themselves up and not just chase women around cinema has shown that men are not their job fight club but also not their girl barbie but if not that then who are they and barbie had a similar moment who did she want to be i dont think it really made big statements like that about the system as after all at least in the west men and women are equal,2023-08-08 22:38:49
"thats an interesting perspective im not an american so what i know about american law mostly comes from watching the west wing and reading the news but my understanding was that women are protected under the constitution i had to do a quick google but the 14th amendment says no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the united states nor shall any state deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws

it uses the terms citizen and person which apply equally to men and women 

unfortunately you currently have some supreme court justices who ignore the law scalia apparently says that nothing in the constitution prohibits discrimination against women but that doesnt make the law wrong the problem is with highlevel judges and politicians ignoring the law i mean theres nothing wrong with adding the era but you should be protected by law right now 

anyway i dont know a whole lot about us law only what ive dipped my toe into and you guys certainly need all the help you can get right now i cant believe whats going on there

but back to the topic at hand re ruths montage i think my problem was she set it up by saying she couldnt let barbie choose the real world without showing her what it was actually like and then gave her the most onesided view thats what i found jarring",2023-08-07 19:45:46
"women currently dont have equal rights

under the law they do there are some sexist expectations from society on them yes thats true but those expectations also come from other women also when it comes to abortion a lot of prolife moms oppose abortion and consider it ",2023-08-08 22:03:34
the message was clear but the plotline was a mess just watched it last night they jump from scene to scene with little explanation for why the characters state that things are such way with no explanation for why not that everything needs it but when the whole movie is this way its a bit much seems like no one writing the movie actually understood the internal logic they were using,2023-09-14 16:26:04
carl was completely superfluous he served no purpose the horses thing was random and almost kind of funny at some moments but not quite the random long song and dance numbers made no sense and served no purpose plus it seemed like they couldn’t decide if they wanted it to be a realistic or fantasy movie that was a bit sloppy i’m having some trouble articulating my thoughts but there was just so much thrown in that didn’t have a lot of purpose it was evident that the story was either rewritten or parts were left out and it also seemed like there was this battle going on between wanting the movie to be edgy and adult but also family friendly and inspiring to children and it just doesn’t seem like they pulled it off very well,2023-09-14 18:45:05
"i thought the message was really clear men rule the world for the most part via the patriarchy helpfully pointed out several times as the patriarchy by characters in the movie it was the opposite in barbieland

 so whats the message then that everyone everywhere is   
that the barbies are just as self involved as the big evil men in the real world",2023-09-14 22:43:44
props to billie eilish for composing and singing that haunting ode what was i made for that plays over barbie and ruths final goodbye i went straight to the barbie soundtrack on spotify on my commute back from the movie,2023-07-21 03:41:52
very much appreciate you saying that,2023-07-23 12:01:49
pretty sure thats the intention the ending ties in with a key takeaway from the film that women should just be allowed to exist without being politicized or having everything they do be taken as a statement going to the gynecologist is female specific but mundane  just let a girl exist in peace,2023-07-23 16:44:02
"which is the highest ratio its ever been and only very recent the female scotus justice was appointed in 1981 the first woman appointed to a federal bench was in 1921

"this has to be a joke right

kens were utterly and completely useless  women were not utterly and completely useless for the last couple millennia  sometimes  men and society often treated them like they were useless but they were usually the total opposite

they did insanely important things for society just without the credit  not just raising families and being the emotional support behind the scenes but everywhere including science business or politics as well",2023-09-09 13:03:42
" the movie explicitly says the kens will have the same rights as women in the real world

i found this bit kind of ironic to be honest ken asked for a supreme court seat and were denied one just before what you say was mentioned by the narrator havent there been women in the supreme court the past few decades",2023-09-09 15:32:18
"so yeah sort of like women for the last few millennia

this really ignores how much women did historically for the last few millennia lol",2023-09-08 03:36:47
"i dont know if they chose not to spend time with each other more that their entire purpose is to support barbie so they did that and nothing but that then barbie had the talk with him and said it doesnt all have to be about her

you also talk about the barbies being forced i might have missed that scene

you have a very interesting perspective when it happens to the kens its because they choose it when it happens to the barbies its because its forced

kens were definitely objects before they had no say in anything objectsaccessories in skimpy clothes with the kens being shirtless vs objects in skimpy clothes with the barbies in maid and cheerleader outfits  kens were serving barbies barbies were serving kens its the same

talking about who suffered more as objectsaccessories seems to be missing a lot of points to the movie

great movie though lots for women and surprisingly lots for men",2023-09-05 15:41:28
just finished watching the movie couldnt agree more,2023-09-04 18:20:49
alan was an actual real doll to be clear but i think he just means the awkward dude who doesn’t fit in with what the rest of the guys are trying to do so not ken,2023-07-21 23:55:47
i think alan represents the  coded men who don’t fit into the toxic ideals of masculinity and struggle to find their place in the world he’s not buff or charismatic like gosling ken simu ken ncuti ken etc so he struggles with the complete turnover of barbieland he is also not totally embraced by the barbies because at the end of the day he’s a male figure so he never truly fits in,2023-07-21 22:43:48
"first i thought he was  then a feminist ally but im not sure because its not clear what he wants at one point he was desperate to get out of barbieland but to do what

idk what is he supposed to represent",2023-07-21 22:30:48
a movie can have depressingserious themes while still being presented in a fun way see dr strangelove borat but im a cheerleader  etc etc,2023-07-27 19:05:27
it didnt do that at all,2023-07-27 20:05:43
that is not what the movie is promoting try again,2023-07-27 19:51:07
lol what the  are you talking about,2023-07-27 18:55:50
id love barbie and ken to be together and have an arc about learning to have a more mature and equal relationship i dont think it is anti men and woman being together since gloria and her husband seen to have a very cute relationship but yeah they definitely missed the opportunity to portray an relantionship with the main characters,2023-07-27 19:00:23

bro as good as ryan was in that movie they dont nominate any movies that arent super boring period dramas,2023-07-26 00:40:11
they werent saying its equality its meant to mirror our real world women begin to slowly step a foot through the door towards equality the kens are not put on the supreme court but they are giving a lower placement in the court system its a step forward also ken being able to cry and find himself is not just a benefit to feminist women but all men as we deserve to cry and find ourselves outside of constantly pursuing material things and women us men in real life have a hard time obtaining a sense of self without a woman on our arm feminism allows women to be themselves away from men feminism should also allow men to step away as well,2023-07-28 16:01:17
its a happy ending but its not equality  ken felt invisible  and disrespected i saw it as  a metaphor for how women were treated in the era when they werent even allowed to get a credit card or lease without a male cosigner they were accessories and not really seen as full people either an apology and acknowledgement is a step forward but its not equality,2023-07-28 11:13:55

what did you expect her to do instead,2023-07-28 05:28:04
"yeah i agree with you on this i feel like the people taking this as the perfect society are just completely misreading the film

look at gerwig herself  how many female directors like her have helmed big hollywood projects like this recently patty jenkins and anna bowden are two of the only ones that spring to mind where there are a dozen male directors working on blockbuster projects this year gunn mangold peyton reed etc",2023-07-31 13:03:58
you shouldn’t be happy with the kens being unequal at the end the point is to make you unhappy at the state of gender equality in the real world,2023-07-31 14:05:20
"it paints “equality” as a zero sum game with one gender always on top

i think that’s a pretty strange reading of the film if you asked gerwig what equality was i really don’t think she’d say that i don’t understand how the ken’s not having equal representation is presented as ‘win for feminism things are equal now’  when the barbie’s sign the constitution putting them back on top you can see how troubled margot is by this she’s learned how being underrepresented and being treated as lesser is harmful  which is why she reconciled with ken in the next scene and tried to build up his selfworth as an individual while also encouraging broader societal change 

like i say  the problem i have with the film is that it gets a bit messy after this point and becomes about feeling lost and lacking clear guidance more broadly  which is fine but feels like they overstuffed what was already leading to a fine ending

the point is the barbie world mirrors ours in the opposite way if you think the ken’s getting the same level of social and cultural standing in their world as women do in ours is a bad thing then it shows gender inequality exists and is a problem

the point is equality is a long standing issue that takes years to fix  the barbie land mirrors our world because we project our own views onto it",2023-07-31 07:02:34

super mario was the exact opposite of barbie in terms of how much it had to say about the world and the experiences of their creators,2023-07-29 19:38:10
ur a loser bro,2023-07-30 01:39:31
ehh it’s far more thematically interesting than mario tfa or a marvel flick imo i mean even if you completely disagree with the messaging or think it doesn’t effectively make its points the film clearly has something to say which is more than all of those can really claim could have been a safe boring ip adaptation but it’s more than that and it’s clearly resonated with a good amount of people,2023-07-30 15:49:36
that’s fair,2023-07-22 06:04:05

true but we never delved into any of that stuff though there should have been a scene with america getting overlooked or something else show dont tell right but the movie is over the top and isnt afraid to speak its message literally so im on the fence about some of the decisions,2023-07-22 07:33:57
weird to assume anything about my life lol nah i thought it was just normal teenage angst and hormones but idk it felt a bit more personal for it to just be that,2023-07-22 06:02:48

as a guy i am kinda on the fence here my main gripe was how in the end it turned to males vs females trope and how the barbieland constitution was voted on without kens present the right way i think would be to accept kens as same class citizens in barbieland also how it turned goslings ken love for barbie into find yourself message,2023-07-22 15:01:35
"i think they said supreme court and there are four women on it right now so that part didnt make sense for me

i actually thought it was only two before checking so yikes it definitely doesnt work now",2023-07-22 16:32:42
exactly the message is basically if you are a man or woman just live your own life rather than doing what society expects of you,2023-07-22 14:58:02
…because patriarchy is bad,2023-07-22 15:01:13
the movie wasn’t making a point that the ken were being treated equally just creating a parallel of what it took for women to have a voice in government in america to make you go like “huh that’s not fair oh wait that was how our society was built”  the ken were eventually going to get an equal voice similar to how women eventually got a voice in the real world is just a parallel to make you think about how it really was unfair,2023-07-22 23:24:01

there is clearly exceptions of course but in general women tend to be a lot more supportive of each other you go girl type of attitude when i find out my friends salaries if its higher than mine i internally feel some pain like i need to make as much or more than them or im not as worthwhile of a man its a  feeling and i dont know why i feel that way i should be happy my friends are making a lot of money but from talking to others they also feel similar like we are in a constant competition and thats built internally women may feel that but it is a lot less frequent when i was almost  by a woman several of my friends said bro why didnt you have  with her she was attractive i know for a fact if most girls said that to fellow girls they wouldnt get such a response its clearly a prevalent problem with men suicide rate is higher for men as well and its often why people who feel like loners aka redpillers gravitate to idiots like andrew tate so they can feel like a top man",2023-07-22 20:54:07
"idk as a man i often feel like im not valued for being a dude and instead valued by how much access to power i have ie money social status raw strength etc

this is something ive heard from my guy friends as well

i know that this is something women struggle with as well but idk i feel like greta gerwig read bell hooks or something i just related to ken and his path and loved the compassion expressed towards him as well as the insistence that it was work he had to do on his own",2023-07-22 21:52:57
you have to look at the kenbarbie dynamic as flipped gender expectations here barbie’s saying ken’s not defined by his girlfriend because in the real world women are regularly defined by who they’re dating in a flipped reality where women barbies are supreme the kens think they exist only to serve barbie it’s making the audience think about what subservience means and how toxicnonsense it is regardless of gender,2023-07-22 22:57:17
"that was simply for the empowering women message not to dunk on men and the reasons the kens were how they were is because no one cares about a ken doll in comparison to a barbie doll barbies are important ken dolls are not and the film uses that to put a message out for both women empowerment and also for men feeling validation with who they are

its not hard to grasp many countries in the world still women are not allowed to have a career even in america it wasnt that long ago where women were expected to be mothers and not have careers like being a doctor or a lawyer we have never had a woman president in the history of this country its getting better than before but come on dude where do you think we were as a society 30 years ago and even today in many countries let women have something 

x200b

the anger you feel was intended for people like you thats how many women had to feel that message was clear the movie is not trying to say lets  the rights of men all men are idiots if thats the message you got you should rewatch it",2023-07-22 20:46:38
"i guess my point is the patriarchy isnt a production of men but a production of society in history if there is a war leaders are selected who are willing to fight and lead their armies as men are often selected for such roles these trends continued not saying all trends were good

the barbie movie seems to act as though the patriarchy never held a purpose other than sexism it seemed to imply all male leaders are sexist and we must stop them i just wish there was a higher expression of unity

ironically i get its a parody but  people are really taking the messages of the film seriously",2023-10-23 22:38:12
"i agree with a lot of what you said but felt the kens “brainwashing” was understandable in a sense i’ve seen people who were once independent burn out and kind of start going along with what their partner wants being relieved of responsibility feels nice and making your partner feel good then in turn validated by them feels really even better

they fell into it easy because they were tired of completely running barbieland i think it’s implied that letting kens step up will take some of the pressure off and leave you with ultimately stronger barbies and kens",2023-07-21 07:52:11
its so disappointing that they spend such a short time outside couldve milked the fish out of water shenanigans also being this on the nose feels like its just preaching to the choir,2023-07-21 08:38:45
" manipulating the kens into fighting themselves felt really forced and left us both with a bad taste in our mouths

its very hard to shake the suspicion that there was another version of the script where they actually deal with the moms depression and instead it was mandated that the movie end with a big finale  and so we got a beach scene and a clumsy social critique instead of a more personal more consistent movie

but it seemed to work for people which is why hollywood people write the checks and i dont",2023-07-28 14:33:51
"i particularly didnt like that the barbies were shown to be happy with kens patriarchy that was such a weird choice thematically at least in the absence of any brainwashing being shown on screen you could argue the film is anti feminist if you view the status quo of matriarchy in barbieland as roughly equivalent to patriarchy which the film seems to do it is at the very least a prostatusquo movie that views change as radical unreachable and extreme

also many many comments in this thread are talking about how cool it was that mattel let them do this this movie absolutely talked mattel up it was a glowing branding spin on mattel that i am beyond confident they are perfectly happy with their story line was in the movie as what is essentially corporate propaganda its wendys on twitter but its a toy brand on the big screen instead",2023-07-21 07:28:20
"yeah the solution was horrifying 

to a well adjusted individual who might get what gerwig was going for its fine

just because a movie isn’t “for” you doesn’t mean it’s bad",2023-07-22 15:11:54

its easy going fun great costumes and decorations great actors unexpected twists whats not to like and keep in mind im a guy and i thought im not even the target audience for this but kens arc was incredible",2023-07-21 08:54:30
"i also think it relies on a good message as protective shielding like you cant really criticize the movie because then it feels like you disagree with the message 

im also just confused by the motherdaughter subplot it feels manipulative by tugging at our emotions",2023-07-21 03:27:20
"it’s fantastically camp but all these people
lauding it as like peak feminism is extremely white and tone deaf",2023-07-21 15:45:38
" i think as a feminist film the message was too on the nose and lacked subtlety it was a bummer greta gerwig chose such a blackandwhite approach to the issue with no depth

i thought similarly as ferrara was going through her monologuebut at a certain point i was just like  it you know what sometimes what needs to be said just needs to be said

not every theme has to be artistically hinted at over the course of the movie especially ones as important as this",2023-07-21 04:30:28
pretty sure the on the nose message was very intentional on gurwigs part it adds to the overall campness the rest of the movie is going for everything is over the top and dialled up to 11,2023-07-21 08:02:26
the first half felt nearly immaculate  and it never stopped feeling funny but the while the jokes kept landing the wall  slayed me the storytelling just kept feeling more and more off,2023-07-28 14:51:56
i dont like how we only got most of the pie instead of all of it,2023-08-10 20:28:47
you perfectly summed up my thoughts the style and pizzazz of the movie are fantastic and the comedy in the first half is great but the core of the movie is too plainly stated also barbieland is now just women in power while taking away the ken’s right to vote i guess,2023-07-21 19:36:56

"commentary was as heavyhanded as could be imagined it felt like a sermon and not all of the messaging was positive imho i’d advocate more of an “equality of genders” perspective rather than one so obviously adversarial to masculinity in any form especially obvious in the last 45 min sequence 

and the plot was about as bad as you’d expect for a movie who’s starting point was “toy doll” it was clear the story was just there as backdrop for the sermon 

there were some funny moments the set design was killer and gosling  the dance numbers were pretty entertaining pretty bad movie overall",2023-07-22 05:50:24

youre lost lol get some help,2023-07-22 15:37:45
this is great perspective and i very much appreciated the insight it’s amazing how many interpretations of a movie we can have and what people can get out of the same piece of art hence why bigger movies are always great to read perspectives on thank you for this,2023-07-23 14:50:54
men and women are more than the sum of the parts of what society tells them to be i think that’s the main point being human is a difficult thing with pain and a variety of experiences we aren’t just the things society tells us to be hopefully that makes sense but movies are always art forms for interpretation,2023-07-23 14:53:47
please cry harder,2023-07-23 14:44:08
"i interpreted the kens being shallow and sorta dumb as another manifestation of the whole role reversal theme 

for example there used to be an actual discontinued barbie doll with a bunch of stereotypically girly voice lines one of those straight up being math is hard which reinforced this socially constructed stereotype of women being dumb and shallow compared to men in this case making the kens these shallow dudebro archetypes is supposed to make you feel mad as a male because thats how females have apparently felt for so long under the patriarchy with the reinforcement of these stereotypes

as for the ken crying scene at the end i honestly just took it as stylized campy acting margot robbie seemed to have a little bit of it too with her falling on the dreamhouse lawn dramatically and stuff she just has a little bit more of a serious take on it at some parts but i do agree with you – it couldve been played a lot more seriously overall to make it less patronizing towards men and make the message have more of an impact on the male audience 

i loved the movie but i admit that there are so many ways the messaging couldve been improved to connect with men more its a story written by a woman intended to educate about the female experience and be for everyone at the same time its a really ambitious set of goals for a movie so of course these messages got a bit lost in translation at some parts i think even just small acting choices couldve made it a lot better",2023-08-08 08:02:46
"after the first 20 minutes or so i was fully expecting your idea to be the angle of the movie to attack the idea of utopia use barbieland vs reality as two opposite patriarchalmatriarchal utopias and show how anyones utopia is inevitably unlivable for others i also agree that kens in the movie are not presented as real equals to barbies but i really disagree with your overall point that the movie is biased against either gender so let me elaborate

first main thought nothing in barbieland is a reflection of reality its an inversion and exaggeration kens arent representing a whole gender just like barbies arent kens are a particular sort of bimboification of men and at different points in the film they showcase both toxic traits and exaggerated femalegaze traits as well as genuine positive traits as they grow barbies and kens are both caricatures we use as a counterpoint to reality  this is called out explicitly in the ending dialogue yes barbies are more aspirational but that also comes with its own shadow side as described in the monologue scene to me the core message is that after going through their growth arcs barbie isnt barbie any more and likewise and ken is dropped for ken is me and kenough neither of them has to be the caricature anymore so as i see it the point of the film isnt to compare men and women directly but to pick at the edifices we have built up around particular ways of being men and women

second main thought speaking of those edifices i do think the movie is more confident in how it presents positive femininity than how it presents positive masculinity where should kens go from here is left as more of an open question i think this is appropriate and accurate given where we are at societally multiple generations have critiqued and rebuilt ideas of femininity i think the same is happening with masculinity but on a later timeline so were still in the dark night of the soul phase of that process thinking hard about what positive masculinity looks like as distinct from just being feminine which is often used as a lazy fallback is a great angle for the movie to push in the current context",2023-08-08 11:30:45
"sorry in advance since this is going to be long but im trying to reply to all your points in more detail but which part showed men being morons aside from the part with the corpos not hopping the fence which yeah of course that part would be goofy since its will ferrell and ken misinterpreting the patriarchy which i thought was poking fun at how amazing some people think mens lives are because of it and ken taking it in a literal sense same with when he expected a job just for being a man bc thats what he understood from the patriarchy book he read maybe i missed some part in there but i dont think i saw any part ripping on men just for the sake of ripping on men the part with ken crying didnt seem comedic to me none of my friends laughed and neither did anyone else in the theater laugh during that point i think the only part that could be considered comedic of that was ken getting all happy when he kept thinking that barbie was comforting him out of wanting a relationship or love out of him like where he grabbed her by the waist and she was like no thats not what i meant then going back to being sad the comedic part of that was the erratic hot and cold coming from ken not him crying maybe i misinterpreted that but him actually crying didnt seem like it was comedic to me or anyone else it was the other events occurring that were slightly comedic but thats what led to his whole revelation moments later that he doesnt need barbie and that its not  its barbie and ken its its barbie and its ken 

the only thing i thought was a little too much was barbie being assaulted almost immediately when in the real world by getting catcalled and spanked but to be fair that is still something that does happen in the real world to women i dont think it was trying to say all men are like this because otherwise the whole movie men would be trying to get in her pants it was just showing some men are like that i do wish that it showed women doing something like that to ken since as a male victim of assault from women wouldve been nice to say hey they also brought up the male side of that issue too but at the same time i dont want something like a barbie movie to be discussing serious topics of assault in an otherwise cheeky movie

i dont think the movie was trying to tell men how they need to change i think it was trying to tell them that they are good enough without having to succumb to narracistic women which barbie was for the first half of the movie to ken which was portrayed in a slightly comedic way with the whole guitar on the beach song being push by matchbox20 and with the whole its boys night being a reference to how barbie said every night is girls night when ken was trying to spend time with her at the beginning of the film how ken kept trying to impress barbie or find ways to spend time with her while she kept just brushing him off or being rude to him etc and that they dont need to live up to unrealistic expectations of others andor women which was also applied to the womans side 


the thing about the barbies picking apart the kens doing what they enjoy and finding male interests i thought was the movies way of showing off toxic femininity much like how it later shows off toxic masculinity it doesnt outright tell you this is toxic with a big sign but thats the point youre supposed to pick up on by interpretation if someone watched that and thought it was ok they arent realizing that the joke isnt about men its about toxic women

and yes to answer your question i am a man and i also am a man who is getting tired of the repeated bashing of males in media barbie might not be perfect but its a good start when you look deeper than surface level unless i misinterpreted the whole movie it seemed like it did great at shedding light on both genders issues without patronizing either side too much and in the end has a wholesome message for both genders if the movie just crapped on men the whole time and made kens the antagonists the entire time or crapped on women the whole time etc i would have a different outlook on the movie but it didnt as far as i saw it flips back and forth between kenmen and barbiewomen being the antagonists showing the damaging sides of both genders and how their actions can affect the other in a harmful way i do though feel like some people are definitely taking this movie way out of context like for example the whole break up with your boyfriend if he doesnt like barbie trend crowd not only are they doing something pretty unhealthy in a relationship with such a weird ultimatum but theyre also completely missing that this movie is about mens issues too i think the problemright now is too many sources are claiming this as a womans movie or a women vs men movie which is such a surface level interpretation of this movie and also negatively impacts the chances of men watching this with an open mind like i said i went into the movie expecting it to be trash i was apart of that group im not insinuating that you are since it seems like you actually watched the movie but i do feel like the messages are deeper than most people are realizing


 at the end to find some common ground with your argument i will say this i dont think its fair that the womens issues are very easy to interpret and understand while most of the mens issues are subtle and hard to pick up on since they arent in your face like the womens issues are but they are still there in a movie advertised more for women than men centered around a franchise that was advertised more for women than men the fact that they even touched on mens issues in the first place considering its material is a surprise i can understand some mens distaste for other feminist centered media which just turns into a bashing men fest but i really dont think barbie falls into that category its not perfect of course but its a good start and i appreciate that it isnt just a men bad or a women bad piece of media its a decent movie that involves healthy feminism and healthy masculisum along with their toxic counter parts you dont have to like the movie and youre entitled to your opinion but i really do think this is a positive step in the right direction and is far from being another sexist film it did something somewhat ambitious for its genre by even considering shedding light on mens topics and while yes of course it didnt delve into all of them i think it did a good job at trying to be fair to men and women i do wish it showed more of mens issues and took it a little more seriously but it still did a good enough job better than what i expected",2023-08-08 08:47:27
what was the mattel ceo plot line about exactly what purpose did it serve,2023-08-16 10:35:09
oppenheimer can probably tell it’s plots coherently tho something barbie struggled with,2023-08-17 06:18:31

"uchexmagazine

thats how the movie starts we really dont see her original life 

and i dont think we saw her develop a desire to be human she just said it we have to see it we never see her choose adventure and self exploration she goes to the real world hates it goes to mattel to be put back decides to flee  and then quickly goes back to barbie world we dont see any of that",2023-08-06 15:12:42

youre a gigantic idiot if you didnt think that movie is good,2023-08-22 23:54:17
as do most people that saw it not sure why the shocked tone,2023-08-21 14:43:04
i really dont think it would have made any sense for the movie to end with a genderequal utopia when one of its major themes is that being a person in society comes with inherent complexity instead it ends on a note that highlights that we still do not live in gender equal society and thats something we have to work towards which is good imo,2023-07-22 02:23:20
yes ive been trying to figure out the wording to explain how the ending let me down it started off as a clever humorous commentary about society and i was thinking that barbie ken and the humans character arcs would all converge and grow into how we can do better for ourselves and for each other but it rather stayed on the us vs them train,2023-07-21 19:27:07
"it also landed strange for me that the way to overthrow the kens is to take advantage of theirhelpfulness and passion

in addition the movie seemed to imply that women are easily brainwashed into becoming kenslaves and cant think for themselves im surprised so many people took this movie as a positive message for feminism when what i saw was the opposite",2023-07-22 16:00:16
"i agree with you but at the same time i think theres a kneejerk reaction to being told that women can want equality and power  but not too much power or else youre taking power from the men you cant want girls to run the world as a power fantasy think of how men will feel about that

obviously the main goal is equality but i think that the fact that theres so much backlash to female power fantasies for not including men enough is eerily reminiscent of the social conditioning where women have to consider men in nearly every aspect of their life we had to have a significant plotline about male validation in a barbie movie ffs",2023-07-21 20:39:05
yeah as a father with a daughter on the way i want her to learn strength through conviction compassion courage and boldness this film although a source of a form of woman empowerment is not what i would want my daughter learning as the script of being a powerful woman of which i’ve seen many examples in my wife sister mother mentors and friends,2023-07-21 19:56:12
i agree i think the reason they did that is to stay realistic to how hard power is to give up — so in a way they did leave the door open for them to have supreme court judges but that they’d have to work their way up from a smaller nomination which was very similar to how women had to make their way in society after the gender movement in the 70s,2023-07-23 17:26:25
"you do realize all the reasons youre upset at the portrayal of men in the film are exactly what women have gone through which is the point

all the anger you feel about the inequality and men being shallow and vapid is exactly how women have felt throughout the decades as they were labeled as dimwits too emotional not capable of most jobs the trophies of men etc

the entire point is to flip the narrative and show men how women feel in the real world the fact youre upset over how men are portrayed is half the point the part youre missing is the empathy to realize this is exactly what women went through so now you know how they feel p

but tons of men are still up their own butts and only focus on theyre making men look bad thats not fair and stopping there

which is the equivalant of a women telling you how your actions upset her and in response you yell at her for making you feel bad by pointing out what you did and thus now make it about how you are upset over what she did p

thats what all these the movie treated men badly comments are

you guys are completely ignoring the point to learn and understand that that is how men have made women feel for decades and instead getting upset barbie for daring to point that out to you and make you feel bad",2023-07-23 22:39:46
"i’ll give you the last point — however i will say living in a patriarchy i already encounter women hating material several times before some rap music is literally example number one almost every movie made prior to 1960 does not have a strong female character wizard of oz might be the rare exception 

the point wasn’t to insult or hate on men — it’s to explain to men how it feels to be a woman living today even now you’re explaining the history of barbie to me an american woman who grew up with barbie  

barbie has been a feminist icon that’s just a fact there’s always been people who protest things but barbie was never married owned her own things and had so many careers she was an astronaut before women could have credit cards that’s the way the founder intended her before men took over the company and rebranded barbie",2023-07-23 17:23:06

i don’t think the movie tries to divide at all i think it actually does the opposite— that a much better society is one where both genders have equal standing and are appreciated for their individual talents and not grouped by gender,2023-07-23 17:27:36
"i mean an oppressed group inacted a revolution and then was crushed by their oppressors dividing them

and then when this oppressed group asked for more rights at the end of the film and were denied

from an allegorical perspective i get it cos the ken’s don’t get rights until women do

but in universe it just seems like a  move",2023-08-06 22:43:42
yeah that’s fair the godfather explaining joke was hilarious,2023-08-06 19:38:11
"all real world men and kens were written as significantly stupider than their female counterparts it’s hardly hidden what way should that be taken what way would women take a single film gender wide portrayal of that nature

it was kind of a false support for men imo for instance in the scene where ken is crying and barbie tells him it’s alright to cry  ken wails in a comedic over the top way which is clearly meant to be funny contrast that with barbie crying which is a serious sympathetic moment so the movie is telling us it’s alright for men to cry and yet at the same time tells us it’s a joke when men cry

it hits the feminist beats of “patriarchy is bad for men too and once it’s gone men will be able to cry more like they supposedly want to”  but it’s a hollow sentiment coming in a movie in which all the men are morons who need to change their ways and are the butt of every joke
the message of sympathy for men was more of a show of a message of sympathy for men  a show that would appeal to feminist women rather than actual good natured sympathy",2023-08-06 20:16:29
why it made an effort to point out mens issues the same way as it did womens and showed its ok for men to be sensitive too i too am a man by the way it wasnt hating on men imo,2023-08-06 20:14:30

it threw me off for them to joke theyd have as much rights as women in the real world only one person on the supreme court etc i thought the point they were making was that everyone deserved respect,2023-07-22 13:42:50
the barbies were really all so flat like the kens all had different personalities to work from but other than main barbie whos personality was existential crisis and weird barbie who was weird i couldnt tell you about any of the rest of them president barbie reinforces the subjugation of kens i guess and also says  nobel laureate barbie wrote a book,2023-07-25 16:54:48
although this was the intent i thought it was a miss not to make barbieland an idealized society of what the world could be especially since they don’t need to deal with many of the real world factors that help to enforce the patriarchy,2023-07-27 12:21:37

its a movie that deliberately shows men as exaggerated versions of the way the film industry regularly depicts women you are not supposed to like the way ken is written you are not supposed to have a high opinion of the intelligence of the mattel ceo you are not supposed to be comfortable with how easily the kens are convinced to fight amongst themselves over women that deliberately pitted them against each other you are not supposed to like any of that thats the point you are mad about men being shown the way women have been since forever good now apply that next time you seehear a woman say she gets treated like an object or next time someone tells you they feel uncomfortable with how their gender or race is being portrayed in a particular type of entertainment whether movie tv show book or play when someone says to you im so tired of 2 dimensional female characters either existing only as an accessory to men or being so clearly strongwoman that its repulsive actually listen you dont like it neither do we thats the point,2023-08-09 09:30:23
" every ken and real world man is written as a  

i think thats just because barbieland and everyone in it is a bit simpleminded and childlike after all the super intelligent barbies like the president novelist nobel prize winners etc all fall for kens brainwashing pretty easily and that brainwashing seems like it could just talking about how cool horses and beer are and that the barbies can then rely on the kens for things which is not something youd figure a nobel prize winner or president would just fall into",2023-08-08 11:17:18

"ordered thank you 

i am kenough",2023-07-24 05:29:21
"i totally agree with everything you said 

the movie thinking ken was a role reversal to highlight how mistreated women are

i thought this too especially near the end ken has a scene where he stops being a dumb himbo for a second and honestly opens up to barbie and tells her something along the lines of do you see how it feels to be lesser and ignored do you see why i did all this to barbieland i wanted to be treated better like he was dead serious and not joking at all 

which is a call back to earlier in the film when the little girl asks where do kens live in barbieland and barbie is dismissive and goes i honestly dont know  like  kens are mistreated th

and i was like wow that is so brilliant  to make us think ken is the villain and draw parallels to womens suffrage and all that but they never went anywhere with it 

they go on to show that him wanting to change barbie land is wrong while at the same time they have barbie telling the other barbies how oppressed they are even though they just had a barbie matriarchy 

and in the end all the kens just accept their position in barbieland and go back to having an allwoman leadership and only woman in power and noone to speak for kens rights kens still dont have a place in barbieland

which is ridiculous because feminism is about equality the ending shouldve had barbies and kens on the leadership team there should never be just one gender in power no matter which gender thats like arguing that men shouldnt be teachers or nurses because those professions are female dominated and should stay that way thats still inequality 

im all for girl power but its a weird message to push in the movie when its shown to actively be hurting the ken minority they couldve just cut out the parts of the ken mistreatment and the movie would be lessmean",2023-07-26 17:07:10
making ken both represent women in the real world while he was a underclass in barbie land and also the patriachy is really giving mixed messaging like how can women identify with that when he then turns into a massive   and how can men get that message that it’s not nice to be second class when kens then portrayed as a  who is in the wrong for doing something about his own oppression  and also held up as an image of what’s wrong with men,2023-07-26 19:16:49
"i think that it was never going to be a super indepth look at feminism and for people who wanted that from the film i understand how it would totally fall short for me watching the movie it felt like the barbies and kens were often how young preteens imagine the world to be neither barbie nor ken the margot and ryan versions were especially deep thinkers but both went on a somewhat coming of age that young preteens go through for barbie greta gerwig said that she was somewhat influenced by the book reviving ophelia a fantastic book that i recommend and a main thesis of the book is the change that girls go through as they become aware of all of the hard stuff that the real world puts on girls and women for ken i saw his change as the incelred pill movement that young boys can go throughthere are a lot of things that can pull young boys into this movement that appears to be attractive to them telling them that men should be powerful and should be entitled to all these things again these were somewhat shallow views since at heart this was a movie that was trying to accomplish a bunch of other things as well 
  
i felt like the message of the movie is that change is really hard and slow but is a worthy goal to keep pushing for and dreaming of i also felt like the message is that dreaming of equality ie through play with barbies isnt enough that you have to work for change in your life as well and that working for that change as an ordinary person ie stereotypical barbie as opposed to president barbie is enough and ok 
  
i also thought that there were a lot of more subtle feminism messaging as well that i liked such as toxic masculinity harms men who dont fall into the stereotypical masculine mold allan magicearing ken and sugar daddy trans women are women having cast a trans woman as a regular barbie with zero commentary life experience on women is beautiful while i think that they could have done more with the diversity in all respects it was also nice to see better inclusiveness than i expected
  
i think its absolutely ok if this movie didnt connect with you a film will never be all things for all people i loved this movie because i did like the messaging for what it was and i thought that it was honestly peeing in my pants funny the choreographed dance number the sight gags the side barbies im just ken the matchbox 20 serenade",2023-07-26 16:44:30
i think it doesn’t have a solution in such like creating a world where there’s common ground not perfect but that is actually equal in barbie land but i think that’s part of the message as long as we favor one gender more than the other we’ll never really have a common ground this is why we saw ken feel what a lot of women felt and then showed what barbie felt in response to him and to how the real world treats women and how we can treat each other,2023-08-12 05:28:25
the theme is literally spoken to you through ruth at the end the movie is about the  that we have injected into our societies because of the discomfort of being human,2023-09-13 00:19:28
i didnt hear this part either,2023-07-31 08:59:10
ive genuinely missed that part where did they say that thank you in advance,2023-07-31 07:06:26
"interesting but i would argue it’s to parody the way virtually only one kind of female body type has been deemed acceptable in movies for 100 years  you see lots of dudes of different ages and body types starting in movies but the women are nearly all rail thin super models 

ie george costanza vs the whole cast of love interests in seinfeld

weird to think that the point is that acceptable male bodies are too limitedcontrolled",2023-07-30 13:18:07
or maybe they just didn’t think about making  kens so didn’t bother and there’s nothing more to it,2023-07-30 07:44:07
kind of a bully i mean her other classmates clearly seems to be scared of her maybe she is not bullying them physically or stealing their lunch money but the social and emotional bullying is arguably worse,2023-09-05 01:52:31
"a bit hawkward for that to be the end scene when they had a real trans barbie in the film like the final bit is another funny for sure genitals joke sort of undercutting a lot of contemporary ideas about gender in the first place   


i laughed in the theater still think its funny but it was an interesting example i think of how they really prioritized the humor over paying off a lot of the deeper more complex ideas they were throwing around for the first 2 acts to sort of shift gears to a bit of an unearned third act that left most of those interesting bits out to dry",2023-07-23 05:08:26

quite literally the original comment did not say that you just interpreted it that way…,2023-07-22 03:01:03
put down the guitar,2023-07-22 02:10:55
no i said if they’re mad at it that’s not disliking something that’s being noticeably angry like a lot of people in the comments are i would actually understand why people didn’t like it,2023-07-22 02:01:22
the way it was utterly quiet during her speech the lack of any background track made the moment doubly awkward and forced i can appreciate stylistic flourishes like that but it didnt fit the tenor of the film nor the moment,2023-08-03 06:02:42
the gender stuff was because ken was also going through his own identity crisis,2023-08-01 04:52:18
yeah you get to know more about ken than barbie you see them interact more their friendships come out more and the rivalry between ken and ken is amazing,2023-08-03 12:41:04
as much as i liked margot in this role i feel that barbie could have been played by any of her contemporaries whereas im genuinely struggling to think who could have played ken as well as gosling,2023-08-04 13:28:57
"its like the movie didnt understand its own message

what the  was with that vo line about margot robbie being too beautiful for the role implying she is too beautiful to feel selfconscious how feminist

where is the transphobia tho,2023-08-01 23:53:20
how so,2023-08-01 23:22:51
a doll turning into a human is transphobic got it makes so much sense,2023-08-02 23:08:07
for a while there i thought mattel was run by old kens that no one wanted to play with thats why they were so threatened by barbie breaking into the real world,2023-08-24 17:03:36
that moment was like when stan lee appeared in marvel movies  its a little easter egg its a little nod to continuity  just because you as a dude didnt get it doesnt mean that it was bad—the same way if someone didnt recognize stan lee in a marvel movie it wouldnt mean that scene was bad,2023-11-14 19:35:46
"that was the first old woman shes ever seen she sees a woman with ragged hair and wrinkles and still sees her beauty its a lot of character growth from how she saw weird barbie before being awakened to the possible range of emotions 

plus in a world of you dont know youre beautiful thats what makes you beautiful its really nice when someone fully accepts themselves and knows their own beauty",2023-10-24 08:03:06
"i think this scene was her true but barely acknowledged message 

this was less a movie about the patriarchy and more a movie of a young woman turning into a woman it’s a hardtoexplain concept but the idea of real life purely for the sake of living is a beautiful message accepting growing old accepting death also accepting life this scene and the hand holding scene conveyed this well 

but it waaas a mini movie within a movie there’s barbie’s movie which is actually a short coming of age movie and then there’s ken’s zany comedy in there that was the rest of the movie 

i enjoyed them but there was a bit of tonal whiplash 

it felt like the ken movie was the movie the producers wanted and greta slipped in her coming of age movie i think she had to fight for the old lady scene",2023-10-24 10:35:35

do you remember when i’ve been paying close attention and haven’t heard or seen it at all in fact i just started watching with subtitles on and during the car chase scene there’s a caption when she talks and it actually says “sasha’s mom”,2023-11-16 15:13:27
i think the movie pulled its punches when it comes to mattel criticisms it takes the easy shot of “maybe it was naive to think making barbie an astronaut would actually solve sexism” but at the same time it portrays the mattel executives as well meaning in their attempts if bumbling and misguided but it ignores that mattel wasn’t actually well intentioned they were trying to sell toys and it’s hard to divorce that from the fact that this movie including its criticisms of mattel exists to revitalize the barbie brand and sell more toys i think it rides the “a toy can’t solve everything” message hard while only paying lip service to barbie’s issues with minority representation and negative contributions to the meaning of femininity,2023-12-23 15:34:14
"did we watch the same movie

the kens arent even allowed representation on the supreme court they still have no belongings no homes no money and no power even alan the best represented male in the movie remains secondary to the barbies and their power over barbieland

it’s especially funny because the thesis statement of the movie was essentially that neither patriarchy’s or matriarchy’s work let’s find a harmonious balance for ken and barbie

the movie ends with them reverting to a matriachry and flat out denying equal representation to the kens",2023-07-24 12:53:41
"its just my opinion on what is valid and what isnt im open that others disagree but i feel bad that some men cant enjoy the humor but thats their loss i guess 

i think mean girls is arguably the best comedy of the 21st century thus far and its entirely a critique of women especially high school girls and their willingness to break each other down if there were women who had a problem with it id definitely argue that they have an inability to look in the mirror and accept some selfcriticism

thats ignoring things like how comedy relies a lot on punching up instead of punching down always has if you or others think that were on an equal playing field i can understand why they think that the humor in this film isnt punching up 

with that said i would stress again that regardless if you cant find a way to enjoy laughing at the some of the  stereotypes of men they were poking fun at idk take things less seriously but thats my take and others are allowed their own i just find it kinda surprising",2023-07-23 18:54:36
the whole “fragility” thing is just a buzzword to shut down men expressing when something is offensive to or bothers them which is pretty ironic seeing as it’s coming from feminist types who apparently think men shouldn’t be held back from expressing thoughts or feelings,2023-07-23 16:07:46
shapiros got 43 mins on why the barbie movie is bad and a lot of people are on the bandwagon youre allowed to complain whenever you want and im allowed to make fun of people when i think theyre being ridiculous but weve got differing viewpoints and thats ok i wish you the best,2023-07-24 02:11:12
"what are you talking about roles reversed roles reversed is the real world lol 

barbie land is a matriarchy — the ken’s fighting for recognition is like the feminist woman’s movement

the real world is a patriarchy when ken felt like he could have any job we wanted — but didn’t feel that way in barbieland — reverse that for women today",2023-07-23 16:53:37
thats not the message of the movie at all she literally apologizes to ken for taking him for granted and encourages him to be his own person outside of his identity in relation to her,2023-07-23 16:27:15
there were also two  jokes or rather lack of  jokes in the movie but they were as harmless as can be,2023-07-22 21:35:04
that and the kens beaching eachother off,2023-07-22 21:25:16
is it because of content or themes we are a pretty progressive family and i dont think the themes are gonna stick with her near as much as the content,2023-07-22 20:22:49
it feels like it was written by an ai,2023-07-23 01:00:07
for me its the font,2023-07-23 00:31:32
wrong that woman is not barbara handler it is a longtime friend and costume designer of the movies director,2023-07-25 07:26:30
totally agree and im also impressed by her reply i know she is so confident and natural,2023-07-25 07:24:51
this is why i didnt say put her on the board i suggested earning a high position on the board  whatever that looks like even if it was years in the future or whatever that doesnt look like maybe she wants to get an education instead or work somewhere that no education is required or do nothing at all i just would have liked some glimpse in to her realworldness beyond the gynecologist appointment,2023-07-24 17:51:06
true and thats why dont mind the gynecologist scene in there i just wish we also got to see more of her journey in the real world beyond her now having female anatomy and what she might do or not do maybe in a sequel,2023-07-24 16:44:57
to me her ending up at the gynecologist ironically reduces her to a body part the writers had no idea what they were doing,2023-07-24 16:43:52
i appreciate that i had been thinking about these things for two days after seeing the movie and decided to just write it all out because it helps me process figured id post it here because others might feel the same or different i like hearing opposing views too,2023-07-24 17:29:37
thanks and yeah barbie should definitely be the focus but ken could have had a little more than beach,2023-07-24 19:27:30
thanks i have spent quite a bit of time thinking about this lol totally agree that it was so close to being amazing but fell short with plotmessages i hadnt thought about ken going with barbie to navigate the real world  that would have been so interesting too sets and costumes were out of this world great,2023-07-24 17:06:26
i think ken will get his own movie where we can see this happen and that’s why it didn’t occur in this film,2023-07-25 01:30:17
i can see that i also think some things in the movie were overexplained to the point of somewhat annoying repetitiveness instead of just letting the audience watch and come to the conclusion on their own,2023-07-24 19:29:25
i first remember reading long long time ago in college from the famously acerbic writer dorothy parker18931967 the rhyming refrain “men seldom make passes at girls who wear glasses”,2023-07-24 19:19:03
except the big lebowski is a superior work in every single way,2023-07-23 23:07:06
barbies talk with ruth at the end was absolutely devasting imo  it was far from a lets end this movie somehow speech and much more of a culmination of everything shown in the movie until that point,2023-07-23 23:24:13
what do you mean just about every main character except maybe will farrell had an arc and i felt they were all pretty well developed for what they are,2023-07-23 23:07:26
i felt like this was the fault of the earlier scene with ruth not the end i think they were hoping to have more of an oracle scene like from the matrix but they didnt hit the mark  it feels like a lot of it is on the cutting room floor,2023-07-23 22:58:59
that’s a good point i hadn’t thought of that i still feel like if that was the intention though it was executed sloppily,2023-07-24 16:50:52
"i felt pretty similarly for a moment there it felt like they were going towards a message of unequal and unfair systems hurt everhone be it patriarchy or matriarchy and building up to a realization that everyone should be treated with respect but then barbie fixes ken and the kens disappear from the story again with no solution to their problems having no value in barbie land without barbie attention and getting laughed at for asking for representation

like the fact that nobody even knows where kens live is taken completely for laughs its a comedy so on its own thats not bad but given the noncomedic aspects of the movie its just disappointing",2023-07-24 18:47:08
"i feel this scene was meant to parody the hysterical woman trope  gerwig seemed to grind the gears a bit between shifting from addressing real issues and satirizing patriarchy with the role reversals  its her movie and her message  as a mid forties male there were a lot of things that left me feeling like hey thats not right  i think that was the point  there are plenty of movies out there that validate men this movie wasnt supposed to be one of them

ideally i want to see a ken movie where he finds himself and we get a nice transitory story of defining what being a man is in the modern world  or all the kens so we can see a more multifaceted approach to each one finding themselves",2023-07-24 18:38:12
i think ken having zero power in barbieland was supposed to reflect how women lack power in the real world men in barbieland  women in the real world the ultimate confusion comes from not understanding why barbie wants to go to the real world especially after “saving” barbieland i understand she felt touched by human connection and aging etc at the public in la but to me that wasn’t enough show me more ending didn’t land for me because i never felt invested in barbie “becoming” human,2023-07-24 18:07:19
did barbieland end up being more balanced,2023-07-27 13:42:41
"people should be grateful for a big movie which addresses the pressures that men go through nowadays in that they are worthless if they are single and that the growing pressure that they are not manly enough gosling showcased both in a very entertaining manner and showed how ridiculous societys expectations and pressures on us can be and it ends with the important message that being yourself is valuable 


its so sad that people are grossly misinterpreting whats actually a super positive film for men into being some evil feminist attack",2023-07-27 17:40:30
exactly they must have missed the entire point of the movie its not antimen its antipatriarchy and anti just blindly following without question ken even says when he realised patriarchy wasnt about horses he lost interest even the rest of the suits just blindly do what the ceo says without question even if it makes them look absolutely ridiculous even the barbies at the end when they get barbie land back from the kens are still blindly following their self imposed matriarchy because thats all theyve ever known themselves,2023-07-27 10:28:22
" but the fact all the real world male characters and kens are portrayed as morons who are doing bad stuff whereas the real world women are sympathetic and competent and the barbies are more intelligent and competent and cooperative than the kens

but how is that in anyway different to the fact that women have been portrayed as the dumb  in movies and tv for decades its literally flipping it on its head and showing you how women have so often been portrayed as one dimensional characters whos only purpose is to further the male main characters story line and how ridiculous that is when you reverse genders",2023-07-27 10:55:26
did you notice that even after the ken’s took over her home was stolen and all the other barbies were brainwashed it was still barbie apologising to ken and that she still has to reassure him that he was enough,2023-07-27 20:18:25
allan its clearly allan,2023-07-27 12:55:40
"the kens despite their literal subjugation of the barbies are treated with overwhelming compassion and are even apologised to by barbie 
does this claim by you also make every movie without leading role models for women antiwomen",2023-07-27 13:20:33
"alright piers

if that was your only takeaway from the movie then clearly it wasnt for you",2023-07-27 12:56:40
whats wrong with the supportive husband and father character,2023-07-27 12:58:10
yeah after the beach fight and the kens coming together i thought that the next scene would have them rushing into the capitol to put their voice in the constitution and have equal representation then the barbies and kens would have an emotionally impacted scene about both sides coming together and live happily ever after but that didnt happen it was just back to matriarchy lol,2023-08-01 02:04:58
when america ferreras daughter asked if margot and america were shining when they were speaking in unison,2023-07-23 19:44:50
the daughter literally asks her mom if she is shining with barbie,2023-07-23 19:46:10
"yes exactly it doesn’t make much sense real world wise as well since there are women in the supreme court i know historically it hasn’t been that way but that shouldn’t matter since in barbie land it’s historically for them not to have men on there only women which is just another reason the kens are more like women in the real world than the barbies

edit also as for narrative stuff the whole mattel thing was so pointless and confusing by the end i forgot about them",2023-07-22 07:00:08
ya just like a cheap joke but it really muddys whatever point the director is making,2023-07-22 07:22:32
"that supreme court part was really sad i didnt get the point the director was making are we supposed to be happy that barbie world is controlled completely by women is the idea that the real world is still completely controlled by men

i assume the idea is to end barbieland at exactly what the real world is you are not supposed to be happy you are supposed to think why you are not happy with the barbieland but is okay with real world",2023-07-22 12:58:34
yes the idea is that the real world is still completely controlled by men,2023-07-22 11:56:22
well that’s one way to see it idk my theater just laughed so maybe that’s why i see it that way,2023-07-22 08:06:34
"i don’t think that was the point if so then why did the barbies give up their power so easily they say they were brainwashed but it wasn’t ever really shown that it was actual brainwashing if that was the point wouldn’t the barbie then push back not let the ken land happen and instead slowly realizing that they’re a matriarchy 

also everyone just laughed at that moment so maybe if that was the point it didn’t hit its mark  they also say the kens would “get it someday” as well as jen saying it’s too hard to lead implying that they are not smart enough and need to climb up in power and at least to me i felt like that that’s just wrong to say about any gender even as a joke it’s in poor taste especially when comparing it to real life women

edit also there was only one moment i remember them making fun of women but maybe i missed it can you tell me some",2023-07-22 20:00:23
"as a man who was excited to see this movie the patriarchy message did not push me away at all in fact i was pleasantly surprised by the nuanced take on mens issues ken was given as much development and growth as barbie in her own movie and for a fun movie it had a fairly deep take on living in a gendered world

i was also pleasantly surprised it didnt turn into a tropey fishoutofwater extended montage which would have bored me to death the time spent in the real world was just enough for me",2023-07-21 18:23:16
but feminism isnt a matriarchy,2023-07-24 08:32:57
i would disagree in that it’s a jab at how ‘alpha male’ energy is really an immature and self destructive interpretation of masculinity a full embodiment of its most toxic qualities it’s all about pushing men down and preying on their insecurities bc they need to constantly one up each other in a pointless  measuring contests and both end up just as insecuremiserable or more than where they started with the winner having a temporary high that so quickly fades alpha males also needlessly measure their worth in relation to women just like ken did and the point was that you can be just you and that’s more than enough you don’t need a brodozer huge muscles a ton of money superpowers and a harem to be ‘man enough’ the movie also critiques toxic femininity at times with weird barbie,2023-07-31 06:34:41
you dont know much about feminist theory and btw theres a lot of differing feminist theory  its not monolithic just like most theories arent so watch sweeping generalizations,2023-07-31 08:18:03
what do you want people to believe,2023-07-31 04:18:09
ohhhhhhhh now i get itt hahahaahah thank u ,2023-07-21 23:48:54
he is credited as the singer for that song,2023-07-22 07:10:05
bro  hes part of the mickey mouse club where they hire triple threats  iirc he had an opportunity to be in a boyband back in the 90s but went the route of acting instead  he actually has an album out i think his band is called dead mans bones i listened to a few songs after the movie theyre not bad,2023-07-22 07:39:41
"interesting  i think the point was that barbie saw the beauty within her as well

the word beautiful has many connotations and i think that in this scene it is used most of them except the physical aesthetic  of course the older woman is not  but i think that the inference in the scene is that beauty is not skin deep

people can age gracefully and beautifully depending on a lot factors and those who can see and appreciate that beauty live fuller more meaningful lives precisely because they look past the surface and see the personality that shines through

i think a big part of barbies journey is understanding this way of seeing and starting to learn how to do it and this was the first moment where it happened for her  barbie saw the beauty of a life lived at full engagement with the world loving it for its truth and trying her best to change the bad parts

just a thought",2023-09-19 15:04:06
i did too  i just wanted them to talk a little bit more especially since barbies journey in the story like pinocchios in that she become a real woman who will eventually age and die,2023-09-15 20:20:17
"i was definitely starting to feel emotional when barbie was breaking down and talking about how shes just not good enough and the mom started saying how she is and how it kills her that she doesnt see it i feel like that was a very real conversation too many women have had with their motherssistersgirl friends and if definitely hit home for me 


i understand the sentiment by her speech afterwards but it did take me out of the emotion i was feeling i wish that scene had kept the supportive tone it had instead",2023-07-22 16:51:48
yes ironically the message of the movie didn’t seem sincere bc it was very muddled and thrown together,2023-07-22 16:32:45
"ken isnt insecure in his masculinity he arguably has no conception of masculinity until he goes to the real world and finds value and purpose there where the movie falters is that femininity is presented as real essential and timeless whereas masculinity is presented as performative and unnatural the take home at the end is presumably that gender power dynamics are so pervasive in how men and women relate to each other that its just better for each to go their own way   

it would have been better for this movie not to bite off more than it can chew  i agree with the critics who said that the execution is lacking here",2023-07-22 16:47:35
"the barbie and ken “love story” kind of gave me “i’m a strong independent woman who doesn’t need a man” i just felt like so much more could’ve been done it the writing was better like in the second half of the movie i felt like the focus was more on ken and he gets musical insert and barbie had to still walk him through his feelings at the end and like the little girl said “what’s barbie’s ending”

i really think the writers were just trying to take ideas and mush them all into one script and it fell flat for me",2023-07-22 16:42:45
ppl are quick to take things wrong so i’d rather overexplain myself,2023-07-22 18:12:52
newsflash that’s just the world,2023-07-22 18:39:03
you can only speak for yourself i personally didn’t feel emotional about it,2023-08-02 21:55:11
i think that scene should have come later near the end it happens too early before she actually had her full crisis over her beauty,2023-07-25 19:02:40
welcome to reddit where having an unpopular opinion gets you down voted  dem hoez,2023-07-24 01:43:21
yeah there were just so many things that left me wanting more i wanted to see more of her experiencing the real world i wanted to see more of her connecting with this family  especially this young girl  mother who she actually belonged to like what an interesting dynamic that could have been,2023-07-23 23:58:29
i don’t think that’s it i do think they wanted to write a meaningful empowering story but just got a little messy with the plot a lot of people loved the movie it just wasn’t for me so it goes not every movie is for everyone,2023-07-23 23:42:31
kendom mojo dojo casa house,2023-07-21 23:45:23
i would love to see a movie just named “and ken” which is about ken discovering himself outside of the confines of barbie land,2023-07-21 23:47:19
not sure about that,2023-07-22 05:24:27
wait i’ve got it kenland is the paris commune and the sequel is going to be the first keninternational where ken marx is going discuss why kenland failed and a split happens between the kennarchists and the karxists then in the third movie vladimir kenin is going to lead a revolution in barbie land russia,2023-07-22 04:15:41
thanks missed that now it seems ridiculously obvious and ill go into my hideyhole as shame barbie,2023-07-23 00:30:56
they are literally selling merch from the movie already though i get why everything’s an ad to some extent if you aren’t selling something consumers are buying something else i’m just a cynical  i guess,2023-07-23 17:20:57
they actually dont give the kens a seat on the supreme court they tell them they have to start at the lower courts and then laugh at them which is pretty  up because this happens to women all the time irl and is an excuse to not give women positions of power ,2023-07-23 18:32:14
i agree with the ken film i was thinking the same thing and would definitely love to watch that i think with how successful this movie was they will absolutely want a sequel so i could definitely see it happening,2023-07-23 18:11:26
i think the movie is actually pretty geared towards grea gerwigs actual age39  a lot of the barbies are early 90s barbies pride and prejudice is 1995 pushmatchbox twenty is 1998  i think there are jokes in the movie that go totally over the heads of gen z,2023-07-23 23:10:37
"i saw an interview with margot robbie where shes straight up asked if this was a kid movie and she says  its for everyone

if this wasnt for kids they should have been honest about this when asked",2023-07-23 22:25:28
they were literally giving out toys to promote the movie and did you even watch the trailer it was clearly marketed towards a younger audience,2023-07-23 22:28:35
i would have loved this movie even as young  i just would have not understand a good chunk of the humor or references but it’s brightly colored and they’re acting silly which is enough for kids,2023-07-23 23:28:24
" theres almost a 100 chance you first were introduced to 2001 via a cartoon

yeah when homer went to space 29 years ago i dont at all pretend to know what cultural references young kids recognise now but i doubt stanley kubrick is one of them

to be clear im not criticising the movie  i enjoyed it a lot  but im trying to make sense of the audience its attracted and how they might respond or not respond to whats in it i had a theatre with a lot of young families girls in particular and im not sure if theyll get the same connection with the movie as their parents will  and i think thats important to think about",2023-07-23 23:28:10
the classic people dont think the exact same as me therefore it must be a conspiracy,2023-07-25 17:16:01
but doesnt helen mirren literally say this will one day reflect the real world at the end in regards to the kens being second class citizens,2023-07-25 16:53:39
"thank you 

you make a good point there i analyzed barbie land through a reflection of our own forcing a feminist  equality lens into my interpretation  having barbie land as its own world with its own values and systems makes a lot of sense",2023-07-25 14:54:42
the concept of an incel is based on feeling owed something though youre owed a partner   because thats what it means to be a man ken not having genitals really doesnt mean hes an incel by default theres more to that category of person and wanting  isnt really the problem its broader,2023-07-25 16:22:13
  is  too,2023-07-25 15:18:04
yes way to recap the movie and it’s obvious messages point for point truly brilliant,2023-07-25 15:30:44
"oooo i like this idea of ruth and the ceo being the parents or “creators” i thought it was just calling out capitalism for twisting the original idea behind the barbie doll 

gosh i just loved this movie",2023-08-21 04:53:50
"i don’t get all the comments about his age dude was like 43 when it was filmed and that is hardly old especially nowadays ken has never struck me as a 20something even in toy story 3 the ken doll is played by michael keaton and you kind of picture him as being middle aged with how the character is portrayed but ryan gosling doesn’t even look middle aged lol… he looks better and younger than most guys a decade younger

also  anecdotal but interesting to me that everyone i’ve seen criticize his age has been other dudes lol i’ve never seen a single comment about him being too old from any female critics or girls i know “irl” i think most women were very happy he was cast in the role quite frankly",2023-12-17 16:10:59
right there were two instances where the scenes were similar too 1 when barbie goes to see the weird barbie weird barbie morpheus holds two items and gives her two choices or paths to take and 2 when barbie meets the creator for the first time it reminded me of when neo met the oracle for the first time,2023-09-24 05:05:48
she also makes the note that crying was amazing,2023-07-21 18:46:44
it has a lot on its mind for sure,2023-07-21 21:48:40
does that ending contradict the message i took it as a lighthearted joke to end the movie but curious to hear your reasoning,2023-07-21 23:31:47
how does that contradict the message youre not making sense,2023-07-22 00:09:31
maybe not happy but realistic,2023-07-22 00:45:15
so you thought treating the barbies as  accessories  brainwashing them was okay because even the kens themselves weren’t approving of the patriarchy they just wanted to be appreciated there is a better way to go about voicing dissatisfaction that’s kind of a weird thing to say,2023-07-26 00:26:31
"in the real world barbie was treated as an object and not respected she was catcalled and  assaulted she wasn’t taken seriously by the police she wasn’t appreciated as a person but treated like an objectlike an accessory by the men in the real world women hold littleno power in the real world in terms of representation and do not make up the majority of the workforce women often feel undervalued and desperate for change due to this 

in barbieworld the kens were treated as accessories their only purpose to serve the barbie’s they weren’t taken seriously they hold little to no power and have no representation the barbie’s make up the majority of the work force the kens feel undervalued and desperate for change due to this 

i hope that was a simple enough explanation but i doubt user nutsackfordayzzzz would understand especially as it seems you keep trying to degrade the women who enjoyed this film as “antimen” the truth is the kens were not treated even half as bad as women are in the real world but they were meant to represent a fractiontaste of how they are i don’t see you losing your mind over people objectifying margot in this role heck you even defended ityet you’re in every single positive comment about this film arguing that barbie sucks and “all women who like this film are antimen” movie opinionsdislikeslikes are subjective people are allowed to have different opinions and perspectives",2023-07-26 06:22:21
thats interesting you perceived the scene like that personally i didnt once think of it as mansplaining because barbie doesnt come across as condescending overconfident or incorrect rather i took this as one doll barbie sharing very recent learnings about what it means to find value from your person with another doll ken who has only just come to grasp that understanding for me these arent humans that have the wealth of knowledge context and experience that comes from living a life in the realworld that allows them to come to these conclusions on their own so straightforward explanations are necessary imo which helps me explain a lot of very on the nose scenes in the film,2023-07-29 20:29:43
dude men literally call other men women if they don’t get laid and if they let women boss them around lol,2023-07-29 18:57:48
right the whole saying “yes” to feelings scene with the home video montage over that billie eilish track had me choking the ,2023-07-31 02:43:52
thank you for this because ive been trying to understand why so much of the movie was about helping ken manage his feelings via female emotional labor and just not jiving with that at all it makes way more sense this way,2023-07-31 13:40:57
somehow they feel more cartoony than the barbies and kens and not in a good way,2023-07-21 13:52:30
cant tell if youre a troll or if youre just very dumb could go either way based on your post history,2023-07-21 15:58:26
why are forming opinions about a movie you havent even watched see it yourself if you want but taking others opinion as fact is strange,2023-07-23 16:29:12
if you’re watching a review that says there are no character arcs in this movie i don’t think they watched the movie either,2023-07-23 16:59:48
"thecriticaldrinker

the guy is an absolute idiot without any understanding of media analysis or literacy",2023-07-23 19:54:54
i didn’t grow up in the us either i’m from scotland but i don’t think that should influence anything if anything i feel the point of the movie was to explore universal womanhood but it fell short  i’m really sad i was so excited for it,2023-07-24 07:33:55
literally it was very like saying something quickly for saying it’s sake to move on to another point but no depth or exploration into what was being said if that makes sense feel like i could word that better i think they were trying to fit in too much so none of it really came across and instead it we were left with a movie that was confusing and disjointed,2023-07-24 07:31:54
"the characters and plot morphed into an unsubtle mouthpiece for gerwigs feminist beliefs and it hurt the film she let her passion for the subject run away
i realise a lot of people like this film but i have a feeling it will be viewed quite differently and as quite cringe once we’re out of the current cultural zeitgeist",2023-07-24 08:13:36
"i get that but they didnt really execute that theme completely imo

her having death thoughts means shes human but what was the solution what was the lesson somehow they used that theme to break other barbies out of their spell therefore does confidence mean we can conquer the world and become  men and her thoughts didnt really go away did they and if they did how they never really addressed that  she just decided to become human lol",2023-07-29 03:45:38
psssssst it ends with barbie finding a new purpose and coming to terms with those feelings,2023-07-28 03:11:28
it wasnt forgotten at all you just seem bothered about the theme of the movie lol,2023-07-28 05:26:17
movie would have been far far better had she just stuck to barbies existential crisis of helping gloria and forgotten the other ,2023-07-28 19:01:15
"most trans women would have the same reaction as barbie after their first appointment to gynecologist yeah you dont need a  to be a real woman but most trans women want one

in fact in my circles we see alot of trans subtext and allegory on barbie which i think was partially incidental partially on purpose",2023-07-28 17:41:49
this is a good breakdown of my issues with it we always hear directors talking about the “one for me one for them” rule of making movies and this movie felt like that rule applied to every individual scene as a result none of its bigger ideas really go anywhere because it just feels like it’s being diluted by everything else,2023-07-28 16:14:16
it’s so weird to me that more people haven’t called it out maybe i’m just missing something but it had the same energy to me as jk rowling’s infamous “people who ” tweet i’ve read greta’s explanation for why the movie ends that way and it still just doesn’t make sense to me on any level barbie didn’t even know what  was in the first act what has her so concerned that going to a gyno appointment is at the top of her priority list i get that it’s about her engaging in “normal” behavior but i feel like there are way more ways they could have gotten that point across without just going for weird shock value,2023-07-29 05:06:22
there was also quite a bit of “don’t change you’re beautiful” messaging right next to rhea perlman who has had her entire face done and looks like a smoothed out alien now that casting felt odd especially when they had shown the older lady at the bus stop wrinkles and all who she told was beautiful,2023-07-30 17:02:08
i certainly didnt feel any hate when i watched it,2023-07-28 23:11:38
as a man i dont get where the man bashing is supposed to be most of the movie is playing off of highly exagerrated stereotypes of male and female behavior but theres no malice to it furthermore kens journey was great and felt authentic to me sure its mostly surface level existentialism but it was handled well imo,2023-07-28 21:13:43
"its just not men that dont have it rosy its everyone life is hard and complicated and both genders unfortunately have bad defensive mechanisms ingrained into them from years of generational structures and gender roles and expectations and how those mechanismscreate unhealthy behaviors nonbiany or those that identify as both also have it rough but irs a subject that deserves it own potrayal and not shoehorned into a film the film depicts both barbie and ken struggling to figure how to be more than whats just expected of them but each has an inverse look at it 

barbie is someone who basically lived a life of ignorance bliss and privilege being the literal stereotypical barbie but once her mental health starts affecting her and she begins acting different than what everyone expects shes told she needs to fix it or else shell be another weird barbie so she goes into the real world and discovers everything is much more complicated and harder than what shes always known and this affects her in such a way that it questions her entire existence and she realizes that she doesnt want to go back to normal but wahts to help those in the real world by helping try to create and shape things and be something more and beyond just stereotypical barbie 

ken is the inverse of this in the beginning of the film all of the kens are basically the 2nd class citizens of barbie world not because barbies actually hate men but because when ken dolls cane out they were designed to just be token boyfriends and companions of barbie nothing more beyond that just good looking guys to be by barbies side fitting the gender role beach ken gosling clearly wants something more than that and clearly loves barbie but he has absolutely no way of comprehending hiw to do that because the longstanding gender roles of kens are just 2nd class citizens with no real say stereotypical barbie is just as guilty of treating beach ken this way 

when he decides to go out to the real world he sees how its its opposite men are the dominating force and the women treat them with respect but because he has no context as to why this is or having an understanding of proper emotional control he sees the patrichary as he thinks he understands it and takes it back home thinking it will help him be seen this is the key thing people might not realize about ken since girls play with the dolls and as they get older they can form emotional ties to them whereas girls never play with ken dolls which is why they are so emotionally stunted and dumb the gender roles put upon girls with the barbie dolls made them discard any emotional attachment to the ken dolls when they played with them thus ken is just ken its why the barbies always just brushed them off and treated them as just things 

when ken brings back the patriarchy back to barbieland there isnt anyone telling him what hes doing is wrong because its just another expected gender role playing its part now boys are playing with the ken dolls and those gender roles and expectations are being played out its toxic masculinity in a nutshell and its spreads like wildfire all the way into real world sales the ken dolls dont want to give it up because they are being seen and respected even if its for the wrong reasons they dont want to give that up 

when barbie helps undo the brainwashing and restores order she sees that she abd the other barbies were treating the kens poorly she forgives ken but tells him that she doesnt want to be with him but that much like shes opening up her emotions beyond whats expected of her she encourages ken to do the same and he finally emotionally opens up how he has always felt like nothing and his own insecurities and anxieties which barbie realizes theyre the same and that regardless of gender we all want the sane thing to feel seen and cared about and to be whatever we can set our mind on doing  ken eventually grows from this thus the im kenough hoodie and realizes he can be more than just what is expected of him and his role as ken he can be more than just a attractive guy to serve as a companion to barbie he can be his own person who is aware of his emotions and have his own dreams like a barbie does even the other barbies start slowly giving the kens more say in barbie world 

the film is 100 about defying the expectations of what traditional gender roles expect of us both in the classical and modern sense and to grow beyond that for barbie its about being something more than just what everyone expects of you and for ken its to get in touch with your emotions and not run from or hide them in macho stuff because all it does is make things worse 

its also about mental health and how traditional gender roles expect us to just ignore them for women its to just act like they dont exist and put on a fake smile and for men its to bury them under a false sense of strength 

theres so much more stuff this film covers so well beyond that i could write an entire essay or do a video on 

its not antimen its antistereotype its anti gender roles

anyone that doesnt see this is either a complete idiot or just saying it to be contrarian",2023-08-02 17:06:23
nobody is saying it’s misogynistic just the opposite it’s the portrayal of all the real world men and kens as morons or morons doing bad stuff which is the problem not ken not being able to get a job,2023-08-02 16:42:07
"no the movie is still about barbie 

both barbie and ken find themselves literally the main plot of the film is about barbie figuring out who she and want she wants the story doesnt progress or happen without her going through her existential crisis

this thread is literally only talking about one aspect if the film that doesnt mean its the only thing the film is about",2023-08-03 10:16:36
you perfectly articulated this theme,2023-08-03 07:58:54
"i mean im not actually writing a thesis paper on it im 36 i graduated college back in 09

its just a phrase to mean theres a lit to talk about with the film",2023-08-03 19:43:24
"oh you could for sure write a thesis on barbie the plot is nothing new weve seen similar stories plenty of times before and theyve all been as poorly received we first saw it with swifts gullivers travels or even more relevant to barbie niels klims underground travels by holberg the idea of using alternate worlds in media to create exaggerated arguments for the shock factor was invented by writers during the enlightenment using these alternative worlds as measuring sticks are something thats still used today in critical movies you find similar themes in movies like the matrix or even to some extent fight club not to mention barbie of course you could write a lot of pages about the matrix reference and how barbieland represents potu of nazer

there is also the actual politics of it how the movie lends from the idea of the matriarchal state of potu barbieland and builds upon it the real world is obviously a more egalitarian society when it comes to gender rights than barbieworld but the real world still shows signs of the past this point is made clear in the end of the movie when the kens are still being associated with being lesser beings even after their suffrage movement has concluded 

i could go on but honestly i just want to go to bed",2023-08-04 00:21:59
you just described amélie,2023-09-17 08:00:41
"yes as a momwife and primary breadwinner in 2023 i can say women maybe not all feel these expectations women in 2023 have more expecations on them now than ever before and more than men have ever had

if youre thin and fit you dont have a real womans body if youre curvy youre  and lazy with no discipline if you work too much youre a bad mom if you focus too much on kids and not work youre umotivated and hurting feminism if you are too quietpolite people dont respect you if you speak up at all youre a  its truly constant",2023-12-21 07:24:20
"i do want to make a few comments about this as a female engineer mainly just food for thought 

on the heelsmakeup topic i think that whole dynamic has been fairly complex in terms of motivations and even legality theres been beauty standards moving towards natural looks the passage of laws and regulations forbidding workplace rules requiring types of footwear depending on the setting and as a younger woman a push toward setting standards and expectations to be whatever individuals prefer for themselves these are mostly my own observations so ymmv

the other part is where i can speak with a lot more certainty because i definitely applied into engineering programs knowing that being a woman might give my application some extra weight the whole situation is justcomplicated if you were trying to enter a space that you knew was disproportionately difficult for you to access just a few years ago wouldnt you think that things like hiring quotas is helping you play on even footing opening a door that was previously shut but even as youre pushing to make sure that you get a chance to break ground where people like you historically have been sidelined you know that youre pushing into a space where the rules and dynamics probably werent set by someone like you you also have to grapple with whether you were hired on your own merit or whether youre the diversity hire because that will materially affect your success in the job your reputation and your career 

once youre hired even if statistics are skewing in the direction of gender equality the fact of the matter is that we are not yet far enough removed from a time of pretty backward gender norms that those people have left the workplace entirely i encounter women still well preretirement who were maybe the first female hire in their team there are still men in management and leadership roles who hold fundamentally sexist beliefs it can be something that really hangs over your head knowing that theres someone in a higher position than you who believes youre lesser than just because of your gender there are also women whose professional experience involved clawing their way into that space and were put in the position of being competitive with other women being sexualized as a matter of course plays into that tooyou have to question whether a male colleague is friendly for normal reasons or because hes into you and whether you need to be concerned about being alone with him same goes for managers clients etc how can you be sure youre being taken seriously for your work and not because someone thinks youre hot if you know that there are people who will not listen to your words but will close a deal because they think youre attractive wouldnt you use that since not being taken seriously is putting you at a disadvantage 

do you as a 20something guy have to question whether your positive reception is just because you look nice or whether they appreciated the content of what you said whether your boss thinks you have the same fundamental intelligence or ability as your male colleague 

its something that im acutely aware of but find very difficult to put into words i dont mean anything i said to be a challenge im just trying to phrase out some of the things i and other female colleagues have experienced and maybe contextualize them for you to think about

as a final point referring to women as highly coveted in the workplace just for numbers reasons does essentially break it down to being a desirable commodity likethe implication is that women only bring value to the workplace in the form of demographic statistics once the issue of gender stats is sated are women no longer coveted why is that",2023-12-25 06:18:28
"i didnt really think so much about that particular word choice sorry it was more about the vibe i didnt want to offend anyone

for me the idea of ken feeling like his existence can only be validated in the form of a relationship and the fact that his insecurity as a man politicized him certainly did give me some incel vibes 

the movie was actually quite sympathetic towards this struggle of his and i think it is warranted because i think often what these men need is a better social circle and a different perspective on life but i agree with you that the portrayal of men in all other aspects was much less flattering and that really sabotaged the overall narrative a lot",2023-07-21 22:09:19
deep breaths deep breaths,2023-07-21 22:25:21
"it was the realistic ending though the kens position in barbieland reflects womens position in the real world sure were allowed to be equal now yet positions of power especially political ones are still dominated by men

having the barbies fix barbieland instantly at the end when theyve only just begun to grasp what sexism is reinforces the false idea that weve already achieved gender equality and its that easy to fix systemic problems youre supposed to dislike the inequality at the end and make that connection",2023-07-22 21:31:05
false equivalency my friend i refer you back to my question do you believe that women institutionally still have it harder than men in 2023,2023-07-27 04:56:43
i loved certain points too the dancing scene where she just says do you guys ever think about death randomly was probably my favorite moment because it just perfectly encapsulated the idea that the barbie world was artificially sanitized of unpleasant thoughts but then they did nothing with that,2023-08-09 05:09:12
"what seems highly unrealistic to me is that all these powerful women who have only ever known power suddenly give up their power just so they don’t have to make decisions anymore that seems like a very weak explanation if we draw parallels with the real world men only ever knew power and when women openly wanted to be included and have a say men didn’t just relinquish their power or become ‘brainwashed’ just so they don’t have to make decisions anymore so why then would the barbies it makes no sense that they could be easily brainwashed by a group of people dolls that they essentially view as superfluous simply because they’re tired of making a decision 

if this movie was supposed to be an allegory or even a mirror to real world society that’s one of the ways that it fell flat for me",2023-08-10 02:56:24
you read up to the 4th sentence of my comment and then didnt even read the rest of that sentence which was me saying i actually liked the feminist monologue literally the entire paragraph after that is a lengthy discussion of feminist ideology like at least  read my comment before reacting,2023-08-10 04:09:33
"i dont have twitter so thank you for sharing its interesting that this conversation is happening there because a majority of the comments here are not reflective of that at all


i think that is what the movie should have done and sets up but then doesnt follow through on if you see a vast majority of comments that is not the takeaway many people are walking away with the barbies got one over on the kens now they know are being treated like how women are treated in the real world i feel like you can tell that havinga onetoone parallel and showing both worlds as wrong and both a patriarchy and matriarchy as wrong was possibly the framework of the movie at some point but then it got muddled somewhere along the way i dont know if they changed their mind wrote themselves into a corner or realized that the barbies couldnt be presented as antagonists the idea is definitely not properly explored and a lot of it is i think this is what they were going for but then you realize that a different scene condradicts it and so on at the very least if that was the message it is lost on a vast majority of the movies audience",2023-07-22 20:29:40
i definitely agree with this especially with the final scene where were told the barrier between barbie and human is practically non existent and you can pretty much choose to be on either side at any time i think both sides are the same in the sense that the gender that is currently in power expresses sympathies for the other side but continues to do nothing substantial to rectify the issue the movie could have done a better job with highlighting the hypocrisy tho,2023-07-22 20:03:07
where does it show that though main barbie was the most empathetic to kens and she bailed on barbie land what other female character in barbie land gave any indication that their long term goal is more equality,2023-07-22 19:40:46
if that is the intended message why does no one read the comments section here see the barbies as an antogonistic force its one thing to say that was what they intended when you look at in a vacuum versus how it is presented and perceived as a whole its such a good point that no one cares or they missed it if this is the commentary we should be leaving the movie disliking the barbies they are a reflection of the powerdriven men in the real world not how people are percieving it  like the barbies getting one over on kens for how women are treated in the real world a world they dont actually know,2023-07-22 19:34:12
kinda makes it a bit of a dark comedy ending no if kens are an allegory for women in the real world then its either saying women are just as capable of perpetuating oppression when given the chance as men or those sexist men did the right thing in giving those feminists some breadcrumbs and delaying equality as much as possible unless were not meant to celebrate the ending,2023-07-22 19:18:21
i do also think its done purposely but i also see that it doesnt work so the barbies are vindictive they are trying to get revenge  of you can have the same rights as women in the real world  a world they have never experienced they are taking out their frustrations of a world they dont know on people they have known their whole lives and have liked the movie solely works as a pushy commentary of our world and does not in the context of barbie world people are simply looking at scenes independently rather than how they fit into the whole if this is some purposeful powerful commentary of how people in power maintain it then shouldnt the audience be leaving realizing that barbies are a real antogonistic force  just like men in the real world but if you read the comments here 99 of people do not have any critiques of barbies somehow see their mistreatment of kens as empowering or funny or simply dont care not a real effective commentary if the vast majority of your audience missed it and are just completely okay with the inequality because the barbies are doing it,2023-07-22 19:25:15
"heh what do you mean type like this

 anyway then we just pray and hope to never cross each others paths in the real life cheers",2023-07-24 02:23:06
"he’s not the primary antagonist the expectation that patriarchal ideals put on both women and men was the antagonist it may seem like ken represents the patriarchy but he doesnt notice that ken also was figuring himself out

you are a man you are not the patriarchy unless you willfully contribute to it and completely ignore womens needs and desires for just what you want or what you like

i know it’s all very complicated to navigate  it is for me too each year i feel i learn women’s perspective a little more but i have more to go and i could never really know what its like to be a woman

you should use this as a movie to listen to versus one to fight don’t take america ferrari’s speech as an attack but an opportunity to learn something about a perspective you don’t have constant access to because you dont have to live it 

there is a lot of sexism in action films still and changing that wont be the end of action films youre only culpable if you choose not to listen when people bring up what makes them uncomfortable and take it as a personal attack",2023-07-23 21:48:45
"none of it was about attacking men people have been telling you in the comments this constantly it’s a metaphor for the woman experience

it was a 2 hour movie and upset you that much — imagine a woman’s life",2023-07-23 21:49:02
"the barbies showed other kens attention they dont flirt or even say anything to them at all the kens are so brainwashed by patriarchy that they cannot think of barbies as anything but their possession and that attention given to another ken is viewed as betrayal

youre doing what the america ferrera character talks about in judging women for doing the thing men want them to do giving men attention but suddenly its too much attention or the wrong kind of attention and its again a womans failing",2023-07-24 08:11:18
yeah this is what a lot of people seem to not understand about the ending if someone has a problem with the gender inequality in barbieland they should be furious when they leave the theater and come back to real life,2023-07-25 01:37:52
i understood what the narrator said and i get the ending i’m saying i don’t even like what the narrator said there i don’t like the ending in general,2023-07-25 02:47:26
i’m pretty sure most people understood the point of the ending  but that doesn’t mean it didn’t feel mean spirited and a downer to end the barbie movie of all things on i feel the point could have easily been made and have a happy meaningful ending that didn’t end with ken and barbie not together and a gynaecologist gag tbh the movie seemed to have a lot of bitterness and i’ll feeling about men even though it’s defended as a clever satire,2023-07-25 03:18:40
many socially struggling people of both genders are rendered to feel invisible to the other for different reasons it might feel like the other  always gets participation points for existing but thats because the observer also makes the others invisible in their mind,2023-07-25 03:15:43
i’m a 30 year old woman and i felt the same way my friend reminded me that this is a barbie movie and maybe they wanted to make sure the 12 year old girls were gonna get the message so i’ll go with that,2023-07-25 02:38:07
"but why be subtle

i am a man if there is a movie i hope isnt subtle about feminism is a barbie movie",2023-07-25 03:39:41
i’m a woman i get the point but i thought this movie was deeper than superficial guess i was wrong,2023-07-25 02:45:47
"lol thats basically what ken was doing to barbieland

he tried to counter matriarchy with patriarchy the movie literally showed you that fighting one extreme with another is bad",2023-07-22 13:08:48
yeah i think there is something primal in the urge for women to want men to pay for patriarchy having existed prolly just human nature,2023-07-22 07:03:30
it bad,2023-07-22 07:51:11
that it’s not needed but men are needed and men shouldn’t define themselves by their relationship status with a women they should be enough for themselves first,2023-07-22 15:28:00
oh thank you what does it mean i am not familiar with dolores huerta,2023-07-31 23:24:16
glad to hear you enjoyed it i’m pretty surprised at how visceral some guys are reacting to it it’s a movie about a doll that 8 year old girls played with of course ken is an accessory if they made a gi jane she’d end up headless after 8 year old boys played with her,2023-07-25 14:39:46
is allan not a guy,2023-07-25 10:31:02
did you have a sister who played with barbies,2023-07-25 14:25:53
and if the barbies do  feel what their owner is playing them as then how does the final third of the film happen when they’re basically doing whatever they all want to change their society  back again,2023-08-03 04:25:01
"not to barbie it wasnt she wanted to stay and only started struggling when glorias issues started to be forced on her 

i didnt understand the choice either thematically sure but barbies reasoning was really thin and she had a terrible time the entire time she was in human land",2023-08-07 02:02:16
this was nothing like groundhog day,2023-08-07 08:31:04

they could have gone the game of thrones route and voted alan to be the supreme dictator for no reason,2023-08-08 11:48:50
i like this take i also think at the end of the day it is a barbie movie and theyre in barbie land so having things be completely equal between kens and barbies might stray too much from it being a barbiecentered movie,2023-08-07 20:53:25
"i think your take is close imo the point is not that equality is slowly gained rather it is to legitimately leave the viewer—man or woman—with the thought that “hey this still feels unfair to the kens” in the fake barbieland and then hopefully inspect how that connects to reality

because the parallel is made explicitly by mirren’s narration between the unfair experience of the kens and the process women have been working through to achieve equality

it ultimately wants to create this thought you think the kens situation is unfair yes it is you think getting “the same amount of power women have in the real world” is unfair yes it is—and through the movie’s analogy a viewer can now recognize that by seeing ken’s experience and stepping outside of their own biases about our world it’s the “wait a minute is this  play about us” meme moment

that’s just how i interpreted it though",2023-08-07 22:20:03
wasnt that just referencing how people play with barbie dolls,2023-07-22 16:10:50
lol correct,2023-07-22 22:58:32
i agree if they are getting defensive but i think the problem is that criticisms of the movie are being mislabeled as being defensive,2023-07-22 22:50:13
honestly wording it playing guitar at you was genius,2023-07-22 23:46:10
thinking that its right to pay back people who wrong you equally eye for an eye style is vindictiveness,2023-07-23 15:39:04
barbie literally apologized to ken for not “noticing” him despite doing nothing wrong he was the “nice guy” incel and he got an apology it was odd,2023-07-23 14:10:48
"it seems like people are projecting their ideologies onto the movie versus what is actually in the movie itself


so youre telling me that ken and barbie go into a world that has patriarchy and instead of ken going oh this world has patriarchy so i might be able to win over barbie herehe instead thinks what if i leave barbie go back and establish patriarchy in my world hopefully it works because barbies have 100 power there and some of the kens dont even like me and hope that barbie is fine and will find her way back and when shes back i will use patriarchy to win her over 


if as you said the goal of young men and ken is to win over the girl ken had a lot better chance doing that in an already established patriarchy where they were alone


as you said barbie wanted ken to learn that he can be his own individual person and did not need to define himself by being with barbie however as you said the lesson is there is no single definition of men but just within a few minutes of that scene america farreras character suggests and is lauded for her idea of an average barbie once again i dont think their heart was in the wrong place but that definitely kind of goes against the message of embracing onself and not trying to fit into a mold reversing it and saying this doll reflects most of you is not any better than creating a doll that is marketed towards a certain demographic",2023-07-22 12:51:38
"they were taught to define themselves by how good they can get a women

were they taught this or is this biology speaking do you really think the entire world ended up like this because they were taught this if your assumption is correct then why did pretty much the entire world turn out this way the world is pretty big with a lot of different cultures  yet in pretty much all societies this rings true also men are not taught to define themselves by how good they can get women  men are taught to earn money and become successful first and foremost and women will generally follow once that has been achieved

ken thought he was nothing unless he could get barbie

yea but ken is not really reflective of how men in the real world really are  they are not obsessed with one woman only in general

do you think young men love the patriachy and showing themselves as alpha because they hate women no they think patriachy will help them get the girls

do you actually think young men outside of reddit actually know what patriarchy is do you even know what it is heck what does it even mean to be alpha you can ask 10 different guys these questions and youll get 10 different answers

also a lot of men dont hate or love patriarchy they just live in the society they were born trying to become as successful and happy as possible heck both men and women in real life at least in first world countries that are very equal do not spend their days thinking about this what you see on internet is not always reflective of everyday life

the movie shows the problem young misled men have as much as it show the womens side

thats a lie yea it might touch on these problems a bit but without a doubt not as much as it show the womens side

thats totally okay though because the movie is targeted mostly towards women  but at least keep facts straight",2023-07-22 19:43:45

but it does empower everyone in the end  ken in the end realizes he’s not just ken  he is kenough alone  he doesn’t have to win barbies eye to be good enough,2023-07-22 11:43:09
"what are you talking about lol the end basically say they have to work together the boy vs girl things is in the middle of the movie because it is the conflict it is not the conclusion

are you upset because the movie said that ken will get all equal position of power eventually lol it was so on the nose that it reflects the real world",2023-07-22 12:14:21
meaning that the stereotypical barbie gorgeous smart cantdonowrong  flawless isnt realistic depiction of real life women of course and young girls are taught a lesson to understand this that real women have flaws and arent perfect like barbie and grow up into womanhood,2023-07-23 04:40:04

among my group of friends we all felt that it was incredibly relatable",2023-09-09 04:48:41
"taking them into submission for granted

thats the better word i was looking for just odd to me that the movie mentions ken only have great day when theres barbie at the beginning and its barbie and ken towards the end but didnt go deeper into that still a great movie",2023-08-30 17:31:51
it’s a real life explanation for ruth appearing and disappearing in barbie land she’s a ghost,2023-09-19 02:35:20
there was a throwaway line about supreme court justices etc but they still depicted the ruling classparty in a glorified light as they reinstalled their castelike system and sewed internal division amongst the weaker class in a super sexist way but it’s cool cause it’s misandristic not misogynistic that was what i had the issue with,2023-07-22 05:49:34
" i mean the narrator told us theyd make progress over time and end up in the same position women are at in the real world does that sound like a bad end to people watching for some reason if so why

because women in the real world are oppressed and marginalized so it means that basically in barbieland instead of accidentally making kens a second class citizen like they had been they are now actually actively trying to push back against ken equality and purposefully subjegating them like women are in real life which you know is bad and makes the barbies bad",2023-07-22 06:02:21
yes like what purpose did they even serve what was the point of having will ferrell such a waste,2023-07-28 23:58:27
they had nothing to do once they got to barbieland they literally have no use,2023-07-29 06:29:12
it had a mean vibe imo,2023-07-28 10:59:16
the kens turned all of the barbies into mindless maidslovers for themselves and they were too conniving on how they got themselves back,2023-07-28 17:50:38
apparently the movie was not heavy handed enough because you seemingly understood none of it,2023-07-28 21:22:49
i feel like you missed the point that the kens at the end are supposed to mirror the position of women in the real world,2023-07-28 14:20:36
"is this a parody

your wife was the target audience for the movie and loved it and you still felt the need to explain to her why she was wrong did you explain why the godfather is better 

and the ken’s aren’t allowed to vote or be on the supreme court which you think is  do you have any knowledge of women’s role in government in this country that this movie might be commenting on 

it’s incredible that you think the movie was heavy handed and still completely missed it sounds like your wife should have watched it on a girls night",2023-07-28 15:46:26
my interpretation was that it’s not to be equal in the end in the real world there is an awareness that women should be more included respected  valued  but they’re still not barbie world is the same  at the end of the day it’s better but it’s still not equality,2023-07-28 11:44:29
i felt it was kinda rushed and inyourface at times too but that whole ellection without half the people thing treating ken like trash and villanizing them not letting them have a place in the high court etc it all really felt like a parallel to what happenedhappens in real life with women like they said barbieland is the real world inverted so theres that layer to the movie criticizing something and proceeding to do exactly that same thing and it kinda becomes a meta selfcriticism,2023-07-28 11:26:09
 trying to explain to your wife why she didn’t like the movie… this thing went so far over your head man,2023-07-28 16:46:50
"no the barbie’s in barbie land are not parroting what their children are saying margotbarbie started thinking about death and cellulite because america was but america was not sitting at her desk making the barbies dance and then having margotbarbie actually say “do you ever think about death”

"the whole time i was in the theater i was thinking how crazy it was that they marketed this movie so much

its camp meets existential meets postmodern meets political commentary  

 i can see why some peoples reactions are that it was too allover the place i love movies like this and i feel like it was made for me but its pretty crazy that wb trusted it enough to put that much behind it",2023-07-23 16:01:23
i have to say allan was one of my favorite features of the movie youre right about the nuance with him because he was a character that really defined himself by his actions instead of being explained to the audience there was a lot about him that ended up being really surprising and funny when he could have been made into a filler character without substance i loved weird barbie too the scenes with her made me laugh so hard and i enjoyed her story,2023-07-26 14:21:34
"yeah i read that definitely not my taste either thank for test audiences  i’m saying just for a kids joke in the version i envisioned something like “barbie does a  for the first time” lol but handled tastefully — barbie ears and drinks real food for the first time ever along the lines of scenarios already experienced during the film feelings of happiness anxiety joy whatever barbie goes “ii’m feeling… i’m feeling something i’ve never felt before…” audience expects it to be some new emotion she’s unlocked cue to her coming out of an obvious toilet stall door “wow that was something” cue children laughing immature adults snickers…   
  
anyway i just think it could be an idea for a barbie 2 where she explores being in the real world and makes the ultimate decision stay in the real world or go back to her perfect only world once and for all  
    
mattel if you’re reading i’ve got lots of great scene ideas for an adults only version of the movie",2023-07-28 21:22:05
"weird barbie never reverted to a normal barbie

neither did thoughts of death barbie",2023-07-30 02:57:09
she wasnt seeking death she was seeking life much like how everyones brains rotted in the good place when life has no end it becomes monotonous barbie experienced what its like to truly live and feel and chose to be real because in order to appreciate good much more you need to experience bad ive seen a few people saying shes seeking death like shes some goth or emo but i think she just wants the thrill of imperfection and real life so much so that something as routine and boring as a gynaecologist appointment is exciting to her because shes now truly real,2023-07-30 16:38:19
"everyone’s allowed an opinion that’s the beauty of movies and art being put out as long as your respectful when interacting there’s nothing wrong with disagreeing   
  
i just feel like the very last scene at the doctor office opened up so much potential for ideas someone mentioned to me “that’s what george of the jungle was” — i’m not a huge cinephile i’ve seen hardly any movies probably less than 15 in my life — just have trouble sitting through them get too distracted and have always preferred documentaries so i know my idea isn’t original i suppose but maybe there could have been more gags of them in the real world and more so barbie going from a doll to a human and experiencing the joys of human stuff — but like m rates not kiddy humour would love to see a nightclub scene etc but i know mattel won’t be releasing “drug binge barbie” — just me waxing poetic about how i would like to have seen more the end felt so abrupt show us her living with sacha’s family show us her experiencing what the climax was all about",2023-07-30 19:08:46
same found the ken parts annoying and boring and like yooo where’s barbie,2023-07-30 01:53:38
ken has always had variations in appearance like barbie but the iconic look for both of them is blonde hair blue eyes so the blonde makes him recognizable as ken he doesn’t look the best in it but i thought the bleach blonde was perfect for the character,2023-07-28 19:48:21
the point is that most women are kens in the real life thats why it was beautifully made they showed the reality but placed men in the shoes of women,2023-07-21 11:40:32
"thats also kinda the point i think the waste of time bit im pretty sure its even said out loud at some point during the movie itself

yes most efforts to bring about a change in the world will yield minimal results or even have no impact at all but that doesnt mean you gotta stop pushing every bit counts

against its crude i dont think its supposed to be a happy ending at least for barbielandkendom",2023-07-21 16:03:57
nah the moms monologue did get me a bit but the montage at the end is what  me up,2023-07-27 10:40:05
yeah but i feel like that being human concept was just thrown in later on like what part of barbie’s journey made her want to be human she didn’t spend enough time in the real world for it and the mom and daughters relationship was bad one minute and then great the next…not saying i don’t get the message it was supposed to portray but i just wished they leaned into it more,2023-07-27 16:29:21
"can i just say you are kenough

lol",2023-07-27 16:36:23
"under no point in the movie was the matriarchy enforced at the end pictured as something bad  something that had to be stopped patriarchy was however correctly criticised throughout the movie

i agree that the audience shouldnt think that manipulation is ok but nowhere in the movie was it shown to be a wrong thing as such it would be easier to reach that assumption especially if its presented as a way to fix a problem and reach a happy ending i went back to the movie to see if an apology for this happens i think barbie does apologise but because she took ken for granted at the beginning of the movie not because of the barbies manipulative attitude i was not able to find anywhere where this behaviour is shown to be bad  negative nor remember but would be happy to be proven wrong",2023-08-22 22:14:27
this was the first trailer for the film,2023-07-21 12:46:32
ikr,2023-07-21 12:30:54
everyone in the theater was confused and few chuckles when the girl smashed the dolls but i like that they open up with a funny parody of 2001,2023-07-21 12:57:07
"the barbies went back to having a matriarchy and called it a win with no self reflection that it was just as bad as what the kens tried to do laughing it off and giving them a few token positions 

they explicitly say it’s a commentary on the role of women in modern society the kens ‘win’ acceptance but it is caveated by ongoing social inequality this isn’t even subtext i’m pretty sure the narrator states this the idea is if you find the ending unfair to ken’s then you should find real life unfair to women too

but it was never acknowledged that it puts pressures on kens too 

main ken ends his arc by saying the pressures of the patriarchy were too much for him and he wants to go back to his previous life


the writers could have done something with allen feeling alienated by the expectation of masculinity but he was just laughed off and not allowed to leave

he played a pivotal role in the rebellion by working as a barbie",2023-07-23 20:00:00
"you need to find your own identities actually what they were trying to mean was until that point of time ken had gotten over with anything in the patriarchal world even though he didnt have an actual identity or an mbadoctors license once he got out of the patriarchal world he didnt have anything else left to feed his ego egoidentity it means that men can get over with many things in life without struggling muchexploring their identity because all patriarchical rules make it easy for them whereas in the same patriarchical world they soothe women by saying find your identity be yourself etc so this is a double referral first to the mens ease in the patriarchical world and the second to how they numb women by saying abstract things 

and i know life is hard for men also and i acknowledge it and im not comparing it but for women life has multilayered of hardnesses",2023-07-23 21:24:43
oh man taking an entire film at face value must be very easy on the brain,2023-07-23 19:41:33
oh yea just a base plot with the same story weve seen a million times woulda been great a real smasher,2023-07-26 02:38:49
agreed or just her and ken getting lost in the real world and bringing back equality to the barbie world,2023-07-26 02:13:31
i really liked the ken stuff just generally some of the stuff needed more baking for me i’d probably cut the matel execs the ruth,2023-07-26 01:53:59
interesting i do think there couldve been a stronger narrative for the mom and daughter if there was less about ken even less about the cartoonish mattel interference but i enjoyed kens story of overthrowing a matriarchy and learning to selfactualize a lot more than yet another cliche mothervsangstyteen story to each their own,2023-07-26 06:10:12
i guess so but that also works with the theme of the movie which is that the patriarchy isnt something that men do to women its something that both men and women use to put down men and women,2023-07-27 12:42:54
put that manly hand in mine,2023-07-27 08:46:33
" women rarely ever say “all men are like this”

totally i never get that feeling from an actual conversation about feminism with a woman i think this feeling i sometimes get is caused by the writing rather than the message i dont identify with the patriarchy so when the writing attacks the patriarchy i dont feel attacked i feel like thats part of the message of that movie patriarchy isnt a tool men use to oppress women patriarchy is a system that oppresses both men and women",2023-07-27 13:48:58
lol people down voting imagine the real word is and utopia for me good luck of you are  or  or poor,2023-07-29 13:24:38

i agree really i never felt the things they mentioned in the movie but i get why others would,2023-07-30 23:47:40
,2023-07-31 03:08:17
when has barbie ever been portrayed as being a wife to ken he has always been nothing more than an accessory to her  they even mention this in toy story 3,2023-07-30 14:39:06
whats odd is everyone who gets so up in arms about how the movie portrays gender roles when it is clearly all a big caricature thats supposed to be a fun house mirror reflection of the real world while she of course was saying something serious the whole thing is a parody meaning people arent meant to take it too seriously i cried at some parts anyway lol,2023-07-30 20:28:24
"regarding the friendzone  boyfriend thing maybe i misheard but i thought that they were a couple but that in barbie world that’s not a well defined thing

i remember the conversation being something like
ken saying that he should stay the night then barbie asks why they’re not sure what couples should do overnight",2023-07-31 11:04:50
i hate to tell you that song is not a parody it is push by matchbox 20 and a real  song some of us sang along to before we realized what we were saying,2023-07-31 13:45:01
"the barbies decided to give kens all the power women had in the real world

which is wrong  they gave them less power than women have in the real world  the kens are 1 step above where they were before but where they were before were literally not even people  they still only exist under the attention of the barbies and the only barbie that learned the lesson that kens are people too immediately left to become a human

its a reflection on how lots of women feel in the real world

there are 4 women on the supreme court and one has been on it for 40 years  barbieland is a shadow of the us not saudi arabia

but he had this idea in his head that his purpose was to be her boyfriend 

because thats the entire concept of barbie toys  barbies in barbieland embody how each toy was designed and how they are played with

the movie had a solid message and then plowed it under as it went on and mixed itself up entirely barbies are a reflection of how they are played with and what they were made to be but they are also exactly the same as normal people and its ridiculous that kens reflect how they are designed to be",2023-07-30 23:12:15
"the thing about giving kens as much power as women have in real world was kinda too much indulgence in the victim mentality in my opinion 





yes it depends a lot on the area youre speaking of but the matter of the fact is women have a lot more power than they used to have some of the most influential people in the past 50 years were women angela merkel theressa may shes influential lets not discuss how much good she did ok dont open that rabbit hole sanna mirella maia sandu the list goes on on top of women judges women having a higher college graduation rate than men 




do we have a long way to go towards gender equality yes obviously but i think weve reached that point where we need to open the discussion on male empowerment as well such as mental health issues suicide toxic masculinitys effect on men mens health in general and gender roles the same way there is pressure for women to be mothers theres pressure for men to be providers  forbid you want to be a stay at home dad people will have your balls on the chopping board  





now im not saying the movie couldnt get the message across but the kens were the worst outlet for that lets not forget that beach ken adopted patriarchy because it was the first system that showed him basic respect barbieland kens were literally treated worse than dogs maybe a better message would have been hey our matriarchy was equally as bad as your patriarchy perhaps its time we gave you representation in the parliament and we work as equals",2023-07-30 23:06:48
"regarding the friendzonr thing its not that he had the idea in his head that he had to be a boyfriend the barbies knew that all too well the best evidence for this is the guitar campfire scene the barbies knew exactly how much they meant to the kens which is why their  up plan worked since ken didnt have talk with barbie about how much he loves her before that this implies that barbie all the barbies knew all this time its just that you know they willingly chose to ignore their feelings 

and the regarding the they gave the kens all the power women have in the real world yeah i actually agree with that that checks out but it doesnt have to be that way no the barbies got a reallllyyy good taste of what they put the kens through when they established ken land even after knowing what they had been putting the kens through ever since they existed they still chose to let everything go back to normal for me that was the point that the movie took it a bit too far with the message",2023-07-31 11:17:58
1010 alltime classic for me i am also listening to the soundtrack and just laughing thinking about some of the jokes one of the funniest movies in a long  time,2023-07-31 02:51:02
brainwashed writer barbie says it’s like i’ve been in a dream where i was really invested in the zack snyder cut of justice league its making fun of the hardcore fandom who was determined to have wb release that version of the movie and having only that version count in continuity moving forward brainwashed writer barbie had only one singular goal to serve ken nothing else mattered in her world so the joke is both are super obsessed with just one thing,2023-08-05 05:09:32
it’s a 4 hour movie that wb was not fond of it’s ironic because barbie is a movie distributed by wb,2023-08-05 04:45:52
yea i actually liked that the barbies said nah you can have like a little bit of rightsrepresentation but not that much i thought the implication was that they too were flawed beings and its not that men are bad but that power corrupts and anyone in the better side of that kind of power imbalance isnt just going to give it all away,2023-07-29 21:58:29
"yeah but the problem with that is the real world men and patriarchy are portrayed as obviously bad and dumb while the barbie matriachy is competent and you’re meant to root for them to beat the kens so on the one hand you’ve got the real world women portrayed sympathetically  meanwhile the kens are portrayed less sympathetically than the group oppressing them

then there’s the end  imagine a movie where a dumb woman is crying about how much she needs some dude while he “mansplains” that she needs to find herself and that it’s ok to cry and that’s the happy ending well that’s the ending of barbie and people are somehow saying that’s a good ending for ken and men lol ok

also despite the message being that it’s ok for men to cry because kens crying that moment is also clearly played for laughs so it contradicts its own message men crying is ok but also it’s hilariously funny

i think gerwig accidentally let a little too much of her own feelings into this and revealed she had a bit more contempt for men than she would ever admit and that gets in the way of barbie land mirroring the real world i mean the kens are dumb and the barbies aren’t so there’s a justification for them ruling meanwhile in the real world the men are dumb and it’s the creative woman who can’t overcome the patriachy who should be in their position",2023-07-29 18:38:54
"i think that was also made clear by the fact that even after being deprogrammed all the barbies except margot were perfectly content to put barbieland right back how it was 

most people are well aware of the inequalities we live under but the vast majority of people with privilege do absolutely nothing to change the status quo unless it negatively affects them",2023-07-30 05:47:04
yes,2023-07-30 08:58:00
"except the kens are portrayed as idiots and they don’t even really want power and were supposed to root for the barbies to beat them do actually the movie gives the barbies a justification to rule  as kens are incompetent anyway but the barbies are smarter  meanwhile the real world women are sympathetically struggling against the patriachy who are also idiots

imagine an ending of a movie where a woman is sobbing about loving a man played for laughs while he mansplains life to her and tells her she now gets to find herself that’s the barbie movie with barbies message to ken the sexes reversed would be seen as incredibly sexist and condescending it’s laughable women think of that as a positive scene for men 

the problem wasn’t with the gender swap of kens for the real world women  the problem was they were outraged so badly and stupidly just like all the men and when heygit in charge they were worse than it at the barbies so actually the movie justifies the matriachy if you wanted to have an effective portrayal of a gender role reversal you had to make the barbies obvious villains like the real world men as it is why shouldn’t they rule barbie land the kens are idiots who will do the wrong thing

so in reality the movie sends the message that women should be in charge because men are morons but hey once women are in charge men will get to cry and find themselves or whatever feminist women think they want to do",2023-07-30 03:00:39
"because at that point of the film she still hadn’t found the girl who was playing with her to fix the issue once she finds america ferrera’s character after she escapes they need somewhere safe to go and retreat to barbieland

also who knows what the mattel guys would’ve done to “fix” her before she went back",2023-07-29 21:43:29
"i think it was implied the box thing is like a sort of reprogramming tool and not just a portal is like putting barbie back in the ingnorant state she was when she lived in barbieland and she was new and perfect making her forget her new existential crisis
by going back thought the first portal and not the box barbie choose to mantain and remember the experience she made in the real world even the bad parts",2023-07-29 22:33:55

yes,2023-07-21 14:24:50
movies for men get to ask big questions about humanity as a whole theyre relatable to everyone movies for women perseverate on men make it make sense,2023-07-22 16:50:50
feel like we watched different movies… did you accidentally watch oppenheimer i wouldn’t call making a movie where male characters are dumb incapable and the villains making it “all about men” i wouldn’t call a movie about barbie figuring out what it means to be a woman and deciding she wants womanhood to be “all about men” the “dumb ken” jokes were funny as  tho,2023-07-22 16:54:37
"ok im in the minority of people who didnt relate to having felt this pressure but if majority of women who have seen this movie can relate to it then you cant really say no one expects this of them bc you wouldve have experienced it  

in my specific career rising through the ranks is not something i need to worry about but for women who have aspirations of becoming cxos or partners or department heads then they would def feel this pressure bc only one specific type of woman tends to achieve that women who are firm but not bossy who know how to gently speak their mind while still knowing their place who can stand up to men but never above them who must find time to be the primary caregiver while breaking their backs at work to stand out

and even if the pressure comes from themselves u cant blame them for it can you the world has shown women that people do not expect us to make something of ourselves but if you want to become someone in power then these are the minimum requirements to be met",2023-07-29 18:00:45
yeah when they scream flat feeeeet i was like okay,2023-07-29 06:22:46
yeah the music was ordinary,2023-07-28 18:57:39
"thats the joke its a joke making fun of people that think “having feminism” solved sexism and misogyny much like civil rights “solved” racism  when all it did was really start a conversation that maybe leads to full equality 

the ending of back to barbieland is an ironic flip of what is expected that actually mirrors reality and real history you know… like barbieland is

if anyone has a problem with how barbie ended good thats the desired effect and it explicitly states that if that makes you mad then the way women in real life are treated should also make you mad but you can actually do something about it in the real world barbieland is just a mirror of reality so making the real world equal would make barbieland also equal",2023-08-04 13:39:19
barbieland is meant to go back to barbie land bc it mirrors real life nk matter how much progress women make the patriarchy finds a way to flip it as toxic or problematic etc eg slutshaming using words like feminist to mean derogatory things this part is even more highlighted  when the kens ask for a major role in  govt i think and the president barbie says baby steps or something like that,2023-08-04 21:27:38
maybe but to me i feel like that crossing worldsthings coming to life in the real world concept is a very familiar trope in itself both recently and historically no issue with that personally just not understanding how so many see it as something elsenew,2023-07-21 14:41:09
i get its all relative but plenty of other big studio movies have done variations on the same or very similar concept over the years and regardless of studio or budget everything everywhere became about as mainstream as it gets so still not sure why this feels so unique to so many including critics no biggie though,2023-07-21 14:45:16

i just saw the barbie movie and was so confused i agree that there is not a cohesive perspective and a lot was left on the table i think a big part of what bothered me was the ending in how they essentially bring the real world back to barbieland by not striving for true equality it seems like in barbieland they could create an idealized society since they don’t need to deal with the heavy issues or implications of the real world or money lol also i feel like it’s weird that they dissed the pregnant barbie multiple times when this was supposed to be a movie about female empowerment i am female and generally think of myself as progressive but this movie was not it for me,2023-07-27 03:03:02
"well the kens have to start somewhere and one day the kens will have as much power and influence in barbieland as women have in the real world

this was really helpful thanks for clearing this up,2023-07-27 00:06:36
"they were fake villains we are tricked into thinking will be the antagonist until its revealed that ken tries to take over barbieland  


we are set up to believe the board room suit guys  will be the bad guys  all men running a girl toy company but it turns out they genuinely value girl play and just want tickles  this is not a movie that will make you feel bad spending money on mattel afterwards  basically it is  a toothless attack on capitalism  which i am personally not mad about its a fun movie that i enjoyed that had some thoughtful moments  thats enough",2023-07-27 23:36:22
this contextualizes what i was trying to convey to friends well put,2023-07-31 17:57:32
yikes dude i dont think i can really agree or disagree with the message of her speech im not a woman and thus havent encountered the struggle she described but i can empathize with her and it appears a lot of women that saw it very much so identified with it remember the target audience for this monologue its women that grew up with that struggle and girls that may be growing into it and i suppose its also to bring awareness to those of us that have never experienced it or perpetuate it femininity can be complex i found it wholesome to have that experience voiced on the big screen in the biggest movie of the summer no less,2023-08-01 16:24:16
"i agree with you that the end of barbie regarding progress on ken gaining their equality is a metaphor for real world women

but one thing can be metaphor for many things at the same time depending on scene and context  
ken was a metaphor for women in real world for their social role power barbie initially never realize that barbie initially represent priviledge men

ken also subtly represent issue that both men and women have thinking that they are defined by acceptance from the opposite 

then ken found patriarchy and he thinks this is his way of solving the problem but he is overcorrecting his idea is nothing but a gender swap so at this point he also represent young men in real world who fall into alphapatriarchy pipeline who thinks being alpha will get him women ken still do all those patriarchy take over because he wants barbie to love him ken is me is basically the movie telling all the lost young men to not get struck in what it means to be a man man is me is enough",2023-07-22 12:36:36
well that’s just barbie but still gave ken a happy story instead of just being like  u bye,2023-08-02 01:15:27
"how is it antimen exactly i found the ken arc very uplifting towards men separating themselves as individuals rather than tied to that of the women they attract 
every man i know personally enjoyed it and found it fulfilling",2023-08-01 05:48:44
i get barbie having an anti man vibe but that’s the whole point of barbie to honor women to think it would be anything but female oriented is a little outlandish i feel like it could have been way worse than what they made it and still honored mental health issues in men and said they r kenough still gave men their moment,2023-08-01 05:25:05
yeah thats absolutely what i walked out of the movie with as well,2023-07-21 16:20:35
"that softened my opinion on the movie greatly yeah they become polar opposites that was surprisingly dark and cynical  which i did not expect

if thats a good lesson to teach to take revenge and mirror what is bad instead of using movie magic to make it right

thats a good point i guess i was focusing on the kind of shots used during the flashback scenes when barbie finds out who shes looking forrealising human joy a lot of the shots could have been easily mistaken for stock footage imo and while the set looked incredible in barbie land i feel like olivia wilde did the whole eerie thing better in dont worry darling,2023-07-21 15:34:54

can we have a seat on the supreme court  ken

no barbie

great movie though loved the dance scene",2023-07-22 00:37:55
what do you mean that barbie didn’t live alone ken was originally introduced as a boyfriend which isn’t necessarily that serious he’s also just one of the gang as the film shows barbie’s reality and her relationships can be whatever the player decides my barbie was never that serious with ken there’s no canon to this,2023-07-22 01:20:34
i think you may have missed the point of the satire of this movie,2023-07-22 01:07:41

"as a woman

",2023-07-22 02:21:06
"its almost like you made up your mind about the movie before you even watched it not only that but ive read many more impressions from people who grew up playing with barbies who felt exactly the same way about ken as the movie portrays him like how do you miss such blatant subtext even if its not how you grew up playing with barbies and then the entire message of being a whole person without needing a romantic partner for fulfillment seems to have gone entirely over your head

thats on you feminism didnt do it to you",2023-07-22 02:39:14
that’s the point ken represents women living in a patriarchal society it’s actually genius,2023-07-23 16:56:38
same lol i liked it but i dont see where i was supposed to cry or where it speaks perfectly to mother daughter relationships or artfully hits at the complexity of being a woman i dont think it did all that lol it gave me a few good laughs and had cute fashion,2023-07-25 03:52:53
"i think it will wear off after the initial hype to me it doesnt have much rewatch value if the movie was as funny and lighthearted as the first half i could see myself rewatching it for cute girls nights but as a whole it drags in the middle and i wouldnt watch it in full too often 

again it wasnt terrible but it just felt like a meh movie i had parts that i loved like barbies getting ready scenes and when things started getting wonky kens everything lol but the movie could have flowed better",2023-07-25 03:51:32
"i dont think that came across at all we dont know really what she does to be so stressed or why she feels inadequate outside of the general insecurities of a person i think thats a lot to derive from what we are actually given i think barbies arc has a resolution but not americas because i feel like she didnt really have an arc she was depressed and anxious that was chalked up to being weird and dark and nothing was really done about it she just continued doing what she was doing i guess she got to vent out her frustrations to the barbies in barbieworld but i dont see her speech as much of a character arc

i didnt hate her character i was just sad that it felt like the writers halfassed her backstory

edit i feel like the speech would be more impactful if it was given by barbie after living in the real world because we are following her journey americas character i didnt really resonate with",2023-07-25 01:05:49
yes it was something like “i’m not barbie beautiful” and then helen m says “note to production if you want to make that point margot robbie was not the best actress choice” or something along those lines,2023-07-24 12:57:35
"part of the problem is precisely this idea that we must always be universal in everything we say her speech is only about problems that women go through which doesnt mean that men dont have problems but that they are different 

kens entire arc revolves around this he just has no place in the world",2023-07-23 00:07:09
you seem to have a personal issue with her lol,2023-07-29 03:29:55
"status quo baby

again its very odd because of the subtext over womens health barbie ending the movie going to a gynecologist and all i would have preferred a movie where barbies fish out of water story is the focus i found myself thinking that her visit to the doctor would have made for great comedy and pathos that what follows would be far more revealing—and potentially subversive—than this dull ken storyline especially in the context of scotus overturning roe thanks in part to amy coney barrett there would be little need for those terrible speeches because the themes would have more room to be communicated visually

the script is odd because its written for adults at the level of children i keep asking myself how a great at pixar would handle it a studio that—whatever you think of their movies over the past few years—has a great track record of writing movies for children that are emotionally resonant for everyone",2023-07-21 15:37:55

just like barbie is before she visits the real world,2023-07-21 10:46:36
the kens were made just to hang around and love barbie the whole ending is about that im glad it gave something for ken at the end even if it was just you need to find yourself and be your own person,2023-07-21 08:59:18
fair,2023-07-21 02:44:10
i think it was meant to be a dark joke to highlight the fact that women in the united states are still viewed by many as lessthan and despite it being a movie they chose to highlight that reality as opposed to a clean equitable barbie land resolution at the end,2023-07-21 14:31:44
i was thinking that too especially if they leaned more into the generational difference of the mom and daughters relation to barbie like how the moms idolization is problematic but the daughters hatred is equally as problematic  and somewhere in the middle women can learn to understand each other i also wish ken had a little more resolve i’m not sure what i was supposed to think about him and i don’t think the filmmakers did either,2023-07-23 22:57:09
i agree i think the first half of the movie super solid and funny but it fell off when they left the real world so quick i thought the rest of the plot was going to be here helping the mother daughter pair but then they were kind of left underdeveloped and forgotten about i did love all the ken shenanigans but the movie wasnt that much fun towards the end outside of that,2023-07-24 23:45:25
yeah i feel like we could’ve had more hijinks in the real world or something,2023-07-24 22:55:57
i think its also tied in with her creator being like “you have to take the good along with the bad of being a human woman” so the joke is that it goes from this uplifting montage of the good parts only to shift to her first gynecology exam which kind of sucks lol,2023-08-06 18:54:35

funny i thought the exact opposite found the beginning set up unfunny  all leading up to “you have to go to the real world” completely lame 40 minutes in was completely convinced “barbie finding herself in the real world” was going to be insufferable the middle i thought was hilarious and goslings performance saved the film him discovering the real world and bringing his perception of it back to barbieland was very funny and there were a ton of jokes that landed well the end was predictable and beyond on the nose to be considered “smart satire”,2023-07-25 02:34:19
deeply silly thing to say to the point that you genuinely sound like a conspiracy theorist why are people incapable of conceiving that others can love something they dont i absolutely hated nope but not once have i thought that people are just pretending to love it because they dont want to get  on,2023-07-21 17:13:38

"really for me that was the best part of the movie the seeds of it were there from the first scene of her alone in la watching all the people in the park living their lives i thought it was a beautiful examination of a woman deciding to be a real messy person instead of shiny perfect concept which is something the patriarchy often forces upon them i didn’t find the flashbacks random at all 

not to say you’re wrong of course just that it’s interesting how something can connect so much with someone and so little with someone else that’s cinema",2023-07-22 15:19:09
"radically feminist piece of propaganda

the movie literally made fun of radical feminism

barbieland in the beginning is basically a glorified radical feminist society where women rule the world and the men are just there to be playthings for the women the movie compared this to the patriachal society of the real world

the ending of the movie had this societal structure be taken down the kens are given a position in president barbies cabinet and are encouraged to be themselves beyond being their respective barbies boyfriends

the movie is a lot of things but its definitely not a radical feminist propaganda",2023-07-21 04:27:07

"“misandric sic drivel” really

" lower ranking mattel guy hes portrayed as unimportant and relatively meek

 alan alan the orbiter hes the guy that nobody respects or even remembers 

 ken ok so even without knowing which ken youre talking about they all seem to lean into their flaws at one point or another 

 ceo oh come on the ceo is the most overthetop of them all in terms of flaws his line about normal barbie or whatever was something like this is a horrible idea then switches to this is a great idea when his lackey says itll make them money greta could not have been more onthenose with this one if shed named wills character president business he is a man who has no conviction beyond the drive for money 

the closest we get to a decent man is duolingo dad and hes more innocuous than good and one could argue that hes still not really all that aware of the world around him 

but heres the rub i dont think that the fact that every man in the film is basically a collection of character flaws is a bad thing or meant to be nothing more than a round of vacuous manhating 

this pattern lays into the exploration of the experience of being a womanwhich is what the whole thing is about anyhow

i think its a great movie with a lot to say the fact that there really isnt a good male character is part of that statement how does it feel to exist as a woman in the real world",2023-07-21 13:43:04
"i think the writing was consistent

you know how men like andrew tate will say they want patriarchy for the money babes  power ect outside of the few that are psychopaths they are just boys who want connection and love yet cling to patriarchy thinking it will give them that instead of seeking to be see and be seen

how many boys get frustrated about not finding a girlfriend and when a andrew tate or jordan peterson comes along then suddenly click i can make this system work for me",2023-07-21 12:42:09
even those characters were portrayed as weak and fumbling idiots alan was a wimp ceo was greedy and money driven accurate sure to an extent but the construction guys catcalling barbie isnt really a thing anymore thats like 90s and 00s behavior in todays climate that doesnt happen anymore  or as often i guess  granted im not a woman but things arent as bad as they make it out to be in the film,2023-07-21 12:34:16

that’s because despite this being a movie about barbie not needing ken and women’s empowerment  unfortunately even if the portrayal was negative greta gerwig made a movie that’s absolutely obsessed with men which is kinda dumb for a barbie movie,2023-07-23 18:35:53

dude we get it you don’t understand this movie lol,2023-07-24 13:13:24
the representation of men in the movie was to me a way of poking fun at how women have been portrayed in movies since the literal invention of movies have you watched the majority of movies produced in the 20th century because if you have seen even a small swathe of them you would know that women are presented as mindless side pieces with cute interests that dont matter barbie was taking every movie stereotype of women and applying it to men and now men are freaking out about it now you have some slight modicum of how it feels to be portrayed this way over and over again for decades,2023-07-24 14:59:39

i dont agree kens are portraited as victims of mattel choices as well as barbies but on a different level and almost like a parable pf women in the real world while the big bosses from mattel are the only relevant male figures we have from the real world and those are obviously portraited as enemies for instance look at america ferreras husband hes learning spanish his wifes mother tongue hes basically the only man from the real world we actually know and he shows one of the least selfless attitudes we could think of,2023-07-27 07:26:54

yes the film is riven with mirrormetaphor we are supposed to care about ken he is an oppressed minority in barbieland if we are angry about the oppression of ken we should consider the role of women in the real world its fun the film laughs it off but there is a deadly serious undertone there that is like  why have kenmenwomen not achieved equality yet",2023-07-25 20:56:13

it tried to be too many things for too many people all i wanted was a silly fun lets go girls barbie movie for the millenials  gerwig wanted to revert expectations but i wanted a movie where barbie takes on the mattel ceos as the main villains learns that world isnt all sunshine and roses and starts to stand up for herself all while ken happily tags along and makes barbie see his worthgets the girl in the end,2023-07-22 21:53:03

that annoyed me because every day barbie is a  idea it would be like having office man action figures or do your homework games  the point of toys including barbie is to stoke the imagination of the child little girls dont want to play with just normal boring person doll and the only reason americas character suggested that was due to her own insecurities about being a normal boring adult instead of a literal barbie doll which is 

also if every day barbie really did make so much money compared to surfing barbie or astronaut barbie or barbie with a really nice car mattel would have already been mass producing them irl acting as if one of the worlds biggest toy conglomerates doesnt know what toys kids want just to reinforce your own premise is silly and actively harms your own argument",2023-07-25 17:01:01

the final talk between barbie and ken was more personal its between the ken and the barbie we know that every barbies and kens are different",2023-07-23 12:19:25
yeah but barbie land isn’t portrayed as negatively as the real world or the kendom that’s the point your obviously meant to have more sympathy for the barbies and literally every man in the movie is an idiot and most also villains  you can’t do that if you want people to think that it’s wrong if one gender dominates or it will just make it seem like you think it’s better if women dominate,2023-07-23 14:21:04
"i 100 agree the people who are just seeing the movie as “men ” are missing basically every message lol 

the whole takeaway from that conversation between barbie and ken at the end is barbie realized that living in a total matriarchal society was bad because the kens weren’t able to find their own identities she says “it’s barbie and it’s ken”

imo the message is that neither men nor women should rely on gender stereotypes to guide their personality and that everyone just needs to find their own identity i don’t get how people are interpreting that as a “bad” message…",2023-07-23 12:24:49

but thats skipping over a major part of what really happened in real life before the civil war women had money and power prenuptial agreements  were to protect women and their property  total opposite as what we think of today even black women slaves had more rights than black make slaves  they could actually fight for their freedom in court which black male slaves could not  generally everybody was mostly poor with the some being rich and white women made up a large sum of those rich which came crashing down as the civil war concluded taking away a large sum of those womens wealthy property  hence the original feminist movement of the 1870s,2023-07-23 02:37:37

they didn’t say it was a bad message just that it would’ve been a good opportunity to showcase positive communication among males in a healthy way we should be encouraging men to feel emotions and feel a sense of self without a woman taking on the burden of comforting them and telling them everything is going to be okay,2023-07-27 19:54:07
have you ever considered that its just not as fun to punch down rather than up and that a smug film sneering at how were in charge etc would be boring as  to watch,2023-07-28 09:50:01
"wow sounds like someone broke out of kendom land or whatever

did you even watch the movie i guess even if you did it sounds like you dont have the empathy or insight to understand how much it sucks that women today are still fighting for equal rights in the workplace and of our own reproductive systems but please tell me more about how your feelings were hurt when they poked fun at your hobbies",2023-07-28 03:39:59
that’s the sequel barbie 2 ken flips the script and learns the electric boogaloo,2023-07-28 03:38:32
everyone would be in flames we all know its truth,2023-07-28 04:00:42
i understand that but i just think a better message would be like “we’re not going to do what the humans do we’re gonna do better” type of thing,2023-07-21 22:58:51
also i’m a school psychologist and have done a lot of research on gender gaps and truthfully many of the disparities come down to differences in the interestscareers of men and women and the fact that women give birth if we want women’s capital to increase we need to start with better maternity and paternity leaves imo,2023-07-21 23:00:39
idk did it i thought it did a good job of showing the at the ken world was really shallow and they were all unhappy and infighting and her conversation with him that he doesn’t have to be a ken with a girlfriend or house or horse lol to still be a ken was really decent,2023-07-21 23:43:46
because they were justified in trying too,2023-07-21 22:19:06
because we all deserve equal rights because equal rights arent conditional because equal rights are not a reward for good behavior,2023-07-21 22:28:49
why would men give power to women mind you women are in senate congress supreme court etc in our real world so clearly the men in real world are better than barbies in barbieland,2023-07-21 22:24:25
i guess but i personally think the “fight the patriarchy” message was too heavy handed and somewhat exaggerated,2023-07-21 23:19:35
i also feel that they don’t necessarily make it seem like being in a society run by women is the most ideal thing because why else would barbie gloria and sasha all leave barbieland i think if they had all stayed then you could argue gerwig was trying to make the point that “a matriarchal society is ideal” but in truth they were just trying to put barbieland back to the way it’s supposed to be,2023-07-30 14:43:51
it became  ken so they discontinued it even though its the best selling ken doll of all time ,2023-07-23 01:30:14
but the ending is literally everything goes back to normal and the kens still have no power or input or even homes and are still fully irrelevant how is that a middle ground,2023-07-24 15:09:32
i would love to agree with this but the movie didn’t do that there was still no middle ground when it was all said and done… so what was the point i’m fine with it just not having one it was an enjoyable movie beautiful visuals ridiculous lineup of big names the money and time put into the film was obvious but as far as a deep profound message about equality feminism gender roles the patriarchy etc… nah it wasn’t there and if it was supposed to be it just got lost in everything else,2023-07-24 15:26:25
i viewed it as alan already having self actualized as an individual since he was the only remaining alan doll left in a world populated by barbies and kens so hes always been aware of his unique identity and didnt feel the need to lash out along with the kens,2023-07-26 03:43:06
solid read since you mentioned it ncuti gatwa is nonbinary and a ken and they had a line at the end that heavily implied they were essentially  best friend ken,2023-07-26 06:56:17

"i took my 12 year old son and he loved the movie

i know for a fact my younger nieces and nephews would find it enjoyable also",2023-07-21 19:14:26
"might be spoilers in here for anybody who sees this and hasnt seen the movie yet i tried to be as vague as i can


 well it showed that the man running mattel will ferrell was more a result of the patriarchal system than an active participant when he realises what ken has done he tries to make things right because he believes in the original intent of barbie making little girls happy 

then theres the kens who are shown to be treated as secondclass citizens in barbie world and they exist solely to supplement the barbies and vye for their attention and approval once a ken gets into the real world he starts to cotton on to the reversal at play between the genders someone walks up to him and asks him for the time for the first time in his existence he feels valued and useful so he chases more of that

 the movie is as much about ken finding out who he is and where he fits as it is about barbie finding herself as well and is a necessary hurdle for her and the other barbies to overcome he goes way overboard with a lessthanbasic understanding of patriarchy and the kens as a whole  but the film ends with them making up and the kens being granted more of a role in their society after being shown the error of their ways so at the end both sides walk away with a clearer understanding of themselves and of each other and work out a compromise to start making progress to true equality in their world

as a 31 year old man who heavily subscribed to the toxic masculinity mindset through my early 20s i found myself relating to the internal struggles of the kens quite a bit while laughing along at how  and goofy they were yeah it was exaggerated and played for laughs and it definitely should be the way men can react when we feel emasculated and cop hits to the ego can be utterly ridiculous and often disproportionate yet i never once felt like the movie was being meanspirited or unfair it was ridiculing dated yet current societal norms in an overthetop way and a lot of it landed for me 

the movie goes out of its way to point out that the kens position in their society was not ideal for them and fell on deaf ears it didnt use it as the sole excuse for conflict in the movie rather it showed that people who arent comfortable within themselves can latch onto someone in their lives and depend on that person to fill the void so to speak when their expectations arent met unrealistic or unfair as they may be that can breed bitterness and push backs will happen in ome form or another

tldr i thought the movie was really clever and insightful and i didnt ever really find it to be punching down its a goofy comedy movie and it has a very clear message about insecurity and identity on both sides of the coin i enjoyed it",2023-07-26 20:10:20
well when you treat women like  for decades do you really expect women to not be bitter lol pls let us be bitter now y’all finally know what it’s like for us when we watch movies,2023-07-21 11:55:12
i’m so sorry to hear that i’m sure you are an amazing person don’t let this film get you down i know i’m just a random person on reddit but if you need a pal or just someone to talk to you can message me,2023-07-21 04:14:40
and just remember it’s better to live one day as a lion than 100 days as a sheep my friend,2023-07-21 04:17:08
the  does this even mean,2023-07-21 11:53:56
why do you think masculinity is a bad thing not disrespecting your opinion im just curious,2023-07-21 13:57:33
"there were multiple kens shown who had barbies who loved them

was that in the background somewhere",2023-07-21 18:38:58
"in some ways i do understand it did not promise to deradicalize anyone but i think because of the scope of its influence there should be a consideration of how it affects all audiences there are actual real world implications to the millions of men that are being conditioned to view women in the way they currently are

but still even that blatant misandry felt like it was disorganized and inconsistent

barbie obviously wasnt mean to be dystopian it was basically supposed to be heaven for women the women have great boundaries ample opportunity

why have the kens take over just to have the barbies take back over and have society remain essentially the same except now barbies have all the power is power just changing hands from one gender to the other what is the message they are trying to communicate that entire arc felt somewhat pointless to me even the last line about maybe one day the kens will have the same amount of rights as women in the real world what did the kens or barbies learn from their realworld excursion if anything",2023-07-25 04:49:09
i mean this is the place to talk ab the movie man defo too much to just say it was mid tho,2023-07-23 22:04:41
so youre not allowed to criticize it because its just a movie thanks for the brain dead commentary,2023-07-23 22:02:59
additionally i feel like it was for most of the movie promising to unravel all these ideas about men and women and the patriarchy and it didn’t really effectively or innovatively do that,2023-07-23 22:00:42
"you dont see the irony of this comment

if this was true maybe the movie should have focused on being fun and entertaining in other words just a movie instead of turning into a lecture

you are saying its just a movie but to me it seemed like the writers of the movie dont actually agree otherwise theyd probably have avoided all the preaching",2023-07-23 22:57:14
i just feel like if i had 145 million dollar budget i could make a better script frankly,2023-07-23 21:52:56
that was your take away even after the heart to heart with ken at the end you just wanted to be upset,2023-07-22 23:14:59
wooooosh,2023-07-22 23:14:09
if thats the meaning you took away you missed a looot of subtext at minimum and maybe a few important scripted plot points on top of that,2023-07-23 02:07:58
i pointed to my gf that the speech that talks about all these social impositions onto women while not false kinda makes it sound as men are not subject to pressure from society as well her face was a question mark she really believed men are living the dream right now,2023-07-23 05:54:51
i don’t know if it’s just me that felt this but i also don’t really understand why the feminist speech had any impact for barbie herself people have been calling barbie a woman which isn’t entirely accurate she’s just barbie and in barbieland where everyday except literally one day barbies have occupied the place that men have traditionally occupied how does the feminist speech have any real context for barbie if anything “i’m so tired of seeing women tie themselves in knots so people will like us” rings way more true for ken,2023-07-23 08:37:00
exactly some of us just wanted to escape those issues while others thought the wording was stale,2023-07-23 08:08:54
it’s kind of your fault for taking your 9 year old kid to see a pg13 greta gerwig and expecting it to be made for them,2023-07-23 09:03:44
the film is way more egalitarian than how your presenting it barbie world was clearly a matriarchy and kens arc was a clear response to that by the end both sides reach a little more understanding between each other,2023-07-23 08:17:38
the mattel scenes were just out of place too cartoony for real world,2023-07-24 20:05:50
"what was the one or two that you felt could really help the storyline if they were done better

i personally feel that each of these themes could be a movie of their own mattel was a little short sighted here",2023-08-10 16:06:10
"the problem is not that it should be perfect if it was just a dumb fun movie like jurassic world people wouldnt complain but the movie does try to convey deep social messages pretty bluntly

thats why people get more nitpicky about it",2023-08-11 13:26:05
"youre allowed to complain about jurassic world and john wick lots of people do

you are also allowed to complain about the barbie movie

get over yourself",2023-08-14 08:01:50
"to be fair i would be completely okay with that but this movie was made by a feminist director who definitely tried to put these themes in there 

i didn’t hate the movie at all i loved most of it but i was just confused at the end and needed to discuss it ",2023-08-10 15:54:57
also weird that there were no plot holes unless you’re a very confused man who doesn’t understand plot,2023-08-10 23:45:47
enlighten me,2023-08-09 18:16:52
let’s go barbie let’s go party ,2023-07-26 09:50:22
"that’s the point with ken though this film purposely and satirically switches gender roles in barbieland to point out the ridiculous and problematic character archetypes that were traditionally available to women in the real world essentially with this gender swap they make kens into the  role that women are cast in in the real world   


marilyn monroe is a classic example of this early in her acting career her studio typecasted her into the dumb blonde role despite her desire to break into serious acting studios refused to cast her in any other role but the dumb blonde women traditionally have limited roles in film and often times their characters only exist to support or push the story of the male protagonist there’s notable exceptions to this of course but this has been a problematic part of hollywood’s history

  


so the point of the kens in this film isn’t to act like some grand statement that men are idiots  the point of casting men in the classic onedimension pretty accessory to the protagonist “” role a role portrayed by women in the real world is to highlight the absolute ridiculousness and absurdity of the existence of these traditional female character archetypes in film 

if seeing men cast in this role makes you feel angered or like men are being improperly and insultingly portrayed on the big screen it’s supposed to make you feel that way   


stop and think about the countless movies where female characters are simply plot devices used to create  appeal for male audiences or are simply cast as dumb andor mean blondes then ask yourself why is our society comfortable even entertained by seeing women in those roles but when it’s men reduced to this role suddenly it’s uncomfortable  and angering to watch the kens directly challenge the audience’s expectation of gender roles in film as a way to push viewers to question their own biases and expectations the point is that these types of roles are ridiculous and insulting to all genders since it’s normalized to cast women in this role people won’t blink an eye so the point of  casting men as these overthetop absurd gang of idiots is to bring attention to this ridiculousness in a way the audience can’t ignore",2023-07-26 11:36:55
" i loved the reference because it is so gloriosuly obscure and it teased a whole  of indy music fans who wax lyrical about whatever obscure bands theyve obsessed with to strangers and ive def been that guy in the past although ive always tried to avoid monologuing and usually learned more from the women ive talked to about music more than been the teacher

yeah thats just conversation youre allowed to have conversation even if its about something obscure you saying something could allow the person youre talking to to be one of that days 10000

thank you for referencing malkmus i knew something flew by me in the theatre but forgot about it now i get to google good kenergy keep it up

edit lol malkmus has a tweet about the barbie boost",2023-07-26 14:46:54
were they really mean spirited though a few jobs about men overexplaining porsches or certificates of deposit thats all it takes to upset you grow some thicker skin be a man about it,2023-07-26 12:57:39
"i saw it as a woman just sharing her oppressed experience as a female under male dominance rather than roasting men

roasting men isnt the proper wording

in another words sharing a concern of personal mistreatment defense rather than insulting someone else offense",2023-07-26 16:41:26
this comment right here is a textbook example of apophenia not everything is satirical or metaphorical  sometimes plot holes are plot holes sometimes bad movies are bad movies maybe the genital joke was just a joke because of the multiple established jokes throughout the movie centered around the barbies and kens not having genitalia trying to interpret this as some brilliant metaphorical moment is giving the writers way too much credit,2023-07-23 04:58:10
“i don’t like your opinion so you’ve obviously never had  which is the peak of human value”  peabrain,2023-07-21 17:56:35
"appreciate the additional info  so in regards to my original question are there good male role models in the film

i loved the truman show and thought this movie would be a fun but im hearing its heavy handed and preachy in its message",2023-07-21 13:13:28
"i don’t know which men you’re referring to but they definitely do not build their identity witharound a woman 

their identities take shape in their teens… and along the way they find people who are attracted to “that stage” of the personality they’re in 

i have never interacted with a male who has changed his personality or built one around a woman… 

women too… irl their hierarchy in society maybe has been tied to their spouse but each one comes with their own personality inspired by their childhood growing years and subsequent education",2023-07-21 23:16:20
in all fairness the movie gets pretty serious,2023-07-21 12:48:39
"exactly towards the end when they were tossing clothes off the roof and it paused to give you the name

remember that as a kid remember how good you felt when you bought it you can have that feeling again

the snow boot that was lost by the mom as a kid and her wanting to buy an entire new doll to get the boot

ooh i had that play house as a kid i saved up all my allowance for it",2023-07-21 11:34:48
"so it was actually ruth talking to barbie in the closing dialogue 

  
she goes being a human can be pretty uncomfortable  and humans make things up like patriarchy or barbie just to deal with how uncomfortable it is  
and then you die",2023-07-28 04:26:29
"i dont mean villain as in like evil i mean like the narrative sense as in in a film novel or play a character whose evil actions or motives are important to the plot  


basically every movie like greta gerwigs barbie or toy story 3 that has a ken doll in it you can basically guarantee hes going to be the oafish bad guy who turns over a new leaf",2023-07-21 12:39:05
and that kens identity wasnt based on his relationship with barbie,2023-07-21 12:44:02
"i feel like people are getting caught in the words im using the words villain and antagonist are basically interchangeable most of the time   
i just meant that everytime ken is in a major movie hes always an antagonist like hes never a good guy hes always a misled   who needs to be brought back to the good side",2023-07-21 13:57:09
i will offer a million dollars to anybody who can explain said mother daughter storyline to me what was their issue how did it get resolved,2023-07-21 10:35:13
is this a joke see the recent supreme court dobbs decision,2023-07-22 22:39:55
have you heard about some of those abortion laws in the us,2023-07-22 22:45:14
there was a famous supreme court ruling recently you might have heard of,2023-07-22 23:16:52
do you really need to ask that,2023-07-22 22:38:25
did they though i only saw it once of course but all i recall is they were allowed a tiny bit of leeway at the end but that was pretty much it i understand if its supposed to be some kind of narrative of how emancipation started in the first place and thats not really what bothered me there just werent any normal guys in any universe and i dont really understand what point they were trying to make with that  the moms monologue near the end also wasnt relatable for me at all so it just annoyed me with how preachy it felt everything else was really fun and creative i still think it was a great movie it just didnt need that for me,2023-07-22 14:57:22
"i wonder if it was to make the males in the audience thing “oh that seems unfair why can’t you do it now”

so they can catch the ",2023-07-22 12:41:51
i get it but it’s 2023 not 1919  this movies satire is just too absurd i couldn’t take it seriously,2023-07-24 22:08:20
what insecurity do you mean,2023-07-22 14:59:03
well gloria did suggest making a normal barbie in the end and the final decision of our barbie was to move beyond the picked roles and stereotypes and try to figure out what she wants to be as a human being,2023-07-21 13:05:38
and it’s exactly how a lot of us reacted too when we first see stuff like that in our body,2023-07-24 00:02:56
that and everyone sees themselves under the spotlight effect at all times someone whos insecure about their cellulite isnt going to immediately think everyone with cellulite is  theyre just irrationally worried that other people will think that its entirely realistic that a real person would do this,2023-07-23 23:44:04
but in barbie world where the women were in full control and running things why would barbie see cellulite as awful and grotesque in the first place the men are not giving them these ideas same for the flat feet so the women are being perfectionists on themselves all by themselves  with no other male influence,2023-07-23 23:46:02
im not taking sides here but you sound like a snobby  with that anyone with open eyes garbage learn to share your thoughts on the internet without acting like youre superior to everyone else,2023-07-24 02:15:36
to me it felt like a voiceover trying to explain the message of the movie to people who havent yet understood it that may work in a movie where the message is rather subtle however in a movie where the message is in your face such a tirade is way over the top,2023-07-26 22:56:41
it completely took me out of the movie i felt that was a moment the movie wanted me to like but i felt like it was more of a wah being a women is so hard moment like sorry i think being a person is hard but focusing so much on being a victim is a hard pass for me,2023-07-27 07:53:18
they do touch on that theme at the end that’s true but i guess it just wasn’t enough for me and i had the same thoughts about the concept of time as well as oppression just trying to explain it to myself and fill in the gaps they indeed were just trying to juggle too much at once and i understand why that would happen what a tough assignment writing this film would be,2023-08-06 00:42:42
"the movie is not at all about mortality that was just a plot device to show how barbie and the mom are linked and how thats reflected back into the barbie world and also its funny

you may as will say youre disappointed that the end of the movie wasnt about cellulite",2023-08-06 01:59:03
barbieland isn’t perfectly equal in the end because equality doesn’t come overnight in that sense the satire is on point,2023-07-21 13:21:20
"did you not listen to the line after she refuses the ken supreme court justice that says kens will work their way up and maybe one day have as much power in barbie land as women in the real world aka not at all equal this was a scene where a giant mirror is held to your face

the ending is not meant to be perfect this film is for you the father to realize what reality we live in your daughter will have time to consume other movies that will teach her about idealism",2023-07-21 13:31:24
i guess the intention in ending it that way was for menboys to see it  think hey that might be better than before but the kens still dont have full equality thats not fair and then in turn realize thats the reality for women in real life,2023-07-21 13:25:06
" if greta could channel the strength of both gender to make barbie world a better place for coexistence it would be better

if humans could channel the strength of both genders to make the world a better place for coexistence it would be better but real life doesnt work that way either unfortunately",2023-07-21 13:53:49
did you even watch barbie lol tf,2023-07-21 13:38:43
those examples are dumb because noone disagrees the point of reversing the roles is to show that a social convention being held is not fair if there was a movie made about blacks owning whites during the time of slavery it would shine an extremely well lit light on the social norm of owning slaves i think its okay to portray these things because if it fuels hatred on you then you are a hateful person anyway the message needs to be told and if you dont want to support it thats okay,2023-07-21 13:58:32
"the funniest part for me was after his resolution when he says honestly i lost interest when i realised it wasnt about the horses  

it really highlighted the idea that a lot of dudes act like  dudes because they think it looks cool but once they are already invested they just never change back until they are humbled",2023-07-22 00:08:23
it didn’t miss it wasn’t supposed to end with barbie’s fixing absolutely everything and creating a perfect society that would have been way too rah rah for me so instead making a joke how even women would retain majority power in that situation landed a lot better,2023-07-22 22:34:27
it was a heavy handed allegory for the glass ceiling and how despite the best of intentions its still deeply rooted in american society and that reality isnt perfect it was a bit of a reach given that women make up almost half of the supreme court and we currently have a woman vice president where the kens have nothing of the sort but i understood the joke,2023-07-22 22:36:34
"i don’t really think it missed the whole point of that line was to illustrate that even when an oppressed group starts to be heard seen and considered there will still be oppressive power structures in place progress isn’t some sort of instantaneous thing it will take time for kens to gain rights and power in barbieland just like it took time for women to gain rights and power in the real world


in my opinion it would’ve been super corny and eye roll inducing for the barbie’s to automatically give the kens complete equality after they realized the error of their ways it also would’ve implied that the matriarchy in barbieland was somehow more fair and just than the patriarchy in the real world",2023-07-23 02:02:51
yes exactly that part at the end ruined it for me i was already checked out once they went back to barbie land but by then i was like by  this movie wasn’t very good,2023-07-23 00:01:58
it’s not ironic kens suffering in a matriarchal society and his suffering represents women in the patriarchy just flipped genders,2023-07-23 21:31:26
second this massively  wanna add as well to the people annoyedconfused on why only barbie apologizes to ken at the end and feeling like he got more character development that is because kens experience is supposed to reflect womens experience in the real world his journey of feeling like just an accessory and lost on who they are under a matriarchy is supposed to reflect womens experience under the real world patriarchy will say i would’ve enjoyed more attention on the real world family too however all i would change there is making the film longer lol,2023-07-24 06:58:45
no i understand that at the time of inception that was the prevailing issue and therefore barbie taught little girls that they could be anything which was incredibly important and cutting edge at the time but we are in a different place now in the world as women where the new expectation is that we have careers or we stay at home but not both there is immense pressure on women in corprate american to not take time off for motherhood and when we do we are penalized for it i would have like to have seen mattel keep up with the new issues that women face and to have updated barbie over the years to be aligned with the issues modern girls women face,2023-08-02 14:05:56
that’s mattel spin,2023-08-02 14:10:56
my thinking was that it was a movie all about feminism  but only the parts of feminism that all feminists agree on which is apparently a very small space that you could cover with a 30 minute movie instead of a 2 hour one,2023-11-17 20:22:35
"ha what while the movie oppenheimer had some exaggeration everything experienced had political commentary that man faced continued scrutiny out of  fear and false accusation  we were at war and literally no one could be trusted   
today women have made great strides but yes we have to jump over naive individuals such as you  being a human with morals and integrity is why we should remind each other of their importance youre the individual that makes it political",2023-11-12 02:22:39
"no im quite serious i actually initially thought that the backlash it had gotten with maleguy viewers when it was theatres must have been overblown and to a degree it was  but having said that holy  is this movie a blatant ham  attempt at throwing the population of guys under the bus

i love the scene where barbie goes to the real world and approaches the construction workers who are all guys and she immediately starts getting sexualized with derogatory remarks like what in the actual  just with that scene alone there are so many things that are wrong

for one that doesnt  happen in the real world yeah sure if your margot robbie in tight fitting cowboy outfit  guys will stare but  verbal remarks right away immediately when she starts a conversation what and that scene wasnt filmed for humor none of the dialogue was quirky or intended for a laugh so one can safely and obviously come to the conclusion that greta gerwig was trying to say something with that scene

secondly theres absolutely nothing keeping from girls being construction workers in the real world versus barbie world absolutely nothing women are perfectly within their right to apply for construction positions but they dont its not because of a patriarchy  its because well they just dont apply for those hard labor jobs gosh gee golly who could have possibly thought that would be the cause

i stand by what i said this movie is in no way shape or form meant to be funny  greta gerwig knew exactly what she was doing and took every single gullible girl or guy for a ride

since when was barbie an icon for female empowerment and feminism anyway it wasnt but the movie sure as  fooled people into thinking it was",2023-11-06 05:28:52
"or maybe the kens were underdeveloped because reallife ken dolls actually were just accessories for the female barbie dolls maybe it’s a joke about a toy in a movie about a toy that she just slapped some broad feminist ideas onto 

the concept of a ken doll finding out that men in the real world aren’t just accessories for women then getting very into horses and pool tables in genuinely funny because it’s a joke about a toy calm down",2023-07-25 13:47:25
"well mr “nutsackfordayzzzz” barbie also didn’t use the stairs actually have things to eatdrink etc because that’s not how little girls play with barbie in the real world it’s not a stretch to say the kens are underdeveloped because boys have been told not to play with dolls in the real world 

seeing the deeper meaning means also confronting the patriarchy in our own society and that can be incredibly daunting for some people 

it’s also interesting that when ken gets back from the real world he takes over the dream house and “kenergizes” everything with the patriarchy in an incredibly ridiculous way i’m sure a lot of little girls can relate to a brother or cousin taking over their dollhouse with cars or toy horses or trains when they play the whole thing is a metaphor and once you can admit that it’s a lot easier to see the parallels and symbolism",2023-07-25 18:48:35
"you make a lot of outside references without unpacking them in your discussion thanks for pointing out the relation to radical feminism — where do you see the characters enacting that in the movie 

i agree with the op in two specific sections that the motherdaughter relationship is magically fixed and barbie’s aesthetic concerns were never addressed these character problems are introduced and aren’t resolved these lingering threads thwart the coherence of the plot",2023-07-22 23:56:02
the whole bit at the end with ken being “helped” by barbie is defiantly a radical feminist talking point about how patriachy hurts men too trouble is that only resonates with radical feminists as actually 95 of men don’t actually want to cry more or find themselves whatever that means according to feminists  it’s really just a fantasy of feminist women that they like to project on men but is very far from reality it sounds good to women because they think they would like that but men are just like nah,2023-07-26 07:09:19

whoooosh,2023-07-23 19:48:16
well said  i agree  they are afraid that if they criticize the film they will get cancelled  boycotted  etc,2023-07-22 18:38:23
critics of barbie are usually saying things about their opinion and adding in how dumb it is that other people have an opinion different then their own that is when they get attacked when they take their opinion and hold it up as law  it’s fine if someone didn’t like the movie or that they thought it was heavy handed it blatantly is but i felt the movie had fun with how obvious it’s message was almost all the jokes landed for me a white male and some of them rang so painfully true i couldn’t stop laughing everyone in my theater which was packed looked like they were having a blast seeing all these comments about theater walkouts make me wonder how many people making these comments are actually being truthful or just pushing an agenda,2023-07-22 18:52:17
i find it hilarious that people want the message to be more subtle and yet its super apparent all over reddit that a ton of people entirely misunderstood what the film was saying despite how loud it was saying it,2023-07-22 13:59:36
"messages do not have to be subtle but here the constant monologues especially the mothers lengthy speech in the weird house were just stating the obvious and were cringe 

the ken songs didnt make sense  the barbies were turning the kens against one another then they suddenly break into song

i think the mattel executives were meant to be funny they cast will ferrell as the leader  the jokes about them failing to jump the turnstile and rollerblading were silly but not funny

i appreciate what youre saying about the daughter but to me it seems she had a 180 degree personality change without adequate justification

i think reviewers are afraid that if they give this a bad review they will be cancelled or boycotted",2023-07-22 18:46:14
you are correct,2023-07-21 23:44:23
yep mussolini great barbie comeback,2023-07-31 18:32:29
i know but ultimately i think the stares were more so painful than creepy like imagine being ignored and downgraded everyday then finally getting the power to flip it over thats why goslings character never feels like a villain hes just reacting to whatever happend with him,2023-07-22 13:38:48
what rights do you have to wait for exactly that i already have please list one,2023-07-22 21:05:52
i get it but they should have kept it light the message could have been super clear without having to explicitly spell out the theme the last 30 minutes took me out of the movie completely,2023-07-24 22:02:46
"good point i am still trying to digest all the deeper messages in the movie so i enjoy hearing other perspectives 

i wonder if alan is supposed to represent the boys playing with barbies",2023-07-23 12:36:10
i don’t really get what’s so bad about stallone or the godfather or working out tbh seems like gerwig had a major chip on her shoulder against men who have typical male interests,2023-07-23 14:17:01
"i get your point but the problem with that is the kens are immediately relegated to their position as second class citizens in the barbie society at the end of the film 

your point would make more sense if the barbie president decided kens could have an equal say and find their own identity maybe have their own kendom where they can build their mega dojo casas but instead she wont even let them have a small position of power like a supreme court seat kind of goes against the message of both having their own identity if one is still clearly the ruling class

after all the kens just wanted to enjoy their horses and manly hobbies and of course they went too far when they first got a taste of that freedom but then the barbies response was just to completely take everything away rather than compromise the message of well you can just be ken is kind of hollow if ken still has to do everything the barbies want in a society dominated by them",2023-07-23 12:25:31
thank you it was very mean spirited,2023-07-22 16:02:10
and you think that the reasons behind that are sexism and not you know biological differences that make men more exciting to watch,2023-07-22 16:05:33
"but why thats not what happens in real life nor is stallone celebrated just for existing while male i dont think any of the men in that montage were being celebrated at all except for the presidents but they were celebrated because they were presidents not because they were male

again muddled message",2023-07-22 16:03:35
i saw it as look at all the role models including movie stars we are forcing down every ones throat notice how almost all are men,2023-07-22 16:16:38
you went 0100 what happened,2023-07-22 03:16:43

anyone who doesnt think barbie is phenomenal is apparently a teenage male in here it seems",2023-07-22 03:14:58
i’m a woman and thought it was terrible,2023-07-22 04:47:08
"if this movie came out in the 50’s it woulda been entirely controversial but probably would’ve been one of the greatest movies retrospectively ever by actually tackling a problem… but we are 70 years past that point and that’s what really hurt this movie imo besides preteen boys and some odd backwoods folks not much of society at all is trying to say women can’t do anything or has to stay in a certain lane again tho if this was 70 years ago or in modern day syria the movie woulda got people killed but it woulda been a fantastic maybe timeless piece but by todays standards it just looks like man hating for the majority of the movie i don’t know much guys at all that are “women haters” i think most men love women and most women love men but tbh i think more women hate men than men hate women but that’s not really relevant… it failed at tackling the issue because it didn’t really make any sense 

i think the biggest thing tho is they had margot and gosling in a fun pretty world and the movie just wasn’t all that fun surface level feminism if i can even call it that and fell really short of being a very fun movie",2023-07-22 05:05:51
legally blonde is an excellent conversation in feminism without being a lecture it challenges the viewer to reconsider its masculinist internalized bias about what intelligence looks like promotes womensupportingwomen addresses  harassment and even has an example of what a male ally looks like all in a really silly and pink plot,2023-07-23 17:05:30
"i see what you mean but i didn’t personally take it that way i don’t think that’s what they were trying to say since like you said it felt so out place for something like that to be in the movie about how women can achieve anything 

i felt it was more of how mothers can be grounding points for children and how everything in a person’s life constantly grows and changes but mothers act as a sort of lighthouse in our lives “staying still” to me was more in the sense of they aren’t leaving your side through it all and they are the constant that you can always go to",2023-07-21 20:28:00
"my interpretation was as it relates to parenthood and maybe a parent’s tendency to resent their kids getting older and moving on we see this when the daughter is shown taking her old toys to goodwill and the mom saves the barbie doll as if she’s trying to hold on to the memories of her daughter as a young child rather than the young adult that she’s becoming 

so in the same way ruth created barbie as a way to give girls another aspiration other than just giving them baby dolls and saying “here you have to be a mom” but she also knows that barbies themselves have also grown beyond their original purpose",2023-07-21 21:23:18
"it also occured to me that throughout the movie others alluded to the fact that the weird things happening to barbie were caused both by barbie herself and her human when anyone said this barbie always vehemently denied that she had any part in it because she didnt want anything to change 

the idea that it takes two to tango makes sense because if a little girl owning a barbie and being sad caused this it would be way more common 

i feel that barbie always wanted to see beyond her own repetitive pictureperfect world deep down i know barbies dont have complex emotions etc but maybe being the stereotypical barbie and not having a career to occupy her mindtime could cause this",2023-07-24 23:06:27
simu lius ken appeared competent as well as allan and the women were obsessed with not having flat feet and cellulite,2023-07-28 07:35:26
theres no point in arguing youre not open to other opinions,2023-07-28 22:02:21
youre just revealing your own biases you just assumed the above person was male because they criticized the barbie movie and then went on to suggest that men dont like the movie for no reason other than they were entitled because everything else was made for them  which really could just be an attempt to discredit their opinion simply because you thought they were male,2023-07-22 22:12:26
yet i see more people women included talk about ken and how he was the best thing about the movie,2023-07-22 22:44:42
im a woman i really didnt like this movie,2023-07-22 21:59:37
my girlfriend also didnt care for it,2023-07-22 20:37:08
that’s honestly very insightful you’re right the barbie movie is actually a great way to learn about the bechdel test in general,2023-07-22 20:22:59
"i have to agree with thiskinda because it seemed like barbie was just either asexual or oblivious while ken always wanted more but never mentioned to communicate that clearly until the end seems very realistic to me

ps we were all so happy that earring ken made it into the movie that is my favorite doll",2023-07-23 08:06:27
huh ken is supposed to represent how women have always been depicted in film each character is a working metaphor not a grounded person,2023-07-23 09:22:06
telling a man every night for basically all of eternity that you are having girls night and he cant come over is a giant neon sign also women tend to favor nonconfrontational methods of turning a guy down because being blunt about it can make the guy angry and angry men are unpredictable its not all men but its always a man or a very crappy lesbian,2023-07-23 07:50:11
"you do realize men have their own duality of expectations right

erm yeh the film also dealt with this lol",2023-07-23 08:36:44
considering its barbie land and the matriarchy is at the helm showing the kens in position would have been a unique message no the film really struggles between picking barbie land vs real life social commentary and it gets confusing in the 2nd part,2023-07-23 10:47:13
"except no one is keeping women out were on decades of actively pushing young women in some fields like programming women have been leaders of many many countries germany korea to name 2 off the top gwenn shotwell is cfo of spacex the most powerful hired person in the most successful space launch company



theres often a pay gap between men and women still but ive never seen anyone not get hired for being a woman in my 1st job in retail 20 years ago i saw a woman hired over a guy with more experiance and 10 years ago something similar in another field that was more egregious in terms of experience and almost anytime a woman was matched vs men applying it went to women i am legit starting to agree with people who say women have barriers in their own minds because iirc i havent seen them a lot of the disparity is of course because women are relatively new to many fields and absolutely not welcome a few decades ago and because of that the girls growing up then didnt dream or were told not to dream of doing x when they were older but women have been scientists astronauts world leaders and whatever else they want to be for 3 decades now i have seen 2 examples of poc not being hired at 2 different places i worked but both were men so that needs work paygap needs work but women can do anyjob they want in the g20 world they can even direct a film about this topic with no eyes batted",2023-07-23 11:46:08
"and so what does that say about the protagonists of the film they are well aware of the issue and yet are happy to perpetuate it because they are the ones who come out on top the barbie’s have this huge opportunity to create a society where both barbies and kens are treated as equals but they’re like “nah we liked it when we were in power lol”

additionally it was already well established by this point in the movie that being treated as less than feels bad for both barbies and kens so the barbie’s make their decision knowing full well what it entails if the movie really wanted to relay the positive message that it seemed to strive for it would have recognized this “hey it actually really sucks when we treat each other poorly because of our genders let’s be better than the real world and take this amazing opportunity and shrug off those old beliefs and start treating each other equally”",2023-07-30 04:12:37
but it doesn’t even make sense in terms of the story as the kens aren’t responsible for the real world and barbie has just learnt that inequality is bad and gloria agrees it’s just dispensing with story to make a point that women can get a kick out of and for a slap down at men,2023-07-30 04:58:42
4 out of the 9 supreme court justices are women so not giving a ken a spot on the supreme court of barbieland is not representative of the inequality women face today,2023-07-30 17:07:52
"kens

the movie literally ends with the president saying that the kens cannot have a spot on the supreme court but can have a spot on a lower court and that kens will have as much power in barbieland as women do in the real world

the amount of upvotes your comment is getting shows that no one is actually thinking about this critically but instead voting out of emotion",2023-07-30 15:05:54
well it took the usa 203 years before there was one female supreme and barbie has only existed around 60 ish years so if you want to be real literal about it its a long way to go for the kens,2023-07-30 22:47:26

the stereotyping and reductionism of men and their personalities and issues in the movie is why some say its a bit meanspirited movie towards men,2023-08-02 16:45:26
i mean if you made a movie with a long montage showing all the annoying things girlfriendswives do to their men and having the male characters use this to their advantage while all the women are fools who fall for it i’m sure you’d hear people calling that movie misogynistic,2023-08-05 13:11:43
i dont disagree with a lot of your points but im pretty sure they meant they expected something like the movie clueless,2023-08-02 15:59:53
clueless is a movie starring alicia silverstone based on a jane austen book it also is not clueless in nature the title is about the title character it was smart and fun imo the barbie movie thought it was very smart and let you know that and wasn’t much fun,2023-08-02 16:36:41

"one of the best quotes from this film bar none

to be honest when i realized the patriarchy wasnt about horses i kinda lost interest 

its a great acknowledgement of the image of patriarchy and male power and domination and that the issue is a vast and complex problem

it also fits with ken ryans character quite well in terms of his simplicity and innocence",2023-08-21 16:40:34

"but one of the messages of the film was that barbie didnt magically fix all the problems faced by real women which is what all the barbies had been led to believe

it would have been extremely weird if barbie had shown up and just fixed glorias life and frankly i feel like it would have been a lesser movie i liked that the movie acknowledged that barbie being this weird perfect aspirational goal for young girls is outdated glorias internal struggle are a mix of both being a woman in a patriarchal society and watching her daughter age",2023-07-25 03:12:20

i wonder how women would take it if some innocuous wife character was mocked for learning a language by her son and husband and then her husband laughed about some cooler old girlfriend he had would they root for the character mocking her or recognize the obvious disrespect of all that and yet here it’s written for laughs and gloria is played as the sympathetic hero a man doing that would be shown as an  and received as such",2023-07-31 12:05:30

well for starters they present a very superficial and misrepresentative view of matriarchies and patriarchies they go out of their way to negatively present men and overly positively present women they present a detached and ignorant projection of what they believe incel men to be  everything about this movie is rooted in misandry and a disregard for men and mens issues if a movie was created that aimed to purposefully alienate attack vilify trivialize and misrepresent women this hard it would never make it to theater,2023-07-21 03:41:27

yeah but the thing is the women in the real world fighting patriachy are portrayed as good yet the kens are villains so it’s pretty confusing the problem was making kens in barbie land both the representation of women in the real world and the representation of “toxic” masculinity  it just makes it seem like they’re bad for ruining the matriarchy which is weird given the constant messaging of how terrible real world patriachy is,2023-07-23 14:13:32
"im so confused what do colors  have to do with barbie and ken cooperating steorytpical girl color turns uh other colors ok

im reading here barbies rule barbieland and ken are their sumbssive counterparts but then ken find out in realtily men rule and at the end he goes back home but nothing major changes towards an egalitarianist barbieland if the plot is trying to get neither one gender rules all hirearchy idea isnt good then this is one confusing  way to do it

 it all sounds weird for a toyline that begs its players to use in very very very specific ways",2023-07-23 13:04:57

maybe giving the writers too much credit but even when ken was complaining about being a ken in a barbies world i could still kind of see it as being about just how unfair it is for him to have to live up to societys expectations  its possible the writers tried to convey the same message twice to the benefit of not just the barbies but the kens too  being a barbie in a kens world sucks being a ken in a barbies world sucks  people should have the freedom to be who they want to be to live the best life they can while they still can because death and cellulite is coming for us all,2023-07-26 21:46:25

i completely agree with your penultimate paragraph i was enjoying the movie up until that point and although i wouldnt go as far as saying that ruined it it certainly felt like it undermined the message the film was trying to get across,2023-09-16 18:49:27
i think the manipulation part is about gray morality and unapologetically so to me it was about women taking the weapons of power traditionally used by men and wielding it themselves because when they go low we go high has never worked thats just the feel good messaging many people are brainwashed with so those in power never have to worry theyd fight back in any meaningful way,2023-09-20 13:54:06

"spot on with your points here 

just to add after leaving the cinema i said to my wife that im not sure this movie passes the reversebechdel test ie two named male characters talk to each other about something other than a woman 

its definitely a lampshade moment for how women are generally treated in cinema",2023-07-25 18:34:48
" men are treated like women are treated in movies made by and for men read onedimensional supporting characters that further the male leads

eh thats not really whats going on here though there are absolutely films where female side characters serve more as plot devices for male main characters however here its more that every male character is just there for comic reliefto present negative and demeaning aspects of men in this movie there isnt a single male character who isnt an idiot they are universally treated as buffoons who are at best harmless and at worst malicious i would say the most positively represented male character was america fererras husband who has like 3 lines all in clumsy spanish because the joke is that hes learning spanish and then his own daughter says that hes being culturally appropriative but i dont speak spanish so im not really sure what the joke was there 

anyway the point is there is a difference between having simple and underdeveloped supporting characters and basing every character of a certain gender as an idiot theyre not even onedimensional theyre literally just universally dumb while the female characters are universally intelligent its the difference between every woman in a movie seeming more like a prop to further the story of the brooding male lead eg every christopher nolan movie and those women all explicitly being  or seductresses regardless of who they are

 making barbieland a happy go lucky egalitarian society at the end would do injustice to the commentary because barbieland is supposed to be a mirror image of the real world not a utopian society

the issue with this is that barbieland isnt a mirror of the real world at all you could argue that it is a heavily distorted satire of real world politics but it has very little representation of the actual modern real world case in point they make a big deal about the kens not getting representation in the supreme court in real life 4 of the 9 justices are women in the end it just comes off as the barbies being petty and spiteful and actively abusing the kens and theyre meant to be the protagonists here it makes it hard to care about the whole kens brainwashing barbies plot when said barbies were more than happy to oppress the kens both before and after the revolution i mean its even mentioned in the film that barbies get houses and kens just dont 

its one thing to not immediately create some magical social utopia but it seems like the kens just went back to being oppressed by the barbies in the end and were supposed to celebrate that with a quip about how is better than feminists got half a century ago it comes across as just an unpleasant and petty note to end on

a lot of the commentary on men in the film comes across like that just unpleasant and petty and a little meanspirited the whole montage of them saving the barbies by preying on traditionally masculine activities like

 expressing your enjoyment of a movie 

 helping someone who has explicitly asked for help with tech problems

 sports

it just comes across as unnecesarily cruel maybe its because i enjoy some of these activities myself and dont like seeing them made fun of and expressed as a negative but it added to my general distaste of that part it feels like they took pretty positive traits being enthusiastic about a hobby being helpful to others group activities and improvement and twisted them to manipulate and trick people particularly when this part of the story was interspersed with america fererra monologuing about how hard it is to be a woman

i dont know i just dont really like the whole argument of no the film was being sexist towards men ironically so that makes it okay right",2023-07-25 18:56:37
everything everywhere all at once had buddhist subtext maybe that is the reason why its absurdity lends to its denouement  here the teleology of the move is camp it started with and ended with same philosophy being a subplot ,2023-07-25 19:50:29

all that to say i completely agree that they overlapped thematically in a fantastic way and that im glad i watched them in the order i did",2023-07-23 04:02:25
you make good points but id argue that barbieland was not a pink reflection of the real world the movie constantly emphasized that things were perfect in barbieland toast didnt burn shower was always warm etc so i dont think it made any sense to make the message of barbieland this is what the real world is like as opposed to this is what the world should be like i would have preferred barbieland to end up perfect and then stereotypical barbie goes into the real world to prove that women can be happy in an unjust society or to try and change the realworld society to be more just,2023-07-23 10:13:06
"im not going to argue that what the kens did was right my point is that the barbies did essentially the same thing as the kens and yet were celebrated for it in the beginning of the movie the kens were brainwashed and subservient but somehow its ok because it was the barbies doing it its only wrong when the kens do it 

imagine if the roles of ken and barbie were switched but otherwise the movie remained the same the kens made kenland and the barbies just live in it then the barbies read some opinion pieces and see a world where women rules and decide that they should be in charge of kenland and they tell the kens to be their servants and the kens agree because no immunity or something would you argue that the kens should be able to take back kenland by emotionally manipulating the barbies because the barbies brainwashed them and stole kenland and after succeeding in taking back kenland the kens should be celebrated and barbies only be given nonimportant jobs your argument was that the reactions of one group were justified because of the prior actions of the other group if you cant find yourself agreeing as strongly with the actions of the kens in the switched scenario as you do with the original barbie scenario then you have a bias that is impacting your judgement

the message should be that treating either gender as lesser than the other is wrong and that two wrongs dont make a right the solution to our society is not to reverse the roles thats just trading one flavor of injustice for another",2023-07-23 10:06:14

but that was part of the point ken doesn’t get to have barbie just because he wants her in real life you don’t get to have a partner just because you like them that’s not fair to you or to the other person his arc was about learning to be himself and be enough without being attached to barbie and she did apologize for pushing him away and not spending any time with him,2023-07-25 19:29:22
"barbie literally just toyed with him they were definitely in a relationship as he said they were bfgf then she never disagreed

very classic scenario really and disgusting how they made ken the bad one ken knew who he was he was beach guy barbie didnt then ken had to change because barbie made him feel like not enough 

this is literally what causes men to be more aggressive once this happens to them they open up and are vulnerable and the girl theyre with exploits it and uses them as a filler til they find someone they actually want meanwhile ken is blinded by his love 

its just a dumb barbie movie really theres no reason to waste time analyzing it it had funny moments but a pointless story it was purely character driven

"i think it’s a bit weird that a movie that spends all its length criticism patriarchy and how women are basically second class citizens in it ends up with a “happy” ending that involves all kens being reduced once again to second class citizens and not let them have any power… 

i mean is a bit contradictory that an entire movie that spends its time criticising society about something ends up doing exactly the same and insist that is a happy ending treating kens as women in real life when they have been criticising that exact attitude all the time is like they are saying “it’s fine when we are the ones that do it”

as a message against patriarchy is fine but it seems to also imply that “is okay if we are the ones that do it”",2023-07-26 00:47:20
only feminist women would think the movie was empathetic to men literally every man in the movie is written as an idiot doing bad things and they are the butt of the joke women aren’t written like that that some women can’t see how spiteful this movie is to men really says a lot about how desensitised they are to obvious man bashing,2023-07-26 04:19:35

"if i may add my opinion i think there are 2 aspects that are important here

1 many men still believe that the issues of women portrayed in the movie arent a problem anymore catcalling having lower paying jobs etc and find the sheer mentioning of this to be political propaganda
2 while the movie did portray kenland as bad and chaotic they acknowledge towards the end that this all happend because of the unrealistic standards for menkens meaning that they should just be boyfriends to their barbies and nothing else barbie encourages the kens to find their own passions without just being an accessoire to barbie and also mentions that they are open to a mixed supreme court and more kens in higher positions  but only if they proof that they are trustworthy which makes sense to me after the whole ken war i think many people just saw that ken was blamed for everything bad and ended up with only a few more rights than in the beginning and thought the movies message was supposed to be that men are simply inferior period",2023-07-23 07:22:35
"“ the idea of barbie in general carries the exact same theme as the movie”

do you remember the opening lines of the film about what dolls were like before barbie",2023-07-23 07:24:25
"sure the theme behind barbie as a doll was as ruth said  a way for girls to aspire to be more than just mothers as the opening sequence also explained this meant barbie literally thought she had changed the world for girls for the better so after hitting rock bottom and realizing that she’s instead viewed as just another tool of the patriarchy by gloria’s daughter and others she decides that after revolutionizing her own world she wants to do even better and being an impact to not just the outside world but to herself as she has now fully realized that she is more than just a doll  she is barbie

to talk about the “men” theme people keep spitting out others are saying the whole ken sequence was him discovering in an ironic way that men in barbieland don’t have to just be dumb himbos meant to swoon all the barbies  almost like how girls in the real world used barbie to see how they don’t have to be just mothers and trophies for men there’s no actual “misandry” involved in conveying this it’s quite literally just a genderbent story of equal rights that ends with everyone deciding they should live their lives freely of how they were initially designed

"thats sorta true but i think it also misses some of the points the movie was trying to make yes men are sidelined in barbie world and theres connections to what happens to women in real life there

but the kens initial solution to this problem is to embrace the patriarchy and implement it in barbieland the result is a lot of outward improvements for the kens but on a deeper level theyre still unhappy because patriarchy is restrictive for men

the point being that the patriarchy offers simple but often harmful solutions to men because it limits self expression to the box of traditional masculinity greta wanted to explore the impacts of the patriarchy on both men and women which is why ken gets so much screentime",2023-07-27 05:10:33
im not saying it isn’t fascinating what i am saying is this movie is one giant contradiction the fact it’s affecting men so much isn’t at all surprising it’s literally letting them off the hook with a slap on the wrist and taking a movie about feminism and turning it into a movie about men at the expense of its women characters truly a win for the patriarchy,2023-07-26 17:34:19
"what did i miss what is it i have to learn here 

i see many of the things she was talking about a woman’s experience mirrored in a man’s experience and i’m not alone gerwig herself identified it “the men are crying too because they have their own speech they feel they can’t ever give you know and they have their twin tightrope which is also painful there’s something about some of these structures that are just you know ‘somebody make me stop’ that’s sort of i suppose the feeling behind ken”



a bit you’ve said ‘the patriarchy created by men’ do you think men have done this on purpose like they got together like a board meeting and did this—it’s like class structure or racism or whatever it happened naturally through thousands of years of society social norms etc once again it 100 needs to change so that both sexes are equal and people feel less societal pressure to act or be a certain way100 on board with that—it’s just not done as some nefarious plot it’s a confluence of thousands of years of cultural expectations which effect both men and women negatively like toxic masculinity is a behaviour which is most commonly shown by men…and negatively effects men and women…but can also be shown by women eg telling little boys not to cry—misogyny is the same issue men show it but so do women hence the whole mention in the movie of ‘women hating women’…or even sasha’s thing about why she hates barbie the representation barbie shows has been identified as misogyny due to the unrealistic expectations…but hating on people who like the ultra feminine astethic is also misogyny because it’s saying they’re ‘bad’ women for who they feel they are from feminist helen lewis long tradition of regulating female behaviour by defining women in opposition to one another as the architecture of misogyny

it might be coming from a psychology background rather than a sociology background but i tend to see the postmodernism viewpoint and postmodern feminism that meta narratives don’t successfully explain the issues  saying ‘the patriarchy does this’ isn’t sufficient we need to look at the mechanisms like gender norms conditioning etc done by everyone if we’re wanting to change things i always see men and women as more similar than they are different…but aware i’m from a certain intersectional perspective of white working class britain where the stereotypes and roles of men and women are different to those in other countries


all of that middle big two paragraphs are off the point though honestly i felt i needed to defend my position a little what have i missedwhat have i got wrong

"how am i toxic 

it’s a fairly mild critique of an ok movie and how it expresses the concepts of feminism

this video channel does a good job of dealing with some of the structural issues with the movie i had



tldr rather than cellulite barbie should’ve got a grey hair or something to tie into aging and death also making her talking to that old woman about being beautiful make sense cut the mattel people all together and have it be all about america and her daughter actually show her having problems holding things together in her life whether it is at work or with her daughters view of feminism etc have barbie at their house for a while and experience bad and good things about the world eg the objectification having a real shower show the dad being supportive of his wife and daughter have mother and daughter have a heart to heart have the daughter voice her opinions on the world…y’know let the three women bond and build a relationship…then it makes more sense barbie wants to go to the real world and be a real person

the ken side of things make it less slapstick and more overt that he’s struggling with who he is meant to be and his place in the world


don’t have the barbie’s trick their way back into power instead have them all come to a better understanding…i thought the movie was going to do this with the daughter having her giving a perspective that the real world isn’t perfect but neither is barbie land then it didn’t",2023-07-27 21:50:13

 even at the end of everything they were fine with taking the least if it meant the barbies were happy
 all the kens were buff and good looking whereas you had differing levels of health and beauty with the barbies
 the kens were the most emotionally complex and relatable lamenting their lot in life while striking out against the barbies yet feeling conflicted about it the barbies had zero qualms about going against the kens but the kens were devastated by the situation
 the kens were able to establish their own government within the span of a day or less and got the barbies to agree to it given that they could not reasonably have comprehended the real world stuff they would have to have agreed with what the kens were putting down and found it enjoyable

what you’re saying is absolute cope this movie outright  hated the kens when barbie doesn’t even know where the kens live and the kens get emotionally animated about being shown “respect” by being given something as mundane as a question on the time it is abundantly clear that the kens were not equals to the barbies as for your point that they are more individualistic they really aren’t yeah you have the “i am kenough” stuff at the end but it was still abundantly clear that the kens wanted to be near the barbies and the barbies loathed the kens so really it was back to the status quo",2023-07-22 17:00:20

no im not saying its an accurate depiction im saying its an extremely cliche depiction of how hollywood portrays young people,2023-07-23 04:39:23
i was actually only going to watch barbie oppenheimer was a last second decision cause of the tiktok hype and i’m on board with your point this movie would be groundbreaking in like the early 2000s,2023-07-23 07:32:39
"and slaving the barbies  treating them like mindless  

but yeah the horse part was weird",2023-07-23 07:44:29
oh  this movie is really flying over peoples heads,2023-07-23 09:26:05
your takeaway with the godfather scene was that men liking movies is “demonized” that was my favorite scene i’ve probably met 100 men who say “i can’t believe you haven’t seen that movie” and then want to lecture me on the importance of x movie for an hour,2023-07-23 08:32:13
it talks about liking horses and subjugating women like they’re connected it’s super bizarre,2023-07-23 07:39:45
"there is gender war everyday it would be disingenous for the movie not to address that and so it does it by contrasting real world with barbieland i agree that the movie doesnt do anything significant to address beauty ideals and body issues and even jokes around that casting margot as barbie doesnt do it any favors on that issue xd
as for womens rights and mattel of course the bottom line of any company and also this movie is money the movie also says this several times but barbie has had several impacts in how women and especially girls view themselves and their futures the opening sequence starts by making this point very clear now we can discuss what kind of impacts those are positive negative confirming gender roles refusing gender roles etc but we cant deny that they exist
even if it is all fake at the end of the day mattel sells dreams mostly to girls and what girl doesnt dream of equal rights and opportunities companies have their share of influence on politics and the changing of mentalities even if they just want your money
edited this phrase to be more clear",2023-07-25 12:08:23
"how was oppenheimer at all thought provoking  it was a run of the mill history lesson on a subject most people are probably pretty familiar with  maybe being from new mexico im a little more familiar than the average movie goer but like yeah he made an atomic bomb  we all know that  and its not like the debate of the ethics of its use hasnt been debated for decades  its very much a im 12 and what if the atomic bomb is actually dangerous for humanity kind of movie  thats not to say its a bad movie  it was very well done and engaging throughout  but the ideas presented were nothing new and ultimately it shies away from taking a real stance on the issue either way going with more of a vague well what do you mr audience think  was blowing up civilians a good thing  

meanwhile barbie was an absolute brilliant dissection of our modern patriarchy  so much of the criticisms were totally on point mansplaining the godfather to women toxic masculinity regressing to a childlike fascination with playing cowboys the double edge sword nature of barbie as a female role model 

in the end you kind of want the kens to lose i think but then thats sort of the point too  them losing is what made them into reactionary incels who turned into complete misogynists as soon as they got the chance and the idea isnt that women should be in charge or that men should be in charge because both systems had clear and obvious victims even if they were victimized in different ways  plus it greatly explored the harmful effects on men that patriarchy has which is often ignored in popular feminist discussion

like if were talking about filmmaking theres probably a lot more going on in the nolan movie  from the use of black and white to the use of sound during the trinity test to the framing device and reveal around the einstein conversationbut if were to talk about ideas which is what im talking about here when i say thought provoking barbie is far more ripe for discussion  oppenheimer did not have a lot to say and was a very shallow look at an obvious and welldocumented conversation thats been going on for nearly 100 years but barbie had a lot to say with particularly modern takes on real problems of our time which were all experiencing on a daily basis

like sure maybe nuclear bombs will still destroy all of civilization but even that would be a natural extension of the patriarchal imagination suggested by the barbie film  what is oppenheimer but a bunch of kens playing with toy soldiers and fireworks",2023-07-23 03:03:15

what was the political sentiment in this movie,2023-07-23 19:08:49
"i was coming into the movie expecting a lot of malebashing and was pleasantly surprised at how much character they give the male characters by the end for a womencentered movie about female empowerment they did a pretty good job at giving ken a pretty reasonable explanation for a lot of his actions i really came to sympathize with him by the end dude just wanted to be in the dream house with barbie the other men dont get quite as much character development but most of barbieland seems to be this hivemind of exaggerated stereotypes anyways see the women instantly becoming submissive to the men when taught about the patriarchy

the part where all the barbies get unbrainwashed seems to be more of a jab at how society treats women as a whole rather than specifically bashing men for how they treat women though it is sort of implied that men perpetuate a lot of these issues",2023-07-21 12:42:44
if that’s what you think the movie is about after watching i dont even know how to respond to that,2023-07-21 12:14:16
"it’s very clear the message in the movie is that neither man or women is better or worse that everyone 
should be able to feel free with their individuality and just be themselves and do what they want to do",2023-07-21 12:28:46
 right the message couldnt have been more explicitly spoonfed to us,2023-07-22 14:32:52
okay what is that message then,2023-07-23 12:53:43
there are literally people in here complaining that it was too obvious ffs,2023-07-22 16:26:29
y’all really can’t fathom media or literally existence without categorizing something as left or right and that’s exactly the movies problem as well go outside talk to a person commune with the trees say a prayer anything,2023-07-24 16:23:52
yes,2023-07-28 10:59:30
"i think you’re reading too much into it yes there was a theme of role reversal obviously with the kens and real world women but i seriously doubt gerwig was thinking  “i’ll show a man crying and give a “feminist message” that it’s alright for men to cry but i’ll also show it as a joke to make people aware that one gender being shown as a joke is bad” 

i mean who was she trying to show that their perception was unfair herself because she’s the one that choose to make the movie mocking those things for a comedic effect i think it is far more likely she simply wasn’t aware of how contradictory her character writing is compared to the messages she’s promoting
if she did have some super secret hidden meaning then it’s just bad writing if it isn’t clear

if you want to make a movie saying it’s alright for men to cry and be themselves then don’t also show men as a joke when they do these things otherwise your point will be lost if not counterproductive if you just want to make a movie and have fun at mens expense then ok  but don’t pretend you’re helping them with an awesome message why you do so to make it seem acceptable to a female audience

it seems to me this movie was made largely to have fun at mens expense but with a purely performative message for women that the movie is also good for men to morally justify it whether gerwig is cognisant of that is another thing

but in all seriousness if a super macho movie like rambo starring a mens favourite action movie star like stallone has already made the point that it’s alright for men to cry  way back in the 70’s and made it without a hint of comedy and in no way played for laughs just with a wholly good intent for men then perhaps a scene telling men it’s alright to cry in the barbie movie 40 years later as some supposedly new feminist message all while making a little joke of a crying male character at the same time isn’t the positive or new message either gerwig or some of the fans of barbie think it is 
it’s just passé and condescendingly rude

by all means have fun at mens expense  but don’t tell them it’s good for them as you do it that’s the part i have issues with",2023-08-07 14:59:33
that was exactly the point thought it was pretty clear,2023-08-07 15:38:08
"my 8 year old daughter absolutely hated it but my wife loved it

i guess guys and our daughters arent the target audience for this movie",2023-07-24 06:45:08

"the difference is that the  industry was monopolized by a criminal organization mindgeek who profits off the  exploitation of women despite how many women who enjoy doing it so it’s much worse than just a negative portrayal in a movie and i’m trying to suggest that it should be our priority in which problem we try to solve first

edit mindgeek is a multibillion dollar organization that up until all of the new lawsuits had been really good at maintaining their secrecy but there are articles written by the globe and mail or the new york times if you’re interested

pornhub has 120 million men who use their site every day but none of them felt the need to say anything about the fact that the site had been flooded with  videos… why did it take a new york times investigation to “uncover” the crimes that 120 million men watched every day",2023-08-05 14:48:39
"my concern is with the women who didn’t want to do them and all of the  trafficking revenge  videos of actual rapes and 

there’s a lot of focus on individual women being discriminated against for working in  but what’s not mentioned is how these pornstars are funded by multibillion dollar organizations and financially compensated for turning a blind eye to the crimes this industry repeatedly commits against women",2023-08-05 03:01:07

i watched a movie where ken has no home seizes a home has it seized back and returns to homelessness then thats celebrated as a triumph and his desire to have representation in government is laughed at whatd you watch,2023-08-17 06:22:13
it was extremely unsubtle just bad writing having a characters long sanctimonious speech save the world for some reason is silly first half of the movie was way better than the second,2023-08-17 06:25:12
no the barbies tricked the kens into fighting to take control of the government kicked the kens out of the only homes then laughed at them wanting representation in government what ending did you see,2023-08-17 06:24:00
i wanted to leave even before half the movie was over it was that bad,2023-08-21 09:54:19

it’s like some intern at mattel was tasked with going through the bossbabe tag on instagram and writing down every quote,2023-08-14 00:08:29

i do find that it was a missed opportunity for growth for the characters,2023-07-23 21:03:14
"agreed for sure

i think based on the conversation around the movie i was expecting it to be more profound but after viewing it i felt like i fell victim to a hype train

also ill note i had a way more profound experience with guardians of the galaxy part 3 or some of the later seasons of stranger things for example

the barbie movie kinda failed to turn the emotional knobs like some other movies that have that emotional engagement locked in",2023-08-02 19:49:31

right and for a kids toy there was a lot of thoughtprovoking messaging,2023-07-23 01:53:07
and gerwig was obviously aiming at something and i think she missed,2023-07-23 16:19:46
what i took from that is that meaningful change is difficult to make overnight the kens only work experience was beach and even ryanken admitted to not being qualified for any of the jobs in the real world the kens were not ready to take on important roles but the doors were opened for them the tongueincheek line about them not being equally represented could mean both that in their fictional world their success is tied to women in the real world but also just to give a timeline for how long it will take them it is a call to the viewer that if you dont think that is fair to fictional characters in a movie then how is it fair to real women that exist every day in our own world,2023-07-23 03:01:35
this was addressed they made it clear this wasnt ok by comparing it to the womens situation in the real world it would have been pretty terrible also if they had just ended with some sort of fairytale solution unlike anything in the real world,2023-07-23 02:12:52
this implies that the ending is dystopian the matriarchy still rules and the kens are still viewed as tokens this shouldnt be considered empowering then,2023-07-24 13:50:37
how did you miss the film that much it’s supposed to make you recognize what women go through today it’s not ripping on ken for the sole purpose of nothing but a flip the script moment,2023-07-24 13:07:13
that’s on purpose it’s supposed to make you feel upset that ken is portrayed as dumber than the barbie’s ken represents women in a patriarchy welcome to the experience of seeing your gender being portrayed as idiots for like 60 of all films prior to 2023,2023-07-24 12:35:22
i think also that people are forgetting that it is mostly 710 year old girls who are playing with barbies and therefore have no interest or use for ken,2023-07-25 03:49:18
"i get that it is a joke the whole ken war was pretty funny but comedy took precedent than the plot or message barbieland is meant to be a reverse of the real world in reaction to the real world being a patriarchy since it is fantasy land dreamt up by little girls 

feminism isnt about replacing the patriarchy with a matriarchy its about equal treatment of men and women to be truly feminist barbieland and the real world should have strived to become more egalitarian",2023-07-25 02:14:00

it’s a barbie movie it didn’t have to do anything ,2023-07-22 20:55:15
it’s just a weird movie to make that point in when everyone thinks of barbie and ken as boyfriend and girlfriend and seemed like they just wanted to say “barbie don’t need no man so  it up men”,2023-07-26 12:34:42
"you literally asked what the point of her having a  was if not to have  with a man

ok what is the point of it what is the point of a  on a straight woman what greater cosmic purpose does a  serve that im missing

and this is the point where your onebraincellhavingass says well who says shes straight wellidkthe fact that she calls herself stereotypical barbie throughout the entire film and a stereotypical barbie would be straight so you better think of a better comeback than that",2023-07-26 10:09:29
"i mean she apologized to him but she also said that he doesn’t need to be with her to have something for himself it was a message for him too 

but idk why you thought they would come to an understanding after he took over her house and  near ruined everything the last unspoken “lesson” in that story arc was not to give men too much for doing bare minimum lol",2023-07-26 12:07:29
i mean i think he should have gotten the girl but i would have settled for him getting a job at least like ken needs more to do in barbie world than just beach lol the character is literally right back where he started,2023-07-26 08:46:51

" mattel said no because they didnt want to be portrayed as too evil

honestly they werent evil at all other than the whole box thing which we got no real context for all mattel did was

 track down an extradimensional visitor due to the last one kidnapping and almost drowning a child

 promise to send her back home and fix things

 attempt to stop her from taking two humans into barbieland further destabilising the world

 actively argue against the ken uprising despite being specifically told that it would be a financial benefit to them because they cared more about the dreams of little girls than the bottom line 

 attempt to help the kens and barbies come to an understanding then allowing them to make their own decisions and respecting those decisions

like mattel were treated as though they were villains but they didnt really do anything villainous at all beyond not having women on the board of directors which they do irl",2023-07-25 16:51:02

"okay that makes more sense to me sincewell from what i interpretted i thought once barbie became human thats it no more adventures with barbie no more kens the mattel company no longer produces barbie all of it is over barbie becomes real and barbieland ceases to exist and she moves on to become human

itshocked me as also not having barbie have ken to be with made me realize she wont return to her old world anymore and while she has freedom now her old universe ceases to exist and thus mattel retires the barbie brand

i know im overthinking it but sometimes i do think carefully about these things thanks for the help",2023-07-31 05:18:40
yeah theres a line that kind of addresses this when will ferrell is asked if barbieland is like a parallel universe or some kind of imaginationfueled dream world and will ferrell hand waves it away and says imagine a small town in finland or something like that essentially saying the logistics dont matter and dont expect anything to be internally consistent to me that includes the plot,2023-07-31 23:21:13

the movie was full of stereotypes for both genders i see a lot of people saying it delivered a strong message to malesbut what exactly was that message to be yourself the ending when the barbies got their matriarchy back she gave ken a speech that basically was i now see how much it  to be you and never have me make time for you ken you need to be your own person now that sucks though good luck being single loser lol girl power right",2023-08-02 09:18:59

the company changes but not the gender dynamic of barbieland in a world where all of the barbies have a perfect life at the expense of some of the kens not having that life adding an ordinary barbie does not fix that issue it does fix this idea that women have to achieve all of these amazing things to be considered a woman sure a woman can become an astronaut or a physicist or she could be a server or sahm or an assistant trying to deal with her anxiety you know more normal positions,2023-07-23 07:41:14

yea this part was  obviously written by a woman who has no experience what its like being a man

this is ridiculous nonsense and its just one of many ways in which the film reduces the lived male experience to lazy and inaccurate stereotypes",2023-07-23 07:42:53
the film starts off seeming to establish a conflict between what barbie believes herself to represent for women and what she actually does this is shown through the narrator ironically saying “and women had no struggles after the creation of barbie” paraphrased however the film does a turn and makes the resolution about barbie’s own relationship to womanhood and how she perceives herself essentially the starting critique is ignored even the character who gave that critique sasha is pushed to the background,2023-07-23 09:53:16

"cheers for this i can get down with that on some level you’re right it shouldn’t need to be moral and they can be flawed for the sake of the plot that does make sense and i get that side of it and to be fair barbie apologises to ken but i also think they have added social commentary so it’s not just about flawed characters the choices made in production happen for a reason and to me the absurdity and groundedness is out of place when combined with the strong emotions like if it’s all overt comedy it makes sense to totally invalidate ken and if it’s all serious it makes sense to highlight that it’s how women are treated when you blend the two it works really well because they play off of each other but if you also add in a message to love yourself or be present or be human i just don’t think it works because that is creating a dialogue between the elements that isn’t fully cohesive being human is a genderless experience so i kind of would have preferred to have it be like fully comedy ‘ you ken’ and have him be overtly trashed than to have mixed messages or obviously to have it reconciled to me by the end it’s not just trying to be a comedy movie it’s relevant to the times we live in and speaking directly to that before reverting to comedy again there are lots of reasons why it might have been less cohesive than it could have been like production isn’t a straight line from writer to film but i just didn’t get what it wanted from me as a viewer i enjoyed it for what it was but i was also confused 

however i’m not the core demographic so yaknow as long as other people have a positive takeaway that’s what matters and a film like this whether it’s bang on or slightly off base is always going to be important in helping people to know they are represented thank you for your reply i enjoyed reading it ",2023-07-22 21:14:40
"it was a bit of a sermon towards the end and don’t get me wrong i like giving a sermon myself but it was a lot 

it’s not that i don’t think patriarchy exists in some capacity or that the messaging is irrelevant i just don’t think it’s as coherent as it could have been and as a result it is socially flawed because it comes at the expense of delivering a stronger argument women deserve their rights and they deserve the right to make a film from a female perspective but by the end we have strong sentiments that feel like an argument without any real argument to it because it’s also a comedy so it can’t have an argument but it does have an argument but it doesn’t like i’ve covered a lot of flawed films from a feminist perspective that have subtly negative portrayals of women and this movie isn’t as bad as those they’re subtle because the women and men are comedy characters or dramatic characters portrayed as nuanced but if you evaluate it closely there are discrepancies where the depiction is harsher on the female cast when i apply the same principles i’d use to evaluate those pieces to this film the men fall into the same role as the women in those films and yes it’s partly intentional but there’s still a clear bias within the script people can downvote all they want but it doesn’t change that lol  this is a discussion thread to air opinions and it’s something worth discussing the fact that people feel the need to downvote opinions just kinda highlights that you’re allowed to have a film promote independent thought but you’re not allowed to have any yourself",2023-07-22 21:57:04

i dont blame the movie itself and i dont hate it but someone later in production dropped the ball and lost the movie a lot of the credit it should be getting",2023-07-22 21:35:17

" the way they make fun of men

it doesnt even really make fun of men it makes fun of the way society compels men to behave

call me selfish but my absolute favorite part about feminism aside from my wife being able to get a job that pays a  of money is that i dont have to act like a man i can care about patterns in my clothes i can have a close relationship with my daughters i can cry when movies make me feel emotions etc its so liberating every time a little bit of the patriarchy is dismantled

in the movie the kens rush to physical violence until the end when main ken learns that he can just express himself with words instead and theres nothing wrong with crying great message for men",2023-07-25 15:42:06
it’s funny too cause the message even has a positive message for men in it with it highlighting toxic masculinity and why it’s bad and how it affects men men shouldn’t need a women to be seen as “cool” or “manly” they shouldn’t need to hide their real feelings in order to seem masculine they should just be themselves and for ryan gosling’s ken it’s beach and he embraces that at the end like how all men should embrace who they really are while also working to better themselves it’s a movie for everyone we are kenough,2023-07-25 13:39:41

the point of the barbie movie is that all women are beautiful  and they show this by having a movie filled with either literal barbie dolls where the ugliest person in the movie is america ferrara that is not how you make that message the movie literally touches on this with its meta narrator and it does this because it knows this messaging is not working",2023-08-06 02:44:15

we live in a political era that is partly defined by a backlash to inclusivity and diversity transgressive is also a hyperbole yes a major hollywood picture based on one of the most popular toys ever is never going to be truly transgressive but i think it fits woke is used nowadays mainly to disparge liberal ideas this film is making a harsh statement against this backlash it wears its message on its sleeve and has substitive things to say about society compared to movies that try to be progressive by race or gender swapping characters a move that doesnt matter outside of making manchildren cry but barbie tries to do that and more,2023-07-21 21:36:12

personally i a woman in my late 20s also felt like it was geared for a younger group of womengirls at least in terms of the target message stuff like the content of america ferreras monologue seems pretty obvious to most women my age but might be more meaningful to teen girls who are starting to encounter and come to terms with those realities,2023-07-24 00:24:11

"but it doesnt bash menmales though thats some of the erroneous complaints which just is not true

ill copy and paste a reply i made to an identical comment above

youre joking right

the movie demonized a huge number of benign activities as manifestations of toxic masculinity  the patriarchy like watching action movies exercising drinking beer with your friends owning a mini fridge and horses like  how is liking horses toxic all of these traditionally masculine activities are being construed as guilty by association as if men oppress women so anything men like is also oppressive and bad

the message seems to be dont follow culture just be yourself but if youre a man and you like anything stereotypically associated with masculinity this is by default toxic and bad so it doesnt leave men with any clues or any direction except a nebulous sentiment that you shouldnt do anything unless barbie approves of it which actually is misandrist the film seems to embrace the men are defective women trope which is definitionally misandrist

then theres the fact that every single man in the entire film without exception was portrayed as inherently dumb morally weak and some combination of crudely sexist proudly selfish and joyously oppressive

there wasnt a single positive male role model in the entire movie and no hint of a suggestion of what positive healthy masculinity looks like

even sasha presumably intended to be a smart but cynical protagonist comes across as a terminally online loser bigot with extremist views",2023-07-23 07:58:54
i mean the message is that men and women should be seperate and equal but that women should run things it’s a really weird message tbh as another poster said if the movie is called barbie why is ken the only one with a clear goal and the agency to accomplish that goal barbie is worried about feet and ken is basically a human pet who gets knowingly tortured every day and told he’s not good enough they really seem to hate ken,2023-07-23 06:37:54

"that wasn’t the conclusion of the movie at all ken recognized that he didn’t even like patriarchy…it was harmful to men as well he couldn’t focus on his own interests or be vulnerable and he was tireddisinterested in being the leader barbie apologized for taking him for granted and he recognized he needs to find his own hobbies and thoughts not allowing men on the supreme court was a joke referencing the fact that women hold far less leadership positions in government every single president has been male…look up rbg’s “until there are nine” quote 

they even say ken’s have as much power in barbieland as women do in the real world which the entire movie has just established is not okay the movie is poking fun at men who feel they have to be manly stereotypes…and they’re doing this through a ken doll it’s satire and silliness 

just because patriarchy is bad doesn’t mean all men are bad that’s why they’ve included allan men who uphold the patriarchy and cannot empathize have a lot of work to do…but the movie is clearly showing that’s not all men and that just like the real world barbieland is far from fair as well",2023-07-24 03:35:48

you can choose to exercise suspension of disbelief here but if i was to give similar concessions to other movies then most movies would have their score go up by 23 points

i wasnt expecting to hold a barbie movie to account but if youre gonna tackle the subject matter like this movie didthen follow through with it and do it right  superficial takes just feed people on both sides who will get out of the movie exactly what they wanted tojust using the movie as a shallow vehicle for their preexisting feelings

"see i saw all that and i dont know if it was necessarily  on men or highlighting situations that actually affect them one of the biggest things affecting men in the real world today is loneliness and i think that was well highlighted in this movie i felt genuinely emotional and related a lot to both ken and allen allen especially because by the ideas that the movie fights against hes seemingly doing everything right even so hes still constantly overlooked and ignored he understands the women and the issues with toxic masculinity but thats still not enough you can just feel the pain behind his eyes when he sees ken crying and recognizes the same feeling in that moment the only difference is that for all of the things wrong with ken allen has seemingly fixed so whats he supposed to do

as far as the men being morons at least in barbieland thats understandable theyre supposed to be caricatures of a very specific view of the world i didnt have too much of an issue with that and honestly thought they still brought depth to the character in spite of that it did bug me a bit how even in the real world some of the men were excessively silly and again for the board i can write that off as more them  on corporate execs than on men as for gloria  on her husband im definitely with you that i think some people are looking at that wrong its a good example of a guy who is trying to do the right thing and seemingly buck the toxic masculinity train but its still not enough 

maybe im just reading in too much but when i watched it one of my takeaways was that men really do have problems and despite running the world it doesnt always feel that way it doesnt provide any real resolution for the men other than ken deciding to go work on himself but even that doesnt fully address the problem because allen is just stuck in the same situation without any change i think thats a good thing for the movie though because its reality for a lot of men today especially younger men",2023-08-01 18:26:14

most of your points i agree with but i feel like the quoted passage is where i would disagree

more men should be sitting around and wishing they could cry more or you know start acknowledging feelings at all and maybe talk about them especially with their other male friends or did i completely misunderstand your point

and there’s a message delivered by stallone to a crying woman who loves him about how actually she needs to find herself and the overall view of how women need to change for their own good according to men

if the love isnt reciprocated by stallone then yes actually that would be a valid scene or if the female character is completely based on her relationship to stallone

also i dont think the whole according to menwomen is appropriate here or what would you say should be the message if the womens take is wrong",2023-08-01 16:14:11

i understand the themes present in the movie are there for a reason but plot and themes are supposed to tie together seamlessly rather than being hacked on together in a sort of shambles attempt at storytelling im not bitter of any movies success i was all for the success of this movie and i was really excited to watch it i genuinely was not entertained by it yes others disagree and enjoyed the movie that does not make me wrong or them wrong preferences are not right or wrong they are subjective your offence at my view is your own perogative if thats how you want to take it but you dont get to make unfounded assumptions about me as a person 

my critique of the film isnt random this thread called for opinions and i shared mine though controversial and one you may not share as one of disappointment everyone seems to put down anyone who didnt like this movie as disagreeing with the politics of it again this is a weird take i am a woman and a feminist who enjoys movies and am close to the storytelling world so i think i have a stronger critique for things such as plot character development pace tone sound cinematography exposition arcs etc than the average cinemagoer and that should be ok but to put my views down to political alignment because they dont suit you is really telling of the divisive kind of society we live in today rather than to be able to have real discussions about things we have to shame people ok thats your choice im sure youre a smart person but you need to check why you are jumping to assumptions about people you dont know",2023-07-24 17:00:27

" theres no way youre earnestly making the point that this is on par with the social pressures experienced by women

everybody exists under social expectations the point is that the movies feminist critique is solely about social expectations and not material issues 

and playing a who has it worse game is pointless i could point to mens higher suicide fatality rate higher rates of deaths of despair like drug abuse and worsening social isolation with men having fewer friends and fewer relationships and you could point at other stats 

but women have a loud and public campaign against social expectations on multiple fronts while men who also try and go against social expectations are scorned often by socalled feminists 

 playing with kens feelings is not what toxic femininity is toxic femininity describes toxic behaviors that patriarchal societies pressure women into adopting just like toxic masculinity is that for men think being meek nurturing playing dumb being childrenobsessed etc in this sense the movie does address it with the way barbies get brainwashed into playing along with patriarchal social norms in kendom

engaging in social manipulation to corral and control men as well as setting them against each other instead of directly confronting them is literally classic toxic femininity they didnt try to argue the kens out of their position they just set them against each other using their femininity the only tool that women had in deeply patriarchal societies and launched a counterjudicial coup except the barbies are the ruling class so their meekly tiptoeing around makes no sense for their society only as an allegory for ours

the barbies were very silly overall the fact that they were nobel prize winners and stuff was a joke in itself the doctor with fake equipment who doesnt actually do anything ken heals immediately because hes a toy who cant get hurt the physicist barbie in a world without real physics the barbies and kens are all vapid creatures in a fake meaningless world without consequences or mortality the barbies thinking theyre doing important things as lizzo sings on the soundtrack and that theyve solved all the problems for women is one of the movies central jokes but we see how easily the barbies are brainwashed by the kens with one barbie saying she likes being told what to do because its like a spa day for my brain these barbies hardly fit the strong woman trope

barbie spouting a load of feminist discourse that she doesnt really understand was a meta joke in itself this woman is naive childlike and clearly not a great intellectual the juxtaposition is humorous barbie on the run was a great comedy sequence the humour of the discontinued barbies the sidesplitting depression barbie ad

the movie pokes a ton of fun at the barbies having their feet be permanently stuck in an elevated position the way they were horrified by flat feet the worst thing that can happen to you drinking from empty cups etc the truman showesque opening in which every day consists of an identical ritual of greeting every other barbie and being cheerily vacuous barbie walking on fake water like a female jesus in a phony world

men just pay the most attention to other men even in a movie like this",2023-07-26 13:13:10
everyone is trying to predict what this movie is going to be remembered for serious business,2023-07-26 20:14:20
the please call me mother no thank you exchange had me dying ,2023-07-27 20:49:46
"i dont know what are you talking about to the point please instead of being vague and dances around are you disagreeing or agreeing with me

again sexism and prejudice problem is very bad issue in our society very true even some people may at surface seem very nice people but they give off prejudice and sexism vibes the fact that this movie however comedy this movie maybe are issues that we need to appreciate the movie has raised

patriarchies concern to me isnt just about male vs female but also majority white people vs minorities",2023-07-27 15:25:08
i call it rage bait   dont take the bait,2023-07-27 15:40:07
i didnt like how the movie put men and women at war with each other the barbie universe is the opposite of that ken goes on their adventure and is part of the group,2023-07-24 08:15:49
"destroy men

wut

ken isnt destroyed by barbie ken is destroyed by his own toxic expectations and built back up by barbie helping him to understand that he is kenough he doesnt need other people to validate him",2023-07-24 07:30:32
"what do you mean by unbarbie fashion

well and what about ken stilling the show¿ i mean why not they still were able to deliver the important messages",2023-07-24 07:02:59
"wow that is a good explanation of the possible subtext i take that makes sense with the hunger for power singing for four hours while objectifying the women not talking to them but only eyeing them 

and the women switching kens is them reversing the situation taking the power away by switching and objectifying the kens while doing so 

thanks for the idea 

edit after thinking more about it this must be one definitive answer and i will religiously tell everyone about it seriously thanks a lot",2023-07-28 07:15:29
"is sasha a bully i thought she is just harsh and unrestricted with her words the fascist thing was out of line but normal for a angsty teenager to say haven’t thought about the bully trait of sasha in contrast to barbie thanks for the angle

but without the little girl we would have get to know sasha even faster so her announcing sasha seconds before we meet her is still a weird choice to me",2023-07-28 07:04:55
agreed there is enough of these “this movie is antimen” energy present in this thread and they’re always wrong but this exact scene i can’t see where the satire was or where the irony was in acting out a misogynistic stereotypical gender role,2023-07-28 06:00:27
as they always do they will just take snippets and bits out of context to fit their agenda and worldview but i was kind of confused by this choice of script writing as the end with the kens missing the election and the president just denying them a seat in supreme justice was great satire this one i’m still not wrapping my heads around,2023-07-28 05:54:58
"i think the tone just swings too much from one extreme to the other on that front though rather than finding a range where it can work on multiple levels it just goes from obviously being targeted more at hyperaware late gen zmillennial ages to suddenly spelling it out like the audience are hearing these ideas buzzwords for the first time in their life the juxtaposition is maybe what makes it jarring

also a lot of the promo has focused on how subversive it is how groundbreaking how genius greta gerwigs writing is and a lot of that came from greta herself so some of the disconnect is maybe more to do with the expectations that garnered as much as the writing itself being bad",2023-07-21 16:40:03
well the street meaning they don’t have homes as far as we’re shown they’re homeless,2023-08-01 15:22:28
"nah i’ll just buy her something else also the whole bit about ken never having a job or whatever that people on social media are repeating now is made up he had loads of jobs of course he’s not as important as barbie as it’s a girls toy but there’s a difference between girls playing with it less and that being the canon story of barbie land

that was a crappy message lol imagine a movie which finished with barbie crying about how much she loved ken while he explained to her like she was a  that he didn’t like her and she now got to go and find herself",2023-08-02 04:08:39
i definitely think the movie did that though the message is not too be defined solely by your partner or your possessions or your occupation but some of the kens and barbies got back together because they wanted to not because they didnt know how to be without each other,2023-07-21 23:43:15
absolutely agree it was a missed opportunity to promote healthy inter gender relationships i actually felt bad for ken,2023-07-21 23:44:03
"there was a barbie and ken couple at the end that made up the movie isnt saying barbies and kens cant be together

but stereotypical barbie has always been more jo march than amy march its right for her to venture forward and ken needed to realize that he could live for himself",2023-07-22 01:38:43
"regarding actual dolls available for purchase there have been different barbie dolls for decades a black barbie esque doll existed in the 1960s called something else but effectively a black barbie 1980 officially black barbie im sure mattel will be happy to sell whatever doll people want it even was in the movie as the mattel execs crunched numbers and let barbie be whatever she wants to be because it was going to sell

thats why i said i think barbie at its worst just represents society in that moment i dont think mattel toy company is the absolute authority in creating culture and norms more so reflection of already existing norms

for hasbro and gi joe im fairly sure there are some gi joe dolls that arent built like chris hemsworth",2023-07-22 09:08:55
" he lived in a world where he was a second class citizen and all men were oppressed

they didnt even have a house no one knows where they live",2023-07-23 16:13:04
any human being would understand the hurt that comes from someone not returning your affection  barbie did and let ken know she understood  she had discovered real empathy,2023-07-23 16:42:07
i think its not so much to ignore the selfpity from the kens but more to acknowledge that they too suffered as a creation that only exists as an accessory to barbie,2023-07-23 14:41:02
barbie apologized for treating ken like an accessory ken is supposed to represent what it’s like for women in a patriarchal society,2023-07-23 17:03:15
"the problem with this kenrepresentingwomen metaphor is that those kens in the film are all very incompetent so it kinda makes sense not to appoint them to positions of high responsibility 

personally i didnt feel like ken was supposed to be this metaphor for women he is exploring mens own issues in an interesting semicompassionate way they show he has emotional depth and existentialhuman needs but not that much else perhaps thats part of the point that this innerexistentialemotional life is the part that men need to focus on in their own struggle still im not a huge fan of this condescending menbeingstupid trope in media clueless yes manchild maybe but a lot of the time these characters im not talking about barbie specifically but this trope in general seem to be like some sort of michael sctott from the office which belongs more in a sketch",2023-07-25 08:28:27
its what you might think happened if you havent actually seen the movie and youre just parroting whatever youtube clown you buy your opinions from though,2023-07-25 07:54:22
"they had a solid setup for having a conversation about the rise of inceldom and andrew tatelike figures and the fact that men are losing their identity in a world where men are being left behind and wondering about their purpose in life 

instead it just takes cheap jabs at the patriarchy and womens empowerment it would have been a much better movie deprogramming ken who fell down the incel rabbit hole and establishing his real feelings of inadequacy and loneliness and finding his own path forward independent of barbie i feel like they were going towards this with i am kenough but then it was just rewritten to essentially be a throwaway joke at hurr durr play with mens feelings and get them jealous at each other and we win 

not once did any of the kens show cameraderie and support for the other kens emotional feelings and vulnerabilities they were constantly trying to oneup one another and tear each other down the movie acts like its ok to cry but then totally disregards kens feelings and expects him to get right back up on the horse no depression ken no alcoholic ken nothing",2023-07-29 04:02:07
at this point it would have actually been subversive to have ken and barbie end up together it was entirely obvious they would go the “strong barbie doesn’t need a man and ken will just have to live with that” route,2023-07-24 08:32:11
i think it’s also a joke about how the dolls just have a smoothed over bump,2023-07-23 13:50:24
i agree but because of capitalism it will get one,2023-07-24 20:10:21
"i know what you mean

well are you going to share i feel like im having a ",2023-09-25 06:19:04
id love a broadway version of it though,2023-07-26 21:08:54
"isnt that kind of outdated at this point 

western films are concerned more than ever with pseudo empowerment if this had come out in the early 2000s i think it would have hit harder at this point it feels a bit too hyperbolic to be taken seriously and too outdated to create any interesting conversation about gender roles and sexism",2023-07-24 12:51:45
"except that’s not true at all in no film with a big ensemble cast of women are women treated as badly as the men in this film i can’t think of a single movie where the entire large female cast are all morons who are doing something wrong women are sidelined or love interests  but they’re never portrayed as a whole gender in such a negative way as both idiots or idiot villains 

you don’t seem to get that having a woman in a side role or a stereotypical gender role which was common at the times most movies were made and still is is not mocking here or making her look  or bad but here the movie does so for men

i wonder if you’ve even watched any movies more than ten years old or if you’ve just read how they supposedly were on reddit or social media

you’re reaching and trying to see a brilliant satire when in reality greta gerwig just did the same ol “men dumb women good” trope that you see often played for laughs in sitcoms and in the process if she was trying to make that point it was lost as the real world patriachy and women are portrayed so differently and more negative for patriachy and positive for women than the barbie matriarchy and kens

also ken is representing a bunch of things the oppressed the patriachy  as well as being a device for gerwig to joke about men in general how are you meant to feel sympathy for ken and the kens when he’s the butt of the movies jokes when he does something about his situation whereas the real world women fighting the patriarchy are these wonderful heroes making speeches

i just think the bitterness about men shone through and if a positive message was supposed to be there then it’s only apparent to feminist women who can easily overlook the way this movie portrays men as  or  and bad  but the bitterness against men means for a lot of men they can’t overlook that hard to see a movie as anti sexism when it comes off as laughing about sexism against men",2023-07-24 14:07:43
sure so its up to barbie to decide when they want to give power to kens for something men do to women in the real world that ken doesnt have any control over sounds to me like using one form of injustice patriarchy in real world to justify your own matriarchy in barbie land,2023-07-31 07:46:12
"right bit the movie is also saying that women in the real world dont have equality therefore saying one day the kens will have the same level of power as women in the real world is the same as saying the kens will never have equality

it felt vengeful like were supposed to be happy they are kept down jesus even of youdont think theyre mentally ready for power you could at least give them houses that would have shown that barbiland is changing towards equality amf the barbies realize theyve been unfair to the kens but instead its just a 100 restoration of the original barbiland but with the kens told go find yourself and quit bugging me",2023-07-31 11:13:54
it kind of gives the impression that some peoples idea of feminism is to flip the oppression not end it,2023-07-31 13:41:01
there is more than just america the rest of the western world doesnt have a problem with abortion,2023-07-31 16:50:37
when the kens come together via dance to symbolize the power of male friendship ,2023-07-25 01:44:21
" maybe the dads attempt to learn spanish but that was maybe 10 seconds of screen time total


and it seemed like he was being mocked for it",2023-07-24 19:06:30
the scene near the end when ken starts to figure out who he really is and realizes that he is great because of who he is not because he has cool cars and is supposed to be attached to barbie especially relevant nowadays with all the dudes thinking that being a man should be defined as being rich having nice cars and girls,2023-07-25 04:59:29
right for some reason i got emotional by the kids destroying the baby dolls hahaha,2023-07-27 21:26:28
"just shows how different reddit is from the real world


the rather sad and terrifying thing is that redditors think reddit represents the perspective of the real world 


this is exacerbated with subreddits acting as echo chambers and everyone aligning with viewpointsopinions in order to gain karma andor fit in",2023-07-22 13:15:07
i didn’t like the dialogue lines writing i did like ryan gosling singing and the dance numbers,2023-07-22 13:05:32
dude this thread is overwhelmingly positive… haha people are allowed to have opinions and this thread is doing the literal opposite of panning this movie cherrypicking different people from different threads to make a point is more of a reddit moment than anything,2023-07-22 15:23:23
same the ending was very moving,2023-07-22 16:16:32
"they didnt get an explicit speech about it but there was a ton of subtext about men facing the same kind of contradictory expectations and getting wrecked by them

for example the ceo who it turns out legitimately tries to put female empowerment over profits despite earlier jokes seeming to mock the possibility that some old guy could possibly have altruistic intentions for his position of power or want to hug or for it to be okay for ken to cry or to not want to lead",2023-07-23 01:21:40
"i think anyone who criticizes art for having a message is either obtuse or part of the problem usually both

the problem is not having a message but how that message is told",2023-07-23 22:30:05
they were always boyfriend and girlfriend it’s not canon she didn’t like him at all,2023-07-26 03:42:41
yes it seemed like a very natural progression for the tv show barbie dreamhouse for kids but very hilarious and selfaware,2023-07-26 05:27:16
i would agree but they’re explicitly called “boyfriend and girlfriend” in the movie,2023-07-26 05:14:43
ken is an accessory he got the treatment he deserved and more,2023-07-26 01:20:53
making the hero moment about emotionally manipulating people in such a devastating way didnt sit right with me,2023-07-25 22:34:07

yeah that as well good point,2023-07-30 03:24:38
i did laugh as well but then i went like wait a second…,2023-07-30 15:01:17
the main female characters in the normal world are nonwhite,2023-07-22 00:05:58
which character,2023-07-24 03:03:45
thank you ,2023-07-21 18:37:37
"that sounds beautiful thank you  can’t wait to see it  my sister said she’d invite me so i’ll watch it with her 

again sorry that was a dumb question but i heard that this movie is very feminist and celebrates womanhood which is awesome and  my dysphoria and insecurities just often make me feel like i’m not allowed to celebrate or live  my femininity and womanhood but yeah that’s just a me issue i guess",2023-07-21 18:17:47
you’re right ofc and trans women or cis women aren’t a monolith but i just heard it’s a movie that celebrates womanhood and is very feminist which is based but dunno dysphoria and my insecurities often tell me that i’m not allowed to enjoy any of that stuff and that im not allowed to celebrate my own femininity which is a me issue though,2023-07-21 18:10:30
that’s awesome thank you so much ,2023-07-21 18:36:56
"thank you  that sounds wonderful tbh and that makes me happy i’ll definitely check out that movie my sister said she’d invite me and even offered to borrow me an outfit cause i don’t own anything pink 

thank you again  everything i’ve heard about it does sound great and i can’t wait to see it",2023-07-21 18:08:56
idk i actually found it cute tbh i mean most women have to see a gynecologist,2023-07-31 05:27:00
it was a big deal for her because she was a doll before and obviously had no reason to go nothing to do with terfs,2023-08-05 22:19:33
there is a lot more nuance but ultimately patriarchy  bad is the overall message and i mean its not really subtle so i dont understand how you can miss it,2023-07-22 05:01:52
"not objectifying women

women can be in control despite the stigma that they are ‘too emotional’ to make decisions 

barbie wasn’t made to make women feel like they have to be perfect and put together 

it’s okay to just be ‘ordinary’

i can go on and on but clearly you’re upset and don’t care to actually be informed",2023-07-22 04:56:41
haven’t seen it yet but  isn’t that a major plot point from the trailers,2023-08-05 00:31:40
i wonder what wouldve happened to her if she got stuck in the box like would she just sit in a closet forever,2023-07-26 04:04:54
because he was more interested in how hot the actress playing her looked,2023-07-25 15:35:51
i second this its incredible and everyone should see it especially my fellow kens,2023-07-22 00:49:07
this is an amusing response  you say that those who dont like it are uncomfortable having their opinions challenged impressive mindreading on a mass scale but did you like it because it challenged your opinions or because it reflected them back to you,2023-07-22 01:52:46
it aint that deep blud,2023-07-24 00:58:46
and it encourages ken to find his own voice too and to know that he is kenough regardless of how barbie feels about him  that’s a great positive masculine message,2023-07-22 15:45:36
why did they make the husband look dumb in the epilogue for trying hard to learn a second language wasnt it unnecessary and reinforcing the idea of the film having a more feminist agenda,2023-11-21 23:45:31
"yeah the sons will also get a healthy dose of how to objective women and them as objects and manipulate them 

the movie was juxtaposing extremes in both sides and it’s also pg13 it’s not a movie to teach 8 year old girls how to treat men lol it was a satirical film",2023-07-24 15:58:16
you see what you want to see there’s nothing in my wording suggesting that i’m offended and i think you well know it,2023-10-06 11:27:39
why,2023-07-29 04:14:13
doesnt ken go out of his way to say that he finds his own personal objectification gratifying and with no sense of violence lurking underneath,2023-07-24 14:16:43
i’m a real person who wants to be a film critic,2023-07-25 15:28:20
idk im asking people that have seen it,2023-07-21 11:46:32
well his toxicity was born from bad influence in real life and treated like expendable by barbie since he was built to be barbies partner so to me he should be given a chance to redeem himself to be better,2023-07-21 11:09:04
yeah i was really happy they didn’t end up together i really enjoyed the scene where america ferrera’s character pointed out all the terrible things he did to her and why she shouldn’t gov whom a chance,2023-07-21 11:09:30
he did and i will too,2023-07-21 19:58:58
"100 agree oppenheimer was good but the story being told basically summed up to a milquetoast petty political drama played big up also oppenheimer ended up looking like a spineless valueless coward which is unfair to his actual character imo 

still phenomenal acting worth seeing 

meanwhile barbie was hilarious entertaining and had more to say on ethics than making a bomb isnt bad right its the people that drop it that are the bad ones right",2023-07-21 16:42:30
nah they could j have opinions,2023-08-05 01:44:47
"half the audience walked out before it was over

i very much doubt that",2023-08-05 10:48:21
"this part is where i doubt your story 

what message was this movie sending do you mean the idea that the movie is for girls even then thats just the branding of the movie did you watch the movie because youve only spoken in single sentences on the movie",2023-08-05 05:09:53
cool story bro,2023-08-05 16:01:50
agree a lot of dudes reviewing it early seemed to write a review suggesting they didn’t enjoy it at all but then made clear they supported the messages and gave it good ratings weird,2023-08-06 15:02:37
good to know she didnt do a great job showing it in the movie then to me at least,2023-07-28 14:56:32
,2023-07-21 13:43:34
not really because we’re used to it happening to us all the time that was kind of the point of the satire in the movie actually,2023-07-21 13:51:24
and if there was a mens movie with heaps and heaps of women and they were all morons and villains sometimes even without reason the husband of america ferrara women would hate it and no women would say “oh that’s alright it’s just something men are having fun with”,2023-07-21 18:21:11
greta might be in the dga but she has many acting roles too and is very likely sagaftra too,2023-07-24 06:25:37
as a man or woman this movie serves as an excellent coming of age movie i guess you just have to grow up to relate to the characters ken reminds me of 8th grade me trying everything i can to be macho and appealing and falling down a pipeline and later realizing that indocrination further alienated me from the people i wanted to connect to,2023-07-26 05:29:56
you bring up a good point about the way she was treated in the real world  i guess i was referring more to the barbieland when shes not displaying emotions as much,2023-07-26 05:05:52
just the kind of dialogue that greta was hoping to inspire im sure,2023-07-26 05:51:58
that point was the only good aspect of the film and by the end of the film it only shows some development of characters on women’s side but still dominating them and men continued being dominated instead equality should’ve been approached in barbieland if they wanted to preach about any propaganda a world where women and men can be equals without being desperate for each other’s affection as obviously ken was,2023-07-26 06:12:23
"that was literally the point and i imagine that will go over a lot of peoples heads the barbies werent the good guys in that movie they wanted their normal back read when they had everything and kens existed for them

this is a direct parallel to the antifeminist movement wanting the 60s back when men had everything and woman existed for them they even said as much right at the end",2023-07-24 07:11:52
"i agree but i think the writers kind of shot themselves in the foot with the ending scene where the kens ask the president barbie if they can have a supreme court seat and she says no and then theres some line about how someday maybe the kens will have as much power as women in the real world 

i feel like it was really bordering on the poignant and satisfying ending you described but then kind of threw it away by sending the kens back to square on and clearly relegating them to second class citizens in barbie land again rather than the two sides learning to live in harmony instead its almost like the kens get punished for abandoning their toxic masculinity and being open to change 

even though i dont think it was their intent it kind of makes it seem like the movies whole message was men just  and women should be in charge despite that clearly not being the message of the previous 2 hours",2023-07-23 17:21:24
beautifully put,2023-08-01 13:22:00
but how did she realize that she had just been grossed out by cellulite and then thought an old woman was beautiful with literally no character development in between,2023-08-14 19:49:36
i think you missed the sarcasm,2023-09-13 18:16:20
"well because their pure analysis isnt really rooted in reality 

of all thingssaying the pacing is bad is just objectively wild  the movie never once feels frenetic or like a slog  

from there its more just vague accusations that most people wouldnt agree with  so just because they gave an analysis of what makes a good movie doesnt make it worthy of upvotes or shielded from downvotesespecially if its inherently ",2023-07-22 12:30:09
it really didn’t have anything pro men that men actually care about  unless ken crying was mean to be that if it was 99 of men wouldn’t even notice it was supposed to be men empowering as they don’t care about crying more that’s more of a thing feminists like to say feminism can help men with,2023-07-21 15:27:42
im a grown woman and didnt get it  not funny,2023-07-24 14:23:27
the kens werent given equal rights at the end of the day,2023-07-23 00:21:18
that was good ended up being true lol,2023-07-22 22:03:27
"they gave ken a sympathetic moment where he was like “yeah i guess it’s my house and my world now huh how do you like it” and it was like oh yeah he has a point since the kens were mistreated and then the movie gives up on that and the resolution doesn’t really address it i get that it was probably making a point about how progress can be slow with stuff like the kens being maybe given a lowercircuit court seat or something but there was no attempt at a message of “hey maybe we should work toward becoming equal” or “maybe tokenizing kens is wrong and so is tokenizing women in the real world” ken equality is not even presented as an aspirational goal from what i remember it could’ve ended on a positive note about how we can overcome the negative aspects of either gender dominating everything and work together to achieve a better world where nobody is a secondclass citizen but instead they said “actually it’s good that the matriarchy was restored” they just inverted the patriarchy and told us to celebrate when it prevailed

i dunno maybe i’m misreading it and the entire ending was only supposed to be a commentary on how women’s rights in the real world have often begun with tokenism but the rest of the film was making much broader points and it didn’t work in that context if that’s what they were trying to say",2023-07-22 23:15:33
weird no one is taking about that the inherent hypocrisy of the message “it’s so evil that womenbarbie’s are seen as lesser than then they return the kens men to their lower station in society and it’s a good thing lol,2023-07-22 22:19:27
i should make that clear i was kidding when i said it was deliberately pro fascist just accidentally but definitely anti revolution,2023-07-23 03:51:23
yeah but then the barbies still disregarded the kens at the end shouldnt there have been a more of an even stance between them,2023-07-23 04:32:39
her going to the gynecologist it was just a joke about how she has genitals now instead of being smooth like a barbie,2023-07-21 16:33:47
i thought it was supposed to be a job interview where barbie is finally settling into the real world subverted expectations surprise it’s a gynecologist,2023-07-21 16:39:38
for real so close to the point and its sailing right by him,2023-07-24 20:32:43
i got the point hence why i said it in my post,2023-07-24 21:08:27
just left the theatre and i think it lived up to the hype,2023-07-21 17:58:22
most of the movie was on barbie’s reaction to men controlling the real world over empowered women like she thought yeh she stops dude bro land but after realizing the kens shouldn’t just be their accessory’s they switch it back to barbie control it’s just another patriarch the ceos remain in charge the mother i guess is lucky enough to keep her reception job she thinks she their to empower women but by the end of the movie she doesn’t achieve that goal barbie land stays the same and she gets stoked about genitals,2023-07-22 01:12:04
and how did that make you feel ,2023-07-22 01:50:25
 whatd they say lol,2023-07-25 20:02:24
how is the matriarchy shown to be anywhere near as bad as the patriachy,2023-07-31 08:41:32
i feel that with allen too but as a  person with nonbarbie parts i felt very left out not in a way that made me feel any bitterness to the film but in a way that made me just feel like allen ill never get out of here the america ferrera speech was great and i was snapping the whole time but it directly excluded me with its diction i am not a ken and i am not a barbie so how am i supposed to take this not identifying with either end of the gendered extremes am i just supposed to laugh and then feel sad about the state of societal discourse after,2023-08-16 04:18:50
"the thing is i would agree except they dont change anything at the end

if for example the barbies and kens realise that a society where only one gender dominates is bad then there could have been a compromise whereby both genders collaborate together to run society together maybe dont show all the guys except alan in the show to either be dumb himbos or incompetent executives that oppress and sexualize women 

but nope at the end of the movie they refuse to give the kens any power in barbieland or any meaningful role yes i agree that kens story of not leaning solely on someone as your whole identity was a good message but when you still reimpose the matriarchal society with little to no meaningful changes in terms of representation its not hard to see why people took away the message that barbie is manhating",2023-08-15 08:44:18
but men were still given subordinate role in the batbieland at the end of the movie once the barbies take over the government again,2023-07-21 03:09:45
"thats not how the real world operates or has ever operated 

this statement is completely correct if you ignore all of human history 

please enlighten me what society valued women and men equally at any point pre1950",2023-07-22 20:04:26
its tiresome because it has been done to death what would be more empowering to women is giving them the message that their life is in their own hands and live their life as they want without caring about other peoples expectations they should take the advice given to ken they are enough as they are they dont need external validation,2023-07-21 20:23:44
i cant imagine  hes talking about the movie said out loud that mattel was a male lead dystopian nightmare for female employees this movie did not put mattel in a good light at all this is one of those movies you see made decades after the business has gone bankrupt and all the lawyers fired,2023-07-22 13:01:35
same here  and i really need to see the bloopers from that scene,2023-07-31 01:05:18
"the point would get better reception if gerwig hadn’t written all the real world men and kens as stupider than their female counterparts and in need of correction and the movie is clearly made for women in part to laugh at men if the movie had of actually shown kens more sympathetically and barbies as more villainous then you would have a point  but it doesn’t kens are shown as bad for the kendom whereas women are good for standing up to the patriachy the problem was making ken both the standin for womens oppression and the patriachy

this movie is actually more bad than good for gender relations imo because now some guys are gonna think  well it was alright for the barbie movie to potray us so badly and when we were offended women didn’t care so now we can write women as  or  objects and not care if they’re offended",2023-08-06 14:50:02
"right but the movie isnt consistent with that idea at all unless were to believe that the monologue about womens struggles is a joke the movie clearly has a lot of moments where it wants to be taken seriously and  as i pointed out  a lot of moments where female characters become lucid and emotionally intelligent while male characters are always 

i would actually love this movie if it were 2 hours of what we see in the first 15 minutes a flipped version of our world a matriarchy we could see both men and womens harmful behaviour highlighted by the opposite gender it would be a really interesting look at how people react when a female character exhibits negative male behaviours and vice versa do they feel more annoyed at the actions or the gender of the person

but thats not what happens we get 15 minutes of that premise then we go to the hyperpatriarchal real world and then back to a hyperpatriarchal barbie world for the rest of the movie the matriarchy is barely critiqued at all",2023-08-05 22:06:08
why does a movie that empowers women have to spend so much time and energy putting down men surely women can feel empowered without that,2023-08-05 21:33:04
"edit i’m a woman who grew up with barbie’s btw

just because there are movies that treat women bad doesn’t make it right i think the kens were treated badly and their struggle not taken seriously enough not to the degree that commenter says but i do think they did them dirty especially with the idea people have that the kens deserve to be treated that way because men in the real world are bad or that female characters have been portrayed that way forever so now it’s mens turn 

if it was just a comedy and satire i could see that being funny but a movie trying to make a message about the patriarchy and making ken characters second class citizens and saying they deserve it while also comparing them to real world women is just not the move i guarantee that the mostly white woman audience would be upset if they treated all the white barbie’s as bad people or  just because historically poc women have been treated that way in movies so now it’s white women’s turn",2023-07-22 23:58:31
if a woman is a caring mother i guess she has no reason to insult directly a stranger with a different opinion in a movie than hers otherwise she is a bully and she may has some serious issues herself,2023-07-23 00:24:29
τhat he was ditched by the super duper stereotypical barbie and that he should learn to live as a second class citizen from now on thats his lesson you call this an arc are you on a pay roll by mattel or something,2023-07-23 00:16:35
dont get i dont get it,2023-07-21 11:04:33
but the film kinda paints him as the ideal man by how he acts and yet he still becomes an afterthought whilst it might be satire if its the film as a whole relegating him not just the characters then it doesnt feel very good for the viewers so its really just a hypocritical cycle essentially the nonproblematic men in the film are bullied and sidelined whilst the focus is on the toxic ones considering this is a film about a toy aimed at young girls its not really sending a great message that men who spend their time learning another language or dont want to live patriarchal society are a joke unless theyre beating up the bad men it sort of plays like the allans of this world are supposed to stand up to and beat up the kens when necessary then keep their mouth shut and be placid when there isnt an issue satire is best when used to highlight something blatantly wrong but everyone already knows its wrong to disregard unattractive women and theres been a big movement in recent years for a variety of women to be portrayed in various ways,2023-07-30 00:02:28

"whether a movie is good or bad is not determined by breaking box office records

clearly everyone knows barbie and the movie has a good cast so naturally it will be watched a lot this does not say anything about its quality though so i guess the only one here trying to sound smart while being disassociated from reality is you

"i agree with most of this i have watched the movie again and it was better on second watch i still find some scenes a bit boring but gosling is a show stealer so he makes the movie enjoyable and i think its a well crafted movie with some good ideas and nice homages to 2001 space oddysey and being there

but i can see i get a lot of downvotes most likely from women who takes it personally that i did not care much for barbie in barbie my problem isnt even a ben shapiro problem about ridiculing men cause the movie also ridicules women all that i thought was fun and tounge in cheek but the movie overall lacked something for me or perhaps my expectations were just too high i never angered me it just underwhelmed me a bit but again on second watch its a fine movie not as bad as i initially thought

but its funny how angered people get if you dont like barbie as much as they do or greta gerwig i actually wrote a thread about greta and barbie movie but people went nuts and irate so i had to delete it cause it really didnt went anywhere else than snark replies and angered women and men i am glad your partner could understand or at least respect your view on the movie most seem to not be able to

it is really a movie that gets people triggered they are very passionate about a movie about a toy doll

i like 500 days of summer btw really good movie seen it many times and i am glad he finds autumn in the end cause summer is a horrible person

i got a notification that you had replied but i dont use rmovies anymore cause its not for me people are too easily triggered and opinions are not allowed its not the place for me to discuss movies when you arent allowed to feel different than the majority

oh and i would give everything for a sequel about ken a ken movie written and directed by gerwig starring ryan gosling sign me up for that",2023-09-17 21:18:54
"i guess its fair seeing as none of the kens have held those positions of power before and have no clue what its like to govern and need to learn at a lower level first

but i think the average person isnt taking anything away beyond the surface level either yasss queen slay or   really want a matriarchy",2023-07-22 22:18:01

"i said what makes this movie sexist towards men havent your read what i wrote

all men in the movie are portrayed as idiots

all men are heavily stereotyped

men in barbieland are oppressed and remained that way to get it back at men in the real world

the message is ridiculous and sexist especially as this movie present itself as fighting against sexism

you made a sexist stereotype in your comment why would oppenheimer be for men only is a movie about the atomic bomb about men

the reason barbie is insidious is because it is sexist in all aspect to men like the movies for men are sexist towards women not only that but the producers seem proud of that this is certainly not the right way to fight gender inequality

there are no male movies like that that cast women like that  not just today but ever yes women may have bit parts or be there for  appeal but i can’t think of a single movie in which a large cast of women are all idiot villains for men to overcome

how many little girls played with barbie thinking ken was a halfwit who was bad to barbie not many i’d bet but this is what the movie is so i’m not sure saying this is how girls played with barbies is much defense",2023-07-24 12:25:03
"i think it’s far more likely to have the opposite effect on most teen boys and just kind of annoy men 
i get the movie was trying to portray barbie land as a reverse of real world patriarchy  but portraying all the kens as morons and the real world women as heroes battling the dumb patriarchy renders that message obsolete 
as does having ken fill multiple roles  patriach toxic opressed  all at once 

ultimately feminist women won’t get it and try to say it’s brilliant satire men are missing but the simple reality is you can’t say a movie is about equality and men shouldn’t have a problem with it when literally every male character is an idiot or a villain idiot it’s clearly not promoting equality at that point it’s just ripping on men whatever the original intention was gerwig has let her bitterness about men shine through",2023-07-24 12:29:36

"there is a difference between barbie apologising to ken for treating him poorly and implying that barbies are the cause of men installing patriarchy beyond the movie itself it’s a bad message for young girls notice how barbies treated ken poorly by deciding to have girls nights every night and just ignoring them while the kens instead objectified them degraded them and purposefully belittled them the only bad thing barbies did was that kens were more or less homeless the kens went out of their way to hurt the barbies they didn’t just do it because they were hurt they found out the privileges they got from dominating barbies which is a fundamental aspect of why men choose to participate in patriarchy despite their poor feelings

then again i don’t expect any redditors to have any knowledge on actual feminist theory besides basic “women and men plz be nice so we can all be equal” so no i don’t think i can make you understand that saying women are at fault in men choosing to oppress them rather than men choosing it for themselves due to seeing the material rewards they get from being abusive and toxic is wrong

the 11 downvotes prove what i was believing though women bend their ways to make feminism the most appealing easy comfortable movement ever for men but the second you even point out a little uncomfortable truth like “men don’t participate in patriarchy as a response to women being inconsiderate of their feelings but because of the material and social advantages they get from said participation women’s aversion is a response to this not the other way around” everyone loses their  and says it’s anti men and every man and their fellow pick mes comes out with their pitchforks 

we don’t need any wishy washy good feeling feminism because feminism is meant to make people like you uncomfortable i’m muting this comment you’re always free to read de beauvoir firestone or guillaumin instead of reducing your understanding of one of the most major political thoughts in history to illiterate reddit takes",2023-07-22 19:24:57
women are responsible for men’s feelings …  yeah thank you for proving my point about this movie sending a terrible message to young girls if you’re into a woman and she doesn’t care about you that’s never her fault  a woman is never responsible for a man’s feelings and it’s not her job to make sure you take rejection nicely there’s a reason so many women are terrified about rejecting men because of this stereotype ,2023-07-22 19:48:27

native americans had their land invaded and killed by an unseen physical affliction that they had no power or choice to stop their bodies had literally no immunity families communities cultures died and this film wants to use that as an analogy for the easy brainwashing of supposed super intelligent sentient toy women beings  sorry does not sit well with me and does not work from a screenwriting logical or moral sense",2023-07-28 05:15:15

here is the thing if people really felt the way you say they do about barbie then why the  would they show up to a barbie movie,2023-07-22 23:47:12

if only it kept the energy of the first half hour going we would have had a very different movie but noooooo everythings gotta be a  lecture what a buzzkill",2023-07-28 11:05:34

misogyny is something that affects women as well as men to have contempt for other women i didn’t mean individual men telling women to hate other women it’s something that’s been in our society for thousands of years,2023-07-23 13:49:25
there was no need to have those humans in barbieland in first place as well like all they talked about women empowerment wasn’t enough in real world that they need actual deep emotional effects from their problems by taking them to barbieland  the movie doesn’t have even one single male that’s smart enough to be on the same level as the women put on a pedestal by the great minds of the  writers of this movie,2023-07-26 08:38:20
what is the point of the movie,2023-07-27 00:19:55
maybe it was hyped too much but didnt think it was that funny  there were cute parts and i get the satire and points being made but was too silly for my taste  its a great movie for teenagers i think,2023-08-01 15:05:09

"enlighten me then i suppose me and other reviewers were watching nfl on phone during the film right



i give you a chance  counter my points explain it to me how is this better than any d category family movie 

where are the morals of the story i wrote it already but i write it again there is not we have a main character who doesnt develop anywhere if it has any it teaches young children how to get around the system in a bad way

ehat eas the point of the real world mom storyline

what was the point of the director character he just got lost in the story

what was the point of the ken uprising for once all it did was to redirect the plot in the fckin middle of the movie

had we changed the two lead role actor and actress to a noname one this movie would be a  as it is

stop wearing pink glasses and see this for what it was

wanna see good movie  go and watch the joker2019 or for gods sake oppenheimer



i would watch any twilight than this ",2023-08-10 21:01:59

"the women and men are portrayed completely differently in barbieland the men dont want power and control they wanted to be in relationships with the woman the only reason they wanted to take over was to do something to get the womens attention to get them to care about them cause nothing else worked the guitar scene is a perfect example the men wanted to just be viewed as with the women but the women viewed it as some sort of egotistical power play they viewed everything through the lens of power instead of basic social need

men in the real world are different story 

i found womens interpretation of relationships and love as a threatening power play fascinating and sad the end literally has women telling men to only care about themselves and that should be enough its an anticonnection message",2023-08-12 09:12:59

"no its not women are earning more money then men more women are in colleges and university more women are earning bachelors degrees than men more women are in high earning senior roles in their jobs 

according to tim urbans  whats our problem the wage gap is now 1

"thats your argument hahahaha 

at what number what rate 

given that no one would imagine in a million years it could be the other way around this is kind of a no brainer",2023-07-22 00:39:46
yeah all the men in the movie were dumb and misguided you see the problem,2023-07-28 03:22:55
how’s that a logical argument the movie’s supposed to be comedydrama not a parody of barbie i mean if that’s the logic you’re going by then you’ll love the napoleon movie that’s coming out which has the weekend and justin beiber singing songs on a stage while napoleon ultimately wins a battle,2023-07-28 01:40:17
it could be that they all grew feelings for one specific barbie still they should’ve been thinking about why barbies are doing that to them instead of fighting each other like idiots but again the movie has no smart men capable of having same intellect as barbie not even in the real world like that’s realistic,2023-07-28 02:10:37
what did she do wrong just talking the main two he was obsessed with her she did nothing to lead him on  she doesn’t have to let him come round to her house have less girls nights or whatever,2023-07-29 06:24:15
look i agree that adults can like kids movies but you’re not the target demographic and you shouldn’t take it too seriously as if it were an adult film i went to see the mario movie a few months ago but i made sure to see it at a later hour where not many kids were likely to be there i would never go into it and act offended that there were kids watching it instead of people my age but yet that’s what barbie fans are doing with this film telling kids to  just please stop acting offended that kids movies have things for kids in them and stuff this film is bright pink it’s for little girls,2023-08-01 20:41:18
very female empowering,2023-08-15 12:28:18
oh yea i think that’s definitely right and on that level the joke lands i laughed,2023-08-04 00:28:07
what do you mean by “not everything is offensive” i didn’t find the joke offensive at all,2023-08-04 00:16:51
i also feel like no one has got that barbieland is supposed to mimic or be a satirical version of the real world but with the roles reversed i mean they pretty much mention something similar towards the end but the idea of ken being an appendage to barbie is kind of how almost every woman feels in her life we are essentially viewed as appendages to men and almost like were not the main characters in our own stories which is probably why art like films shows and books that portray female heroines sell so much because we crave seeing ourselves as the main character in our own stories even if theyre fictional,2023-07-23 16:35:37
"except it’s not even reality  it’s just made up for the movie ken had been a doctor and a scientist etc  often they would bring out a ken with a new barbie and a woman was the ceo of mattel from the late 1940’s through to the 70’s it would have been longer but there was some kind of tax evasion scandal

the word mattel was mentioned like 60 times in the movie even more than patriarchy  it was clearly trying to get the word stuck in peoples heads in a transparent and annoying way cmon now",2023-07-23 16:11:47
"oh please literally every ken and real world man in the movie was portrayed as a  doing something negative you know full well the barbies and women weren’t portrayed that way anywhere near that extent 

the whole ending of ken being able to cry and find himself without “toxic masculinity” is like something feminist women claim men want and is why feminism is good for men  but 99 of men just don’t care about that at all it’s a feminist talking point in film is all but it will only matter to people who by into that",2023-07-23 15:57:03
"…the issue wasn’t that that ken was upstaging the main ken it was simu’s acting was extremely obvious that he was acting 

the rest of the cast did not have this problem",2023-08-06 02:34:30
and also that it is harmful to men for them to judge their self worth on their proximity and ability to attract women,2023-07-21 17:07:36
it didnt make men the complete center and flawless macho man in the barbie movie,2023-07-21 15:32:15
i felt like it had 3 or 4 contradictory messages  which is fine  barbie is supposed to be about the surface,2023-07-21 23:37:47
how would you sum up the message,2023-07-21 23:39:23
“fragile masculinity” is just a term progressives use to insult someone they disagree with as a “weak man” which is ironic because they’re supposed to be all for men expressing feelings and not having to be strong and such yet there they are coming up with feminist terminology that functions as a good ol fashioned shaming of someone’s manliness,2023-07-25 11:44:17
"what i said

actual comments and questions i heard as leaving the theater include

what you responded

dont confuse your ignorance as a bad movie

you talk about my ignorance while proving your own illiteracy i specifically said it was things i heard said not my own opinion thats why i used quotes on those parts the quotes for people as simple as you mean that youre quoting someone elses statements something youd know if you werent an illiterate ignoramous

dont bother responding i wont see it blocked",2023-07-22 13:28:49
"“did she have to go to the gynecologist at the end”

i thought it was a funny way to signify her transformation as human as earlier she said she did not have a  and a way to say “okay you’re a woman now”

"i never said anti men anywhere okay maybe i should clarify antagonising i would say its hitting you over the head with social issues constantly

i have no issues with the messages in the movie in terms of whats it trying to say its just the frequency of the messages in all of the forms its been conveyed that are a little much for me personally",2023-07-21 22:52:57
"yes it talks about the evolution of humans with the tools theyve created which is additionally interesting because of the film itself being innovative

in the movie barbie is innovative as it goes from women as housewives or subservient to roles outside of that you could easy argue that contraception or a womans rights movement was more influential than barbie which was probably just a formality

then you could say the barbie movie is innovative for social issues is it the film itself is just in my opinion showing what is already there

x200b

in both cases 2001s version the film itself has a more influential and foundational example and then the film itself is innovative

its disrespectful they didnt even try to add a symbol to represent barbie they literally just added barbies and a voice over to say like oh we wont use  ambiguous symbols well just tell you

that was my only real that kind got to me",2023-07-21 23:12:42
it’s a bit weird cause apparently the happy ending involved all kens being reduced once again to second class citizens and having the same importance as women in society… which was the whole point of criticism during the entire film… so basically they are saying “it’s fine if we are the ones that do it” ,2023-07-26 00:40:09
you can convey pro equality without punching down on men not even just a few men in the movie literally all the men,2023-07-25 22:29:19
it’s anti men when every man in the movie is written as an idiot or an idiot villain and the women are rounded and overall good,2023-07-26 04:18:01
only they arent vapid at all those were not superficial discourses about film and music i really dont understand it im sorry its just dumb and pro ignorance before being sexist,2023-07-26 09:01:36
it seems more like gerwig just genuinely has a lot of anger about men in her feminist world view women go on and on about things i and men don’t care about all the time but i’m not angry at them for it or thinking it’s bad that they sometimes overshares with me about things they like my girlfriend will often talk continually about gossip about people i barely know or books i wouldn’t read but i’m not secretly looking down on her for it i’m glad she talks about what she likes with me,2023-07-26 03:38:50
right the film definitely had comical feminist wonderland vibes at times but had no actual feminist messaging for most of it,2023-08-06 23:56:40

"i mean do i really need to get into this movies treatment of men 

as for women i could dissect it all day it all just basically comes down to the authors seemed to have a horrible chip on their shoulders combined with some smug boy barbie really doesnt make a lot of sense when you think about it no she doesnt arent you  clever
 
for one letting women have jobs doesnt mean you respect them harvey weinstein hired women it was an unusual interview process but he hired them but this seemed to be half of the respect lobbed upon women in the movie was their jobs also nice motherhood tropes in the movie smashing baby dolls not subtle i think 3 jokes making fun of the yes shes creepy pregnant barbie from the past and the only real mother in the movie being a miserable depressed husk with a horrid daughter respecting women means giving them middle class jobs and  on motherhood whatever

further barbie represents an archetype for women of sorts she is an ideal of sorts within that category is this ideal attainable of course not one of the criticisms of barbie the toy is that its giving an ideal for little girls to attain that they just cant and it makes them sad admittedly im not a little girl but constantly revenge  on that ideal seems cruel you could make heman into a paraplegic to prove some point about strength but why would you do that its unnecessary 

i am also highly against punishing people for their virtues and the movie just  all over her sunny innocence which is pleasant in this bleak hellscape 2nd gilded age we live in oh cool the teenage girl is edgy and angry and calls barbie a fascist yes i am aware she had an arc im just not impressed and i understand barbie is supposed to grow and adapt to the real world but a lot of the dialogue felt like it came from a woman who wanted revenge against a toy for some unresolved childhood anger or better yet just some ironic totally detached yeah we can enjoy barbie but we should feel totally bad about it enjoy barbie if you want and let everyone else  

and so much of this movie especially the intro to the real world and the end is filled with this women are prey tone that does nothing but weaken a womans place in the world are women potentially in danger yes is each individual woman being assaulted 30 times an hour no hey women why not just develop agoraphobia work from home watch netflix and order uber eats for the rest of your life depression barbie i understand the movie requires a tightened timeline but its just an awful lens into reality 

and then finally she meets not  and not  is like people die ideas live forever what would you like to be stereotypical barbie and barbie decides to adapt to the real world cease to be an idea and plunge her way towards an inevitable death  barbie not like we needed her around anyways 

i spit on this movie let people enjoy things and shove your ironic detachment back into your nobudget indie schlock

"it’s always funny how that’s the first assumption is “you just hate women” nope i just genuinely think feminism is a cancer to women and has no benefits other then the false hope of thinking men and women are equal when they aren’t and thats ok

it’s ok to embrace masculinity and feminity",2023-07-22 01:29:40

i cant speak to your personal experiences nor do i want to negate them just want to say my opinion that you cant tear down a system from within and ultimately any barbie movie that mattel approved only helps prop up the brand of barbie which last time i went to the mall is primarily being used to sell clothes to thin stereotypically beautiful women,2023-07-21 03:10:46
thats why the movie doesnt fit ken does everything for barbie and she just doesnt care he has his issues too thats why he tries to rule barbieland and a break up with barbie becoming human after and leaving barbieland didntt work for me,2023-07-25 16:45:11

"barbie had limitless roles though so i don’t really see the issue the issues with barbie came more from her figure disfigured feet and the initial lack of representation beyond young thin and white and i guess trying to market an adult woman as an appropriate toy for female children the idea wasn’t that barbie was the best and solved every problem but that she was a bettermore versatile option than just “here female child learn to be a mother” 

but yeah pretty much everything marketed to girls and women has a deeper societal purpose and usually not a good one",2023-10-25 09:14:57
im not sure but i just remember how i was given so many dolls that looked like babies and the only way i knew how to play with them was care for them lol because they had removable diapers and clothes i remember being jealous that boys toys looked so much more fun eg with science whereas all the girl toys were based on little dolls and clothes or arts and craftssewing now as an adult i  love pink but im definitely more into how things workscience i dont know just weird to think about how much traditional gender roles were a part of my fabric growing up,2023-08-04 00:36:30
as a guy i never thought that way although im  so maybe that just blocked all those signals somehow lol,2023-10-25 04:15:09
it’s literally what ruth says in the toys that made us documentary that that’s the reason she made barbie,2023-07-22 12:52:47
it was a lie they said there were adult dolls before barbie they just werent mass produced but the only dolls mass produced at that time were rag dolls porcelain dolls also called china dolls were handmade,2023-08-01 14:40:21
some of them were just straight up fashion dolls that had nothing to do with motherhood or home they were more high society stuff,2023-07-24 04:22:38
"i feel like you and others are conflating what the suggestion of a “woman’s role” is vs toys that little girls prefer


do all little girls like playing with baby dolls no do many absolutely let’s stop pretending like we don’t have biological coding",2023-07-25 15:23:10
it’s restocked ken,2023-07-23 08:01:49
nobody in my theatre laughed at that joke besides me and i was so disappointed,2023-07-22 21:13:15
it sold out so fast i looked for it constantly this morning got busy at work looked again in the afternoon and it had been released and sold out ib less than 2 hours,2023-07-22 04:12:50
agreed  will ferrell is in his element playing a cartoony ceo in a childrens movie,2023-07-28 20:40:51
it was also a reference to the dream ballet from singing in the rain i think,2023-07-25 18:55:31
facts and they did the greased lightening choreography for a minute at one point,2023-07-25 03:48:39
are they not all dance breaks and ,2023-07-29 22:55:03
my wife’s laugh was far too loud for comfort there,2023-07-24 03:26:11
financial ken for me when he said ohhh you only have your money in a savings account let me tell out about cds thats certificate of deposit and my fiance gave me a very intense accusatory look ,2023-08-01 19:38:04
"at 

",2023-07-21 23:15:01
whoops this ken is guilty of the godfather thing too oof,2023-07-26 01:25:50
my girlfriend hit me so  the arm i almost got a bruise such a great moment,2023-07-29 22:22:18
kensplained needs to be a word added to the dictionary,2023-08-01 08:38:13
lets start it from the beginning so you can talk over it the entire time my wife just pushed me on the shoulder and started laughing so hard,2023-08-12 21:34:02
its times like that where im so glad im a drummer and not a guitarist,2023-07-23 23:15:24
lmaoooo,2023-07-23 05:23:52
my brazilian partner gave me some very pointed glances during those scenes,2023-07-28 17:28:52
i was dyinggggg laughing when that scene came on and the little duo ding made its appearance  this movie really was a comedic gem,2023-08-02 07:25:59
"jamie’s smile 
takes me miles 

 dusty",2023-08-01 11:07:40
is there any other reason to learn guitar other than to be popular or to impress girls,2023-07-23 00:01:00
haha that was my absolute favorite part of the movie,2023-07-23 02:44:34
i’ll see your point in that the breaking the 4th wall may age poorly but i think it’s all about the insane balance the film kept consistent throughout the more i think about the parts i thought didn’t hit the mark for me the more i think about them and make me want to rewatch it after hearing those points be impactful for other people it’s the weirdest mega hit movie ever and i’m here for it especially the conversations and buzz around it,2023-07-23 03:18:35
i think without it people think lol what shes still very attractive so they are taken out one way or the other,2023-07-24 03:46:22
that was on point you cant make margot not pretty lol,2023-07-24 03:46:05
werent we supposed to vote today,2023-07-23 03:05:06
"i really liked oppenheimer and felt like the time jumping was the best way to deliver the emotional impact of all the different story beats but i also thought it was exhausting i kinda want to watch it again with the mindset that im going to need to be on because someone is always  talking and every word matters 

definitely a smart and complex movie but it only used silence for certain kinds of effect not really to let scenes breathe when the plot was actually moving it was sprinting lots of scenes felt intentionally filmed in such a way where you feel like bits are missing and the effect was actually really anxietyinducing like strong stuff but i felt like i needed to lay down after",2023-07-24 07:41:43
and different fabric and different neckline and different drawstring just altogether different,2023-07-30 04:07:56
it’s 100 polyester there just saved you a bunch of money and overheating,2023-07-27 21:15:25
yes i realize that,2023-09-16 19:41:04
barbie  barbara,2023-09-29 13:01:54
i felt like she still had makeup there tho,2023-08-04 03:19:45
 which in itself is a commentary on how society perceives women shave everything but your head make sure your skin is flawless make sure you conform to what is expected of you in terms of fashion,2023-09-04 12:00:00
eh i mean the characters were not talking to the viewer at any point in the movie so yes i would say it’s a break,2023-07-23 21:59:49
the joke from the movie was funny but man’s is using “epic” in 2023 ,2023-07-23 11:55:10
let people enjoy things,2023-07-28 00:51:14
"watch that scene again 

i promise you that is exactly how it went you can interpret it differently but the narrator said it right after gloria’s line not barbie’s",2023-07-23 05:56:26
 i didn’t even think about the horse scene,2023-07-22 13:35:13
every rmovies user and youtube video essay creator recognized themselves in that scene,2023-07-23 18:44:41
i get it but its still weird because theres no real water in her world even on the beach,2023-07-29 00:39:31
plus its la and they were hot af so youd assume it was a shoot or fashion or something,2023-07-21 16:50:22
i had to explain to my fiancé ya i went there about the whole jordan peterson tate steve bannon subplot  to a guy like me who has to endure those types of dudes all the time the movie was about as subtle as a sledgehammer  but it did a great job of showing how some disaffected young men can easily go full mojo dojo casa house  its a smaller problem than women have with the world but its still an issue worth mentioning,2023-07-24 15:15:54
true but in this case the negative aspects of barbie the brand were waved away as unfair expectations attached to it thats not accurate those artificial ideals were pushed by mattel,2023-07-21 13:06:19
"did they for me that was just handwaved away with that scene with sophie

yeah yeah we know people criticised that arent we funny and meta but we dont talk about that here any longer",2023-07-22 21:52:04
double collar polo shirts is a glaring example,2023-09-03 06:56:25
oh yeh definitely that was obvious but it’s the fact that he decided he was going to wear three that’s funny and just adds to all the other bits of redundant things,2023-07-25 20:36:28
i want someone to edit in that high pitched scream he does in the nice guys,2023-07-22 03:49:14
yeah that moment 100 felt like something that was adlibed id love to see alternate takes,2023-07-21 23:18:08
 same this hurts ,2023-07-26 02:33:35
not girlfriend just a long distance non committed girlfriend and stay with him in his mojo dojo cash house,2023-07-22 04:04:21
this will definitely be a major historical role for trans actors i loved every time she was on screen,2023-07-31 13:36:18
and the sportsteaching  i felt so called out ,2023-07-21 21:59:49
some people get so bitter about that  thanks for taking the ribbing positively  i’m the music ken who was ranting about stephen malkmus lol,2023-07-22 13:27:26
ive seen barbie twice  once with my partner and once with a group of friends both times i felt eyes on me as the person with a film degree in that scene,2023-07-21 19:24:50
yep that got me pegged but for david lynch lol “you haven’t seen mulholland dr it’s a deeply complex morality tale about women in hollywood…”,2023-07-22 14:29:08
see aragorn cries out in real pain in this scene because really broke his foot kicking that helmet,2023-07-23 13:29:58
oh that hurt badly how many times have i explained something im not really an expert in very earnestly to a polite disinterested woman,2023-07-23 04:59:29
“can you start it over and talk through the whole thing”,2023-07-24 05:42:52
my best friend felt sooooo called out hed just made his girlfriend sit down and watch the godfather a few days prior,2023-07-24 10:28:37
weve all been that guy its okay lol,2023-07-22 19:59:05
 kenergy is my new favourite word ,2023-07-26 11:50:13
really i took it to mean the ceo has some standards they didnt become the ceo of barbie to sell ken they became ceo of barbie to sell barbie because iirc the line was i want to be as involved with little girls dream as much as possible in the least weirdest way possible,2023-07-24 03:07:35
"i imagine its because thats exclusive to the mattel website normally

but i bought the kenough hoodie will i regret it when it comes in september possible will i say how much it costs to ship to canada absolutely not",2023-07-23 03:48:15
"whoa  that is expensive these are playline dolls made for actual play  not the more elaborate costumed dolls which are made for a more adult collectors 

from target the mattel website or third party",2023-07-22 14:39:17
bc youll still buy it ,2023-07-22 22:10:43
its not that new of a concept either every adult animation fox show has done it constantly over the last 3 decades,2023-07-27 05:56:57
that’s exactly the point i got from the movie the executives literally don’t matter at all they even show it when they are already selling ken dojo casa houses without their input at all,2023-08-02 00:48:58
barbie had long been controversial as a subject in feminist circles because of the dichotomy between the perfect beauty of the dolls and the fact that its showing women in roles and places of power importance and influence,2023-07-23 23:32:51
"well considering they didnt introduce some new super barbie that saved barbieland which will be sold at target for 60 my statement was pretty accurate they just told the stories of barbies that already existed 

meanwhile movies like star wars always trots out new characters with each film that are designed to make toys out of",2023-07-28 13:53:10
"

the purpose of the movie was to create entertaining content that people will want to watch that tells the story of barbies place in the modern world selling additional barbies was a byproduct of that",2023-08-10 16:22:38
thankfully all 3 of them are hanging around for the final season,2023-07-30 20:16:20
they are,2023-07-31 06:38:53
we at least got something similar to the hot priest bus stop scene,2023-07-24 00:40:40
no way that’s so cool thanks for enlightening me,2023-07-27 09:08:13
when he said he missed his barbie and emma came right in ,2023-07-22 18:56:29
ncuti’s little dance in the background was hilarious,2023-07-22 08:48:34
i dont either am i alone they look totally different,2023-07-23 14:39:07
probably would have worked better with robbie and samara weaving,2023-07-25 02:54:01
i wish they had followed through with that,2023-07-23 06:57:26
the first barbie that gets the nobel prize at the beginning of the movie,2023-07-25 20:37:41
i hope this film gets more attention,2023-07-31 15:56:15
is it good i’ve seen it on the netflix list and have been intrigued,2023-08-07 03:56:37
columbia is just another poetic name for the americas a fauxlatin name derived from christopher columbus british columbia is effectively british america district of columbia is the district of america etc,2023-07-29 02:11:57
that’s even funnier,2023-07-25 19:55:51
"at first i only noticed the horses on the tv and mount horsemore

but then i noticed the lampshades and the paintings and the statues and the just about everything else and i couldn’t stop laughing

the patriarchy is horses all the way down",2023-07-21 03:53:17
yeah where he was saying to barbie “oh you caught me reading” that book is actually mentioned in one of the cast interviews too ryan gosling loves the book and he actually wants to make a movie out of it ,2023-07-21 21:23:21
i can’t believe we saw all those kens beach each other off on screen a few were even beaching other kens off at the same time,2023-07-21 09:37:51
patriarchy was not very beach,2023-07-22 01:28:52
totally i think it also played very well into ken’s place in the world and why the apology for barbie was so perfect much like the narrator said at the end ken’s where very much an allegory for women’s power in the real world,2023-07-22 17:53:46
i dont know there is a darker underline there he is frustrated that barbie doesnt give him the attention that he wants basically incel and patriarchy sounds like something that could change that whether she likes it or not and he gives her the guilt trip for that as well basically gaslighting,2023-07-23 03:23:26
a lot of the time yeah,2023-07-25 19:51:40
youre not super far off,2023-07-29 22:58:02
here hes just ken,2023-07-27 04:43:42
"i need it back up again stat
i missed it ",2023-07-22 15:43:08
i think most theaters did tbh,2023-07-25 19:47:44
mine had black white and pink balloons to cater to both,2023-07-23 01:36:25
this movie was made for genx and millenials young kids can enjoy it but i don’t think they’ll “get” it,2023-07-22 17:30:55
yeah i chalked it up to maybe the crowd being too young to get most of the humor or something lol,2023-07-21 16:11:32
it deserves best costume design too and definitely a nom for director cinematography and original song and honestly i think margot deserves a nom as well,2023-07-22 05:35:37
between spiderverse and mi8 and oppenheimer and barbie we are feasting this year what a time to be alive,2023-07-25 04:34:07
don’t forget about best original song it’s usually my least favorite category but i’m going to be internetcampaigning hard for i’m just ken,2023-07-25 02:32:17
there are much better animated films this year ones with actual endings for instance,2023-08-06 04:18:17
i thought about that but they can still probably show a normal place  like elf showed nyc as nyc is when buddy got there it wasn’t some weird dull version of nyc,2023-07-25 12:27:01
probably and barbie likely would never have expierenced the concept of growing old as a bad thing to be avoided in particular women looking old,2023-07-23 21:50:50
that was my favorite scene in the movie it felt like the feeling when you grow up and realize the world is not what you dreamed it to be but compressed into a few minutes,2023-07-22 06:06:03
i think youre right just googled ann roth and she looks like the bus stop lady,2023-07-21 10:26:49
"i knew it was a cameo so as soon as i left the theater i googled it on my phone and the first article said it was barbara handler this guy was not the only one misinformed

edit its the daily mail i can only blame myself for believing it  
",2023-07-21 23:04:13
yeah thats on me my source was the imdb trivia page should have known user submitted trivia wasnt subjected to peer review,2023-07-25 21:50:18
shed post on the sub rateme or truerateme or whatever it is and be told shes a 6 at best,2023-07-23 13:29:23
that whole thing made the movie’s message that much better because ofc robbie is gorgeous and i don’t think another actress could have played the part as well and she was the one who pushed for the movie,2023-07-27 23:12:38
sometimes i tend to believe that if lucifer was remotely as close as the tom ellis adaptation thered totally be a special place in  for toxic twitter trolls lol,2023-07-31 10:20:25
"there’s also a huge difference between feeling beautiful likely truly looking in the mirror and believing that reflection is beautiful which is such a rare occurrence and feeling that other people see you as beautiful

sometimes it’s a hard distinction to make but it’s an important one",2023-07-28 10:18:07
yeah i wanted to see their living kenditions,2023-07-23 20:33:31
"i loved the movie but having it end with the barbies saying that not even one ken could be on the supreme court imo made the movie miss the mark a bit whole point is patriarchy’s bad but oh wait original matriarchy with secondclass kens is also bad so was really hoping for a more “we’re on an even level” society

but nope we learned nothing and are going to do the same thing that the real world did decades ago but in reverse o7",2023-07-29 21:34:17
quick before they learn how to build sideways,2023-07-21 04:37:23
"there has to be some kind of message that the least patriarchal character of allan was the only man in barbieland that actually beat up people while the kens mostly were just “playfighting” that lead into a musical number 

i wonder if he also killed that ken with a shovel or not ",2023-07-22 18:45:39
the beat down was hilarious just like in the background as the momdaughter had a serious talk he’s trashing sone kens so good,2023-07-22 06:31:17
“i’m never getting out of here”,2023-07-21 05:47:37
got scott pilgrim flashbacks from that scene,2023-07-23 12:11:11
"  buildingthewall kens

 i did not catch this particular joke",2023-07-21 10:40:32
“allan go around”,2023-07-25 20:01:46
 please go as allan ,2023-07-27 03:55:13
when they switched to the black turtlenecks it instantly became my favorite part of the movie it was already so funny and the dancing got even better,2023-07-21 14:41:46
not even the part where ryan gosling gets kissed on the cheek by two other kens,2023-07-22 21:45:14
bro literally got kissed by two other kens  lol,2023-07-26 19:11:18
"a gi joe movie in the same vein as this that accurately depicts the effects of war both on those who serve and those who end up as collateral would be breathtaking 

spec ops the line crossed with pat tillman’s story all portrayed through soldier toys",2023-07-25 20:03:49
dude same hard laugh too lol,2023-07-23 08:21:36
the shining,2023-07-24 06:35:11
honestly i didn’t get what did it mean,2023-08-04 03:15:17
weird barbie offers margot robbie two shoes a high heel for everything to return to normal and a birkenstock to know the truth,2023-08-28 13:10:29
oh  thats actually really smart i love reading peoples analysis on reddit as i am too dense to notice these things,2023-07-21 10:44:25
i felt extremely represented by allan it was nice to have an antimacho antipatriarchal male character in the film,2023-07-23 06:00:58
was the drum sticks there due to the joke that he looks like chad smith,2023-07-22 15:14:59
i liked pretending this is the same world as the lego movie and will farrel is playing the same guy,2023-07-24 01:03:35
my partner noted the fit of the suits seemed a bit off and wondered if they were wearing women’s suits,2023-07-23 06:48:48
"it’s actually even better than that they were both out to dinner at the same place during production when she went to pay she was told cana had already paid so she went to thank him then asked if he wanted to be a merman in the movie 

",2023-07-26 11:09:22
hard to see,2023-07-22 01:47:35
 his name was on the credits for the movie but i don’t understand why they would put his name there if he’s not there in the moviethe weirdest scene was at the beach where all i see is a floating blonde wig and a guitar in the air right next to  dua lipa weird eight,2023-07-22 20:31:51
"i got the same read on that allens meant to be a true ally who helps and supports but doesnt put the spotlight on himself as opposed to the fake ally who makes it all about them and ignores that being an ally is being supportive but not taking a lead role

theres lots of little subtle brilliances like that in the movie",2023-07-23 23:14:16
earing ken was  coded even when he came out i missed sugar daddy ken  but allen was married to midge so it is weird that he tried to ditch her,2023-07-24 00:41:51
his tagline canonically was only “there’s only one allen” and “i can wear all of ken’s clothes” ,2023-07-22 14:45:35
she’s stereotypical though,2023-07-21 17:38:42
that will be the sequel when we get kristen stewart as moms friend she got really close to after the divorce barbie,2023-07-21 18:43:09
"i think a good way to handle it would have been when gloria tells barbie she never had a ken if barbie mentioned some barbies do prefer the company of other barbies  it would fit with the childish sexuality of barbieland while giving a little representation

just like weird barbie is a real thing there are  barbies who kiss by mashing their mouths near each other",2023-07-24 00:40:41
there were so many moments when i genuinely thought margots barbie was a lesbian,2023-07-22 02:34:23
barbie herself was very lesbiancoded to me,2023-07-25 20:43:33
you can be whatever kind of ken or allan you want to be ,2023-07-25 03:35:15
that line killed me but went totally over my daughter’s heads ,2023-07-21 13:47:30
i was thinking about when she used rhythmic gymnastics to overcome high school bullies but really any time hillary duff is around ribbons works,2023-07-23 17:39:12
"from what i gather people apparently dont like him for 2 things

1 he argued that pedos who hadnt done anything should get treatment which is valid however he made a callous comparison of the situation of pedos to  people people spread misinformation that he supports pedos and that hes a  himself which is not true 

2 tldr he made some pretty annoying remarks on twitter about his career and the film industry and some filmmakers

i can get why people would think hes annoying but that doesnt justify spreading false info on the guy",2023-07-22 03:14:53
" i was like you could just get on to the hood from outside

love this subtle type of humour",2023-07-21 21:45:58
this is where an actor truly shines ryan was soo extra he made every thing ken did just all the more hilarious,2023-07-31 09:29:29
and the big short,2023-07-24 03:03:50
his reaction to the velcro wallet is magnificent,2023-07-25 10:41:50
“be better than the gap”,2023-07-25 03:08:40
actor ryan gosling yelled out we got an expletive movie now,2023-07-21 03:22:10
warner brothers meeting with ken was “intense” and “at one point barbie was crying” but everyone grew closer and a big lesson was learned,2023-07-21 06:23:35
"in regards to the sound guy

he  boomed me x4",2023-07-21 07:06:57
ken then went on barbieland nightly news and boasted about how his team of kens kicked the  of all the other kens in a beach dance off even though he picked all the discontinued useless kens and carried and choreographed the entire routine,2023-07-21 03:28:15
rnba has infiltrated rmovies,2023-07-22 13:20:58
im imagining simi liuncuti gatwa and the other kens as jeff teaguederek rose and the rest of the twolves this is your starters oh hes talking about me,2023-07-21 15:37:57
so youre saying gosling absolutely  on the 1s with a team of 3s while shirtless,2023-07-21 15:25:06
as a timberwolves fan i thought the barbie discussion would be a safe space i should have known better,2023-07-24 03:07:55
“barbie was seen driving through barbieland in her dream car asking through texts for ken’s address”,2023-08-05 02:47:29
indeed  i was impressed by how well they wrapped up the ken plot,2023-07-24 12:07:55
"it’s a remarkably egalitarian movie all things considered which makes a lot of the backlash about it being a “woke” movie so ridiculous 

the message of the movie is essentially “why are we getting so hung up on who ‘rules the world’ when that encompasses such an insignificant part of our humanity”",2023-07-26 16:36:46
this comment is gold lol,2023-07-31 09:20:06
"ikr

its very ironic how this film that was made for barbie and females ended up with a ken stood out soo much more especially even his character growth",2023-07-31 09:27:40
"i disagree 

you put most actors with that script and you dont get the magic gosling pulled out 

it was more than just the script his physical humor and how he moved throughout the film was special

he made coming down a slide one of the funniest moments in the entire film and that was all ryan",2023-07-21 02:53:23
but that would mean that no actor can be an mvp of a movie because most actors don’t also write their films,2023-07-21 05:07:39
the real mvps are the people who birthed those who wrote the words and directed the film,2023-07-21 02:54:00
mattel seems to be learning what do audiences love to hate corporations we can make ourselves the bad guys in our movies and make a  of money,2023-07-24 08:39:18
made her corpse,2023-07-25 17:02:48
"it certainly wasnt the comedy kids movie i assumed it was      
i didnt know anything about it my girls just saw it was a barbie movie and wanted to watch it i went in blind but i did enjoy it as did they",2023-07-22 00:08:40
im a dude and that line had me floored  so powerful,2023-08-13 05:09:31
"it really was i wasnt expecting it and the daughters indifference towards her mother was so true to life it really caught me off guard like someone hit me in the stomach        
ive tried explaining to my daughter that she can refuse my affection in a more gentle way and i really do hope seeing it play out on screen in a way designed to get you in your emotions will make her realise how much it hurts     
i could feel her looking at me then i looked from the corner of my eye and she was watching me then after the movie she said i saw you cry      
i didnt make a thing of it but hopefully she had a light bulb moment",2023-07-21 23:10:10
for what its worth my parents took the chance got the third boy and never regretted it for a minute  and im glad to have two younger bros,2023-08-13 05:12:16
thank you shes of an age i cant be affectionate in public i dont force it i dont want to embarrass her or step on her boundaries but i do so miss the days i could hold her hand in the street,2023-07-21 22:58:22
lol thank you i was a … special … kid considering how my face has turned out i’m really happy i was wrong,2023-07-25 03:55:23
if you enjoy workplace sitcoms like the office and parks and rec as well as ms ferreras acting its definitely worth a watch rsuperstore is pretty active too,2023-07-22 19:47:42
absolutely on top of everything already said it quite often brings up social topics in a serious yet lightheartedly comedic way nearly identical to this film just with less camp,2023-08-20 23:19:52
ahaha yes my next thought was big sister too even though i know she’s totally a reasonable age to have a teenage daughter just like i am my brain just couldn’t compute it at first,2023-07-30 01:37:14
really  i must’ve missed that one,2023-07-24 02:36:53
i just got back from the movie and didnt even notice the make of the cars id rather see real products in movies than have characters talking about facespace and drinking cola,2023-07-28 05:32:26
i dunno that car chase absolutely felt like a commercial and you cant forget dont forget your purse flashes big ole chanel logo at the camera chanel necklace glittering in the deliberately false sunlight,2023-07-24 08:57:36
id imagine that felt a lot more egregious watching it in the us than it does in other countries here in the uk i dont know if they even sell them anywhere,2023-07-26 21:44:07
i felt so seen when the birkenstock scene came up i’m not a high heel girly but i own more birks than what is probably socially acceptable,2023-07-26 03:33:57
"when the kens broke into that allblack dance routine in the middle of their beach war it was the first time i ever turned to the audience behind me to see if they were as transfixed and flabbergasted as i was   


they were",2023-07-21 03:33:40
"the second i saw that hoodie i immediately wanted to buy one  

edit there isn’t any official ones but i found some in websites











they might be trash but go for it everyone

edit they have an official one ",2023-07-21 03:34:03
as a dude the first thought in my head when that hoodie appeared onscreen was “i need that hoodie” and the entire row of guys behind me pretty much voiced my thought lol it was hilarious,2023-07-21 09:32:56
 just ordered mine,2023-07-22 01:29:23
 i hope they sell those because i will buy one instantly,2023-07-21 05:01:50
i swear to  if i can’t buy that somewhere i’m gonna start petitioning mattel,2023-07-21 23:49:04
those are going to sell in their millions,2023-08-09 21:48:56
its on the mattel website now,2023-07-22 07:30:06
gotta catch that 3pm preview ,2023-07-21 06:01:03
funny as the line is it also touches on cognitive dissonance the whole sunk cost fallacy thinking its not what i thought it was but it still benefits me so ill keep going,2023-07-21 15:51:02
such dinner conversation that is,2023-07-21 15:48:54
because thats exactly what the movie is,2023-08-04 21:45:06
i feel like he’s been taking the rdj in tropic thunder approach and not dropping character until he does the dvd commentary,2023-07-23 05:19:40
i don’t think you are wrong but… it’s strange that this is usually the opposite in oscar consideration,2023-07-21 12:44:03
i think you’re really underestimating his range look at lars and the real girl where he plays a depressed man who is in love with a  doll or half nelson where he’s a crack addicted innercity teacher or even his role in the big short where he’s an over the top boisterous and smarmy wall street banker he’s played a wide variety of roles through out his career,2023-07-23 02:27:05
ryan gosling totally stole the show not that margot robbie wasnt great but yeah barbie was at its best everytime gosling was on the screen,2023-07-21 16:24:39
he’s supposed to play ryland grace in project hail mary so excited for that,2023-07-21 03:04:31
"my top 3 ryan gosling movies in order are

1 barbie

2 la la land

3 drive",2023-07-21 09:34:30
crazy  love is one of his best as well,2023-07-22 17:42:02
and the place beyond the pines the believer half nelson blue valentine amazing actor,2023-07-21 19:12:37
id add half nelson to the list it was a low budget indie film released in 2006 and his performance was magnificent he plays an inner city school teacher whos addicted to drugs the film explores themes about role models and second chances highly recommend it,2023-07-21 05:38:41
how the heck did you leave off the notebook jesus my wife and everyone her age  worships that movie,2023-07-21 08:40:31
hes really good in half nelson too,2023-07-21 04:00:38
crazy  love is excellent too,2023-07-23 00:09:45
let’s not forget the play beyond the pines and blue valentine,2023-07-23 19:13:37
also only  forgives wanna rewatch that this weekend because it might be his most opposite role to ken his range is absolutely insane,2023-07-21 14:09:55
my favorite with him is place beyond the pines,2023-07-23 00:28:16
thank you for mentioning drive,2023-08-06 04:56:03
hes also hilarious in the big short,2023-07-21 04:40:37
nice guys is  great and he’s excellent in it no idea how i missed that movie the first time around,2023-07-29 02:42:21
"you gotta respect that he takes his work seriously but not himself

  


hard balance to pull off",2023-07-21 15:08:00
"ive perused some of the initial threads and see a couple random comments like hes 41 shouldnt ken be in his 20s but then i scroll some more and then i keep scrolling and then scroll some more and maybe find a few similar comments but its difficult to gauge based on the sea of positive comments 

x200b

so unless this person is visiting different places and seeing overwhelming skepticism i stand by my original comment its pretty wild to me that someone would go as far as to say ryan gosling was doubted to a noteworthy degree at least on reddit the majority of people seem to love him",2023-07-21 05:14:35
he’s fantastically funny in the nice guys,2023-07-21 06:46:11
the scene of him trying to manage the gun newspaper pants and bathroom stall door at the same time kills me,2023-07-21 12:55:47
"agree 

i love that the film doesn’t make gosling’s ken and the other kens evil in the traditional sense once they found out about patriarchy but are deep down trying to find what their purpose and place

one of my favorite little moments in the film is after the ken rebellion ncuti gatwa’s ken happily reunited with emma mackey’s barbie showing that they can love one another and work together",2023-07-21 17:11:06
its like what america ferreras character said its like the indigenous americans during the 1500s they had never encountered smallpox and therefore had no immunity to protect them in this case its kens and the kens plastic naivety exploding into resentment once he gets immersed into the misogyny of real world patriarchy,2023-07-21 03:36:09
its no coincidence how many grownass republican politicians literally cosplay as cowboys  ken was exactly a satire on these people,2023-07-23 01:30:40
"honestly he and margot should receive best actor nominations for this film yes they were really silly roles but they absolutely disappeared into them

  


you can see the amount of time they spent finding every little quirk about these characters and the effort they put in to not only bring them to life but also be taken seriously ken is an unexpected antagonist of the film and i want him to lose but i also see where hes coming from and believe that he believes in his mission

  


and margot was just born for this role you just see her fall apart as she realizes that not only is she not perfect but that its okay margot is one of the most beautiful women on the planet movie even says so but she plays this part where i trust her when she says she doesnt feel beautiful

i see ken and barbie because theyre there not just because the movie tells me that theyre ken and barbie thats acting and despite the comedic roles its some of the best ive seen this year again movie straight up literally tells me that thats margot robbie and i still see barbie 



 i have similar feelings about dustin hoffman and his portrayal of captain hook sorry just had to throw that out there too",2023-07-21 14:58:00
i think robbie will definitely receive a best actress nomination and i would be really tickled if gosling got a nom too he  killed it mostly comedic but he brought a lot of heart too  i’m literally on cloud 9 from this movie,2023-07-22 04:40:43
he should run for supporting and he should win there won’t be a more memorable character from this year’s films than his,2023-07-24 03:03:03
allen being actually a part of the movie and not a random cameo made me so happy,2023-07-22 13:05:30
i love bo but like he doesn’t have the himbo chops that gosling brought,2023-07-21 03:55:59
not even their goldenboy ryan reynolds,2023-07-22 08:36:22
completely agree some people will never be happy with any business and believe any decision that business makes is in bad faith “they only did that to make money” duh that’s what a business is if they can make positive changes and make money that’s a winwin,2023-07-22 17:36:47
this i think a lot of people aren’t even aware how inclusive barbie has become my daughter has barbies with different races hair textures heights weights she even has amputee barbie and alopecia barbie and i’ve seen in stores vitiligo barbie wheelchair barbie albino barbie it’s really refreshing,2023-07-23 10:51:07
low key my favorite joke in the whole movie there “do it sasha destroy barbie” played so genuinely lol,2023-07-21 06:17:54
their addressing of it was entirely surface level and almost immediately brushed off  it felt like they included it just to avoid people mentioning that they didn’t say it but didn’t want the average movie goer to take that away as a message,2023-07-21 03:07:20
yeah the thing literally starts with cellulite  flat feet,2023-07-21 18:21:32
honestly i found the daughter really annoying her rant during lunch was horrible ive never heard of anyone getting body image issues from barbie because shes a  doll she didnt set feminism back 50 years because shes just a fun toy that little kids like to play with,2023-07-23 01:31:07
yeah its kind of whack that people are comparing this to josie and the  cats in that movie the filmmakers rejected any ad revenue they would have made from the brands featured in the film to show that they were in the movie purely to criticise consumerism,2023-07-21 12:07:52
very accurate depiction of gen z logic tho,2023-07-22 06:31:52
i mean yeah the doll has to have  up proportions to work the entire point of these things are the clothing and outfits and while you can make clothing 10x smaller in area you cant make it 10x thinner so the doll needs to have wonky hips et al so it doesnt look weird once the clothing on,2023-07-23 03:04:02
"the subversion of depicting of the ceo as a goofy but harmless  instead of what he was set up to be in the first half  the big evil a la the lego movie strikes me as something beneficial to mattel rather than detrimental

disney will make fun of itself  enchanted came out in 2006 and kind of helped push this trend",2023-07-22 19:36:02
okay yeah the chevy and chanel product placement was really aggressive that kind of thing usually doesnt stick out to me but it felt like it was on full blast for those two in particular,2023-07-24 08:18:42
you’re really going to shame those women about their bodies after watching a movie like this that’s the real irony here,2023-07-21 04:02:47
they use it to refer to anything i dont like  fascism doesnt even require a dictator,2023-07-25 20:42:53
it definitely was monty python islike horses and the godfatherstereotypical boy stuff that they get so far into it becomes part of their identity for some time im surprised there wasnt a boondock saints poster in the background too,2023-08-28 02:02:30
hmm yeah i guess so anything else wouldve been too on the nose,2023-08-13 07:15:43
very briefly one of them mentions stephen malkmus,2023-07-21 04:14:29
i swear to  matchbox 20s push was the most hilarious needle drop in the movie im never going to hear that song the same way again also greta gerwig says she does really love that song,2023-07-21 03:39:19
“can i play the guitar at you”,2023-07-21 04:00:18
was probably the biggest reaction in my theater and then i asked some of my female friends how many guys had played guitar to themit was a lot had no idea as a nonguitar playing guy,2023-07-21 04:19:49
there are a lot of people who will always criticize heavy handedness don’t look up bad the same criticism,2023-07-23 02:13:41
i called out the heavyhandedness to a degree but i’m realizing after reading this thread that i was wrong,2023-07-25 21:39:22
“snyder cut” is the exact way it’s referenced,2023-07-21 22:27:17
i wont be surprised if greta gerwig is a casual lurker on rmoviescirclejerk,2023-07-21 02:45:27
as a man watching this with a group of women i just kept thinking to myself “man this ken ran place sounds kinda cool…i’m part of the problem aren’t i”,2023-07-21 08:06:55
it was a great pop culture reference the fact that it got people mad kind of proves the movies point coming from someone who thought zsjl was a vast improvement over the theatrical cut,2023-07-21 18:30:36
hes completely missing the point that its nothing to do with the actual film itself its the behaviour of the culture of fandom around it,2023-07-22 00:30:56
1000 sure zack snyder would laugh at that bit too,2023-07-24 08:27:39
got a link,2023-07-25 21:41:15
by that logic the movie is also saying that the godfather is a beacon of toxic masculinity and incels yet gerwig is on record talking about loving that film as a person who really likes zsjl it honestly just felt like a throwaway gag about dudes and their obsessions,2023-07-24 01:13:22
why wouldn’t they they’re not on good terms w snyder i thought and the botched theatrical version remains their canon version,2023-07-21 14:32:31
yeah to be honest it kinda  me off,2023-07-21 23:38:20
im just takes a lot to get me to actually laugh out loud in theatres most films get me to giggle even while many people are actually laughing but that zs jab was just hilarious imo i couldnt hold myself back ,2023-08-16 06:50:00
yeah i loved that joke and was simultaneously angry at how well that tactic would have worked for distracting me,2023-07-21 09:32:27
yeah as a former film student i had flashbacks to godfather dudebros scarface would have been another excellent choice,2023-07-23 05:40:32
"i am aware of that ive seen the movie

gosling was absolutely excellent but lets put it this way this film could exist without gosling and his ken it would be a lesser film and significantly less funny but it could exist just fine without him 

however it could absolutely not exist without robbie and her barbie robbie as the producer is the reason this film exists at all she is also the reason that goslings ken exists as she personally got him on board all this provides a complementary meta overlayer to the films premise which is that ken exists because of and secondary to barbie

as for films content the main reason it is resonating with its target and primary audience of women is barbies journey towards becoming a real woman and her experiences of the real world on the way her encounters with women from several generations the old woman the mother and her daughter her discovery of physical imperfection and not feeling good enough her experience of  harassment etc this is the heart of the film and it would be a somewhat throwaway comedy without it of course most of the female audience is not commenting on reddit

saying that gosling carried the film is akin to saying that eowyn carried  the the lord of the rings films as opposed to you know its male heroesprotagonists frodo sam and aragorn now eowyn was a highlight and some peoples favourite part of the trilogy but she in no way carried it credit where credits due 

most of the people i have seen making these aggrandising claims for gosling often at robbies expense have been men at least assumed some are falling over themselves to claim this womanled womancentred and womantargeted film for the boys one professional male commentator went as far as to reduce robbies role to running around in nice dresses his article read like a parody but i think it was actually serious",2023-07-29 15:12:56
sure sis,2023-07-29 12:53:55
they definitely benefit from each other in many ways they sort of fill in the holes for the other and create a more rich narrative experience,2023-07-21 16:32:07
something i thought about after the fact he collected a lot of books throughout the movie but i don’t think at any point we see him readingreferencing anything he just kinda transforms after seeing the four tvs with ads and tv shows,2023-07-24 02:02:23
we need way more movies that include explicitly red pill ideas as villainy tbh,2023-07-23 14:48:12
that’s so funny a bunch of teenage boys in front of me left halfway through america ferrera’s monologue their loss,2023-07-24 16:31:13
"ouch  i equally had a date though she was more concerned about the amount of times i said ouch over ken being overlooked it ended up with her being more sympathetic 

but i totally get that breakup lol",2023-07-31 11:21:07
thats what my kid said haha,2023-07-21 03:05:16
so do i they need to make it for real,2023-07-21 12:35:01
i just bought it for 75 without a second thought from the mattel website,2023-07-22 05:12:26
the two friends i went to the theater with both have that i am enough tattoed on their forearms had a pretty good laugh about that,2023-07-21 03:54:10
"
well i think theres something to the notion that the real world in this movie is still a girl playing with toys 

and that girls name is greta gerwig",2023-07-28 05:22:43
they sold out immediately probably gonna take some effort to grab one when they restock,2023-07-22 02:40:09
i feel just like when ken discovered horses,2023-07-22 01:45:23
" the fact that it was about her finally having a 

i missed that part of the joke i got it as shes a person she has to go to the doctor haha its a lady parts doctor but i forgot she had a blank slab of plastic down there before that",2023-07-25 00:36:39
so that made me think when she became a real person was she bequeathed a real  or was she made human with no  still and so she had to see a gynecologist to see about having one,2023-07-21 21:21:13
that guy could care less as long as he recognized its going to make money,2023-07-22 04:53:23
“i’m here to see my gynecologist” or something close to that don’t remember it exactly,2023-07-21 15:10:47
that person would probably be rung up for the hot wheels movie somewhere down the line,2023-07-22 11:20:26
how do you guys even notice what car they are product placing i was so involved in the narrative i couldnt care if they were driving beetles,2023-07-26 06:56:25
"i love all car chase scenes even really bad ones so i had a great time and its one of my absolute favourite scenes of the movie but yeah thinking about it it was definitely a car commercial

for some reason i had a massive brain  about this and i literally thought the blue car was a toyota for like 2 days until i was talking about it to a friend and she was like actually its a chevy  doing a very quick comparison of the chevy blazer and the toyota corolla cross while obviously not perfect i can definitely see why i came to that conclusion because the front ends are vaguely similar then again pretty much all car manufacturers seem to look similar within vehicle classes these days

obviously i identified the tahoes correctly right away but to be fair theyre also not a totally unusual car chase scenebad guy car choice",2023-07-31 02:04:12
the joke about who taught the mom the drive like that was hilarious though,2023-08-13 05:56:12
idk know why but the chanel stood out to me so much birkenstocks kinda made fun of themselves in this but there’s a scene wheres she’s holding a chanel purse and she has the huge jeweled chanel necklace and i think earrings they felt so out of place,2023-07-21 04:55:58
unless you know the brand you wouldn’t know what they are i feel like the gag only worked because they are in the zeitgeist and they only get shown twice for a couple seconds each the chevy chase was a whole damned commercial,2023-07-21 08:07:59
please let me keep reading it as  and not marketing,2023-07-21 07:29:08
looked like it accelerated really quick,2024-01-28 17:28:24
also there is almost nothing more relatable to women and unrelatable to men as a woman seeing her gynecologist it was a hilarious but also very female specific ending note,2023-07-21 05:33:23
ahhhh ty,2023-07-21 12:56:34
i think they are talking about the daughter who said it was appropriation,2023-07-21 07:04:52
actually originated in the 70s during the farm worker activism led by cesar chavez,2023-07-23 03:26:10
we latinos use it for everythingif it was used in the obama campaign its only because we also use it everywhere else,2023-07-25 14:25:39
in argentina it was popularized by president mauricio macri 20152019 he said it in all his rallies,2023-07-27 14:07:03
i felt real dumb that i didn’t understand the last joke of the movie,2023-08-02 07:17:28
interesting i’ve never thought of that before,2023-07-22 00:59:18
but allan is supposed to be an admirable character isn’t he i don’t get it is gerwig trying to make fun of nsync here and what about,2023-08-05 11:22:17
that is some classic allaning right there,2023-07-26 21:42:25
ack youve given the most thorough description of the joke so far and i still dont get it would you mind helping me out what are the essential characteristics of allan that match up with justin timberlake to me timberlake has or had star quality he was often the lead singer on nsync tracks and became the groups breakout star allan is none of those things hes an easily forgotten background character whereas ken is routinely ignored from where i stand allan is even less consequential to most barbie owners i dont understand why the movie chose to compare him with timberlake or nsync,2023-08-14 03:48:45
this is the end inches closer to being a true story each and every day,2023-07-25 02:55:26
and chris brown is apparently a pleasure to work with i think that someones work self isnt always a true reflection of who they are overall,2023-07-26 15:27:35
source for that,2023-08-03 02:35:08
i don’t think that’s entirely true it’s grounded in the propaganda myth that mussolini — the italian fascist leader — made the trains run on time  and i imagine controlling the flow of commerce is grounded in nationalisation of production,2023-08-10 17:33:30
yes to the second part of what you said i said that too but where was the part of the joke that is people who are fascists don’t know it if you’re implying barbie was a fascist but didn’t know it i’d have to disagree because she isn’t a fascist fascism is a far right wing authoritarian political ideology and she clearly doesn’t ascribe to that,2023-08-10 17:35:00
it’s less funny to me if they’re both wrong,2023-08-10 17:36:18
what about the same reference in the  wonka and the chocolate factory,2023-07-28 14:48:31
yeah i know  subtlety this movie wore  the patriarchy sash on it i really really appreciate that boldness,2023-07-21 03:18:37
interesting takeexplanation for that i was cringing so hard at that monologue it felt so heavy handed like a corporate bot wrote it after being told about the patriarchy for the first time i’m not saying it doesn’t fit the movie it probably does but didn’t land for me i wanted it to though,2023-07-23 01:18:24
i grew up on disney channel so i remember her from gotta kick it up loved the sí se puede reference and then later sisterhood of the traveling pants i really loved her performance,2023-07-21 07:11:24
yeah she has dumb money in september and elio pixar movie in march 2024,2023-07-21 02:46:49
im not gonna lie if someone did that in my theater i wouldve lost my  laughing and wouldve had to leave to regain my composure lmaooooo,2023-07-21 04:22:02
my theater clapped and cheered at that scene and several others at all it was an early access screening and it seemed to be made up of a lot big barbie fans i felt like i missed some references that most of the rest of the theater got based on their reaction,2023-07-21 20:17:11
i love theater experiences like that,2023-07-21 15:19:25
my theater was clapping it was wonderful,2023-07-21 04:11:07
my theatre clapped and cheered more in this movie than the theatre i was in at the avengers endgame premiere it was unreal everyone was dead silent during that monologue then immediately erupted in applause when she was done like it was a live performance,2023-07-21 14:40:31
as a woman who has seen and loved almost this exact monologue on tiktok it did end up feeling a little… i don’t even know how to describe it i think because we’ve already seen this near exact monologue in the real world delivered by real women it felt off to see it utilized in a corporate hollywood film,2023-07-24 02:57:22
as a movieholic it was definitely the godfather scene for me lol i felt sooo attacked,2023-07-31 11:14:10
i hear that people are flocking in droves to see a movie about a doll from 1959 idk tho,2023-07-22 08:57:43
good point  there probably could have been more diverse barbies with speaking parts it seemed mostly whiteblack,2023-08-03 14:35:02
i just looked that up because i didn’t know either  he was announced as the doctor in may 2022 right in the middle of filming for barbie  so there’s probably no way that could have been included in the original screenplay  they maybe could have added that as a rewrite or reshoot if somebody had pushed for it hard enough,2023-07-28 14:36:57

i thought that was a interesting twist when the mattel execs are rollerblading to barbieland the ceo gets told that all of the ken stuff is selling like crazy but he isn’t actually all about the money he genuinely does want to empower girls even if he’s a  who hasn’t figured out that maybe having an all male executive board is part of the problem,2023-07-22 22:53:41

but not in a creepy way,2023-07-29 21:09:43

not only that but his last line “si se puede” was what i assume to be a reference to america starring in ‘gotta kick it up’ from the disney channel,2023-07-21 05:59:49
i mean in movies particularly with latina women they often portray a single mom with a kid think maid in manhattan spanglish jane the  superstore at first it seemed like thats what they were setting up but then nope her husband is duolingoing and it was nice,2023-07-21 15:18:16

"self worth is your self you decide what that means that means it is a vacuum the fact that you immediately jumped to external success as your gauge for self worth is the entire point the movie is trying to make with kens journey that the things around you arent what make you worth something to yourself unless you choose you make that choice and if you decide your self worth can be gauged by those kind of external factors well thats a pathway to become villain ken 

youre either a troll didnt even see the movie extremely dense or all of the above for not getting that its extremely explicit and it looks like it would do you well to take that lesson your job has nothing to do with your self worth unless you let it 

my self worth comes from seeing my wife laugh from hugging my mother and telling her i love her and seeing how it makes her feel accomplishing the goals i set for myself things like that none of what you said was true at all",2023-07-21 09:30:59
ahhhhh yes that’s exactly what it was  thank you,2023-07-22 16:03:42
but the narrator did say kens will get as much power in barbieland as women do in the real world so its very explicitly pro equality in barbieland,2023-07-27 05:04:46

gender pay gap isn’t real at least not how it is described by feminists there’s a lot of reasons why women aren’t promoted as frequently as men it was cringe because every word of dialogue that was spoken by a man seemed like it was written by a teenage feminist who has never spoken to a man,2023-07-30 02:17:09
" some brands of feminism can be implicitly antiman

i mean you have to at least fall for rightwing propaganda to think that  feminism is specifically about equality of genders  

in your example this is why feminists support expansion of paternity leave  its not mens fault women can get pregnant but the reality is that women can get pregnant and people of all genders should be able to take off work to care for family when needed and we need a society that not only allows for that to happen but doesnt hold it against people for choosing that",2023-08-11 01:51:31

the “tell don’t show” part of it really bothered me the movie had so much visual flair please show us this thing you’re describing,2023-07-21 19:47:33
"okay so the message is basically that men should just accept they will not be with a woman anymore and to just find happiness in themselves because theyll be forever alone anyway nice   


how can you honestly think this will work for the majority of men like finding happiness in yourself is just an easy thing that everyone can just decide to do i know its not impossible throughout history there have been many ascetics and mystics who have found happiness by giving up their worldy desires but these were always just a fringe group who put in the effort and had the spiritual reasons and desire of love from the universe and could handle not being in society  


the assumption that the majority of men should just give up their desire of love from women is such an unrealistic and dumb one love from women is literally the no1 thing men want in their life imagine every male mcdonalds worker to follow your and the movies advice to suddenly not look for happiness outside himself he would literally stop working at mcdonalds because there is no reason to work at mcdonalds except if you want to save up some money hope to get laid and eventually marry a nice woman do you not realise that society and capitalism is literally based on the idea that men have to work for womans love   


i also dont like the way you are assumming im falling into the hypermasculinity trap or whatever first of all the most attractive girls go for the meanest most hypermasculine men they can find in my experience this is not just a moot argument and you know it   


i know men and women should be working out their differences but that is simply not possible if women continuously go for the worst of men and  value into loving a man and supporting him   


i know i would give so much of my energy and love to a woman if she loved me back and was loyal with me and no thats not just me saying that because i am desperate i would literally love her just because i love love its just that the dating market is so  skewed right now and women are abusing it like factory bosses are abusing their workers and i get it its the first time period where women get to shine and show the world what they can do they are not yet used to the responsibility that comes with their newfound power i know theyll do eventually because there is nothing wrong with women  


just remember this prediction when women realize in 20 years that they have ruined men and now have to truly build up culture again for the first time theyll cringe at what they did in this age to think they can use men as  toys and not care about marriage and relationships",2023-07-21 17:14:54
give me 1 example of a recent hollywood movie that did not portray being a man as being something bad,2023-07-21 17:20:30
"i mean he referenced “top 20 of men” and “female hypergamy” which are incel talking points in case you didn’t know

i do hope he gets well though and has a perspective shift he needs to realize he is kenough",2023-07-21 16:54:14
you shouldnt even be allowed to talk about incels as a  man because you literally have no conception of what an incel is like i hope  people get more rights etc have more acceptance and have good lives but incel is literally the only thing you are not allowed to speak on as a  man just like straight men have no idea what its like to be a  man and be hated and oppressed you have no idea what its like to be an incel because inceldom does literally not exist in  or  spaces or whatever,2023-07-21 17:32:25
yep you found him youd be one too if you werent ,2023-07-21 17:23:13
theres nothing feminist about the movie unless you define feminism as just being antimen the entire movie literally said patriarchy like an online chat bot spweing nonsense both barbie and ken were going thru issues and the entire film portrayed it just men are bad what kind of a message is that,2023-07-21 16:53:21
i’m not a young female tik tokker but a 34 yo female nonetheless i was so happy for the message this movie gave to our future generation go off sisters,2023-07-22 03:58:22
i’m a 33 yo male  and tbh this is more how i felt coming out of it i did find it to be profound and i cried through a lot of it not only was it a beautiful and easytounderstand encapsulation of the patriarchy and feminism but it was also just a beautiful reflection on what it means to be human and the human experience we all have of learning who we are who we’re not who we want to be and trying to find true beauty in life as we push through it i obviously thought it was absolutely hilarious but walking out of the theater i felt deeply touched in a way i don’t often feel from movies it was gorgeous,2023-07-22 05:29:03
good grief,2023-07-22 03:57:00
he really wasn’t his role was a nothing one but he does rise above it but this movie rests solely on the shoulders of margot robbie without her the movie doesn’t reach its peak im in she’s in every important scene of the movie she is the heart and soul of the movie and most of the comments in this place are talking about gosling or a ken joke or a ken line or the “kenough” thing,2023-07-23 01:56:27
"gee wiz my bad usually when people talk about groups having seen completely different movies its referring to hating vs loving the movie 

you also went out of your way to say male dominated reddit which in the context of this very feminist movie gave me the crazy impression that you were talking about what i thought you were talking about my apologies for the misinterpretation",2023-07-23 21:44:40
" maybe i live in a liberal bubble but even the culminative message to ken that he is enough is baffling to me as a man ive never felt that my value depended on my female partner therefore kenough comes off as bizarre and condescending pablum to me id never think to say this to a woman precisely because its blindingly obvious and condescending

theres an entire generation of young boysmen growing up watching andrew tate and other redpill misogynists across social media believing that their value only comes from the attentioncontrol they have fromover women and the things they own",2023-07-24 19:52:42
i agree with this my parents took me to see indiana jones and the temple of doom in the theater when i was about 4 years old there were definitely parts i didn’t understand and i clearly remember that one guy getting his heart ripped out and it was still beating that is definitely something that people today would not want their kids to see i love indiana jones to this day and i will never forget seeing that in the theater sitting with my dad,2023-08-06 00:52:14

so i’m saying they didn’t get a lot of the jokes it’s not that deep",2023-08-06 03:18:57

interesting i didnt get a feminist message from that movie,2023-11-06 07:21:59

yeah im the same way it blows my mind how my gf can watch an awesome movie with me and shes satisfied with saying that was pretty good and then move on with her day with no discussion needed  but everyone has different passions so its all good i suppose,2023-07-23 04:20:04
the best part of that scene was the woman replying to barbie i know,2023-08-04 08:23:02

i think the monologue scene could be improved if instead ferrera’s character felt like she couldn’t comfort barbie who’s basically the idea of a perfect powerful woman when she herself feels like a failure then barbie would find the contradictions and comfort her herself and that could mirror how dolls comfort little girls maybe se could’ve brushed the mom’s hair lovingly reinforcing the mirroring it would also be more organic if barbie was doing the “deprograming” of the other barbies i felt like it’d make more sense and barbie knows the dolls personalities already,2023-08-06 15:10:17
it worked because they’d be breaking the third wall throughout the entire film with their oneliners and humour in one of the opening scenes lizzo literally asks barbie “girl you ok” after she falls down the barbie dream house,2023-07-22 09:29:51
it did but i am not a fan of meta humor like that,2023-07-22 01:12:21

id disagree the movie ended well were all noticing that the kens are still 2nd class citizens and barbie literally decided to throw away immortality to become a real girl in a reality where women are on the bottom of the totem pole,2024-03-17 00:29:40

now the whole process of transitioning between the worlds confuses me more so any human that travels from the actual world to barbie land becomes a barbie or ken and thus theyd have blobs instead of genitals and vice versa,2023-12-24 04:14:07
"the barbies are not portrayed as stupidly as the kens the kens are always  but the barbies are only  when they’re “brainwashed” saying it’s how a child would play with barbie land to excuse the uneven writing is just a cop out

will farrel and the rest of the business men are absolutely idiots while meanwhile america ferrara is has better ideas than them speaking of america ferrara  even her husband is portrayed as a good who is mocked by his wife and daughter and later again taken shots at when gloria mentions some other guy teaching her to drive say what you will but i think this movie shows gerwig has more contempt for men than she would admit even when totally unnecessary for her own story men are made idiots and mocked

uh huh let’s see how women would react to a scene where an idiot barbie sobbed about loving ken while he mansplained life to her told her he didn’t love her but that meant she could find herself lol the reaction would be very different

the real world women are  genius saints compared to the portrayal of men in this movie and you know it",2023-07-30 03:13:44
"thats what most incels are like they think value comes from ones ability to attract women and without women they are worthless some blame themselves for being weak some blame their genes and some blame women for deeming them unworthy but what unifies them is that they derive value from women and not from themselves

no the genders are not reversed  there are not movies which portray the entire female gender as bumbling morons doing the wrong thing and belittle their interests there’s a wide difference between that and women not being main characters or movies being made for a male audience  there are movies made for women which sideline men or have them as basic romantic leading men as well that’s not the problem the problem is the negative portrayal of an entire gender which honestly isn’t unlike old sambo cartoons used to portray black people,2023-07-26 04:39:24

"yes you arent american and probably not a lawyer so you arent seeing the nuance  the constitution protects against intentional bias and discrimination against women  but it does not protect against systemic incidental discrimination against women  

in other words american law takes into account whether an action is intentional or not  other countries may only look at the results or the effects of actions and not consider what the intent is which is very difficult to know  

thats why we americans need a separate equal rights amendment  time after time weve seen that the 14th amendment is not up to the task of protecting women  we need to make it clear that discrimination against women is illegal whether its intentional or not",2023-08-07 20:05:16

also i wasnt trying to say women are useless or have never done anything historically but that thats our designated role in a patriarchy women are expected to just stand around and look pretty and do little else the original comment said the way kens were relegated to that role in the barbie movie was unfair and the point of my response was yeah being a woman in a patriarchal society is unfair thats an intentional choice by the movie",2023-09-09 14:36:25

"it was definitely skewed a bit towards making fun of men but it made fun of women too barbie land was the opposite of the real world it was showing men in the roles women have historically played in the real world plus it showed that men are also emotional and deserve to find themselves and not have to fit into typical male gender roles 

it was definitely heavyhanded but it knew it it wasn’t trying to be anything else i’ll take that over all the movies that pretend not to be about the current social landscape but are obviously awkwardly fitting it in",2023-07-22 14:15:08
i don’t know how you could take the line about ken’s eventually filling the role women have in our world as anything other than hilarious it was a joke about how the barbies would appease the ken’s with token positions and feel good about themselves for it it was skewering the barbies just as much as the ken’s for being a joke about those in power not truly wanting to share it equally,2023-07-22 16:37:08

idk i thought there were lots of plot issues that made a satisfying conclusion tough great movie from a fun perspective but hard to end maybe stay as “stereotypical barbie” in barbie land bc matte can’t stray too far from its roots and will ferrell enforces this which is a darker but more accurate ending but they also let her sit on an advisory role on their board of directors  profit g the roles of ken in barbie land and painting a more accurate picture of modern corporate csr esg,2023-07-28 12:03:04

it was a success based on the opening weekend that’s not because of the content of the movie because the plot was kept very secret

i believe if you had all those elements with the same cast and trailers the plot really wouldn’t matter it would have been huge anyway

that’s all i’m saying whether it’s superior or inferior more intellectual or deep or not basically this is the same old  mario comic books characters transformers barbie dolls  that kids like which has permeated the culture to the point it’s a universally known brand worldwide  and now is packaged as a big budget hollywood production with the big budget marketing",2023-07-30 18:51:22

"well i guess that’s the political commentary in this fictional barbieland they did the same thing that happens in the real world they took all the power and gave the men crumbs

so i interpret this as making the audience think about how that feels in the real world

politics is different than the selfactualization of ken 

i think the movie took on too many themes to be honest so i do feel like this message was a bit lost",2023-07-22 15:47:10
you missed the major point that these characters are toys that fulfill a function the reason kens can have the same place in society as women in the real world and wont be equal until real women are equal is because thats when little girls wont need a womendominated fantasy world to escape to until then girls need barbie to be the star of her universe as long as girls are marginalised in reality they deserve to be the centre of the universe in fantasy little boys get both from the real world and the vast majority of media,2023-07-22 16:21:27

also men are competitive with each other but so are women a lot of women are not using makeup for men they are also using makeup for themselves and other women they clearly compete with each other also they also slutshame each other  its not only men doing this

if barbieland actually existed im pretty  sure it wouldnt be such a perfect place as shown in the movie",2023-07-22 22:26:53

yeah i absolutely understand and agree i felt very weird about the justification being that they had no immunity exposure to it like women wont figure out that gender subjugation is wrong unless someone tells them i get that they kind of parodied that with white saviour barbie but it was still a bit of an ehhh moment to me,2023-07-21 15:09:41

"obviously the main goal is equality but i think that the fact that theres so much backlash to female power fantasies for not including men enough is eerily reminiscent of the social conditioning where women have to consider men in nearly every aspect of their life we had to have a significant plotline about male validation in a barbie movie ffs

what the   the movie has a solid through line about how barbieland is a biased unfair matriarchy as much as the real world is a biased unfair patriarchy  and then it ends the movie by saying nah thats fine  it throws away its message immediately after having a huge scene about calling it out  the movie ends with literally no one learning anything nor a clear message that thats the point  the entire movie is about selfawareness then ends in hypocrisy

you are the peak kind of feminist who is going to take the wrong message from this movie",2023-07-21 21:05:22
"loads of movies before 1960 have strong female characters yeah sure some may be in stereotypical gender situations  but that’s because the whole world was that way then so how else would they be shown the mistake is thinking their portrayal is weak just because of that for instance i just watched a hitchcock movie from 1942 called shadow of a doubt and there’s a teen girl in it as the star who is obviously clever and is called the head of her family her father and his friends are idiots and is kind of the foil to the main villain i wonder if you’ve seen many films from the 40’s and 50’s to say that there are no strong female characters there are quite a few 50’s sci fi movies with female scientists and astronauts

anyway if the point was to explain to men what it feels like to be a woman surely the barbie movie was a bad vehicle as the audience is statistically skewing 73 female at this point and a large portion of the men who go will just be taking kids or their with a date and barely paying attention regardless perhaps what men do go would be more receptive to the messages of women’s struggles if they weren’t presented in a movie ripping on men and portraying them as morons for the rest of the time

i hardly think being a woman makes you more uniquely qualified to know the corporate history of barbie or the protests about the doll
here let me mansplain it to you as those who liked the movie might say  barbie was never a feminist icon that’s an interpretation from like this year when this movie was announced feminists protested the doll in the 60’s and 70’s when the female founder and ceo of the company was still in charge men didn’t just kick her out either she had to leave because of tax evasion scandals barbie wasn’t rebranded it was the same basic doll

barbies careers in the 60’s were  like nurse and teachers assistant which was stuff women had done forever already  the astronaut was because space was all the rage then barbies careers have always been an excuse to get her new outfits so they could keep selling the doll without that they wouldn’t have been able to keep bringing out new looks but regardless our difference of opinion here seems to be that you consider women having any career back then as feminist whereas i can’t do that when many of the women of the time taking part in career wouldn’t have called themselves feminists or been considered such by feminists

look i’m glad you liked barbie and don’t want to take pleasure from something you grew up liking from you and don’t want to tell you barbie dolls haven’t or shouldn’t empower young girls because i’m happy they do and i’m glad you feel that way but as a man i clearly saw the movie differently to you and i’m obviously not alone in that it’s not about the doll or her history it’s about this one movie",2023-07-23 18:10:08

i do wish the real world wasnt quite so silly and overthetop dominated by the dumbest men around i see that mostly as a plot device because it inspires ken to take over barbieland but he could have been inspired by a more realistic real world for example mattels board of directors is 50 women from kens perspective that would have been inspiring but they decided to make it 100 blithering idiot men because its funnier

i dunno i agree that there were some poor choices made but at the same time i find them all at least defensible and overall i liked the movie",2023-08-06 20:29:44
i perceived the comedy in the ken scene as not that it was funny that he was crying but that it was funny that he was so confused and ashamed by it  kind of making fun of how men put pressure on themselves to posture toughness but i do agree overall the movie had a very shallow message of just women good and men bad however i also strongly disagree that this shallow portrayal is what would appeal to feminist women it is what would appeal to buzzfeed girl boss feminists maybe so basically people with an equally shallow understanding of feminism real feminists would actually want to see the movie genuinely portray the nuances of how women contribute to patriarchy and men are also disadvantaged by it,2023-08-08 01:25:16
" it was kind of a false support for men imo for instance in the scene where ken is crying and barbie tells him it’s alright to cry  ken wails in a comedic over the top way which is clearly meant to be funny

huh i guess i just didnt view the way in which he was crying as making fun of the idea of men expressing their feelings to me it was just the way goslings ken acted since he was pretty flamboyant throughout the movie even when it came to his masculinity i can see where youre coming from though had his ken cried in a more toned down way it might not have undercut the message for you

but for me the comedy of that moment was from him doing the stereotypical woman cares about my feelings so that must mean she wants to be with me thing that exists throughout media and irl really

 all real world men and kens were written as significantly stupider than their female counterparts

i get it but remember theyre meant to be a kind of manifestation of mattel toys i dunno much about barbie so i just figured they havent made a astrophysicist ken or marine biologist ken could be totally offbase on that one but maybe barbie in the real world can influence mattel to make those ",2023-08-09 02:46:25
"it wrote all the kens and real world men as  compared to their female counterparts and also morally worse and needing to change
the part where it showed it was “alright for men to be sensitive” was where ken cried and barbie told him it was ok but contrast when barbie cried to kens crying scene  barbie crying was a serious and sympathetic moment ken wails in a comedic fashion which is clearly meant to be amusing 

so the message is saying that it’s alright for men to be sensitive  but what’s on screen is showing men being sensitive as a joke 
it hits the right feminist talking point that it’s alright for men to cry but also shows a beaten man crying as a big joke and so allows the very same types who whole heartedly buy into men crying being ok to laugh at a man who is crying while still feeling feminist about it

is men being sensitive ok or is it a joke the movie and greta gerwig can’t seem to decide now i’m not saying men crying can’t be shown for comedic effect  but pushing a serious message that it’s alright for men to cry at the same time as showing their crying as funny
comes off as very contradictory and hypocritical
especially when it’s coming from a movie made by a feminist woman whose dead serious with her “patriachy hurts men too and men should be more sensitive”
message she’s thinks she’s educating men about

you know rambo already pushed the message it was alright for men to cry if they needed to  and that was like 4 decades ago and didn’t play the moment as a joke i hardly think barbie has done any wonderful thing for men in showing a scene of a man crying in a comedic way for laughs",2023-08-06 20:54:17
i think she just saw the barbie movie as a way to make points she wanted to make about feminism men and patriachy and ken was the character she chose to do that whatever points she wanted to make i feel like she really should have kept in mind that barbie should be the focus and her story should make girls feel good about themselves,2023-07-25 15:52:05
they never would have because mattel would hate it and it would go against what gerwig believes in but the movie would have been more fun with a malibu  barbie vibe like ken had for robbie’s barbie and get the dumb dumb “math class is hard” stereotypical popular girl barbie on there too  then they can play off the clever barbies seems like all the barbies have the same basic personality for the most part the only memorable one was weird barbie i don’t think the different barbies should have got on so well they missed a lot of chances for humour,2023-07-25 17:20:56
"while i see where you’re coming from i don’t think barbieland is at all meant to represent an ideal society 

i think it’s actually the opposite way around barbieland reverses expected gender roles and stereotypes satirically to illustrate  and critique our reallife societal issues regarding those topics

i would go as far as to argue barbieland is supposed to be a critique of feminism the barbies live in a delusional bubble where they believe they’ve cured the world of inequality meanwhile the film goes on to show us this couldn‘t be further from the truth   


this disconnect from reality represents today’s mainstream brand of feminism in which women call themselves girl bosses reclaim their sexuality and think that feminism has won this ignores the struggles and barriers in place for women especially those with intersecting identities like being a women who’s also a racial minority

so yeah for these reasons i think presenting barbieland as an idealized society on the surface is really supposed to act as another layer of social critique",2023-07-27 15:25:13
exactly in a similar vein to the godfather joke,2023-07-27 13:07:13
one that actually acknowledges the barbie world where women ran everything and men were second class noncitizens was also bad and should be changed,2023-07-22 04:15:13
yes,2023-07-24 05:29:28
i felt like the barbie matriarchy winning and ken crying and going to find himself was symbolic of the radical feminist belief that women need more power and once women are in charge and patriachy is overthrown then men will be able to express all the feelings they supposedly want to express and find there true selves and somehow that’s equality,2023-07-26 19:18:58

the matchbox 20 bit had me in stitches,2023-07-26 20:33:25
a message isnt a solution though i guess the biggestclearest message i got out of it was patriarchy bad which is ok i guess but i really feel like they were trying to say more than that it seems like it had the desire and potential to say some necessary things about how the feminist movement has had a negative effect on men and we need to do some balancing here because we should be equal but we are different and that focusing on one gender to the exclusion of the other isnt healthy for either but they didnt,2023-08-12 05:33:00
this is the problem though as the men are actuslly representing the womans story in real life and the barbies are actually men realising how they treat woman in the real world and at the end when the barbies regain control the end should have been that they work together equally instead theres a line about how the kens would eventually have as much influence as woman do in the real world so the message is really that women have less power than they do now  and the men never learnt and only became more aware of what they are doing if you get me,2023-08-13 09:58:51
"no they arent yes women were historically mistreated but it has improved immensely because of awareness and while there are still changes to be made most of them will be finished as the boomers die and their positions and influence can be replaced 

but the issue now is that men are struggling badly make enrollment rates are way down graduation rates are way down this is a promotion that needs to be talked about i have a daughter and a son both in middle school do you know how many shows have said women can do anything how many girl can do x programs there are

is that barbie meant to be trans or is she just a female barbie played by a trans actress they never mention her being trans",2023-07-23 05:59:07

ahh really i felt the opposite margots consistent strength as an actress was doubly highlighted by the casting of the other female characters shes able to carry the seriousness and the comedic no one came close to her chops  ryan felt all over the place in his portrayal as ken he definitely looks like a ken even though id prefer zac efron or matt bomer didnt quite nail the acting which was a departure from his usually strong performances,2023-08-04 13:45:57
" what the  was with that vo line about margot robbie being too beautiful for the role implying she is too beautiful to feel selfconscious how feminist 

i think youre way overthinking this barbie was just not feeling beautiful anymore because she wasnt stereotypical barbie since she lived her entire life but it was funny coming from margot robbie considered one of the most beautiful women in the world and then the film breaks the fourth wall just saying what the audience is thinking

to me the whole ending was also a dab against wishful thinking on equality and feminism as in its easy to say the whole society is evolving and women are also capable etc but the world doesnt changed overnight anyway


it is the irony of the men saying yes we get it now but still dont change anything",2023-07-22 03:55:02
"thats why i said kens have more rights now but it still is a society were the barbies are the leaders and the kens are secondary

" the kens arent even allowed representation on the supreme court they still have no belongings no homes no money and no power even alan the best represented male in the movie remains secondary to the barbies and their power over barbieland

comedy has nothing to do with punching up or down and it definitely hasn’t always done so  that’s a modern progressive idea 

it’s not any one stereotype that i can’t find funny it’s the constant stereotypes of everything men like as dumb and all male characters as bad i can laugh at jokes at mens expense and have in other movies  but when a movie is nothing but dumb men endlessly mocked while competent women are upheld  then clearly the jokes all add up into one big pile of bitterness against men which is very obvious",2023-07-23 19:04:46

and yet the kens are portrayed as morons like the real world men and the women are sympathetic heroes battling the patriachy it’s not even handed at all,2023-07-23 17:08:37
the point is that the movie would have received widespread hate if it was about mens issues and showed women in a bad light every single man in the movie was either a bumbling idiot creep or both now imagine a movie where every single female character was either a  annoying drama queen or some other sexist stereotype while all the men were perfect thats basically this movie and im shocked that you cant see that,2023-07-23 17:09:40

it’s very interesting to me that now that fictionalized movie barbie has realized herself it‘s now ok and celebrated to buy a 50 dollar stick figure doll which celebrates the once upon a time reviled stickfigureness because now margot greta the cast  and of course new ceo 2018  mattel  give us their “blessing” and ”approval” pfft  and the new dolls appear even more prayingmantis like due to the articulation formation and that they do not even have the old rubbery and fleshy legs",2023-07-24 17:27:47

plenty of women’s movies have some cardboard cut out brooding dude either rich or supernatural who is just as much a female  fantasy as any side character in male movies is for men that’s ok it’s not stereotyping an entire gender as  and wrong

that’s why the movie even compares it to women in real world which makes me more upset since it implies that women are like kens but we won’t give kens rights or power because they don’t deserve it

ok so barbies were in charge of everything because that’s just the way it was they didn’t decide that themselves they were made that way so after forcing the ken’s to confront their toxic masculinity instead of instituting a patriarchy they went back to the way things were until ken’s obviously were hoping for more representation the barbies decide to give them token representation and the joke is that they are doing the same thing as men in the real world because they don’t know any different ken’s feel this is a huge improvement and barbies feel they are being more for equality but they are just repeating the same pattern humans have had for thousands of years to me that is a joke about power and how if women were on top of the world for centuries the roles would be reversed because we defer too much to tradition and how the way things are before very agonizingly slowly changing for the better,2023-07-22 20:08:22
"a group of guys in their 20s exited the theater looking disappointed like they were hoping the movie would have been more fun for their demographic 

the marketing made the movie look gaggy but was really imo intended for a female audience 

i like movies made for me but i also like marketing that correctly sets up my expectations",2023-07-21 18:38:14
"you must not be very aware of feminist literature and studies because matriarchies are widely depicted as utopias or held in high regard usually because theyre more peaceful and nonviolent

but im not really trying to discuss matriarchies here   
again my point is that the kens breaking free from the barbies control the matriarchy would be analogous to women breaking free from the patriarchy in the real world assuming were going with the satire angle if the result was that the kens ended up establishing their own control of the barbies in a unequal and unfair way as a result then that paints feminist movements as problematic",2023-07-24 12:39:42
the movie had a chance to critique feminist with the barbieland matriarchy  it never really did i just find it ridiculous that the kens are supposedly in the real world womens place in barbie land  yet when they get power they’re shown as not being worthy of it and totally incompetent and moronic if you think that’s making most men reflect on being better and thinking about women’s position in the real world or whatever you’re dead wrong a teenage boy leaving this movie would most likely just be  off that men have been shown to be idiots and not worthy of being in charge of anything and not in a good way that will help women,2023-07-31 08:40:59
"do feminists not claim “patriarchy” and “toxic masculinity” is holding men back from crying and showing emotion and being their true selves 
yes they do does gerwig not try to potray that with kens ending yes she does
what part of that am i mistaken about

yes when you’re totally making stuff about men up based on what feminist women think there tends to be an unlimited amount of strange theories as many as feminists can imagine i’m not disputing that but what i’ve described is the feminist ideology and ideas present in this specific movie",2023-07-31 08:55:47
if you don’t like the way the barbie movie portrayed it’s theme and messages then what is the alternative is that people should believe,2023-07-31 16:53:21
about what,2023-07-31 08:42:34
didnt he sing in la la land too,2023-07-22 22:08:45
"even though i loved it for me the biggest flaw was that i found that the most interesting concept and it kind of gets forgotten for a large part of the movies middle and only picks up again in that lovely now feel scene at the end

the matriarchy vs patriarchy stuff is a lot of fun and arguably makes for a better barbie movie concept and for me kens song number is the unexpected highlight of the whole film but the becoming a person and live forever as an ideal or die but live a real life choice is way more interesting it reminded me of the movie bicentennial man

also for a moment i thought the woman at the bus stop was a cameo by barbies real life creator ruth herself then i remembered two scenes later that she died in the early 2000s",2023-09-15 21:50:33
they were too into their own message for the audience who is super into the message they might be able to overlook that this movie isn’t really that great and the plot doesn’t make much sense why are mattel chasing barbie in barbie land when they wanted to chase her back to barbie land,2023-07-24 04:15:23
i think they should have made the characters a lot more relatable and the message youre trying to give has to be subtle then the story becomes a lot more meaningful this movie didnt do a good job at that imo,2023-07-23 23:44:25
just beach,2023-07-22 01:05:39
i got the vibe that ryan gosling was just baked i know he actually wasnt in order to portray the  k e n e r g y  and it was perfect  his own movie would be amazing,2023-07-22 03:12:58
"you think those barbies were being portrayed as the good guys for explicitly denying the kens a seat on the court

in that scene they were basically playing the antagonists from any historical female empowerment movie with the kens being the ones fighting and gaining new rights

in a different kind of movie one of those historical dramas that would be considered a good end",2023-07-22 07:13:38
this but unironically,2023-07-22 04:44:44
i mean yeah the movie is made with a reason and profit cant be ignored from the equation of course ,2023-07-23 19:28:18
"thats what i said they ask the kens to start from the lower levels which means that they do get a position of some kind its not a hardno

i found it to be a very realistic portrayal to be honest if theyd have switched to an equal representation right after itd have taken away the essence of reality the film was constantly dabbling with

in the real world once you take back what was yours its difficult to give it back  share it  especially when youre  to operating with it in a particular fashion the way i saw it was that the barbies were willing to take a step towards equality their matriarchal ways possibly couldnt change overnight so again them laughing after saying that line was a satirical jib at how it is in the real world  with the roles reversed ofcourse as you mentioned

so now kens will have to work their  off to prove themselves  the same way women have and sadly are still in the real world also it makes sense because lets be honest ken was created as a romantic interest for barbie 
like he says in the film it was never just ken it was always barbie and ken so this plays perfectly well with that ethos too

i hope we get a sequel titled ken soon",2023-07-23 18:41:45
it is a barbie movie so i feel like we arent supposed to take this part too seriously,2023-07-23 18:46:47
because she wants people to watch this movie the more the better it wasnt for kids but kids werent exactly banned from seeing it who cares if they understand or not parents taking little girls to see it was definitely a thing which would profit them more,2023-07-23 22:28:56
i would take a kid as young as 78 yo to this depending on the specifics of the kid as every child is at a different developmental age at this point and it cam vary somewhat,2023-07-23 22:56:34
"well as a coproducer along with mattel  margo robbie’s job is also to maximize profits by getting those bottoms in the seats as many as possible  and in any way possible

neither she nor mattel nor gerwig for that matter care in theory how old the participants are babies younger children adults older people those are tickets sold and  is to be made in any way possible

a ticket sold is a ticket sold no matter the age show me the money 

this is greta finally coming to terms or has she really lolol with leaving the independent world behind and getting into bed with the ”evil” corporation  ",2023-07-23 22:55:47
one has to be really add your adjective to think this movie was a kids movie it was very clearly marketed to the millennials and genz who grew up with barbie not the ones who are 910 year olds rn the fact that they distribute toys to promote doesnt mean anything tbh the trailer the buzz and everything was for the older audience,2023-07-23 22:32:45
couldnt agree more,2023-07-24 11:28:29
no it’s just that a lot of the 1010 reviews there really read like simplistic prompts to chatgpt,2023-07-25 18:53:40
i think what the commenter was trying to say is that the barbies and kens cant achieve social equality and thus shouldnt be used as a way for us to model equality in the future,2023-07-25 17:31:41
oh i think you were right to analyze it through that lens you said it best when you described barbie as abstract concept that concept allows barbieland to parallel the real world but exist in its own space your thoughts were really insightful,2023-07-25 15:14:59
and of course once barbie realizes her whole life has been lived in a dreamlike trance she’s unable to go back to her former life as the curtain has been pulled back and she’s unable to enjoy the blissful but meaningless existence and has no choice but to move forward as “human”,2023-09-24 19:23:22
"yeah no   i get they were going for a reverse genders scenario the point i am making is that potentially empathetic theme is lost because they portray the real world women who are the under class so sympathetically and the real world patriarchy so badly  yet portray the kens as a joke and antagonists and the barbie matriachy as not anywhere near as badly as real world patriarchy

lol “degrade women who enjoyed the film” i’m talking about a film on a thread which is for talking about the film it’s not a barbie fans only site negative opinion is valid so don’t try to shut down opinion you don’t agree with by saying it degrades women we’re men not allowed to watch the movie and have an opinion on it",2023-07-26 08:08:32
uh huh well i sincerely doubt women would take a scene of some moronic woman obsessed with a man sobbing while he educates her on how to live like she’s a  the same way,2023-07-30 03:04:35
is letting women boss you around supposed to be good,2023-07-29 19:05:39
others are saying its someone else,2023-07-21 14:39:50
"bcz tickets for both the movies are overpriced  i have a busy schedule and i dont like wasting moneyeven single pennies

and that reviewers and my opinion have kind of always matched until now and now that i know that the ending part is true it kind of ruins it for me i believe that a story is only as good as its ending

so im asking you is it good story wise",2023-07-23 16:34:43
by getting a  so the resolution to barbie’s existential crisis is “muh ” yeah great stuff,2023-07-28 03:37:33
"im not sure about that but i agree it was shoving in far too much it felt like the equivalent of an instagram post with 1000 hashtags in the caption when someones indecisively trying to reach all people so they do everything it overwhelms so much it becomes incoherent

if i throw a tennis ball at you youll catch the ball but if i throw 50 tennis balls at you youll catch none of them",2023-07-28 19:35:10
right she covered off on your circles i think that’s in line with the point i’m making that she was very careful to make a lot of different people feel seen in what felt like checking so many boxes so clearly and openly which is why it felt tedious to me instead of just a flowing naturallytold story it was a scattershot of references to sects of barbie fans and people she admires and current talking points and all corners of her instagram feed and it wanted you to know that she was keeping you in mind it just felt exhausting like a cavalcade of placation and i could really feel it throughout for two hours instead of getting lost in a deeply compelling story or characters,2023-07-28 19:16:54
"totally agree i wrote this to another comment above but the overwhelming scattershot of themes and dilution of message reminds me this analogy

if i throw a tennis ball at you youll catch the ball but if i throw 50 tennis balls at you youll catch none of them",2023-07-28 19:39:14
because men are constantly shamed for  and their bodies ,2023-07-29 13:22:34
clearly,2023-07-29 09:23:57
same am a man and found zero man hate in the film self empowerment across the board seemed to be the theme,2023-07-29 02:24:44
there’s loads of malice  the movie portrays men as morons in the wrong women are portrayed sympathetically whatever shots the movie takes at men and women it takes the shots at men with lead and the shots at women with a water pistol if at all,2023-07-29 03:06:44
you’ve got me on speed dial lol,2023-07-29 03:05:15
"lol you just did write an entire essay you essentially recalled the plot and the obvious attempted themes did your think people didn’t get this stuff they did your not seeing anything that wasn’t obvious

the problem is in the midst of that gerwig choose to write all the kens and men as morons and moral failures in comparison to women and barbie so the movie can have a message of her version of gender equality  but also be totally bigoted against men in its stylistic execution which really outweighs the message 
also the whole thing of barbie needing to lecture ken on how to find himself is deeply patronising and only a feminist would consider that a good ending",2023-08-02 18:26:24
meant misandrist,2023-08-02 16:54:56
"the kens arent dumb and emotionally stunted because they are just  doing bad stuff 

theyre dumb and emotionally stunted because little girls barely play with them beyond only being a companion to barbie those girls are playing with them how the gender roles of how men are supposed to act 

theyre not emotionally complex or struggle with issues because for years the idea of men acknowledging their mental health issues and emotions was considered not masculine 

theyre just ken they only exist to be pretty companions to barbie nothing more sound familiar 

thats why the kens in the movie are the way they are little girls playing with then based on their gender role expectation its something the film directly criticizes both women and men of

when you played with gi joes or power rangers or whatever action figures as a kid how much enotional connection did you give to the female action figures or were they just there to be pretty and be companions and nothing else",2023-08-02 17:39:47
even then its surface level stuff lots of others have already said,2023-08-03 20:10:09
i liked amélie,2023-09-17 08:28:25
interesting thanks for your input and is this all actually verbalized by others like do people nowadays actually criticize you like this for whatever you do if so is it coming from both genders or one more than the other,2023-12-21 15:55:05
isnt that exactly what they said in the movie thats the deprogramming understanding that people will say things but they shouldnt affect who you are or what you want to be,2024-02-01 11:06:42
the media illiterate masses dont seem to be picking up on that though and its had the opposite effect inciting division between genders,2023-07-22 22:04:31
not at all it’s the exact same thing well i guess women can be expecting that in the future since it’s apparently ok ala the barbie movie,2023-07-27 06:02:44
maybe i did care to enlighten i believe i saw the whole thing they end by denying ken a sc seat which doesnt reflect the current world,2023-07-27 08:13:54
yeah that really felt gross like these supposedly strong capable women became doormats in skimpy outfits with no resistance thats not giving women much credit,2023-08-10 05:57:46
"if this movie was supposed to be an allegory or even a mirror to real world society that’s one of the ways that it fell flat for me

its mostly a fantastic escapist movie the real world is like when the tyranosaur escaped into the city in the lost world i dont know why every woman led movie has to check all the boxes instead of just being plain entertaining and fun",2023-08-10 11:28:44
"i actually hated that scene the 2nd half of the movie felt all over the place and suddenly im stuck in what feels like a one woman show maybe it wouldnt have been as jarring if they cut it short or maybe just filmed it without having her give a speech directly to the audience it just felt so long and there wasnt really a lot of investment in her or her daughters character to care they really felt like they were horseshoed into the script  and i get the 2 werent the point behind the speech but it was just sudden and right at your face it was jarring to say the least 

honestly the mom and daughter didnt need to be in the movie and they made it fairly cringy",2023-08-10 10:41:52
relax lol it was a joke holy ,2023-08-10 12:11:16
thats the point they dont really care about equality but theyre willing to try and appease the kens by acting like theyre working towards it its an allegory,2023-07-22 20:36:44
movie has its flaws ofcourse but i think in the end its all about money so down the years we might be seeing barbie 2 where its built upon more or maybe i am wrong and its actually ,2023-07-23 11:45:07
"exactly it completely feels like they lost their own message somewhere along the way that is exactly what the movie is establishing 


and i agree if the movie was deep and was actually holding up a mirror to our society and saying look we fooled you into supporting an oppressive force and siding with the enemy that would be interesting but if you read the comments here a vast majority of people are leaving celebrating the ending which then begs the question is that what they actually intended and also how effective or good is your movie if your audience missed the point",2023-07-22 19:42:22
theyre not vindictive or vengeful theyre just a product of a society where they have always been in power they dont have the same sympathy for ken that stereotypical barbie does because they dont have the capacity for the depth of emotion that she does theyre not supposed to be people with people like feelings and motivations theyre dolls,2023-07-22 20:41:27
oh my  am i a ken am i kenough,2023-07-24 08:14:10
except they were already like that before ken brought patriarchy to them that means it was barbieworld society what made them extremely codependent on their barbie which is what barbie exploited,2023-07-24 10:10:35
yep and if they have a problem with the gender inequality in barbieland we should strive to make sure gender equality is actually what we are trying to achieve not replacing the old power regime with a new one or fail to see the root of the problem just because the messaging isa bit rough and involves lashing out and i say that as a woman and a feminist overall the movies messaging was a bit heavyhanded in some ways but i think it can be thoughtprovoking for both men  women,2023-07-25 03:19:59
no they get it but a lot of people want a barbie movie to have a good ending not end like a dystopian sci fi just to make a point it would be like if the flinstones live action movie from the 90’w had of ended with fred and wilma divorced and dinosaurs destroying their home to make a point or something of course a lot of people will be like ,2023-07-25 03:20:41
"i’m saying i don’t even like what the narrator said there

yeah im pretty sure thats the feeling the director was shooting for

if you dont like the implications of that line you should probably examine what part you can play in changing how those implications play out irl

if and when our real world is ever properly equal then by the movies barbieworldismirroworld logic the kens will have a perfectly equal place in the legal system",2023-07-25 02:58:33
"that didn’t end with ken and barbie not together

ken realizing that he doesnt need to define himself things he has or by his partner probably the biggest part of the happy ending to his arc and getting together with barbie at the end would go against that point

i’ll feeling about men even though it’s defended as a clever satire

im a wellbearded dude and at no point did i feel the movie was directing ill feelings at my kind if you felt like you were being badly portrayed that might say something about character traits in the movie you identify with and that could be worth examining further

one major leg of the movies themes is that men are also subject to conflicting expectations that can wreck them just as badly 

the kens were never evil even when they were in control of barbieworld they were moreorless just following along with what they felt they were expected to do in patriarchy of which they only ever had a surface level understanding brought back by ken  just the same as what the barbies were doing no ken ever tied them down and subjected them to a brainwashing session or anything

things like the ceo turning out to be genuinely looking to put female empowerment over profits despite all the earlier lol old rich guys caring about women yeah right jokes or him wanting to hug people more

or ken realizing it was okay to let his emotions out and cry or to not want to be in charge those are a few examples of men in the movie breaking out of what they felt was expected of them by society as they understood it",2023-07-25 04:15:04
ken and barbie would have never gotten together ken has always been an extension of barbie an accessory of sorts and to have them end up together would be antithetical to the very nature of barbie she is whatever she wants to be or dress up as and ken is always her boyfriend never her husband what does ending up with ken do for barbie,2023-07-25 05:24:04
thats a very good point,2023-07-25 11:09:55
i was a 12 year old girl less than a decade ago 12 year old girls can understand metaphors,2023-07-25 02:48:33
"i see your point but at the same time the film’s lack of subtlety made it come across as generic and artificial sometimes almost like greta was held back from creating something genuinely powerful and complex because she was forced by mattel to simplify everything

greta’s movies are incredibly feminist and that genuineness that you’d expect from her was sort of…missing in barbie the message is important powerful and necessary but the seeming lack of care in it’s delivery made it feel a little hollow but i don’t at all blame greta gerwig i more blame mattel greta is better than what she served up here she has a much more unique and powerful voice than this film would lead you to believe and i truly believe that mattel compromised the vision and that sucks",2023-07-25 11:50:26
nah i think it was deeper too the messaging had to be obvious enough for the kids a little too heavy handed for me but i cant deny that it wasnt thoughtprovoking i  an adult woman went with my father and we both thought so,2023-07-25 03:23:28
"i feel like the point of that final barbieland explicit no to equality scene was to setup the dont worry the kens will work hard and become equal to womens position irl line

if a watcher feels like women have a 100 equal place at the table that line should indicate a perfect landing for ken after the movie ends

if a watcher feels like women irl have a rawer deal than theyd like to see ken end up with then thats a probably conversation worth having and im pretty convinced thats what the director was going for",2023-07-25 08:09:11
"then at the end when the barbies regain complete control of barbie world is the audience supposed to feel happy that the barbies have barbie world back or sad because they represent the patriarchy 

the men dont feel needed in the end barbie rejects ken i cant remember 1 scene where it put across a men are needed message",2023-07-22 19:40:07

however im not aware that the phrase is tied to any particular movement or cause either in spain or latin  america",2023-08-01 10:57:50
"i agree with this

i don’t find it funny when people reference or compare things to the potato famine as someone of irish ancestors it almost downplays  how awful and devastating it was  the oppression they went through 

i didn’t like that comment and it didn’t sit well with them there’s a million other things to compare the barbie’s not having defenses to the kens other than what it was compared to",2023-08-01 01:27:11
agree barbie isnt about racism or colonialism makes it even harder to swallow the smallpox line out of the blue poc are included because there are barbies besides stereotypical barbie humorous she calls herself that in the fantasy land were shown theres no racism no racism shown in the real world either,2023-07-31 21:15:41
"yeah the kens being useless accessories struck me as a joke about how actual reallife ken dolls are accessories to the barbie doll and it’s funny to imagine one of these dolls finding out real men aren’t like that and going way over the top in response i do not understand how anybody could watch that and think it’s somehow supposed to represent real men except only tangentially and humorously as with the guitar and financial strategy jokes and whatnot 

these people could watch dr strangelove and get furious at it because they think it’s pronuclear war",2023-07-25 16:38:53
third act of the movie feels like it disconnected from the actual movie and just did its own thing,2023-08-03 04:31:23
right i thought the same because they show the mojo dojo casa houses selling like hotcakes but never address how the barbies turned that around on real life,2023-08-03 23:47:01
exactly  you would think it would have made more sense for gloria to help barbie from the real world,2023-08-03 04:32:49
because she was adjusting to reality going into the experience she was convinced that they had fixed some of the social problems she experienced once she adjusted over the second half of the film and it clicked for her during her speech to ken at the end that she needed to find out who she actually was deep down i thought it was very well done,2023-08-07 02:12:37
" she wanted to stay and only started struggling when glorias issues started to be forced on her 

this scene lol",2023-08-07 02:38:52
"i very much hate the matrix pill knockoffs ngl and even more all the pretentious metaphors that are shoehorned into the original movie but this was really spot on 

it was even more ironically onthenose since shes not leaving a dull imperfect world but some kind of literal heaven",2023-08-07 12:14:00
"the whole film of course not 

the first part when she starts to become more selfaware than the average doll its the same",2023-08-07 10:28:51
groundhog day refers to the eponymous film wherein the protagonist relives the same day again and again like how barbie lives the same day again and again in the introduction until she has thoughts about death,2023-08-07 01:50:58
"it means whenever a character wakes up every day being the same day 

to be fair this is a bit of a variation of the original version its more like that they dont parse the issue rather than being oblivious to the event happening in the first place and you could technically count the time progressing anyway theres not much of a point when you are living in an infinite utopia that resets and provides you with whatever need 

then now that you make me think to it for as much as the paradoxes of immortality or of the gilded cage or the even older allegory of the cave barbie is living in her own fictitious dimension so unlike your average truman burbank that resides in actual dirty reality maybe you could imagine her world so overall perfect and pristine that theres not even a reason for her to doubt or assume there is more in the first place 

but anyway once you excuse the starting plot device it goes back to the usual trope once you see the real supposedly firstorder universe you dont want to go back to the accessory one in this case theres possibly the metaphor between trophy wifeys happy to live in the shadow and at the dependence of their breadwinners instead of taking their life by the balls but maybe im stretching the plot too much here",2023-08-07 02:31:25
dont remind me of that pile of garbage that was season 8,2023-08-11 13:38:21
i think it also was just a realistic touch the barbies went all out to get all the power why give it up women are human beings just like men it shows that people get  to the status quo that even though they might have an inkling that something is wrong in the end it will take a lot more time for things to truly progress so until then the kens would just be happy with some robes,2023-08-08 22:32:10
true and i am sure there are more toy versions of barbie than are ken but they were very loose with continuity in the film,2023-08-07 20:58:52
"i agree with your take to me it paralleled rbgs attack on gender discrimination when she was an attorney she started by going after one of the very very few laws that favored women a tax deduction for caregiving was not available for unmarried men the government argued that many many laws differentiated between men and woman and allowedmandated different treatment so how could this one little tax statute be unconstitutional if it is they all are   
and the court agreed with the government in a way even though rgb won the case she used their list to systematically attack the unconstitutional laws  


anyway i feel like barbie was similar because it centered kenmen and their experience at the end because it is the only way to get kenmen to understand the unfairness similar to how youll hear that a man wouldnt do x to women because he wouldnt want someone to do x to his daughterwifemotheretc not treating a woman fairly because it is the right thing to do and that woman is her own whole person who deserves fairness  treating a woman fairly because that woman is some other mans daughteretc and no one wants their daughteretc treated unfairly we have to make it about them because they dont care unless it touches them it happens in other areas too  so a humanity issue not caring about parental leave policies until you have a kid etc being antiabortion until your 14 year old is pregnant etc  


i think i liked the movie for what it was and it seems like others wanted it to be a different moviehave a different message but really im not sure i think it was well done it made me cry it make me laugh im a man without power does that make me a woman but it made me so deeply sad sad that it is a reflection of our world a realistic one sad that this is the way things are sad about the backlash also maybe a reason people are disappointed in it considering the backlash i assumed it would have a more radical message because some do consider it a radical message i dont know i need to think on it more",2023-08-09 19:02:44
"precisely if the movie tied everything up neatly audiences say “how nice” leave the theater and nothing changes

if theres still tension unresolved the conversation continues after the lights have come on",2023-08-09 11:25:02
yeah that was deftly handled like its not gonna be a light switch and the kens get equality hopefully forcing people to consider the way women are still treated today,2023-08-10 06:00:38
i think it was a smash bros reference for sure,2023-07-22 16:11:34
really depends on the criticism,2023-07-23 00:50:48
tbf all the barbies have nice big houses while the kens dont appear to have any place to sleep,2023-07-23 14:31:31
"i’m saying this as a woman — 

barbie continually steam rolled ken’s need for validation and independence at no point in the beginning did she ever encourage him to find himself she led him on because of the attention  and had no intention on sharing any aspect of her life or power in society with him 

reverse the genders and you get men who treat women as long distance low commitment girlfriends ken only acted the same way barbie treated him — boys night every night was an example of that

the whole point is that no one should be compromising their individual autonomy to be someone’s accessory — which tends to happen in very patriarchal and in barbie lands case matriarchal societies

i felt the whole message of the movie was to try to make people see that we still have a long way to go with the patriarchy and that the real goal isn’t a matriarchy which ben shapiros small brain thinks is the end goal but rather a system with equal opportunities for both",2023-07-23 17:08:43
calm down bro it’s a comment about a persons review trying to apply real world logic to a movie about a doll,2023-07-22 11:42:06
mattel the corporation who brainwashed women young girls and the whole barbie world into tacitly accepting patriarchal hegemony gets off scott free in the end remind me again how that’s a bold creative decision on their end,2023-07-31 18:35:09
why are you doing this,2023-07-22 10:11:49
"you just proved my point 

before the movie ken and barbie are a cute toy couple having fun enjoying fashion and exploring careers and lifestyles

this movie ken will get all equal position of power eventually

like who asked for this",2023-07-22 13:29:31
"he thinks being his boyfriend is his purpose so he keeps trying even tho he keeps getting rejected at the end he understands that he doesnt have to be with her to be himself to the fullest

berbie is the one telling him but it couldve been anyone or like for barbie he couldve realised it by himself but its logical for him to hear it from the person he is the closest to him

edit you shouldnt follow your outdated label you should be yourself whatevers written on the box you are born into",2023-08-30 20:50:55
in matriarchy the kens dont act like theyre entitled to the attention of the barbies and are otherwise oppressed by,2023-07-22 06:18:13
"they basically rebuilt a flawed system thats a mirror opposite of whatever weve got now in the real world maybe a handful of years backward in time  and i dont think the movie tried to portray that in a this is how it should be kind of way 

i took it as choosing to end on a joke thats supposed to make the audience think a bit about the deeper implications of same position as women having any kind of negative connotation to it at all

that said if barbie world is the opposite of the real world presumably if the real world ever hits true equality so will barbie world thats a good ending right",2023-07-22 06:23:46
but isnt that what is currently happening in society just reflected back at us in barbietinted light,2023-07-22 06:24:36
they basically ended that part of the movie on a good end note from any inspirational historical movie about women gaining rights or being the first woman in some nontraditional position i dont think that was an accident and i dont think the barbies were supposed to be seen as in the right for setting things up the way they did,2023-07-22 06:24:49
"he just talked about why he didnt like the movie he didnt say she shouldnt have like it 

im a feminist and i thought they could have done better yes we all get that kens were in the same position as women in the real world but when theyre trying to vote or gain some rights or whatever and you paint them as  there was no consistency in the narrative is what i mean if its a reverse of the real world and barbie has been to the real world and knows how bad women have it she should understand how bad kens have it in barbieland which she sort of does at the end but not fully the character of margot robbie understands but the movie as a whole ignores it which is what i mean by no consistency",2023-07-28 17:46:52
"the thing that confuses me is that they couldve used ken fighting for respect in barbielands matriarchy as an allegory of real life feminism

instead they went for him ruining barbielands utopia with patriarchy story which makes no sense as barbieland was supposed to be a reversepatriarcal  to begin with

its like a man directing a movie on how feminism is bad women are sent back to the kitchen and everybody is happy in the end

i still had a lot of fun though",2023-07-28 12:57:28

to be honest i feel like none of that was conveyed well at all and having america’s thoughts leak into barbie’s raises way more questions than that plot point is worth,2023-07-28 18:17:33
are they implying until then only children play with barbies,2023-07-29 06:30:18
would you mind commenting on what nuances you got about allan that i missed all i got was heres a levelheaded softspoken but less insecure man in a world of kens who never falls prey to toxic masculinity but look again hes also a secret badass who can fight really well lol whodathunkit,2023-07-28 15:47:14
so kinda george of the jungle but pink,2023-07-29 07:24:58

"i loved her monologue it was the one part of the movie where i was like ‘wait a second’ that’s deep lol i wished there was more gloria and her daughter resolving their issues

like why was the mom sad to begin with why was the relationship with her daughter at such a rift the mom played with barbie and made her sad but then it’s just glossed over",2023-07-27 16:31:10
i mean it starts at the beginning when barbie starts to think about death and get cellulite  thats when her journey begins  a doll beginning to conceptualize age  at first she rejects it and then she meets the older lady on the bench then the ghost in mattel both changing her mind a little bit about age  both modeling grace and beauty at old age which barbie has never witnessed before but seems to appreciate  and she gets to see the impact she made on the mother and she gets to see the spectrum of growth and humanity via the ghost at the end  i dunno from my perspective that theme was earned and executed well enough the clues were there,2023-07-27 17:42:43
thanks bro 3,2023-07-28 09:02:44
"not the person you asked but i can answer your question 
no i would not feel like i have less value as a person 

no one else can give you value or purpose in life if you don’t find it in yourself and the things that people feel give them value will change from person to person 

some people just don’t enjoy being around others i’m finding this more and more true for myself i’ve never felt more lonely than when i’ve been in relationships 
i enjoy my alone time and when i need human interaction i talk to friends or hang out online 

i had a breakup in the middle of covid and it forced me to be single for a while it gave me time to recognize the patterns in my dating life that were leading me to be unhappy it also helped me realize that i just don’t enjoy being in relationships much it’s entirely possible that’ll change some day but if it doesn’t i’m perfectly content",2023-07-27 14:10:14

i am in a very happy long term relationship currently i love being in a relationship i cant speak for anyone else but my problem was that i felt worthless because i didnt have a girlfriend like the fact i didnt have a partner meant my life and my opinions and my interests werent valuable i didnt love myself at all and derived all of my value and self esteem from my partner it was essentially very low self esteem which caused problems in other areas of my life that made it more difficult to have a romantic partner in the first place i am still working in therapy but i feel much more content today than i did 2 years ago",2023-07-28 09:00:51
barbieland is already shifting from becoming a matriarchy at the end with the kens starting to work their way up to govt positions theres also no way you forgot about the narrator explicitly pointing out how barbieland was an inverse of the real world which pretty obviously points out how a total matriarchy as presented in barbieland is wrong,2023-08-22 23:51:33

nah i think he was the only male in barbieland that understood he should be who he really is which is allan not another ken

he knew that that patriarchy was wrong so he fought it with the barbies",2023-07-23 20:50:50
exactly if you find the ending unfair to ken you must understand how unfair it is for the women,2023-07-23 21:27:53
it wouldve been better than the gender war  that has virtually no relation to barbie,2023-07-26 06:34:33
the theme of the movie is that life is inherently uncomfortable to deal with so we invent ideas like barbie and the patriarchy to make it easier to deal with the patriarchy is a theory not a truth life being complicated is the truth,2023-07-27 13:25:29
"i dont identify with women predators that does not mean i can not see that they get away with crimes more than men 

men get alot of  these days and just because i am not the one who gives them  i am not going to pretend it does not happen",2023-07-27 16:33:15
"i’ve always understood the movie it’s not anything special or clever like you think it is it’s just that the overall portrayal of men vs women pushes it into man hating territory but just aside from that forgetting the message it’s not very well written  a whole lot of inconsistencies happen there’s mixed messages because of ken representing different things the jokes are lame “muh ” ends the movie  and not in a good way but your meant to overlook that because apparently the movie isn’t serious  yet it’s also super serious with an incredible message and satire so think deeply about it lol

you just can’t imagine that this movie isn’t very good people who don’t like it do understand it and some people want really want it to be genius because “ it’s greta gerwigs feminist barbie” when in reality it’s badly written the man hating and message makes it a 010 for me but if i overlook that and focus purely on movie i really couldn’t go any higher than 510 and that’s mainly because it looks good and the casting is really good",2023-07-29 03:01:35
as a kid i didnt play with ken actually i didnt know what to do with him he sat on the sidelines didnt realize that was the universal experience with ken until seeing the movie made me smile,2023-07-30 17:54:31
he’s been her boyfriend this whole “ken was an accessory with no job” thing is just social media bs pushed for the movie in reality they brought out president ken and first lady barbie pilot ken and flight attendant barbie doctor ken and nurse barbie  all before barbie was ever president doctor or pilot,2023-07-30 18:37:04
"which is wrong  they gave them less power than women have in the real world  the kens are 1 step above where they were before but where they were before were literally not even people  

how do you figure they were not even people 

there are 4 women on the supreme court and one has been on it for 40 years  barbieland is a shadow of the us not saudi arabia

hmmm lets see the supreme court was first instated back in 1789 the first woman was appointed 200 years later  in 1980 even though they were being considered as early as the 1930s there have been what 115117 supreme court justices in history about 107 of those were white men 
so considering the kens just started being considered for positions of power id say the portrayal is pretty accurate im sure a ken will be appointed to the supreme court in the next 50 years or so too bad there hasnt been a female president though i guess kens will have to wait a bit longer for that",2023-07-31 04:51:08
in the real world did the president just appoint 4 women to the supreme court immediately,2023-07-31 14:08:46
"amen bruh 

but seriously that was very well said",2023-07-31 06:00:07
"exactly when i said they literally made full circle thats what i meant to say but you put it way better the main barbie came back to ken land and got the same treatment that kens had been getting since barbieland was a thing this as said by other people is a direct call out to the real world kind of saying that men would break down into tears if the were treated like women are 

but like does it have to be that way did the barbies really have to take the worst possible approach to this and just say because you treated us badly instead of resolving our issues now that we know how it feels to be treated like that we will now treat you badly",2023-07-31 11:08:39
my sweetie is really into comics and we both burst out laughing at that part,2023-08-06 02:34:49
uhh thats rather complex i think the joke is that she was thinking more like a man or was influenced by men so she cared about the zack snyder cut,2023-08-05 08:34:13
"what i noticed about that scene was that barbie apologized as she should have whereas ken did not  

and ken kept ignoring her constant no’s to continue to try to date her  

this is a nearly universal female experience dudes ignoring the no throwing a tantrum because they want you and you should just change your mind because they are whining about it in the real world the tantrums over being told “no” turn into physical violence far too often anytime is too often 

so no this isn’t for you it’s about an experience women have on the regular of having to manage the emotions of men who can’t handle being rejected romantically 

it’s not for you",2023-07-30 02:46:38
"thats not the message of the movie at all i see you commenting all over this thread with your bad take and your bad analogy and people keep telling you its wrong maybe try genuinely understanding what people are telling you and why you are so personally upset about it   

a big issue with gender issues nowadays is 100 the fact that women are breaking the chain of the old gender roles and redefining themselves and men push back see the rise of andrew tate and similar harmful preachers the movie and real life encourages men who are now unbalanced due to the lack of role in social settings to find a new way of being new role models not defined by their connection to women  

barbies in barbieland at the beginning of the movie do not care for kens kens are just there barbies are living their best lives with their sisters and dont bother with kens that much which is not nice mind you but it makes sense because as a child you played with barbies and you probably had that one lonely ken and thats it  something you would know if you had experienced that in your life   

as soon as kens take over they sexualize barbies and want them around to feel as foils and mirrors of their existence kens are also supposedly living their best lives but that includes humiliating barbies and keeping them around as glorified pets for their egos   the crux of gender roles is in that obsession cant you just find your place in the world and leave us alone we do just fine without you 

this is not insulting or offensive this is what women had to do with every wave of feminism fight to become their own independent entity that wasnt tied by law or by norm to their fathers bothers husbands this is not being antimen this is world history relying on the subjugation of women that happened and its still happening in nonwestern countries its life its real    

i am sure you guys can find a minute or two to think about everything find a bit of empathy within yourselves and realise that being asked by a toy movie not catered for you to stop defining your whole sense of worth on the mirror provided by women is the way to go",2023-07-30 10:04:27
"the barbies aren’t smarter than the kens no one in barbieland is ‘smart’ it’s about power and lack thereof the reallife doll’s existence informs the barbieland dynamic of barbie being ‘everything’ and ken essentially just existing as an accessory for her

it’s a reversal of the adam  eve myth which takes places in a fantasy land every bit as imaginary as barbieland yet has been used as justification of real women’s supposed inferiority for centuries you root for the barbies not because genderbased oppression is good but because it’s cathartic to see that inverse of the reality we all live with 

anyone—men and women—that truly wants gender equality and sees how far we are from that in the real world should enjoy seeing a little bit of balance brought to the big screen",2023-07-30 06:16:48
yeah but the whole real world to barbie doll connection is real vague  and it all happens so randomly and america ferrara just goes to barbieland meanwhile her very angsty daughter does a complete 180 and goes to barbieland,2023-07-29 21:47:38
i thought they werent going to bring her back at all and were just going to leave her in the box forever,2023-07-30 05:49:07
 right so funny ,2023-07-21 12:50:02
i’m just kinda thinking you’re not thinking about this deep enough the bplot about ken wasn’t intended to instill value in men the kens in a writing sense were meant to be an insert for the “female love interest character” in man focused media ken being solely dependent on barbie was meant as a commentary on the damsel in action flicks who can’t exist without the “big strong man” it had that feel to me while taking meaningful and funny jabs at the “manosphere”,2023-07-22 16:59:31
"yeah but like i said the pressure isn’t from men and it sure as  isn’t from the patriarchy  so it felt weird and dishonest to include in a bit which was about bringing down the patriarchy  without “patriarchy” there will be much worse pressure for working women 
the movie lays a whole lot of  women feel pressure used by at the feet of men when they have nothing to do with it",2023-07-29 19:08:19
"exactly  this is what this article gets completely wrong it’s not about ken or barbie it’s about living in a world where toxic masculinity hurts everyone and there are no easy answers and it’s not a zerosum game no matter what the gamemakers say

"it’s a big deal because usually big studios rarely take big swings

as big as eeao was it was not unique for a24 to take the swing

while the concept is familiar i feel the execution does stand out the way the film approaches its themes humor and visuals is unique compared to something like the lego movie 

i think it’s heartening that wb is distributing a movie that has two women that represent concepts of femininity speaking to each other about death in a barbie movie produced by mattel",2023-07-21 15:22:13
i’ve read some decent criticism of the film here so obviously there are genuine people but it’s crazy that every time i log in and check this post there are so many repetitive generic comments and claims that their wife andor daughter disliked the film,2023-07-22 12:22:41
"no one plays with ken enough to have a weird ken and he has painted on hair you cant mess it up ken is an accessory hes not even a fun accessory 

barbies reflect the girls playing with them which is why barbies reflect different body types or sometimes she has a wherlchair etc kens reflect the girlplayingwithbarbies  desire for barbie to have a boyfriend or iceslatingpartner shaped accessory for her adventures some barbies come with a dog which is kind of the same the little girl is still projecting herself onto her doll not onto any of the other stuff this is not a reflection of men and women in reality 

so no ken does not need to be plus sized i cant believe this needs to be explained to you",2023-07-23 13:16:34
no worries i felt like it was showing that being a human and a female is complicated beautiful and yet simple and pure it might have spoke to men and women differently but that part made me pretty emotional but that’s the beauty of movies and stories they’re different for everyone,2023-07-24 02:52:33
"i havent seen any reference to the line that likened the dolls reaction to the patriarchy akin to the native americans reaction to european diseases none of them had any built in resistance to it

none of them

they were all victims

playing with the idea would any of the kens have been able to have been deprogramed im guessing there was a throwaway line as to why they would only try with the barbies but i missed it",2023-07-24 19:26:19
"i feel like the creators had a collection of their favourite ideas for a barbie movie and then did whatever they could to include all of them in the one movie so i generally had a great time and enjoy lots of individual pieces but if i look at the movie as a whole  it’s messy 

like will ferrel ceo and execs had general evil guy vibes but there was no clear threat the only thing they did was want to put barbie in a box which would send her back to barbieland instead she runs away bumps into mother and daughter and they travel back to barbieland…",2023-07-24 23:26:20
it will be remembered forever but so will batman’s bat ,2023-07-25 03:34:34
"i wouldnt say barbie is the villain she is a product of her environment as have been all people in history both barbie and ken were entirely unaware of any ethical issues within their society until they were confronted with new information both of them drew faulty conclusion based on this new information and while ken overcorrected barbie tried to reverse everything to the previous status quo then to patch the newly developed disconnect barbie agreed to implement incremental changes to this status quo

nearly every significant social revolution follows a similar pattern most of the time the oppressed or wronged groups dont manage to stage fullon governmental revolutions but they often try to overcorrect the social wrongs are then met by strong counter movements by the establishment and finally are being granted small but successive improvements

nobody has to be evil in this its just how humans work",2023-07-27 01:21:53
because barbie isn’t the villain men and patriarchy are the villains it’s not an equal comparison of the domination of both genders being bad if it was barbies would have been portrayed as more obviously bad in the way real world men and the kendom was,2023-07-27 03:20:07
"yikes dude we  on christian movies for being preachy and literally monologuing but this somehow okay what happened to subtlety what happened to naturally integrating it into the story what happened to less is more do the rules of storytelling just go out the window when youve got an important message the speech literally grinded the movie to a halt

protip if you want your important message to be not just be heard but taken seriously you cannot be preachy about it no one likes it especially the people youre trying to change otherwise youre just preaching to the choir if anything its counter productive",2023-08-01 16:43:52
"it portrays all male characters and kens as doofuses who need correcting in their ways the whole message to men isn’t even one they need it’s one feminist women have decided they need men on the whole don’t get their entire self worth from women any more than women do it’s natural to derive some self worth from your partner or family if that is what you want out of life

the whole positive message to men is you can cry more and find yourself and you don’t need to attach yourself to women for self worth problem is that’s not actually something 95 of men care about and they have no desire to cry more or whatever feminist women have just decided that men care about that and it’s bothering them even though actually they don’t care at all for the most part and that message is presented in a movie where all men are morons so it’s a condescending message for men men don’t even need delivered in a package which insults them

even a small side character who had nothing to do with sexism like gloria’s husband is mocked for no real reason i think one excersise to do to find out if something is sexist and bigoted is to reverse the genders and see if it’s acceptable would a male heroic character who mocked his wife learning a language and then laughed about some cooler old girlfriend be seen as a good guy would that go unnoticed

"you can honour women without being anti man can’t you i obviously expected it to be female orientated but i didn’t except so much bashing of men as a whole

i feel like the whole kenough thing was more of a feminist woman’s idea of what is good for men rather than actually honouring men i mean when ken is kenough what has really happened he’s become powerless again is crying because barbie doesn’t like him and barbie had to explain life to him like he’s a  that’s honouring men errr ok",2023-08-01 05:31:57

it is also clear that the mom is a creative person but works in a uncreative position at a soulless job this is resolved again when her daughter encourages her art and she successfully pitches a new doll idea normal barbie which contrasts with stereotypical barbie that we watched all movie struggle with the expectations set upon her by society one of the studio execs mentions this will be a financial success would have been nice to see gloria get a promotion or something but i guess her just getting some praise is more true to the real world being underappreciated at the office",2023-07-25 02:32:08

lol oh my how very stereotypically sexist of you,2023-07-29 03:51:24
no i didn’t want either but for the plot to make the point about one gender dominating society being a bad thing the barbies had to be the villains at the start if they were going to portray the patriarchy and the ken patriarchy as bad things which they did otherwise the messaging just comes off that women are better being in charge and just generally better,2023-07-21 18:44:34
the question still stands did the marketing for this really make it out to be some classic piece of cinema sounds like it’s just a goofy fun movie with some life lessons sprinkled in there which still seems like a better movie than any live action depiction of a child’s toy should be,2023-07-21 13:11:48

there was so much more potential with the real world however when they got back to barbieland and ken had introduced patriarchy i thought maybe this is going to be a really good direction it was so entertaining but just ended up being a time consumer that didn’t allow for things to develop like the motherdaughter relationship and the mother’s connection with barbie it was really funny how they incorporated all the things the barbies did to distract the kens but that overall scene could’ve been more clever i just wish we knew what the main plot line was and it had a complete resolution then she becomes human and i’m confused because i didn’t realize that was even an option she was going have,2023-07-24 23:53:05
yes the culture shock of the real world scenes were hilarious definitely could have added more of those and that could’ve covered other societal issues as well idk things just needed to be more cohesive,2023-07-24 23:01:44

" but the construction guys catcalling barbie isnt really a thing anymore thats like 90s and 00s behavior

the central theme of this movie is about the experience of being a woman in the modern world 

now if they just showed you exactly whats going on in a vacuum youre going to see that experience through your own perceptionfilters and you wont actually get the what does it feel like thing

the only real option for getting around this is exaggeration thats what satire is often about

the film isnt saying every single construction worker is going to use the same pickup line youve heard a thousand times on you its saying this happens and has shaped who i am as a woman and how i perceive others around me 

the film is undeniably selfaware and is not at all trying to depict the realworld exactly as it exists will farrells character makes that clear

the film is trying to condense part of the experience of being a woman into about 2 hours of screen time so it makes it clear that 1 this is not to scale and 2 we know it is not to scale thats part of the artistic statement",2023-07-21 13:50:12

men and the kens were just  and doing bad things  there is almost no movies like that from any era potraying women as a whole gender that way or men until now and you’re defending that

yepmy bad for engaging in your troll misogynistic bait  i saw it and couldnt help myself  i should have known,2023-07-21 11:39:01
"ive got to disagree with you again here i think its great that it was ken who had to do the self discovery to realize its not the validation of others or barbie that makes him who he is and thus powerful because the root of patriarchy and toxic masculinity stems from men so it should be ken who goes on that journey to liberate himself from whatever causes him to want barbies validation so much we feel that kens journey overshadows barbies because his one is easier to relate to on the surface level

for barbie however her own issues are a bit more nuanced and forces viewers to accept that sometimes its okay to just be you and the characters throughout the film repeatedly tell barbie she doesnt need to be someone because shes perfect the way she is her personal issue was that she didnt know who she was if she wasnt someone so she quite literally went on a journey to discover what that is its harder for viewers to relate to this because most of us wont even touch on the surface level of who am iwhat is my purpose

kens character benefits from being the comedic juxtaposition to barbies turmoil we pan between scenes of barbie discovering the real world in a serious way then to ken enjoying the benefits of being a man in the real world we instantly see ken as the funny part of the film and it carries through right until the end so we end up rooting for him more than the main character this is pretty common in any film with a comedic side character so its understandable that a lot of people feel the same way as you did",2023-07-22 22:32:01

"the barbies are the bad guys in the same way that men in real life are the bad guys they exist in a system that prioritized them even if they do want equality they arent gonna just give half of all positions to the oppressed gender theyre just gonna give them the opportunities to earn it

when women were allowed to have more power in the judicial system they didnt just give half the supreme court seats to women instead they let women be judges in the first place and let them work their way up just like the men did is that how to fix inequality no not really because they arent acknowledging that women start at a disadvantage in the first place but thats how progress works in the real world anything else would seem unfair on the surface level i mean look at how people react to affirmative action and diversity hires 

thats why the patriarchy is so insidious and hard to let go of even though a lot of men do want equality between the sexes the point is that you cant undo inequality overnight even with good intentions its meant to be satire  i dont think youre suppose to idolize barbieland youre meant to see it as a mirror to the real world thats why the narrator explicitly said that one day the kens will have the same rights that women have in the real world",2023-08-02 01:14:18

that part of the movie was very obvious political statement about our current magaqanon issue not about gender w jan 6 being about 2 years ago it maybe wasn’t at the forefront of your mind but a good chunk of the movie was about the type of toxic power cults men form,2023-07-21 22:48:41

"i think thats the thing i cant stop chewing on the movie does a pretty good job of showing how patriarchy doesnt just damage women it can hurt men as well two things that come to mind allan continuing to be disrespected and gosling ken admitting that he did t even like the position he put himself in he just liked horses but he felt the burden of maintaining the role created by patriarchy i thought were both interesting issues to shine a light on but even though it goes out of the way to show how the womenempower people are hurt by it they dont show how the womenempowered people understand the issues of the mennonempowered people whichi know it doesnt have to but it seems like the movie went out of its way to set up that payoff and then it didnt if thats a deliberate choice i dont quite understand it

idk it just felt like too much of a downer ending i wasnt surprised by a morally complex ending  barbie trying to figure out what her life should be and being told reality kinda sucks for women tbh gels with what i expected going in but it kinda feels like nobody aside from robbiebarbie learned anything goslingken learned a bit about self actualization i guess loved his shirt at the end that said i am kenough but i didnt really buy into how he got there

again literally every man in it is an idiot doing something wrong and the real world women and barbies are portrayed very differently from that say what you will but there’s clearly a level of anger and bitterness about men in a movie which goes out it’s way to show every member of their gender as a  yet portrays women as competent and sympathetic,2023-07-26 20:20:35

true to be totally honest neither my husband nor i noticed the rating  just took for granted a barbie movie would be okay for her,2023-07-23 09:04:54
yeah but through the movie the barbies are portrayed as competent and clever and literally ever man is an idiot or an idiot and a villain  that’s hardly egalitarian and the mixed messaging with kens being the equivalent of women in barbie land but also of patriachy just made it confusing like we’re meant to hate real world patriachy and root for the women yet we’re meant to root for the barbies to over throw the kens who are the impresses in their world,2023-07-23 14:39:16

"please there is no movie which portrays the entire female gender as badly as the barbie one does for men “it’s satire” is a pretty convenient excuse for what is simply a continuation of the tired sitcom trope of men dumb and women smart and done in this film in a particularly mean spirited way

there is nothing wrong with with casting women or men as simple plot devices in a movie intended for the opposite gender sure as  a lot of films women like like those jane austen adaptions or 50 shades or twilight all feature the same basic broody rich or supernatural guy with the same basic personality it’s not about the lens being sidelined  it’s about the awful portrayal of all men in this film  not just the kens but the real world as well 

marilyn monroe is one person playing a character types  there albane been loads of dumb male characters as well ala homer simpson but saying the way she was portrayed gives women the permission to portray men badly 60 years later for satire is a pretty flimsy excuse

this movie does to men what 40’s racist cartoons does to black people and turns them into a twisted stereotype of a strawman to rag on well i guess men now know that it’s fine to go back to potraying women as complete  or mocking them since it’s apparently fine for women to do that to them and then call it satire",2023-07-26 12:59:16

"i think if you saw this movie and didn’t understand that it’s satire then you kind of missed the point it’s not exactly subtle about it

also apophenia tends to apply to humans seeing patterns in the random or natural not deliberately crafted pieces of art that are literally one big connected story this was a thing that was made for a specific reason by people to convey certain messages not a random assortment of stars that look like they form a shape 

and i struggle to see what “plot holes” you’ve pointed out at all the whole term has be diluted by cinema sins and similar things to go from logical inconsistencies in fiction to “everything wasn’t explained in flawless detail so it’s bad” i found the universe this movie set up being one with no real hard rules about the why and how and instead emphasizing characters and metaphor more than anything to be pretty much consistent all the way through

just because a movie doesn’t tick the pacing box perfectly or the internal logic box just right doesn’t mean it’s bad just trying something else it’s fun to just enjoy the ride sometimes",2023-07-23 05:34:14
yeah i guess you could say for the most part they all are sorta because they have a good arc of learning to be yourself the movie is more about how toxic masculinity can corrupt people than simply saying all men are bad i don’t think there are any evil men in the movie i’m guessing you’re asking if they treat men like they do in ghostbusters 2016 and yeah unfortunately they do treat them as  a lot  i feel like it doesn’t end in a way that feels like men are equal to women because a ken asks to be on the supreme court of dreamland and a barbie says no they have to work their way up to it like women did in the real world,2023-07-21 13:45:26
hes the antagonist rather than the villain,2023-07-21 13:36:39
nah you good there are multiple forms of antagonists and unless they have malicious intent towards the protagonist theyre not considered a villian ken in this film is an allyantagonist he had good intentions of changing how he and other kens are represented in his society but ultimately it caused harm and hurt the barbies it also hurt the kens toxic masculinity however barbie needed kens character as a foil because his actions forced their society to grow and confront the real world,2023-07-22 18:12:33

"im not   i knew what the person was alluding to 

women not being allowed free abortion is not women having less bodily autonomy because men cant have abortion either 

both women and men are not allowed to do whatever they want with their body heck bodily autonomy doesnt actually exist and if you wanna argue that some  has more you need to present a case where men are allowed to do something with their body that women are not",2023-07-22 22:56:24
are men allowed to get an abortion you cannot claim women having less bodily autonomy in the us by using an example men doesnt have either,2023-07-22 22:47:52

the movie seems to have largely resonated with a lot of its target audience certainly did with me its understandable that it wasnt everyones cup of tea",2023-07-24 22:48:41
ok but like just throwing that in doesn’t mean it accomplished that messaging extremely sloppy the kens come back and have an idea of who they want to be and they are squashed down and told that’s not what we expect you to be so you can’t be it so is the message inclusion of all or inclusion of what we expect you to be no different then in the real world when women are relegated to just homemakers etc,2023-07-21 13:28:00
they’re dolls so they don’t have any imperfections that’s why barbie hated her cellulite at first the same way a lot of people hate things they’re unfamiliar with at first out of fear then grow to love them the moment with the old lady was supposed to show character growth,2023-07-23 23:52:38

its also a super generic being a woman is so hard line that ive honestly heard in so many different shows and movies at this point i dunno maybe ive just consumed a lot of feminist media but it felt like a speech written by a 16 year old in 2010 or something,2023-07-26 23:15:04
how can you say this movie was not at all about mortality it was practically the climax of the movie barbie has to make the decision to stay a doll or become human and ruth emphasizes to barbie that humans get just one ending death this is a huge plot point for barbie at the end but it’s seemingly out of nowhere and that’s why it didn’t quite land for me,2023-08-06 03:51:45
i think there is certainly an angle for this movie focusing on cellulite that is more poignant than what we got,2023-08-06 02:25:02
i’m saying it would cool if it was more about how that mortality and the fear of it ties in with why oppressive social constructs like patriarchy come about this is a discussion about the movie and everyone is welcome to their own opinion so i’m just sharing mine also your cellulite comment makes no sense to me if my comment can be summed up in “i may as well say i’m disappointed it didn’t end with cellulite” then i’m here to tell you you’re wrong that’s not what i think at all it just sounds like my opinion made you salty and you’re welcome to disagree just remember to be civil if that was your intent then that’s cool obviously i can only go off what’s written it’s hard to tell intent over the internet,2023-08-06 20:46:47

it literally asks you to buy tickets at the end for a cause 

would agree its very on the nose just thats kind of common and not something at all unique to the barbie movie",2023-10-24 14:56:19
" directors and writers shouldnt use a film as a vessel or vehicle to spout a direct message

why on earth not directors and writers have been doing that since the invention of movies and playwrights have been doing it for thousands of years although they often couldnt directly express their message due to censorship

if you want an example from 80 years ago of a film being used as a vehicle to express a direct message try the great dictator by charlie chaplin it doesnt get more direct or unashamed than this



a number of countries around the world banned the film england had originally banned it but by the time it was released they had gone to war with germany so the film was allowed 

for the record i havent seen barbie and have zero interest in it but the idea that directors and writers shouldnt be political or express overt social messages in their movies is preposterous",2023-11-16 06:16:39
 eat  ,2023-11-05 06:59:48
"the blatant overexaggeration of the film wasnt too on the nose its like satire

take the movie bottoms came out recently if youve watched it basically its this high school where two girls accidentally start a fight club anyway this school basically worships the football club whenever theres a pep rally or football game the captain comes out some girl is screaming eat my  there are posters with him on it and  written in the middle the captains sidekick type guy is threatened by the girls fight club because he thinks itll take attention away from the football game spoiler alert at the end the fight club girls literally  all the members of an opposing football team because they were trying to  the captain with pineapple juice there are way more examples in this movie
anyway the difference between bottoms and barbie is that barbie had a real message and bottoms was just mindless fun both were an exaggeration of current social situations high schools loving football women always having to live up to unrealistic expectations 
and it is real you say supposed patriarchy as if its fake it shouldnt have to be explained that even after women got suffrage and jobs and laws passed so that discrimination wasnt allowed sexism still exists 
the complaint that its too on the nose may be true for me a woman who understands that a lot of the things stated in the movie were completely obvious but its obviously still needed if people are still talking about patriarchy like its fake",2023-11-11 03:32:41
"when i asked if you were serious i actually meant this part of your original comment

	since when was it acceptable for directors and producers to use movies as a blatant attempt at political and social enlightenment that movie was ridiculous…

since when is it acceptable do you not realize how   that sounds movies are made about transforming robots superheroes all kinds wizards completely fictional everything historical events and “based on a true story” but you find it unacceptable for a movie to make a blatant attempt at political and social enlightenment that’s the dumbest  thing i’ve read in quite some time acceptable to who if you don’t want to see a film with a political message then don’t  see it simple as that 

but then to justify your  rant you focus on one tiny shot from one scene yeah of course construction workers wouldn’t be so blatant about their catcalling sure it’s unlikely as  that someone would smack a woman on the  like that oh and by the way no she wouldn’t have been arrested for that nor would ken but did you cry about that part being inaccurate nope just decided to rant about women not being construction workers because they don’t like the work not because of the patriarchy 

let me ask you are you a construction worker do you know this to be true for sure or is this just your opinion because i happen to work in construction i design fire sprinkler systems and have spent hundreds of hours on job sites you know what happens to women in construction they get treated like  the few women who do work construction jobs whether onsite or inoffice have inappropriate comments said to them constantly get harrassed nonstop and generally have to deal with tons of  that men don’t and perpetuated by men and women who work in construction offices tend to be constantly tested whether they belong there that’s pretty standard for women anywhere in a professional environment that is maledominated 

but hey you go back to watching movies about totally believable things like time travel and keep fuming about movies with a political theme and totally unbelievable scenes like men sexually harassing women because that kind of thing neeeeeeeever happens ever",2023-11-06 05:47:31
"for one that doesnt  happen in the real world

lol what bubble do you live in

women are perfectly within their right to apply for construction positions but they dont its not because of a patriarchy  its because well they just dont apply for those hard labor jobs gosh gee golly who could have possibly thought that would be the cause

oh that bubble lol",2023-11-21 00:59:42
let me guess youre a guy,2023-11-12 02:12:00
"i think the movie is very selfaware that it is a representation and it makes layered commentary the structure of the world in the movie as i saw it was that the real world was also a caricature and over the top not just the barbie world but that doesnt mean that those caricatures dont have a relationship with truth just like actual caricatures highlight real features and make them appear ridiculous so does the movie highlight them in a ridiculous fashion so you are entirely correct that the situation with the construction workers does not generally speaking occur that literally but cat calling and  verbal remarks still does happen

on top of that i think the movie is actually criticizing the kind of feminism you are against so in a certain sense i think you and gerwig are on the same team here and for what its worth i too found it very uncomfortable how kens were represented at the beginning of the movie but that was the point the barbie world was just the opposite of a caricature of a patriarchy sasha legitimately calls it out as  fascist but even so it bares resemblances to how real world exists in the exact opposite way women are often side candy in movies i personally found it interesting to experience the uncomfortable feeling exaggurated as it was that no doubt many women feel when they play games or watch movies where women are just there for the men

so if there was a message in relation to this it was that the kind of barbie feminism really is just not very feministic while it still recognized that it at least was some kind of step up from all women being reduced to moms when playing with dolls and in real life the whole starting scene with the 2001 reference and the music is an over the top darmatisation of what occurred in 1950s looking at it now it was a dramatic change at the time but looking at it now it appears as the whole thing was great big farce about a miniscule step forward just as the opening scene

so to sum it up i think gerwig agrees with you that the way kens are treated in the movie is problematic and i think she is making the point that this kind of feminism is a problem that ultimately it is just patriarchy reversed

tldr hold off the barbie bbq for now fellas",2023-11-07 12:08:43
actually it is a stretch a stretch of fantasy and seeing what you want to see,2023-07-26 04:27:02
"i think the way the male characters are treated aligns with bell hooks and radical feminism hooks is really compassionate and real in her approach to men she argues that in discussing and understanding men we can help redefine manhood in way that is constructive and not just man hating 

ken sought to oppress and control barbie he was wrong the barbies eventually regained what was theirs but along the way they taught the kens how to achieve selfrealization ken said it himself when he first took over  he was respected for just being a dude this is pretty big for men real quick water under the bridge i understand this is worse for women  im not trying to argue otherwise but anyway among men this feeling that were only worth what we can provide isnt rare i do think there is a bit of a role reversal as well but i think this is also to help people empathize so to show compassion towards someone who tried to oppress you is bold and radical

along the lines of radical theory  the justice portrayed was transformative justice it wasnt punitive barbie helped ken grow but she also learned that ken lashed out because he felt hurt so they began to change their community thats what transformative justice is  changing the conditions and environment so the person who committed harm doesnt harm again 

i can see the point about the momdaughter relationship i didnt mind too much i was more pleased that it was more about the moms boredom and dissatisfaction with motherhood and less about her being a great mom i feel like what fixed their relationship was the daughter seeing her as a person and not just a mom

honestly though i feel like there is so much to it so im sorry if i get carried away or unclear i was just talking to my fiance about greta and she mentioned how shes very good at presenting flawed characters who you just need to accept  like life i thought the ending took this even further the world cant be fixed part of being human is learning to cope with it and still seeing the beauty in it

but like i said i think theres a lot here and so much conversation to be had so sorry if its hard to follow i can try again later to expand what i think if it helps",2023-07-23 01:36:43
"yeah and thats a problem with men patriarchy is the status quo and under patriarchy emotional maturity isnt really the fastest way to power

the stuff bell hooks pushes isnt anything your average therapist wouldnt recommend either  its just emotional maturitythe point isnt literally men need to cry more its men need to be in tune with reality and their emotions ive been in aastyle meetings for abusive men half of them claimed they would never hit a woman  it wasnt manly yet after decades of repressing their frustration towards some aspect of their lives they would snap and throttle their wives one time is all it takes to land you in that meeting yet they all swore they did nothing wrong a more conservative approach would be zero tolerance  cancel culture throw them in jail the more progressive approach a la hooks and gerwig is to show compassion and help men develop a fuller healthier understanding of themselves i guess its up to you to decide what you prefer for what its worth in speaking of issues relating to men hooks is the only person ive read that was actually concerned about men  violence towards them their quality of life etc

"i disagree they didn’t turn barbieland into a perfect utopia for men and women at the end because our world today isn’t a perfect utopia for men and women it’s a reflection of the current world just flipped it’s a better version of barbieland than it was before since they are starting to give the kens their own agency to discover who they are and work their way into “power” within society but it’s not going to happen overnight…just like our society today where women all of a sudden didn’t become president and supreme court justices and scientists and lawyers overnight it’s taken decades and decades of progress for women

someone below in the comments said it best by saying it’s not an endorsement it’s a satire…obviously everyone would want there to be a perfect utopia society for all genders but that’s not the way the world has worked in reality",2023-07-23 12:36:14

in the end the kens ditch the toxic masculinity and even out to become more emotionally healthy but retain some of their independence with the promise of maybe more in the future which that last part is another nod to the real world where women have been granted political and social rights slowly one step at a time making you feel frustrated that the kens were going to have to slowly climb their way up the ladder to full equal rights",2023-08-03 02:46:07

"ken and barbie aren’t perfect allegories for men and women and that is also not the point of the film

you seem to think that the barbies  women and the kens  men and that barbieland  is just an inverted version of our world

you’re complicating the images of these dolls that is toys made in the image of men and women with real men and women that is not the allegory the film is built on 

the allegory is ken and barbie needing figure  out “what they were made for” beyond the ‘roles’ mattel printed on their boxes because living within those roles is unfeasible just as real men and women need to figure out their identities beyond their genders because defining oneself under either gender is limiting and harmful to both 

barbie is a more accurate allegory of women in the film because she is a toy made by a women in the image of women to be played with by women

ken isn’t because by the logic of the film  he is still ultimately only the image of a man as played with by young girls so while ken does at various points very clearly and intentionally intersect with the actions  of real world men he’s not meant to come anywhere near as close to a one to one allegory of men in reality in the way that barbie is of women in reality 

barbies journey from barbieland to the real world is quite explicitly an allegory for a girls journey from childhood into womanhood

however ken is obviously not an allegory for real men nor is he an allegory for the journey of boyhood to manhood 

because ken is at once a representation of the toxic and limiting effects of masculinity and the patriarchy on real men and a direct allegory for real world women and a depiction of women on film 

ken fills  the role of vapid pretty love interest that women have played  with little nuance for the majority of cinemas existence 

it’s not that barbieland is an inversion of our world but that ken is actually an allegory for real world women 

yes obviously the satire comes from its appearance as a inversion but that’s not what’s actually happening 

the kens live in a society stacked against them despite making up 50 of the population where they have limited power rights and influence and are treated as pretty but ultimately superfluous objects 

people keep saying they had hoped for a warmer ending to the film where their society has reached true equality but the kens can’t reach true equality by the end because they represent real women and real women have not reached true equality that’s the point

the same fate is offered to the kens as has been offered to real women a path toward equality not because men deserve to see the shoe on the other foot or the film being about revenge but because ken is literally an allegory for women and women were not handed equality over night 

the films grounded in the look of the early 60s  alongside barbies creation there wasn’t a female supreme court justice until the 80s so it stands to reason that in 20 years a ken will be made a supreme court justice and in another 20 years they’ll be 4  kens severing on the supreme court and 2 retired because that is the rate of progress in the real world and barbieland influences our would as much as ours does barbieland so who knows when they’ll be a ken president we’ll know before they do 

yes it is a  ending but it’s also half the populations present lived reality",2023-07-23 18:51:30

i do agree with your points i just feel like glorias storyline and problems were swept under the rug i do think the touch on barbie being an outdated goal was good but maybe the writers could have expanded on this somehow in helping gloria for example barbie has never officially married ken or had children to my knowledge and this could have been brought up when facing glorias issues maybe just stating that barbie couldnt address these issues but still comforting gloria would have been good more empathy perhaps or acknowledging the comfort in that barbie cant be everything to women  she cant be a mother married have an ambitious career plus whatever else you can throw at her and because of that gloria might have to find a new role model or find some inner strength to combat these issues not saying that gloria used barbie as a sterotype to live up to i know that she was primarily using barbie as a comforting concept to understand her own issues through her drawings and as a way to remember her daughter as a child i just think gloria deserved more however maybe that is too much to expect from a doll,2023-07-25 15:43:12

i don’t disagree per say but a barbie movie was always gonna be about women at its core it never made the men evil just misguided and idiots for the most part it played with concepts from our current political time but then kinda veered back into the silly as a piece of entertainment it was very well made and written and filled with great performances i don’t agree with all the points about patriarchy and women’s challenges but they never got in the way of enjoying the movie for me,2023-07-21 07:20:06

"yes i understand what they were trying to convey i just felt like it didnt work super well in the context of the movie

the kens werent particularly despicable they were like children naïve and misguided none of them actually harbored any ill will towards the barbies even ryans ken says he lost interest in the patriarchy after he found out it had nothing to do with horses all the kens wanted was to find meaning in a world that wasnt made for them something that i think most of the movies viewers assuming its girls and women can identify with it just feels like punching down in this situation and the only moral ground they have to stand on is that theyre the opposite gender

i think if the mattel ceos were the focus of the conflict and played as a little more  or went a harder on the love bombing then they wouldve been better targets for manipulation even if it parodies their public image too much it mightve worked better structurally for the movie and as long as will ferrells character learns a lesson at the end of it it can still paint mattels image in a good light

"but the barbie world is the mirror of the real world where in reality women are bad or shamed for all the reasons listed in the film where men dont have to do any of those things and get away with doing bad things the whole point of the film is that equality is the only equilibrium

"that’s not at all the message they conveyed with the men of the “real world”

what message do you think was conveyed with the men of the real world",2023-07-25 20:48:17
no it isnt ken doesnt represent all men look at alan ken represents toxic masculinity its pretty obvious yet so many people seem to miss this,2023-07-25 20:03:00
"there’s no actual “misandry” involved in conveying this it’s quite literally just a genderbent story of equal rights that ends with everyone deciding they should live their lives freely of how they were initially designed

youre joking right

the movie demonized a huge number of benign activities as manifestations of toxic masculinity  the patriarchy like watching action movies exercising and horses like  how is liking horses toxic all of these traditionally masculine activities are being construed as guilty by association as if men oppress women so anything men like is also oppressive and bad 

the message seems to be dont follow culture just be yourself but if youre a man and you like anything stereotypically associated with masculinity this is by default toxic and bad so it doesnt leave men with any clues or any direction except a nebulous sentiment that you shouldnt do anything unless barbie approves of it which actually is misandrist the film seems to embrace the men are defective women trope which is definitionally misandrist 

then theres the fact that every single man in the entire film without exception was portrayed as inherently dumb morally weak and some combination of crudely sexist proudly selfish and joyously oppressive

there wasnt a single positive male role model in the entire movie and no hint of a suggestion of what positive healthy masculinity looks like

even sasha presumably intended to be a smart but cynical protagonist comes across as a terminally online loser bigot with extremist views",2023-07-23 07:50:33
"the movie didnt end with barbieland becoming an equal utopia it ended with it becoming a place that was better but still had plenty of work left to get there  like our world

those that were structurally powerful admitting that the structure was unfair but reluctant to surrender control of that power  again like our world  is a message as well thats not an endorsement its satire

its also about how our abstract ideas are shaped by our messy reality and vice versa barbie didnt bring full female empowerment to the real world a more nuanced worldview and the complex inner life of real women didnt bring full kenquality to their world either",2023-07-23 10:10:28
"it wasn’t revenge it was reality 

as much as we build up women and say they can do everything we’re still not holding as many positions of power still being stripped of our rights etc etc

the kens also went full on insurrection and were going to put a patriarchal constitution in place and had a civil war…

it was incredibly telling that the barbies said they would work their way up",2023-07-23 10:02:53
this and the kens brainwashing the barbies was really poor writing tbf makes the message more confusing,2023-07-23 10:49:31
it’s not surprising given feminisms obsession with patriachy and toxic masculinity and all things negatively male feminism focuses on the patriachy and women often seem an afterthought it makes perfect sense that a feminist movie would as well,2023-07-26 19:07:31
"i dont think men sat around and decided to start a patriarchy and i dont think men today even consciously try to uphold it but men as a monolith were sure as  bigger and stronger than women and took what they wanted at the start of civilization when thats the base of what we are now yeah things are going to be skewed in mens favor and men in general arent going to question it because it feels like the natural order of things do you think women came up with all of the rules to be clear im talking here about actual rules that dehumanized them throughout history women decided periods were dirty so they had to be locked away for a week every month women decided to be passed off like cattle for trade women feel that our beauty and ability to be nice and accommodating are the most important things that we can offer because thousands of years have told us that this is true this is historically how you get the man you want rather than the one who you hate but your dad told you you have to marry thats how its been for most of human history and women today either still live in those exact conditions or if theyre lucky they are still unlearning those rules so they can just be comfortable with themselves

this isnt to say that women do not participate in the patriarchy and uphold misogynistic values most of the shaming women experience in motherhood for instance comes from other women who think they know better but there is often a lot of pressure in the female experience to be just so lest we turn off men so when women explode with frustration about the double standards we experience that frustration is often directed at men unfairly or not because we know other women are going through the exact same thing

so i think the other redditor got frustrated because saying men go through the same thing is kind of a what about the men statement and isnt really relevant to that scene its a scene of a woman talking to a woman about the female experience men dont really come into play there even if they do have as you very thoughtfully quoted their own tightrope to walk

for why barbie chose to be human one of her biggest struggles throughout is that shes just normal standard barbie in some ways she has the same problem as ken who has no profession hes just beach she feels powerless in her own perfect society feeling a lack of purpose is a very human experience so she decides to be human in the moment leading up to that decision shes more human than any other barbie has ever been its something i personally struggle with all the time and that scene absolutely made me cry there is something beautiful and deeply touching about giving yourself the freedom to stop thinking about what you want to be when you grow up and how youre going to change the world and lets face it probably feeling like youre failing and decide to just be human it was a very subtext heavy plot though so i could understand if it didnt come across to everyone",2023-07-28 07:52:40

"ive mentioned this in other comments but that part is used to demonize everything else that men dolike as bad or guilty by association

the men are depicted as oppressing women and liking horses and because oppressing women is bad that means liking horses is also bad

theres a double standard here because in the beginning the barbies were oppressing the kens which is you know presumably bad but that wasnt really explicitly described as bad and nothing else that the barbies did was implied to be bad either just all the things the kens did were described as bad except for being quiet obedient accessories for their barbies 

the messaging was just very confused and unnuanced",2023-07-23 08:15:23
"how else are you supposed to interpret the activities the kens did during the kendom

they didnt watch action movies and drink beer and talk about horses  is up with this its so random before the kendom they only did it during while they were also brainwashing and oppressing the barbies and when they were put in their place and told to change for the better the action movie watching and the beer drinking etc were toned down then when barbie is telling ken that he needs to follow himself and not a toxic culture to find his place shes literally talking about all the stereotypical behaviors the kens participated in earlier

the movie explicitly links malepopular activities and toxic behaviors the direct unambiguous not even allegorical or symbolic but quite literal message is that these activities are all part of the same constellation of male toxicity that includes oppressing women and establishing a monogender government which the barbies also hadhave but its good when they do it the messaging is inconsistent

im still suspicious that theres some satire here that im missing but no one is pointing out where the movie also lampoons womens struggle it actually takes itself quite seriously in that regard so wheres the satire supposed to come in",2023-07-23 09:33:41
what’s wrong with talking about what you’re passionate about,2023-07-23 08:49:50
"yes the idea here is that when men are free to act as they please the patriarchy they immediately oppress women and then party and do all kinds of stereotypical male behaviors

the male behaviors like watching action movies and liking horses  is this even masculine is it even toxic makes no sense are made guilty by association

men oppress women and men like horses  and oppressing women is bad so horses are bad too

for  sake the conclusion of kens storyline is that he should just be himself and not what culture dictates a man should be which was the whole point of including all those stereotypical masculine activities in the first place

the problem is that those activities arent inherently bad or sexist but theyre being conflated as such men engaging in culturally stereotypically masculine activities was explicitly demonized as merely an aspect of the patriarchy and the end of the movie directly implied that theyd be happier if they found other interests presumably something the barbies would approve of but its never explicitly clarified the message for men is what youre doing is bad stop but theres no clarification on what isnt bad the best we get is what the kens are doing before barbieland becomes kendom land or whatever which is basically being neutered domesticated pets for the barbies thats obviously not a solution for men in the real world the movie doesnt give any direction to men in the real world it just tears them down and says do better with no further direction 

this is just a highbudget display of the men are defective women trope",2023-07-23 08:42:17
"why is it disingenuous that a barbie movie based on a child’s toy of all things doesn’t focus on a gender war why is it a good thing to get boys and girls at each others throats by insulting one of them and telling the other they need to overcome their oppression is that really going to be a positive thing

the opening sequence is making a pr point for mattel that makes them look good in the current day you realise that right barbie wasn’t the first doll of an adult woman she just became the most popular and mass produced and she didn’t have any kind of job in her first few iterations then she had jobs like teachers assistant and nurse  the astronaut doll was a novelty joke because space was so hot a topic in the mid 60’s it wasn’t this serious message like people are pretending now feminists literally protested the doll throughout the 60’s and 70’s but mattel had tik tok feminists convinced barbie is some seminal figure in women’s rights which is hilarious

the entire story surrounding barbies creation is largely fabricated to make mattel look better and more progressive ruth handler had a basic idea to copy a sexualised german doll which already existed and a guy called jack ryan designed barbie it was even named after his wife ironically for all the talk of patriarchy it was actually handler who was ruthless about taking all the credit and downplaying his contribution and funnily enough the men at the company originally wouldn’t create the barbie doll because they thought having a bombshell  doll was offensive and gave the wrong message to young girls to try to live up to that that is until jack ryan who loved the idea of the doll looking like a 50’s bombshell because he was a  maniac got on board and pushed for it and that’s why barbie had pointy  and curves at first because some pervy mad men style dude thought it looked hot

there’s your real story of a doll created for female empowerment 
nothing against barbie and i’m not trying to tear down all the fun girls had playing with her  but the whole thing about her being created to support women’s rights or something is total bs and corporate spin",2023-07-25 15:13:22
there have been women on the surpreme court and in congress for literally my entire existence and i am not young by any means i think the problem is that the movie draws from a bygone era and tries to convince the audience that it is a true reflection of modern society people arent going to be receptive to a message if they see it as disingenuous,2023-07-25 13:26:17

"greta gerwig has openly stated multiple times that that is exactly what she was doing though its not an assumption it is what the writer herself said before the movie even had a trailer you not seeing it for what it actually is doesnt mean it was hard to understand it means you had a preconceived idea of what the movie would be and interpreted it to match your bias it wasnt to tell men its ok to cry it was to hold a mirror up to the ways that toxic masculinity hurts men but is still not taken seriously by a lot of people you saw a man crying and you heard laughter and you put 2 and 2 together and came out with 5

also if rambo did such a good job how come 40 years later men still havent got the message 

i didnt feel like they were making a joke of a crying ken personally but i can understand how some might perceive it that way especially when they expect a crying man to be a punchline and forget that there was more happening in that scene or that people laugh at more than just that was funny yknow i laughed because i was happy for ken and found him oddly endearing as he discovered that he was kenough i laughed because him misunderstanding barbie comforting him was so painfully accurate to life but in that moment it was definitely more of a fml laugh than a haha lol laugh  crying ken wasnt the joke your perception of crying ken was the joke and its not the kind of joke thats intended to be funny it was supposed to make you uncomfortable",2023-08-09 08:39:56

"except actually they weren’t portrayed as idiots in the way this film portrays literally all its male characters that way there’s a difference between a single female being a sideline character or a sexualised character and the entire gender of males being portrayed as morons doing something bad most of the time

and i don’t buy that anyway  it seems more likely it’s just a continuation of the men dumb women smart sitcom trope played for laughs because it’s not just ken  it’s the real world men as well",2023-07-24 14:11:38
i agree  they could’veshould’ve gone with making the proper feminist point but i think they chose that ending because it’s supposed to show that if the idea of the kens treatment in barbieland is upsetting to viewers they should leave the film upset about what that means about the current irl treatment of women i think a call out of sorts  like “you have empathy for kens but do you feel that way about the women you see day to day”,2023-07-25 02:28:08
did you miss the phrase “women hate women men hate women” the hatred for women knows no bounds,2023-07-22 16:51:00
many men still saw this movie  and many women who yell about feminism being bad as well,2023-07-22 16:00:33
there were plenty of other barbies who were happy with their kens in the end this barbie was on an existential journey that separated her from what she was created to be its not that she did not like ken its that she did not like her scripted life with her arranged marriage goom husband,2023-07-26 15:53:42

girls typically stop playing with barbie’s when they hit puberty like the daughter barbie having a  and going to gynecologist symbolizes her stop playing in barbieland and entering her womanhood,2023-07-26 12:56:01

that tickle scene was so weird,2023-07-25 16:51:31
yes but you could take them out of the script once they go back to barbieland and nothing would change which is something that usually happens if a plotline has been dropped their reason for being there is a very flimsy justification that could have been added in last minute especially since earlier in the movie they were portrayed as out of touch antagonists that wanted to put barbie back in her box,2023-07-25 17:21:41
profit theres a line in the movie saying that the new ken mojo dojos are selling better than barbie did,2023-07-25 18:30:07

"being a feminist just means that you believe women to deserve equal rights and opportunities as men thats it

its an extremely broad term and thus most people especially women are thus basically considered feminist by default",2023-07-28 08:20:56
"barbie tells ken to be his own person  that sets him free thats not treating him badly or as a second class citizen kens understanding of patriarchy is intended to be exaggerated laughable once he learned it wasnt about horses he lost interest meanwhile kens subjugated barbies to be adoring handmaidens not an endorsement for egalitarian leadership

important to remember that barbie land is a female fantasy land barbie isnt dismissive its her reality just as human men accept their reality being in charge kens dont have any real role barbie tells ken to find his role not something that can be handed to him or to anyone 

ken not getting representation is a direct mirror of reality  you want an ending with everythingeveryone being equal as explained in the movie its a long painful road",2023-07-31 07:23:03
wasnt that the point the fact that you can recognize its not a solution is great but you need to connect it to the reality of our world is thats the deal women are given in our patriarchal society,2023-07-31 19:07:16
im assuming barbie land continues with all the other barbies  the children who will continue to play with them margot barbie the stereotypic barbie interestingly is the rebel seeking her own life having experienced the real world while the other dolls are happily doing what theyve always done since they dont know anything else,2023-07-31 05:46:45
i also read the ending as you did  as a death of a reality like if peter pan left neverland and neverland was his imaginary land it would die but she was just one barbie after all so maybe its more like a lost boy leaving the adventures live on but that one kid grows up,2023-07-31 13:32:47
"also to be perfectly honest i hope mattel doesnt really retire barbie

i mean i know its a movie but seeing so many barbie fans at the theater did make me smile and mattel just giving up the franchise is like saying barbie is gone forever never to return

i sure would feel like as if toy story ceases to exist since mattel has done wonders for me and my collection of awesome sdcc toys

i dont want a franchise to end here and now and yes i liked the film just dont want it to be an endgame here

again overanallizing this too hard but still i would have missed barbie since i do recall seeing alot of the awesome toys back at toys r us and thinking boys and girls can play with barbie and ken it aint weird to me and thats awesome

i hope that at least the movie doesnt discontinue the franchise like how ive seen so many franchises just disappear and never come back

thank you barbie 3",2023-07-31 05:25:16
did they loads of men hate the movie,2023-08-01 04:22:33
men like cheap messages and shallow movies,2023-08-01 00:27:52
"i’m not saying that you can’t get a barbie for cheap but that people are ignoring how absurd the barbie and dream car combo being sold for 65 is justified because of the 100 ebay barbie’s 

like i get it everything will go up and down in price but you can’t deny that this movie in general the sales from the merch kenough hoodie  toys from the movie etc is making bank for mattel 

i also get that movies are made for money but people ignoring the history of mattel and how much isn’t changing besides marketing really and acting like them making more movies is a good thing for women is just sad 

like people can be happy with the movie and happy with the merch and stuff don’t get me wrong however ignoring what it really is and that “it’s okay if they sell stuff for insane amount of money it’s worth it cause it’s them” is hypocritical when you do not say the same for other companies who sell things for an abused price because of their brand only",2023-07-31 15:51:37
"no what is happening is that individual sellers on ebay bought the mattel dolls in bulk when they were first released product sold out so now you can purchase the special barbiemovie tm dolls via the individual sellers but for much more than the original 50 dollars ie 85100 depending on how much one feels one has to have the dolls right now  

in any case imo the original 50 is too much in the first place considering the low quality of the dolls anyway just because they do do have spray painted on clothes ie supermarket dolls does not mean the fabric or plastic is of very high quality 

and has anyone noticed hoe skinny these dolls are toothpick arms and legs lolol",2023-07-31 17:11:54
yup it was definitely written in a way to provoke a reaction isnt us talking about these issues kind of the point of satire,2023-08-01 04:00:51
took their home but i think they also let them stay there its probably not like how the barbies didnt even know where the kens were staying in the beginning i might be wrong tho,2023-08-06 01:06:29
i thought the jokes were really good  andokay  is that a criticism,2023-07-22 16:36:52
"yes agreed and the rich are mostly made up of… men 

due to the systemic discrimination against women and people of colour right up until after my parents were even

" are you saying women can’t enjoy things deemed masculine because it makes it abnormal

i’m obviously not saying that but it suits your narrative to perpetuate that i am so whatever man  keep living in denial that things in this world are made for men by men even when they’re made to be sold to women",2023-07-23 08:00:32
the point is that words alone do not convey the total meaning the tone of how theyre said and they way that the person who says them is looking at you and how familiar they are to you changes what the words mean,2023-07-23 07:34:58
right but the point is that those comments arent a threat to the barbies in the same way that the comments in the real world are which is why theyre different,2023-07-23 10:30:54
i think it feeds in the men never receiving compliments trope how often do we read even on this site entire threads about how men remember compliments received more than ten years ago i think thats what that scene was about for barbie it was unwanted attention for ken it was for the first time attention,2023-07-23 09:34:10
"men do not walk down the street and at baseline feel admiration from strangers nor do they fail to notice any undercurrent of violence

were talking about a guy who felt respected as a man because someone asked him what the time was",2023-07-23 07:53:18
that was just ken being oblivious it wasn’t saying men are admired it was saying ken just assumed the stares were positive and didn’t understand the danger barbie was in,2023-07-23 10:14:00
gerwigs husband cowrote the screenplay and as far as i know he has experience being a man so  ,2023-07-23 08:07:10
…because barbie realized that feminism wasn’t magically fixed by women having control of everything and being “perfect” and “extraordinary” and learned that being a woman is being a human…bring multifaceted having emotions opinions etc,2023-07-23 10:11:43
you heard me,2023-07-22 11:36:54
the film was never advertised like that nor would they have hired greta gerwig to direct a film like that there are a ton of animated barbie films for babies if thats what your grownup wife and teen daughter apparently prefer to watch,2023-07-22 13:56:47
sure thing women’s reproductive health isn’t talked about quite enough any questions just ask,2023-07-22 18:13:36
so well said thank you for this,2023-07-23 14:24:44
"agree with you  there are some pieces missing

one point towards it being a production issue ken isn’t treated as a predator or illegitimate in his romantic intentions even when he tries to kiss barbie he’s treated as naive and misplacing his affections and barbie doesn’t scorn him she relates she has a boundary she pushes him towards helping himself out i don’t think that would be in the film if the origins were singularly female focused

stallone being an influence for kens was also not fully explored and played as a joke but there is a very real connection between ramborockyothers and body image the 80s action star did a lot to market hyper masculine identities that ken is adopting i assume there was a better link to masculine identity through that and it’s easy to overlook because we only see the comedy side of it

i think a lot of people will probably misconstrue my read i’m not angry at the film and i understand the parallels between the two worlds i just think it was inconsistent in some areas which made it appear needlessly isolating literally all they needed to do to soften it was be like ‘if being in a pink mansion with a little car and a dog that poops everywhere is you go for it if being yourself is being into photoshop and trucks and boxing you do you whether you’re a barbie or a ken you don’t have to rely on what society wants from you or what you’ve always done before follow what you believe in and discover who you are’ 

that’s a coherent message of selfworth that still retains a positive note for women which is also consistent with the themes of the story and validates every character and viewer instead we have a mishmash of light comedy and iconoclasm that leans more one way than another and imo weakened the script you’re totally right that it could be getting a lot more credit",2023-07-22 23:46:07
oh it’s definitely making fun of men but ‘men love gangster movies’ and ‘isn’ cringe when guys awkwardly play guitar to impress girls’ are completely harmless it’s no worse than ‘take my wife please’ style humor you’d have to be hypersensitive to really read into that  and i’m a traditionally masculine man who likes almost entirely traditionally masculine stuff the difference is that i can laugh at myself cause i don’t have emotional regulation problems,2023-07-25 16:25:44
so basically breaking gender norms is great until men have feelings then its way back to the boys dont cry mentality,2023-07-29 18:08:35
you said it was a liberal barbie movie that must mean you have an opinion about what a conservative barbie movie looks like i want to know,2023-07-23 22:39:11
"yes and even the old ones aren’t as bad no james bond movie since the 90’s  on women
yes i realise that gerwig probably thought she was doing something very clever with showing how the patriarchy and toxic masculinity hurts men too by showing ken crying and getting to find himself  but in reality that’s not something men actually care about  it’s something feminist women claim men care about then claim the patriarchy is stopping them from doing and then other feminist women agree but most men don’t care at all that will only resonate with feminist women

it’s just weird that the patriarchy in the real world and barbie land is portrayed so negatively yet the barbie matriarchy isn’t  if they wanted to contrast the two then they needed to show that as just as bad otherwise the message is just that women should be in charge because they’re better",2023-07-21 18:57:37
lol sounds interesting,2023-07-21 18:50:48
"nope sure women get sidelined and sometimes there are stereotypical gender roles  but that’s not the same thing as bitterness and mocking i’ve been watching hitchcock movies from the 40’s and 50’s lately  they don’t  on women at all women often fill stereotypical roles but they can be clever or whatever else

the barbie movie literally paints all the men as  and bad",2023-07-21 18:54:03
those with real ruling power 00001 are men but the average man is less powerful than the average woman change my mind,2023-07-23 21:53:11

"all the barbies in barbieland are the manifestation of the fantasies of young girls in the real world playing with them all young girls imagine they will be beautiful were you in the bathroom during the scene with the older woman on the bench where barbie tells her shes beautiful and the woman says i know it did you miss the two pivotal scenes with rhea perlman

and barbie now a real woman in the real world goes to the gynecologist because she has a real ",2023-08-06 04:02:06
yes you dont think becoming human is personal growth for barbie thats weird,2023-08-06 13:42:41
"life must be tough when someone asking a question leaves you feeling so insulted

i read your review as i was falling asleep last night and felt like you missed all of the moments that made the movie meaningful for me i don’t mean missed like “i think you’re ” i mean missed like that you didn’t feel them the same way i did i thought hey we’re probably coming at it from a completely different life experience possibly because you’re not a woman i wanted to engage but it was already 6am and i didn’t want to start off on some sleep deprived rant by assuming your gender so i thought it made sense to ask and come back later 

so to clarify are you a man who is insulted that i thought you might be a man because you seemed to be coming at the movie from a male point of view

i thought it might be the start of a conversation but i’m not really interested in a discussion if you’re offended by the idea that our lived experiences mean we might experience the same things differently",2023-08-06 04:55:19
"the movie doesnt lean on men at all unless you believe expectations are in turn to be expected from one the insult isnt that you are a man its that theres a whole level of social pressure that you are oblivious to not that theres anything really negligent in that when its not addressed at you but if you really want to take offence i suppose it would be thatedit other examples

having your vhole checked isnt a shocking joke because its gross  but because on the complete opposite its supposed to be and i quote somebody else in this thread maybe the most prosaic mundane uncomfortablebutunremarkable aspect of being a woman

similarly there was no continuous replacement of target in the movie message it was just one constant logical and emotional buildup about why women feel trapped its not just the glass ceiling media representation or whatever other long shot disparity the great majority of life subsume an implicit social contract which was summed up perfectly in the big monologue at the weird barbie house if you come out of the shower and just dress with a hoodie and jeans nobody absolutely gives a   if a girl does the same shes probably assumed to be a drug addict similarly while there are probably many manly and rad synonyms for when somebody is a  the tamest one i could think for the other gender behaving the same is  and even then only with younger kids today which to be fair do probably have some actual chances of walking around all these ingrained conventions but nonetheless even them have to interface with older wife bad generations

last but not least im not sure what crying at the end of the movie should say about women i mean its pretty much a given that the finale of any drama will have a big dropping emotional scene but as a guy that cannot cry even when thinking alone to the big dread of existence my eyes were surely getting very slippery around 10 minutes before the credits",2023-08-07 00:45:07
if that’s the case  this kinda diminishes women how does a successful barbie leave her career to become a housemaid because someone explained patriarchy to her ,2023-08-13 08:56:47
"if majority of people didnt get this then maybe you are the one being wrong here and just trying to cope because the movie is not providing the message you want to be true

also the movie wasnt really subtle with any messagethemecommentary before the end so im not sure why you are so sure your take is correct and even if your take is correct the fact that a lot of people didnt get the ending just shows the ending wasnt done that well",2023-07-22 20:10:23
"seriously  the point is going straight over so many peoples heads and this whole thread  me off

this movie should be mandatory viewing for all men and then a debrief about what they learned",2023-07-22 21:38:58
its not even implied the narrator says it point blank,2023-07-24 03:17:33
"imo the message is pretty universal but maybe itll strike more with a younger audience

i just think the comedy for example things like having a dude shout matchbox 20 at you being mansplained the godfather or binge watching pride and prejudice when youre depressed is far more targeted at millenial women than gen zers",2023-07-24 00:29:17
i am a 34 year old dude and loved the movie i think we assume young girls understand this message but my younger sisters friends seem to need this message,2023-07-24 01:57:53
should be and actuality,2023-07-24 05:39:20
you’ve completely missed the entire message behind the movie and the creation of barbie as a whole if you’re actually thinking that,2023-07-23 06:43:05
well i would answer but something tells me you don’t actually want me to answer which countries…,2023-07-23 07:06:34
"not allowing men on the supreme court was a joke referencing the fact that women hold far less leadership positions in government every single president has been male…look up rbg’s “until there are nine” quote 

yes duh  barbieland is a matriarchy where men kens had no rights  and then it ends pretty much exactly the same

they even say ken’s have as much power in barbieland as women do in the real world which the entire movie has just established is not okay 

yes literally my point

just because patriarchy is bad doesn’t mean all men are bad

the movie saying the patriarchy is bad and failing to embrace the identical matriarchy is bad is hypocrisy

that’s why they’ve included allan

no they didnt  allan sided with them  at no point is allan included",2023-07-24 11:14:24
its worth noting that one of the very first shots shows waste managementrecycling barbies as being greeted and treated as equal by other barbies in kens world the problem wasnt that they were working service jobs but that 1 their self determination was taken away insofar as much they had it in the first place and 2 all of their roles became specifically about serving ken instead of being equals who happened to perform service tasks they at best treated as functional arm candy,2023-07-24 18:36:11
"the problem was that in that section of the movie the women had no agency when interacting with the kens

you can nitpick how its delivered but its a movie about dolls being dolls

from what i hear the thundercats movie where they deconstruct the pushpull dichotomy between the catlizard conflict and its ties to the deconstruction of the us labor movement in the 20th century is going to be much more nuanced",2023-07-24 18:59:53
im pretty sure that in kens world the barbies didnt have jobs they were just servants and the whole point of the deprogramming is that theyre going back to their original careers so clearly those careers are the ones that they chose and enjoy and whats so wrong with that,2023-07-24 18:00:50
you hit the nail on the head though that was kens world with that depiction  and it was kens world that also stripped the barbies of any choices in barbieworld thats not the case i know that because i definitely have owned a flight attendant barbie before the harmful narrative is forcing the president or the nobel prize winner or the  worker who might also be a mother or a video game lover or makeup fan or a recovering alcoholic to be reduced to just anything barbieworld is absolutely flawed but that isnt why,2023-07-24 17:49:41
i agree with everything you said im ok with kens being idiots and all the corporate men too but just give me one guy whos chill and given a little respect,2023-08-01 19:33:57
"that’s one very generous interpretation another more straightforward one is that greta gerwig doesn’t actually like men that much so regardless of the situation they’re in whether their being an  being gentle or just being a regular guy like gloria’s husband she sees them as idiots worthy of mockery and writes them as such and just like gloria’s character with her husband she’s either unaware or uncaring of her attitude regarding that

also i would say loneliness is one of the biggest things effecting many from all generations since the beginning of time that won’t change",2023-08-01 18:46:56
"why should men be wishing they cried more because that seems natural to feminist women and they think there’s something wrong if men don’t do it that’s no different than men insisting that not crying is best and trying to force that on women 
the mistake is on feminist women for believing they know what is best for men better than men what’s so great about crying what if men don’t need or get a lot out of talking about feelings like women do who are feminist women to say that way is wrong and their way is right why on earth would they have the moral authority on how another gender should act in relation to their own feelings don’t they hate that when men do it to them

there is no way a crying woman getting rejected by stallone who then told her she could find herself would be played as a positive ending for the main female character of one of his movies and if it was women watching would be insulted by it",2023-08-01 16:49:24
the thing is that’s kind of ironic in a movie which is as preachy as this,2023-07-23 14:53:13
nothing wrong with liking zach snyders justice league its just probably the polar opposite of this movie,2023-07-24 04:40:44
the synder cut sold me on its tall aspect ratio and hes also an all around solid dude,2023-08-06 03:54:01
you completely missed the point of the joke dude,2023-07-23 20:52:22
"yes but this movie is also a commentary on gender in the real world 

there’s an implication that the doctors physicists etc have been working for years have qualifications etc while the ken’s don’t have jobs or qualifications they are just “beach” we see the president barbie making decisions barbie’s in space so while we think they are toys they have been working since their inception into barbie land and the ken’s haven’t

as to why ken’s don’t have jobs and are barbie accessories that’s a question for mattel as evidenced by the movie girls wanted to play with barbie and ken was just an accessory that’s what made them money",2023-07-28 06:48:28

teeny tiny bit of an over generalisation there maybe,2023-07-22 16:41:08
there is no real introspection to be had here and the fact that you think there is just comes off as preachy narcissistic or chauvinistic  and how much misandry are men supposed to tolerate before they react or say something,2023-07-22 05:26:08
no   the movie was meant to be a surface level viewpoint of the real world just as how its portrayed in barbieland i mean the genre is comedy for christs sake what do you want a freakin documentary,2023-08-22 08:44:25
incel is a pretty problematic insult to begin with it’s reductive and implies that someone’s worth lies in how much  they have people with disabilities injuries or disorders that make dating difficult would technically be incels too what would you have against them i think you need to reevaluate using incel to insult people,2023-07-24 20:34:26

"the kens are a commentary on the negative effects patriarchy has on men and the way it makes men behave kens whole character arc about being unable to properly express his feelings and defining himself by his job and his partner thats all part of the movies criticism of patriarchy the kens turning into egotistical chauvinists thats commentary on the role patriarchy expects men to play

the barbie movie is one of the few pieces of media ive seen that really engages with how the patriarchy hurts men too and its baffling that the movie is being accused of hating men",2023-07-23 13:29:43
still id rather be dependent on a job than a husband less risky and there are other ways to make money once u actually have your own money and not all are miserable in their corporate jobs at least my employer gives me money that i myself have full control over  and also wfh when i want maximum 40hrweek great salary paid vacation etc the good thing about a job is that you can quite easily change it if youre unhappy with it you are also not as emotionally attached to an employer as you are to a husband at least there is no financial abuse and risk of physical abuse and manipulation your employer probably wont stalk you and threaten you if you leave you probably dont have kids together with ur employer why am i even stating the obvious here,2023-07-23 22:19:59

"ok  i forgot weird barbie and that was a well conceived character so i will admit she should be included as a good character i don’t agree with the others being interesting though

was barbie spouting intellectual feminist jargon really some awesome “meta joke” or was it just bad writing and gerwig wanted to make characters her mouthpieces at the expense of character continuity seems like excusing anything that makes no sense as a “meta joke” is just that  an excuse

all those jokes at the barbies expense are light hearted and often physical comedy the one constant joke at the kens and mens expense is that they are dumb there’s a difference",2023-07-26 15:12:10
why because i think the movie was bad that’s my opinion and please don’t call me a misogynist i’m a woman and didn’t like this movie,2023-07-26 23:44:43
i think i made a pretty blunt point i personally wouldnt call this dancing around but i get u if u think it is yeah i disagree for the most part also you didnt answer the question,2023-07-27 15:31:25
it represented a fantasy dumbed down version of the real world to compare with barbie world vs the opposite john wick or james bond movies dont claim to be nonreal world do they,2023-07-22 13:44:40
what about the real world did you think wasnt represented truthfully,2023-07-22 13:31:22
all through the movie he’s a downtrodden idiot and then he does something about it and it casts him in the villain role  he’s clearly portrayed negatively compared to the barbies the whole thing about him being kenough is just a feminist idea come to life like sure women barbies will have more power but men get to cry and find themselves and that’s equality or some  like that,2023-07-24 08:24:45
"to me the film says barbie can’t be the girl boss without dominating ken that is unbarbie to me barbie is barbie without ken 

so what ken steals show it’s the barbie movie she can’t even be the main character is the ultimate irony of this “feminist” movie i think the writers knew barbie wasn’t compelling and they spent more time making ken the well rounded character",2023-07-24 07:15:07
"is sasha a bully

i mean yeah thats the whole point of the little girl character to convey that information to the audience the film doesnt really have the screentime to dwell on it but yeah sasha has a reputation at her school for being a bully which is probably a sign that shes deeply unhappy and its coming from a place of insecuritybody image issues which is why shes so  at barbie that was my read on it anyway it also mirrors her mothers unhappiness and gives both of them an emotional connection to barbie that better ties them to barbies story in which they are really just side characters",2023-07-28 08:07:22
"it definitely moves fast and swings a bit so i can understand that it didn’t bother me at all because i was so engrossed

i don’t know about subversive but i’d say it’s fair to call it groundbreaking i’ve never seen a blockbuster not pull any punches on gender criticism before especially wrapped up in that aesthetic",2023-07-21 16:45:01
"i wasn’t referring to just race culture or body type it comes down to only representing model humans instead of average humans or even downandout humans

think about the millions of redditors who are nothing like barbie or gi joe they probably feel like failures by comparison it’s as unhealthy as social media is

i’m just repeating myself at this point but that’s my answer to your question",2023-07-22 09:18:41
"take a look at their line yeah there may be different colours but it stops right about there they have curvy which still looks like 80 of women never will what kind of message that sends there is doctor and other high professions and there is the trophy wife type where is the average the 95 office worker the shop assistant etc so no in general they are still all about the for many impossible goal

set women back 50 years no not in the way the movie meant do they have a bad effect on mental health yes why precisely because they set an impossible goal which if little girls growing up dont reach they feel like a failure 

we could argue about body positivity for example and that  isnt healthy no it isnt does someone  deserve to be treated by society by as a subhuman no does that treatment come from impossibly set beauty ideals starting from small girls toys yes  
so overall i do think there was and is a negative effect

x200b

oh and on a side note i want 1 hour 40 minutes of my life back because the movie  so bad",2023-07-22 12:56:48
"i felt like that metaphor went over so many peoples heads ken’s comment about not owning a house and it being barbies house — welcome to every woman’s experience in the real world in 1950 and prior ken is trying to show men in a lighthearted way — what it’s like to live in a patriarchal society — but it’s through a matriarchal society — just genders flipped

barbie owed ken an apology barbie treated ken horribly reverse the genders — which they do during the kendom part — and it’s  behavior",2023-07-23 17:01:04
"sure but being hurt because someone didnt return your affection doesnt mean you take over their house and generally act like a  either

edit
im trying to say that kens behaviour wasnt great either and in the end barbie is the only one apologising when her crime was basically not loving ken back this justifies his revenge on barbie and i guess this didnt sit well with me because of the very real issue of women rejecting men and in some cases paying for it even with their lives",2023-07-23 18:14:22
"yeah i thought the message was clear barbie was righting the wrongs she saw in the real world she understood that womens suffering in the real world was wrong she realized barbies were doing the same thing to kens and apologized for that treatment and for being an active part of a society where kens self worth was attached to pleasing barbie

thats why the denial of the kens to be on the supreme courtbe a part of government was a conclusion that missed the mark still loved the movie though",2023-07-23 15:33:13
"ok i didnt really like this movie overall it was alright but mostly i was disappointed it didnt live up to the hype 

however to your point glorias monologue about the contradictions in what makes a perfect woman be smart play dumb be a mom but have a career be attractive but dont flaunt it be ambitious and a go getter but be caring and dont hurt anyones feelings

you cant figure out how the kens are supposed to be because the expectations on them are the same as women in real life we want them to stay in their place and not upset the barbies yet we also want them to have more depth more intelligence but not too much not too demanding we want them to have more agency but not to grab the power off the barbies 

for the barbies to be happy they have to be in charge there is no equality the the kens because thats just not how things are done around here they actually dont have a good reason for not aiming for equality other than fear of loss of their own power

it was mostly goslings ken who was played for the idiot the rest of the kens were just living with less power but in history women were not even allowed a full education because we were deemed not intelligent enough for it the media portrayal of men being  generally is a kind of petty revenge but in a movie about feminism it was to be expected being denied education in the real world because you are not intelligent enough is not something i can ever see happening to men its supposed to make people uncomfortable it made me uncomfortable and im female but men have done that to women in far more real ways than just media portrayal and thats the point if the movie wasnt about feminism then this portrayal would be unfounded but its trying to make you think i have a lot of gripe with the execution of it but i can see the reasoning",2023-07-25 09:32:40
the movie ends with barbie apologizing to ken and empowering him to be his own person and the barbies say they dont want things to go back to the way things were and start to work towards equality in barbieland its right there in the movie,2023-07-25 15:44:35
that was exactly my thought lol,2023-07-25 17:09:04
"i think the fact that the battle ended up a dance battle that turned into a coop dance scene was really good progression i do think a solo ken movie where he can find himself in an antipatriarchal comfort of positive masculinity would be really amazing

but yea the movie is about barbie i get how cinematically there was space to further resolve ken stuff but it’s not women’s jobs to fix men",2023-07-29 16:55:52
"the movie was not about ken the movie was about barbie the thinking they missed that is you missing the point by a mile

why would they make half the movie about men when part of the theme is that women often have very little to do with the plot of films whether as a driving character and are mainly treated as accessories to mens lives",2023-07-29 04:31:18
no because if they ended up together it would reinforce that ken deserves barbie just because he’s into her that is how 90 of movies go,2023-07-24 13:18:11
when the dance scene starts ryan’s ken moves his back foot first before the rest of the kens all of the other dance moves are nearly in sync idk how to post a clip i just watched it last night and noticed the same thing the op commenting was talking about,2023-09-25 07:41:35
no if it was outdated this film would’ve been made way earlier,2023-07-24 13:05:29
"as a woman in 2023 that still encounters sexism and seeing the amount of men in the comment section that absolutely do not even understand this movie — i would say it’s absolutely not outdated

my grandmother who is still alive wasn’t able to have her own credit card all her mail was addressed with my grandpas name and she couldn’t legally own anything ruth bader ginsburg helped change a lot of those laws with the supreme court that wasn’t even a 100 years ago my grandma is still alive

i don’t understand why men think everything is solved that kind of systemic injustice takes almost a century to being to start to heal",2023-07-24 13:25:39
exactly  i was thinking it would have actually been more shocking if ken and barbie did end up together in this film considering the year and director it was easy to predict them doing the “barbie doesn’t need a man and ken has to accept that” bit,2023-07-24 14:08:55
"i can guarantee you i’ve seen more movies than you have in your entire life

i’ve watched more movies from the 50s than most people i know 

i can think of a million movies that are extremely sexist

get over yourself seriously",2023-07-24 14:59:28
exactly keep going and you might make it under the 100 levels of satire to the real point being made,2023-07-31 13:25:13
yes you got the point,2023-07-31 13:50:53
you are completely correct and that was the point of the film,2023-07-31 18:21:13
to me the point of it being vengeful is that the real life men should be fuxing grateful real women in movement want equality and not just to reverse our fates like this whole movie is an exaggerated fever dream absolutely not meant to be taken at face value,2023-07-31 11:34:45
it unfortunately is some peoples idea of feminism and the movie is pretty clear that that is also not ideal,2023-07-31 18:18:26
yeah but there are still inherent issues regarding patriarchy that effect other western societies there is still sexism misogyny transphobia and homophobia all of which are by products of the patriarchy also im speaking of america because this is an american web forum discussing an american movie,2023-07-31 19:32:20
abortion seems more like a religious issue with america rather than one specifically stemming from men in charge you could have loads of societies be totally male dominated and they might never think to ban abortion or even might be pro abortion,2023-08-01 04:58:42

and if you do not agree woe be to you ",2023-07-22 14:55:43
i actually enjoyed this movie i have 0 problems with it i just am amazed by the insanity flowing through this comment section i don’t understand how people can’t realize everything to do with this movie are blatant stereotypes of both men  women respectively the second barbie enters the real world she has men cat calling her and being disrespectful and ken is also disrespected in barbie world the entire movie is making fun of both men and women stereotypes i don’t see where and why people are saying this was meant to  misogynistic men,2023-07-23 01:25:06
never said that just that ken was created to support barbie hes quite literally an accessory and always has been,2023-07-26 03:45:15
"it is actually they very publicly brokeup in 2004 and didn’t get back together until 2011 when ken begged for barbie back barbie and ken’s dynamic in barbie life in the dreamhouse is very much like it was portrayed in the barbie movie also ruth handler stated that barbie and ken will never get married which mattel has honoured

many critiques of the barbie movie arise due to lacking knowledge of the barbie lore and canon i think it is possible to enjoy the movie without that knowledge similar to enjoying a random marvel movie without having watched the previous films but it is immaculate with the background knowledge if you are interested the podcast america hysteria just released a phenomenal podcast that goes through the barbie references nearly pointbypoint

yeah that’s the part that i thing is weird and ultimately impacts the movie negatively,2023-07-26 05:16:48
that was the point though it wasnt in favor of misandry it was trying to illustrate the issues of inequality by flipping the genders and pointing out the hypocrisy now flip it around and watch oppenheimer was it as clear that the women in that film were treated as objects and nothing else,2023-07-26 02:01:57
the woman he wants doesnt want him so he deserves to take over the world is exactly the kind of toxic entitlement theyre talking about jfc,2023-07-26 02:03:42

i love that you did happy that you realized this good luck,2023-07-21 17:32:52
yeah but its not just about diversity in casting its also or even more so about the writing and the way it tackles—or doesnt—the issue,2023-07-22 01:10:55

the movie at the end makes the point that you need to have a  to be a woman,2023-07-21 21:43:59
not a dumb question at all also just found out theres a barbie played by trans actress hari nef  so rest assured this movie is for all women and i hope you have the best time with your sister,2023-07-21 21:55:03
amazing enjoy,2023-07-21 18:16:37

not exactly  what you see in the trailers has virtually nothing to do with her becoming human,2023-08-05 02:01:13
she goes to the real world in the trailers she’s still a doll just human size at that time,2023-08-05 03:52:31
its a minor one used to support a larger theme,2023-08-05 04:38:21
i kind of just assumed shed get factory reset and returned to barbieland or maybe retired like a westworld robot,2023-07-26 04:05:59
i liked it because it did echo my opinions to a point but at the same time there were a number of scenes that made me very uncomfortable because i noticed some toxic traits portrayed by the kens that i recognised in myself and being able to walk out of the theatre with new insight was incredible,2023-07-22 02:07:39
"its cause theres lotta generic white dude youtubers who are all like its fine everythings good but why did it have to have so much commentarrryyyyyyy

like i think even if you were not tuned into the commentary which would be hard cause its very in your face itd be hard not to have a  of fun with this movie",2023-07-22 02:39:03
"lol

for some reason your comment made me laugh thanks for that ",2023-07-25 23:57:39
"i just dont see how thats relatable to the vast majority of men who have never depended on women for their self worth

its muddling the real world messaging by reframing it in the exaggerated subservient relationship that kens have with barbies in barbieland",2023-07-22 16:01:28
because of the heavy reliance of current hot topics and buzzwords plus the fact that people who enjoy those things and the message they convey are overlooking that this movie is quite badly written once where out of the current cultural zeitgeist this thing will look like a mess,2023-07-29 08:21:52
"apologies it honestly felt generated when i peeked at your post history  saw nearly the exact same 2 opening sentences almost verbatim in your elvis review it seemed more likely to be the case

he is given a chance to redeem himself  but that doesnt mean he gets to do it within barbies space and life anymore,2023-07-21 11:45:00

did you just call the invention of nuclear weapons “petty political drama”,2023-07-21 21:10:36

how,2023-07-21 05:23:24
yeah very likely but she is promoting barbie as its director which likely a loophole for her not to cross pickets,2023-07-24 06:26:32
i think at the end they were just showing the real world where things are not equal it was a genderflip parody female president lol they let the women i mean the men have some token seats in the cabinet,2023-07-26 06:26:59
"i’ve said it before but that’s literally what happened to women 

the first female federal judge was appointed in 1949 

the kensurrection was like their revolutionary war or sufferage 

women didn’t get automatically get on the supreme court in fact out of 115 justices only 6 have been women with the first appointed in 1981",2023-07-23 18:06:53
it’s easier to see the beauty in someone else’s imperfections than your own,2023-08-15 01:24:16
the woman was a cameo from the girl she was based on barbara handler,2023-08-16 21:28:18
"nah theres several others albeit some that are more nuanced than explicitly called out

 kens conversion to total patriarchy ahole only happens because he felt undervalued and found instances in the real world that validated him and then he started reading about all the horse stuff which led to more and more until kenland a parallel to figures like andrew tate and the like validating young men

all this to say men arent inherently bad like feminism may sometimes frame them to be and thats different than the patriarchy itself as we understand it today

 similarly its admitted that barbie was stringing him along with the whole every night is girls night thing and also wasnt upfront with him overall until the end

 the whole postcry point of be your own person if the cry itself is that only thing you focus on then thats a bit weird imo lol

 a super smaller point cause im not 100 it was effective in doing so but just showing men in more effeminate positions in the movie like the big dance scene does help men who enjoy conventionally unmanly things even in 2023

there might be a few others scattered around but promen themes arent just things that pat dudes on the back not sure what else you could be looking for",2023-07-21 15:53:24
dudes not being pitted against oneanother anymore because the patriarchy has been defeated is fairly promen tbh,2023-07-21 15:56:50
"no thats one of the points of the movie society run by one gender sucks both ways and it doesnt magically change overnight 

it is supposed to be unfair to kens but with the hope that their temporary coup and fight for individuality leads to a gradual uprising in society thus the line and maybe one day kens will have as much power in barbieland as women do in the real world

also they werent completely disregarded they did get a ken in a lesser court just not the supreme court where previously they had no power at all its a decent step",2023-07-23 04:48:14
"right but thats like saying

i know i shouldnt eat poison but does anyone else think eating poison is a good idea",2023-07-24 21:10:24
personally it felt like an acknowledgement of the issues but the only solution was oh well deal with it,2023-07-22 01:13:29
"i was fine with it i understand barbieland is supposed to be a kind of mirror for the real world but a more evolved and aware one now like how the modern world is more aware too etc

i was just confused by the comment more than anything",2023-07-22 01:51:54
barbieland is a matriarchy kens were oppressed in barbieland,2023-07-31 08:50:51
they got their first taste of governance a circuit court seat with a promise of more in the future if it goes well a parallel of how women irl worked their way up from regular judge positions until finally reaching the supreme court they got progress with a brighter future,2023-07-21 03:13:25
women are and were always considered an important part of human society  men have always loved and cherished them everything men do is for women this is as true today as it has always been even when men take on roles of leadership or compete for position of status they do so for women even in a so called patriarchy women are more comfortable protected and welloff as a whole than men and men are doing what women expect of them  male chauvinism was not as common as you think it was and the fact that men didnt really appreciate women trying to womensplain to men their own field of expertise wasnt the same thing as women not being valued,2023-07-23 03:09:17
the message would be better if it was proceeds to explain the exact message of the film,2023-07-21 20:39:02
"
 please tell us more about what women need to do",2023-07-21 20:34:33
i dont think its overdone i think the movie done it in a really refreshing and empowering way the advice given to ken is definetely supposed to be to women because barbieland is reversed so ken is equivalent to women in the movie,2023-07-21 20:33:07
"it’s a movie at the end of the day gerwig made stylistic choices and the movie had a comedic undertone the choice to make all the ken’s kind of a joke was not to be taken as a literal description of real men 

to your point about wanting more examples from the beginning of the movie as a woman it didn’t take much imagination to picture a world consistent with the real world that instead valued women more than men you needing more examples to understand is a result of you being a man in a patriarchal world which again is the point of the movie 

i appreciate the honest discourse around this and my comments aren’t to be taken as an attack i just hope you can understand that women who watch this movie seem to all get the point immediately whereas men need an extra minute at the end to think about it it makes sense that it would work that way since women live this reality every day but i hope you are able to digest the true message of the movie the women in your life will thank you",2023-08-05 22:14:59
yeah look at the women roles in the majority of movies that empower men,2023-08-05 22:18:41
"barbieland is a reverse of the real world though the kens are used to represent how women are treated it’s wild to me how mostly men are upset about how the film treats men and can’t comprehend that’s how women are actually treated 

the whole point of the movie was encapsulated in this line basically maybe one day kens can have the same kind of power women in the real world do

the kens weren’t taken seriously because that’s how it is for women",2023-07-23 00:16:15
"that’s not my only defense lol it was to make a point to misogynists like yourself but i know trying to have a conversation with people like you and the original commenter is ultimately pointless 

barbieland is a reverse of the real world the kens are used to represent how women are treated it’s wild to me how men are upset about how the film treats men and can’t comprehend that’s how women are actually treated they were proving a point that so many of y’all missed",2023-07-23 00:13:00
"i’m not a mother i said i was a woman who has a mother 

i didn’t insult you because we have different opinions on a movie it was because you clearly hate women 

i definitely do have some serious issues though and they all stem from the fact that i am a woman who has to deal with misogynists like you every day",2023-07-23 00:30:09
"you seem to be struggling to understand the themes of the film and ken’s arc in particular so i’m copying part of another comment i made explaining it i hope this helps

ken arguably has just as big of a character arc and journey of self discovery as barbie does he starts off as an accessory to barbie his only purpose in life is to be near her in the real world he learns about patriarchy and loves the idea of a society where men and horses are powerful and in charge he goes back to barbie land to turn it into a patriarchy but it still doesn’t make him happy instead of defining himself as barbie’s boyfriend now he defines himself by his house and his car and his clothes and possessions all he wants in life is a sense of identity and to feel needed and wanted and powerful but instead the system that he himself has put in place holds him back and imposes strict roles on him that he doesn’t really want he only becomes truly happy when he starts looking inward to define and accept himself for who he is as a person and realises that he’s kenough

there’s a really sweet message in there about how society hinders men from living as their authentic selves because of the roles we as a society place on men as well as women all too often men are defined by how much money they make and how many beautiful women they have around them instead of who they are as human beings the whole andrew tate idea of hyper masculinity encourages men to be as shallow and materialistic as possible and then blames women for expecting them to be rich alpha males

if you’re upset by the end of the movie where the kens make some social progress but still get treated as second class citizens with less power than the barbies good that’s the point it’a a deliberate mirror to how women are treated in society today progress has been made but there’s still a lot of work to do

the message of the movie isn’t ‘men bad women good’ it’s that humanity is complicated and messy and we put systems in place that harm us all",2023-07-23 00:35:23
your the silly comment man youre the silly comment now go  your bed,2023-08-05 02:57:15
"you seem to be triggered and are being rude for no reason i never even said anything about the movie being bad so you need to chill out so i wont bother giving you detailed explanations other than  
 barbies being played with by girls affecting individual barbies with no further explanation this implies there could be infinite barbie worlds dictated by individual kids

 barbies getting brainwashed instantly by a single ken even though they were powerless

 the actual production of the barbies and how that fits into the real word why anyone in that world actually cares if the barbies leave barbie land

x200b

edit looking at your other replies here you just seem like you are toxic and or trolling so im just going to block you",2023-08-04 06:37:50
"you missed the point

what you call an emotional manipulation scene the rest of us call a realistic portrayal of the truth of gender power dynamics  

so you wanted the barbies and kens to come together in equality well that isnt realistic women have been able to vote for 100 years and yet still only make up 27 of congress  but the point isnt that we should strive for equality because that isnt very realistic instead the message is we shouldnt be dicks to one another and its going to take us men to stop being so defensive about ourselves and learn the thing that women have had to learn on their own that we are okay just the way we are and well be okay if and when were no longer in power",2023-07-23 22:33:18
bricklayers arent in charge last time i checked,2023-07-23 22:06:04
i am talking about the majority though way more people think flash was a very good movie and way more think barbie is a really bad movie than the contrary,2023-08-02 13:51:56
that’s still extremely subjective lol i know a lot of people children that still like that movie specifically that one the bigger problem is the movies that came after but very telling thats your viewpoint lol,2023-07-31 14:23:56
"i don’t think so long  it was very in line with the type of casual joking born out of close loving and comfortable relationships among family members if a man can’t handle that kind of “disrespect” then i would seriously question his ability to have a seriously healthy relationship with women family friends and himself 

i think there are probably plenty of examples of male characters which i’ll use instead of “heroes” casually being dismissive or insulting of their female partners without losing an ounce of sympathy from the audience 

men’s rights is a  cause from one man to another",2023-08-06 15:46:07
"my perception of him was different for two reasons

1 the driving bit was not about implying that the husband was lesser for not being a crazy driver it was about gloria not wanting to have the i had other lovers before your father conversation with her preteen daugter in the middle of a car chase

2 the thats cultural appropriation comment from the daughter is not meant to be accepted at face value just like we dont accept barbies a fascist because the daughter called her one gerwigs showing a very real modern archetype of a preteen girl who is passionate about social justice but doesnt quite yet understand the context of the causes shes championing

that is correct im not sure how the person youre responding to didnt understand that unless they didnt watch the movie,2023-07-22 23:33:32
i mean the message was men and women deserve equal rights and the point was to show that the kens have less rights than barbies just like women have less than the men in the real world they literally said that in the movie,2023-07-22 23:57:18

i went into it blind with my dad who was definitely not expecting much from it and we were both very pleasantly surprised as a woman the movie was already so impactful but as a woman thats trans everything had that extra layer to it as well in a way that is difficult to describe in a reddit comment overall i loved it and it was the first time in a while that i left at the end feeling that impacted by a movie,2023-07-24 09:44:44
"personally i feel like the line at the end is more to point out the hypocrisy of the barbie in charge though like yeah we want equality for you but not so fast not a no you shall not be in charge because you  

that’s not to mention the movies depiction of the kens totally wanting to take over barbieland and make all the barbie’s objects with no thought for their own

the movies depict the kens as wanting to be appreciated recognised and being acknowledged as important and taking over barbieland helps them do that because thats the only way they learn i think there is a clear distinction between portraying them as having evil intentions and doing evil because thats the only mean for equality in barbieland they have ever known but ofc its subject to interpretation i think you just need to look at ryans ken entire character arc which was very consistent in this depiction the joy he got and his emphasis was never about he can bully barbie around it was because he is appreciated valued he can be important he can have fun by himself and with the boys and he no longer needs to be just an auxiliary to barbie who obviously mistreated him and took him for granted

the men in the real world are kinda caricatures though and i agree that is one thing the movie can be attacked on some people are just a bit too zealous to attack anyone who has a different opinions on the movie even though many of them are totally valid though i think the movie also really does suffer from mean spirited attacks by people who are upset by anything with feminism inside as well",2023-07-31 09:58:12
"ken definitely has a character arc he learns to show emotion and the power of men supporting eachother emotionally he also learns that his value isnt tied to masculine things such as whether girls barbie are attracted to him or not

its funny youre upset that the kens were  and easily manipulated when the movie shows all the dolls to be easily manipulated the barbies are equally manipulated into accepting kens patriarchy after he visits the real world what saves barbieland is a human who manages to deprogram the barbies

the movie plays with gender roles and barbieland is a gender flip of the real world where men hold most positions of power the irony of the ending where barbie returns to power and only allows ken minor positions of power is intended it reflects the real world where women have fought for a long time and usually only get to take small steps forward at a time

finally even if the main message of the movie were simply about womens empowerment why would that be a bad thing",2023-07-26 07:58:32
is it really necessary for men to have a character arc in the barbie movie the joke of the ending that went over your head is that it is a horrible ending for ken because as the movie puts it theyre finally on par with women in the real world,2023-07-26 07:39:20
"it doesn’t really glorify a matriarchy yes it definitely bashes the patriarchy heavily throughout the film but the whole thing is satirical anyway barbie’s not happy at the end when the barbie land issue gets “resolved” and in fact the movie even states that she “doesn’t get an ending” what i think gerwig is trying to say here is that the return to matriarchy with the beginnings of the ken suffragette movement is not the endpoint it’s the beginning of change 

i would say if you come away thinking that any entrenched gender imbalance is good then that’s a very surfacelevel analysis of the film the commentary on the real world patriarchy is done to set up a juxtaposition with the barbie land matriarchy we spend the whole film talking about how male power imbalance is awful but rightly the same arguments apply to female power imbalance too barbie is not happy by the end she as the stereotypical barbie rejects this completely 

i would say the absurdity of barbie land is the same as the absurdity of men in the real world thinking gender equality is achieved it’s completely ludicrous and disillusioning… and that’s the point if you’re put off by that good that’s how a lot of women feel about the real world 

ken even makes what i think is a pivotal comment near the end of the second act something to the effect of “now you know how it feels” the kens takeover makes barbie feel awful but likewise the kens have always felt awful in barbie land any system with entrenched gender imbalances makes the powerless feel pathetic infantilised and ignored",2023-07-21 13:07:50

1 was introduced as nothing but a dude whos obsessed with barbie and wants to be her boyfriend


2 all the other kens fight each other for barbies attention twice once in the beginning and once at the finale because they value the themselves based on their relationship with barbie


3 kens insecurities werent resolved and that lead him down a path of toxic masculinity which leads him to find superficial confidence and a false sense of belonging and began performing acts of violence against women both domestically turned all the barbies into  servants and legislatively rewriting the constitution clear analogies for both the domestic and legislative harm that occurs when insecure men begin taking their rage out on the women they based their self worth on like the dobbs ruling and its fallout he even says that all he ever wanted was for barbie to accept him and he had his whole life turned around by the one time one girl gave him a compliment something many people on this very website will state is one of the more difficult aspects of being a young boy the kens obsession with barbie is also what led to their downfall because they still couldnt just be themselves

well men commit more crimes than women and have more trouble talking about their feelings therapy is available to everyone but men are far less inclined to take advantage of those resources this is in part because of the toxic ideas men were raised with that opening up and feeling your feelings is weak that translates into violence toward yourself and others when anger and aggression are the only emotionalexpressive states you view as safe the problem is the attitudes men have learned about vulnerability and women as a whole which affects men as well as women,2023-07-23 21:43:38

there are a lot of men in a bad place and there are also a lot of women in a bad place its not an even split of mens mental health is being overlooked so all women must be thriving

it also worries me that you say more men than ever are reporting not having  or a romantic partner in over a year  and romance is not something men are entitled to receive from women and its not something women give out either its a mutual activity that both partners consent to it may seem skewed at times but that is the reality

they were boyfriend and girlfriend or she at least allowed ken to say that without objecting but she pretty much just used him as a prop right next to her dream house and all her other cool stuff its like just as much importance as a kid who might say my barbie has it all she has a mansion and a car and a phone and a boyfriend and roller blades and a ton of friends and hes just an item on a checklist of stuff a cool girl has without her wanting to dive into any of the needy stuff,2023-07-29 14:14:27
people who grew up with barbie are the demographic age doesn’t matter i watched it with my mom and my sister and we definitely took it very seriously considering the very real topics this movie discussed personally i haven’t seen anybody upset that children are attending the barbie movie if anything i’ve been seeing a lot of parents bring their children to it where did you get that from also it’s the 21st century barbies or the color pink are not just for little girls,2023-08-01 21:06:57

"it really is a devious trap for the promen movement  

if youre upset at the portrayal of men in this movie well have i got news for you dude",2023-07-23 17:04:49
"everyone got it it’s not subtle the problem is when you portray the kens as idiots and the barbies much smarter and the real world women as sympathetic and smart battling agains the dumb bad patriarchy it is an clearly uneven portrayal which makes it look like the movie is saying women in charge are better and mens struggles are a joke
if the writers had of put aside there need to portray all mens real or ken as idiots and made some of the women and barbies as more obviously bad or dumb the way the men were portrayed  it would have been a good point made  but as they couldn’t get over their bitterness toward men it isn’t
and obviously they wouldn’t make barbie be a villain of her own movie which was why this plot wasn’t able to make that point or perhaps gerwig just really feels women are better than men idk

also the thing that’s confusing and sending mixed messaging is that ken is the equivalent of women in the real world in barbie land yet he is also representing some kind of patriachyincel role  so because they tried to do it both ways it just comes off as making a joke of men while treating womens real world struggle against patriarchy as some great thing you can’t have it both ways

the writing wasn’t good they tried to make ken represent too many things and the point was lost but that’s what happens when you put idiology over character cohesion feminist talking points were made but the message of the actual movie was muddied",2023-07-23 17:36:24
"good points 

i guess i still dont have an issue with it because it was used as a good device to create the upsidedown power dynamic in barbieland and the political commentary from that 

you can disagree thats cool but i dont think it makes sense to be upset that they didnt accurately portray history so that the men were made to look like fools in the barbie movie like what would you expect but whatever

 it was clearly trying to get the word stuck in peoples heads

"idk man clearly you are dead set on seeing what you want to see in this movie im a man and i wasnt offended by it or anything its definitely a feminist movie but i dont think the main takeaway should be or is supposed to be all men are dumb and bad haha 

they definitely mocked male stereotypes but every negative depiction of men in this film i felt was based in at least some reality and was humorous we all know the guitar  or the guy who has to over explain every movie its funny because its relatable 

 its absolutely a girl power film but i seriously doubt gerwigs intent was to offend or insult men or turn women against them

i will say i wish they had fleshed out the ken storyline a bit more and given them some more depth but im almost certain this movie will get a sequel and maybe well see that then either way i didnt feel like this movie was some kind of attack on men",2023-07-23 16:09:56

"the point is that barbie can’t solve sexism barbie was revolutionary in championing women’s aspersions and goals outside of the home barbie was an astronaut before a woman every went to space she has been a president before any woman was she owned a home before antidiscrimination laws were implemented to prevent married women from being denied a mortgage 

conversely barbie has also been heavily criticized for being perfect creating unrealistic beauty expectations and using “girlboss” feminism to sell dolls barbie despite all her attributes cannot solve feminism the entire movie was predicated on the barbies’ false belief that their existence solved sexism at least for women 

it would be hypocritical for the movie to then turn around and say “okay barbie didn’t fix sexism before but now she has” to me the ending showed that barbie can have both negative and positive effects on sexism america ferrara’s character speaks to the contradictions women face in her speech the same is true for barbie as a pop culture icon she had been heavily criticized by progressives and conservatives she is a problematic fave so isn’ fitting that the solution the imperfect barbies come up with is identical to solution us imperfect humans have come to an ending in which sexism is solved would have been hollow and contradictory to the thesis of the film",2023-07-26 06:20:24
"there is a difference between making fun of men and depicting ken as he exists in the broader barbie lore and canon ken was literally created as an accessory to barbie almost no one owned a ken unless they also owned a barbie he was not created to be played with on his own this is the ken depicted in the barbie movie the ken characters in barbieland’s existence is predicated on barbie perhaps an interesting contrast to the judeochristian belief that women were created to be men’s helpers re adam and eve 

the kens’ solution was to usurp the barbies’ power and subvert it they explicitly aimed to replace the matriarchy with the patriarchy initially the barbies wanted things to “go back to normal” make barbieland great again so to speak but they realized that absolute power harms everyone  barbie acknowledging it is tough making all the decisions instead they provided the kens with some autonomy albeit not complete equality 

the movie quips that like women the kens had to work for it however if you look at the initial issue the barbies’ belief that their existence had ended sexism it would be hypocritical for the film’s resolution to be that barbie initially did not end sexism but now it did this ending would feel hollow instead the underlying message is that barbie as a cultural icon has promoted female empower ex astronaut barbie was created before a woman ever went to space and regressed feminism unrealistic beauty standardsstriving for perfection barbie is not equipped to solve sexism barbie like women like humans is contradictory re america ferrera’s speech to the barbies",2023-07-26 06:36:08

it seemed to be less a critique of things men like and more a critique of men who presume women wouldn’t understand it the joke wasn’t that ken was watching the godfather the joke was that he talked over the entire movie to “explain it” it is different for someone to continually talk about a book they love that you would or have never read and someone explaining a book to you after you’ve read it because they assume you did not understand it,2023-07-26 04:52:05

i also think that it was designed to make some people feel uncomfortable while watching which is the point i personally felt a little attacked by some of the behaviours in the movie which i saw myself doing and i welcome that because now i can be more aware of that and hopefully make other people less uncomfortable in the future

overall if you saw the movie as bashing on all men then you might need to challenge the way you see men men can still be masculine without the toxic derogatory traits seen in the movie i dont think the movie was bashing on men just the problematic behaviours and mindsets most commonly seen in men

hope im not coming off as hostile just looking for a civil discussion",2023-07-22 01:37:45

i am a barbie collector 80s and 90s dolls and as a woman i was heartbroken by this movie i found it extremely sexist and frankly depressing i really dont understand this narrative that men are bad and women are amazing ive had negative experiences in my life with both sexes and i dont see anything constructive in portraying the other gender as the enemy ken was never an accessory the dreamhouse always had two chair and plates and pictures of ken all over the house i grew up thinking that ken and barbie were an idealised perfect couple something to dream of then i watch this movie and find out that barbie doesnt care where he lives she tells him you can go now when shes done talking and shes not in love with him i honestly found this movie heartbreaking,2023-07-22 01:29:58
" it’s ok to embrace traditional masculinity and feminity

and its okay to not just dont force one way of living onto people like you seem to want to do",2023-07-22 01:40:30
i am a feminist and i have several friends who are stayathome mothers so already your premise is false and also it is important to embrace masculinity and femininity just not in a way that puts men and women into boxes you want to know why i think you hate women i am a feminist and i think it’s great for women to make whatever choice makes them fulfilled you think there’s one acceptable choice that’s the difference,2023-07-22 01:32:32
you are not very familiar with feminism if you think it dictates anything especially if you think its constantly reexamined also yes stating your opinion like 725575675 times and stomping your little feet is an indication that you wish you could actually dictate other peoples lives from what i understand you probably from the eastern hemisphere right why is it always you folks both wanting to live in the western world but also want to change it to eastern standards if you are a guest at a place you should live by its rules and thats that,2023-07-22 03:02:42
it didn’t come over as curiosity at all because there wasn’t really a question presented more just an offhand statement about “what you had heard” and the irony that presented,2023-07-21 17:33:22

the narrator says kens have to start somewhere and eventually the kens will have just as much power and authority in barbieland as women do in the real world if you hear that and think wow thats super sexist against men congratulations thats the point,2023-08-04 02:14:58
"again i think this went way over your head that was supposed to be a parallel to what women went through when women first broke into the work force they weren’t allowed to have high positions this wasn’t being sexist toward the men   it was showing what women go through  but barbie land is a parallel universe where the men are the “women” 

but honestly idk why i’m even arguing with you",2023-08-04 00:49:55
alright then write the essay i’m sure you’ll do a good job at it if you try hard kenough,2023-08-04 02:35:12

i think the point of him is he isn’t trying to get looks from barbies he is content and secure in himself he just lives if he was concerned and felt overlooked then he wouldn’t be allan he’d just be another ken enough from whom his goal isn’t the same as kens which is to be with barbie imo id say you’re describing a ken masquerading as an allan,2023-08-03 23:06:04

"youre absolutely right that it should be that way but children have historically been pushed in directions even when playing with dolls yes that reaffirm archaic gender roles i think thats more the point i wanted a barbie so my gi joe could have a girlfriend and they could do secret missions together but my parents told me boys dont play with barbies yes thats a reflection on my parents which is a whole other conversation but we have to acknowledge that reality that many people have such stories from their childhood like mine

thats why we actively work to normalize it while yes it says a lot more about that person we have to consider that theyre just perpetuating what theyve been programmed to so much like america ferrera in the film actively working to break it for those people is a good thing",2023-07-25 13:59:02
i did sometimes i would want hot wheels or plastic puppy’s and got those from time to time   i would ask for american girls dolls but as a kid growing up i was more a tom boy i liked some of the nerf guns and my mom never even let me play with them at other ppls house bc it was to violent and boyish to do,2023-08-03 23:45:01
well yeah what else do you do with a babydoll boring and strange imo then and now did you ever express your dislike toward baby dolls or your interest in science did your family not allow you to play with the toys you wanted to for the record i’m the same i love pink and cute things but im a insectscience girl tho insects are cute imo but most would disagree,2023-08-04 01:25:29

what biological coding if you give little boys baby dolls before theyve learned that they are for girls theyll play with them just as readily i know because i did it dozens actually it might have been closer to hundreds of times when testing to see if toddlers had developed their pretend play skills yet,2023-08-06 05:02:35
that’s not the point we are saying that before fashion dolls the only toys available to young girls were baby dolls to look after and the idea of a woman’s only role in life is to raise a family is installed very early on to us yes we may naturally gravitate towards baby dolls but our whole life should not be about becoming a mother one day we weren’t put on this earth for the sole purpose of being a mother we have the option to become one but it’s not our duty to earth and that’s what barbie represented she represented to little girls that you can be more than a mother you can maybe the president one day you can be a doctor a nurse a teacher the owner of a house you do know that women weren’t even allowed to own their own credit card or open a bank account in their own name until the 1970s,2023-07-25 16:40:03

kens plotline felt much more cohesive he starts out placing all of his worth in the approval of a single person then learns he can just have everything his way through patriarchy and goes overboard in order to give barbie a taste of how he felt then realizes that doing that doesnt actually make him feel better he ends learning a lesson about how he treats others and how he views himself he is kenough",2023-08-01 00:57:48
"late to the thread but that was the whole point barbieland is a matriarchy and had always been run as one the kens have even less power than women in the realworld they dont have homes or identities outside of barbie 

you dont overturn years of disenfranchisement with a few nice speeches and people believing things should be better it would have been a naive message to say that everything will immediately be better

it is a direct parallel to realworld progress as women have slowly gained more positions in society the movie even shows the kens being excited and happy with the explicitly unequal compensation they were given in the same way how in the realworld we celebrate women gaining minor steps forward towards equality for instance it is seen as an achievement that women now make up 14th of the us congress the highest amount in the nations history while at the same time many people will claim that women are fully equal in the us",2023-08-22 23:17:59
because they are leaving kens in the same place women are right now in reality its even outright stated this way so its actually quite a bold political statement in the end because barbie world is a fiction but womens still unequal reality is not,2023-07-25 12:10:46

"simu is extremely cringe on social media for example his posts in fb group subtle asian traits that it annoys me sometimes but in the end he comes off as sincere and wholesome that i cant help but root for him

hes kind of like the real life mr peanutbutter from bojack",2023-07-22 05:43:01
all of this is completely new news to me i dont really pay attention to this kind of stuff,2023-07-22 19:10:10

"ryan gosling on who would win in a beach off him or margot robbie  “i don’t compare myself with anybody” gosling said 

then he rolled up his sleeve and showed a tattoo of galloping horse 

“i’ll let you interpret that however you want” gosling said",2023-07-22 00:26:57
“that  gosling boomed me”,2023-07-22 02:00:32

seeing rnba bleed into a barbie movie discussion warms my heart especially a jimbo reference,2023-07-30 00:50:50
i felt like ryan and margot went through the same exact journey basically however margot met this awesome mother and daughter who helped her deal with these new emotions and grow instead of meeting an awesome person to help ken out he ended up learning about patriarchy,2023-07-30 03:04:21
are you doing a bit,2023-07-24 02:23:12
like you said his physicality is off the charts good theres a moment near the very end when he tries to hugkiss barbie the second time and then he very dramatically slaps himself and kinda falls over and it had me dying like thats barely a joke on the page but he just squeezed maximum hilarity out of every moment and gesture,2023-07-21 05:34:15
before this movie was released i was telling everyone how underrated gosling’s physical comedy is there’s just something about his timing  expressions and movement that kills me,2023-07-23 01:58:50
i’m not trying to change your mind about gosling he was great as was robbie but it’s not undisputed i just disputed it,2023-07-21 02:58:56

corpsing is a term from acting for when an actor needs to be serious or completely non responsive such as when playing a dead corpse but something happens and they just cant stop themselves from smiling giggling laughing or otherwise giving away that they are in fact having a good time instead of being serious or dead,2023-07-26 16:59:10

none of those logos bothered me and im an american who watched it in the states i guess the chevy car logo did stick out after a while during the chase but in the end it was a movie affixed in the world of mattel so nothing was going to outshine that for me branding wise,2023-08-14 03:37:21

not only was it hilarious but it was honestly a visual marvel like my jaw was in the floor it was just absolutely beautifully art directed and choreographed and i especially love that they were arranged in a giant v ,2023-07-22 04:46:40
it was just so hilarious that i couldn’t look away,2023-07-21 04:30:07
the ken war was by far the highlight of the movie for me just a bunch of cool dudes having the time of their lives both onscreen and obviously even behind the scenes,2023-07-21 09:33:42
 besides the fact that this scene was hilariously over the top it was beautifully shot from the music and lighting down to the camera work everything was so good i couldnt look away i think thats my most favorite scene in the entire film,2023-07-23 17:53:11
i want to watch that scene on repeat over and over,2023-07-21 14:46:57
just out of curiosity whereabouts did you watch it,2023-07-22 09:01:58
i turned to my daughter and we were both crylaughing funniest thing i’ve seen in cinema i think,2023-07-23 21:39:10

"my girlfriend immediately turned to me and said “i need to get you one of those”

and i have absolute confidence they’re actually going to produce those",2023-07-21 03:43:21
so much genius marketing for this movie but not having an official sweater ready to drop on opening night that says i am kenough was a pretty big mistake,2023-07-21 15:04:11
i need the hoodie from the movie,2023-07-21 07:06:23

"brilliant

edit of course its sold out lol",2023-07-22 16:14:49
"for what it’s worth i think it’s just sort of a foregone conclusion that mr is getting nominated for best actress you’re correct that she was nothing short of amazing in this film and it’s not like she hasn’t turned in other incredible performances but this one is just next level it’s too early to know who will ultimately be nominated but i’d be shocked if she’s not a front runner which is in and of itself astounding for a female lead in a comedy

i think the other commenter you replied to is correct in that rg is getting talked about so much because a mostly comedic turn is just way easier to explain what you liked about it and comment on in a social media post than the much more complicated role that mr had to pull off and of course on a maledominated space like rmovies comments about him will get the majority of the attention hmm wonder if there’s a recent movie that dives into this topic lol it’s just easier for people to do the anchorman thing where they just quote one of his hilarious lines about patriarchy and it gets sent to the top

rg mostly just had to nail the himbo role not easy to be fair and i could totally see him getting a much deserved best supporting nom and while he had some moments of serious weight it’s not even close to the balancing act mr had to pull off she had to be funny believably perfect as a barbie believably imperfect as a “broken” barbie carry the majority of the emotionally weighted scenes although special shoutout to af for nailing the gerwig monologue about what society demands of women and basically just tie this entire thing together and she did it with aplomb the movie would be worse if rg wasn’t in it but i don’t think he’s completely irreplaceable in his role i can’t think of a single other actor other than mr who could have made barbie work to the extent that it did major props to her and gg",2023-07-23 12:38:21
"yup and la la land crazy  love his episode of  history the notebook and remember the titans are all mostly comedic turns or have comedic scenes that he completely nails dude is versatile af and really underrated as a comedic performer

crazy that young hercules is still crushing it well into his 40s",2023-07-23 12:53:59

such a good book right after reading it i found out it was being adapted i didnt think it would make a good movie but after seeing arrival a few weeks ago i can see how they could do it pretty excited for that one,2023-07-21 05:24:33
this has me unreasonably excited man i really hope they pull it off,2023-07-21 20:37:35

"such a great comedic performance holland march is definitely one of my favorite performances from gosling

don’t forget the cigarette falling in his underwear,2023-07-21 14:13:00
it’s because they only stopstart listening at points that are factual about what women go through but they don’t want to hear  president barbie made it clear she did not want it the “old way” and even the ceo tho ken’s ideas were selling he wasn’t about it he still wanted little girls to have the hopes and dreams  the money,2023-07-21 07:26:48
they got the point that kens were the oppressed group in barbieland but wanted the barbies to to automatically give them half the power missed the point that barbies were always flawed and end still flawed just like us,2023-07-21 07:04:42
its an antired pillincel sentiment while still being sympathetic the only people upset are those that bought into the grift,2023-07-21 07:23:47
expecting that crowd to have media literacy isn’t worthwhile it’s why they fall for right wing propaganda so easily the film is about how the patriarchy hurts both men and women and how we need to work together for true equality of which there’s still a long ways to go that’s not a controversial message unless you’re a ,2023-07-21 08:30:13
yeah it was as much about humans finding themselves as some feminist taking it back movie,2023-07-21 06:08:57
well thats the point if a girl doesnt want you  it doesnt mean that you are less of a person it just means that this girl doesnt want you and you might have to repeat that many times but still you should not judge your place in the world based on the  you are able to get find your own place,2023-07-23 03:26:20
anybody who thinks this movie is antimen is an absolute lost cause they missed the entire point i took my wife and daughter to the movie this morning i loved it more than they did ken is me,2023-07-21 21:50:14
agreed during the first half of the film i empathized with ken and felt for his situation his entire purpose is just to be a sidekick to barbie and he never gets to do the things he wants or have any ambitions of his own other than be just ken my takeaway was definitely that the film wanted to say that both the original barbieland and the kendom were flawed because they both heavily favored one part of the population thus kens arc felt both believable and ended on a great note,2023-07-23 18:40:55
it’s clearly antipatriarchy and i think some of the more  “poor media literacy” folks are conflating that with being antimalemasculine,2023-07-22 04:36:22
for some people antimisogyny is anti men,2023-07-23 09:14:53
for misogynists anything that doesn’t place men above women is antimen,2023-07-26 03:57:23
yeah there was a really deep message and sympathy that the movie had around the kens they overreacted when they got power but they were treated poorly and taken advantage of ken was in love with someone who didnt love him and strung him along and the movie very pointedly showed how cruel barbie was to him it was as much about ken finding himself as barbie,2023-07-30 00:06:12
i personally loved the inversion of the stereotypical crazy horse girl character for ken getting super duper into horses,2023-07-23 02:57:50
"good odds gosling gets supporting actor since they tend to get a little whimsical with those i’d say that category is downey jr’s to lose from the oppenheimer reviews that i’m reading 

i wouldn’t be surprised to see robbie get a best actress nomination there’s just more competition for a leading role and they tend to give those to the more serious movies

i think it’s a safe bet gerwig gets a director nomination nod though",2023-07-21 15:38:24
yes also when ken runs off crying and it just hard cuts to allen’s reaction holding back tears got me so good like we know just enough about allen but there’s still enough to make him so mysterious about how he actually feels about everything,2023-07-22 13:06:52
bo would never win a nobel prize in horses for instance,2023-07-21 04:46:13
yeah i think ken kinda has to be classically hot to make the premise work bos a step closer to allen energy than ken,2023-07-21 05:30:37
there were so many oddball lines like that throughout the entire movie will ferrell was a fountain of those in particular,2023-07-23 01:06:09
i mean its a probarbie the doll movie while also skewering the premises behind the doll thats quite a remarkable accomplishment,2023-07-21 07:25:59
yeah it felt like a compliment sandwich the criticism by the daughter is never fully addressed and then after the moms speech shes basically women get criticized for everything so it must be so much worse being a doll,2023-07-21 03:16:55
how long until barbie goes into public domain that movies gonna be good,2023-07-21 07:08:40
"the whole movie seems to be grappling with that and the intersection between barbies perfection and the real world

i agree mattel doesnt really care about will ferrells portrayal but i dont think the movie dodges the question  kids playing with barbies were dealing with that even as they played",2023-07-24 04:04:52
totally agree i was hoping they’d go deeper into a few of these themes the design choices they made gave solid subtext then they’d say something very basic like ai writing a barbiecritical tweet collectively it was good but didn’t quite scratch the itch i was hoping to get,2023-07-21 07:17:14
the daughter is speaking hyperbolically by saying it sent feminism back 50 years  but there is absolutely no questioning that there is a well established record of feminist groups critiquing barbie for perpetuating unrealistic body images since the 1970s there’s an entire section on the barbie wiki page dedicated just to this,2023-07-23 04:20:20
they…address that they literally address that in the movie no matter what women do it will never “be enough” to the point where even a doll will be criticized,2023-07-25 03:52:16
it’s like you didn’t watch the movie,2023-07-23 06:58:25
"yeahhhh there was a lot i loved about this movie but there was a lot that was weird maybe its because i spend a lot of time talking to women but it felt very weird to have america ferrera just kind of explode into what felt like a series of obvious complaints about being a woman in the real world then even weirder when saying those things to women who were programmed was treated like the solution that just fixed them instantly it wasnt weird that the next step in barbieland was to trick the men into having a beach off until they realized they really did all love each other 

but it was kind of weird how the movie sidestepped addressing what the solution is for the real world the movie just kind of yells at men and women who buy into the patriarchy and hopes theyll realize how silly and destructive it all is im not saying it needed to actually solve these things but it asked big questions before going into a really trippy and bizarre metaphysical question of what it means to be a real person instead of a plastic doll punctuated by the question of whether or not barbie has a  now it just left me feeling really weird",2023-07-24 08:16:40

well i think in that scenario she was representing someone unaware of their fascism  and barbieland was a bit fascist to begin with with the 2nd class citizkens and how they treated weird barbie  they all had their roles to play and could deviate  so i dont think its unfair to call barbie fascist but she wasnt aware of her fascist tendencies,2023-08-10 17:52:33

it wouldve also been much easier to digest if it didnt come off so preachy  i blame this one on the directing of this scene  it was like it was either done in one take or it was repeated and not felt there was no in between  a quieter more personal and heartfelt dialogue would have outshined whatever that was",2023-07-28 14:42:55

but in his mind its probably not as evil as we think it as after seeing barbie gain selfconsciousness to him hes just putting her back in her normal environment like releasing an animal back into the wild,2023-07-21 04:24:37
"i think he was actually being sincere upon seeing the full movie the box probably would just send her harmlessly back to barbieland

"toxic masculinity emotional stoicism instead of emotional openness general homophobia attached to any male emotion or connection women viewed as  conquests instead of human beings women viewed as lesser thans who belong in the home and belong to men physical strength and career earnings viewed as more important than developing an actual personality and interests going to the gym instead of going to therapy men in positions of power abusing that power and exploiting the power imbalance they have over others and creating a system that mostly covers up or facilitates their crimeswrongdoings men in power making political and legal decisions about womens bodies with barely any female input male dominated government bodies unrealistic body standards for both men and women and permitting or encouraging shaming of those who dont measure up etc

thats not to say that there werent things barbieland was doing wrong before ken brought back patriarchy it actually goes to show that where inequality exists things like patriarchy or matriarchy will flourish for the worst thats why barbie tries to empower ken in his own right by saying he doesnt need to do all that macho  to try to lock her down or impress her he should just learn to be himself like allen theres a reason allen doesnt like either kendom or barbieland and the allens continually escape hes looking for actual equality",2023-08-06 02:53:00
a big part of the movie is that these societies create internal strife by defining people in terms of profession possessions and relationships even when ken institutes the patriarchy its ultimately unsatisfying for him because even though societys perception of his value has increased hes still basing his selfassessment of worth on things that arent him but are just things he has the end of the movie is him accepting that hes not beach ken or barbies boyfriend but is his own selfactualized person with a selfworth thats unconnected to his relationships or profession,2023-07-23 06:42:13
"it was commentary on the negative effects of men tying their feelings of worth to womens views of them exacerbated by a society in which the kens are literally just made to be with the barbies and serve no other purpose

and yes a lot of incels do entirely connect their feelings of selfworth to how women perceive them the kens separating themselves from that rhetoric in the end and being confident on their own i am kenough is a positive message for men not a rag on them",2023-07-23 04:52:23
"no men can have feelings and like women women are not obligated to return the feelings are you obligated to love every woman who likes you 

but in the end she does apologize because she was treating him poorly and that was wrong but also let him know he’s enough he doesn’t need to be defined by her",2023-07-23 13:19:33
"that really fit the tone of the movie its not saying men are evil or even the problem its just saying that men are not women and therefore really dont understand

  


you become a part of the problem when you stop doing your best to understand it",2023-07-21 16:03:01
i actually didnt realize that was a stereotype until just now but  they do that a lot with hispanic women black women too although i think the sistas have a better lobby because you dont see it as much anymore ,2023-07-21 21:02:34
cobra kai,2023-07-23 04:24:36
ah now i understand your comment yeah could be,2023-07-21 12:07:26
"same 

my fiance was tickled to play push on our alexa when we got back from the theaters to prove its a real song lol",2023-07-21 18:18:22
the way they share and the general male groupthink it’s not sharing when you stare at someone while they watch and explain tarantino to them,2023-07-21 06:25:58
it was a few hours ago i think,2023-07-21 20:07:33
thats sad,2023-07-23 08:09:19
"you decide what that means

no you dont you are in a large part unconsciously shaped by society and its orientations its even debatable that you get to decide anything does your self worth come from seeing your wife laugh because you decided it or because it is a very common social paradigm that we get self worth from our love ones happiness",2023-07-23 05:14:50
eh it says one day the kens will get as much power so the kens are starting at a lower point plus the movie makes it clear that in the real world women are not fully equal with me so the kens getting to the same point as women in the real world isnt really equal,2023-07-27 13:41:55
angry  engaged  ad impressions sadly,2023-07-23 06:41:34
hahaha you realize the movie was supposed to be like a giant snl skit right you surely know satire no,2023-07-30 02:19:20
i can discern the difference between what is said and what is actually done,2023-08-11 10:32:15
are you kidding me with this question i feel so sad and sorry for this countries future gen z and the mellinial  males are flat out borderline shemales and oh so freaking soft you all have literally regressed males down sniveling whining completely whimpy whiners you all are embarrassment to males,2023-09-02 13:36:39
"i mean if the thing they took away was do whatever you want with this property just make it creative and appealing to millennials who like smart movies thats not necessarily the wrong idea 

just so long as they dont start checking boxes established by people on reddit who try to classify what an a24 movie is",2023-07-24 09:07:19
yeah movies are  expensive to make,2023-07-21 23:14:49
i get that but i think the whole point is that there was no room for independent women in the ken’s mojo dojo casa house,2023-07-24 00:07:51
i did notice that but they werent given a lot to do which is why they felt unnecessary to the plot i think if they were used as the main antagonist in the film it could have been slightly better,2023-08-04 19:59:40
there was 1 black man on the board,2023-08-04 22:07:47
hahaha ok ok good thank you they are playing at the park where i live so i was gonna go watch that there outdoor movie sounds fun thank you,2023-08-05 13:05:46
i think your explanation shows the movie did its thing in my opinion its the uneasiness and that feeling on the back of your neck feeling like something is going to happen its not as jump scary or outright frightening as other films but jack slowly descends into madness and the things he does are unsettling,2023-08-15 15:51:17
i think if that’s what you want to see going into it that’s what you’ll see there is a lot of nuance in the movie and i think does a good job of showing why it would be bad to have only females in charge or only males some of it is indeed a little preachy but for the most part it’s an entertaining unique and interesting movie which is more than i can say for a lot of movies these days,2024-01-08 08:09:22
thats why margos character left change in barbieland is dependent on the real world humans are the ones who can change,2024-01-24 14:26:36
bit of a sweeping generalization there friend,2024-01-09 01:57:23
"barbies problems are just as real as kens though she doesnt find the vocabulary or context to define them until later in the film  the cellulite isnt just about cellulite its a representation of concrete and deep fears like aging perceived worth devaluing with a decline in what society views as beauty loss of friendship or familiarity through uncontrollable events irreversible change unexpected growth and instability in life sudden self doubt and awareness of your own mortality and more 

you also have to remember that while barbie is privileged in her original world her emotions and perspective are impacted by gloria a woman who arguably experiences less privilege and entitlement due to her gender in the real world

to reduce it to a simple worry about cellulite is uncharitable to the thought put into the film and shows a lack of understanding about subtle approaches to nuanced themes",2023-12-12 01:45:24
im sorry do we advocate treating you like property,2023-07-21 16:51:09
yeah youre not from the generation that grew up with social media and the total fetishisation of degenerate culture nice to know you still get to live like this i truly hope every normie enjoys their life as much as possible  just know that in about 25 years time youll realize the horribile reality which has been left for your children and grandchildren who have to go through  to give their children the same joys that were simply handed to you,2023-07-21 19:02:37
"that is the point yes

from another commenter i thought it was so clever that in the end the barbie world remains matriarchal but throws a few concessions to the kens mirroring the real world where the world remains patriarchal but has essentially thrown a few concessions to women  ",2023-07-21 18:33:41
it was generally put back with room and an aim at improvement for the kens it was explicitly stated as such so the twisting and turning to look over that message is kind of weird it’s like some people really want to force it into an antimen box it was a bit more nuanced than that while also being over the top,2023-07-21 22:10:41
"ill give you that the representation outside world was a little over dramatized but it wasnt totally off base remember the patriarchy montage is the characters seeing a nonmatriarchal world for the very first time  of course seeing masculine hobbies and celebrities men working female jobs like construction worker or president and any sort of antifeminine sentiment would be highlighted quite heavily in their minds

the only time we see this world without kenbarbies point of view is the mattel offices but to that point mattels executive team is currently 70 men and all of the executive officers save for one is male",2023-07-22 06:26:15
 it doesn’t surprise me you can’t see the tenderness shown towards men while still highlighting the struggles women face this movie is clearly not for you maybe try transformers,2023-07-22 22:33:36
"its not an assumption all of these points of yours are not based in fact and are redpill talking points

finding yourself takes a lot of work and a lot of time and a lot of self discovery i set out to find myself years ago i feel closer to knowing but still unsure it took a lot of time and there is a long way to go 

finding yourself to me means to find ways to be content happy and fulfilled and that needs to come from within cause if it comes from a woman or man and she or he screws you over then your sense of self sense of fulfillment and sense of being happy is gone and relationships are fickle people will hurt you because thats human nature

dating apps are skewed yes i would not use them as a woman or a man they seem miserable for everyone there is like 20 men for every woman of course women will be very selective and men in turn desperate

an advice try to figure out how to stop being so bitter because this hatred you have for women really is not doing you any favors in the attracting a woman department maybe try asking women or being around women to learn more about women",2023-07-21 17:31:42
ah youre in the youll see ohhhhhh youll all see phase of being very normal,2023-07-21 18:44:25
is this a joke there are tons of movies like that just thinking to the last movie i saw in theaters before barbie the new transformers can’t recall a single reference to men being bad,2023-07-21 17:33:58
have you somehow missed that were the heroes in the vast majority of things that hollywood makes,2023-07-21 17:23:38
it 100 does exist for some  people in your attempt at gatekeeping you tried gatekeeping inceldom from a community that is not immune to it,2023-07-21 22:12:41
im a straight man and i also think youre full of ,2023-07-22 09:15:29
no…i really wouldn’t,2023-07-21 17:38:48
ah the 34 year old who is juiced about a barbie movie…guess i’m super annoying compared to absolutely pathetic lol,2023-07-24 15:12:08
"dude was the surprise villain doing most of the conflict and got his own big character climax thats more grandiose than barbies

barbie is absolutely the protagonist but the movie spared no narrative device to make gosling stand the  out and he proved worthy he stole the movie in the same way ledger did in tdk even though the story is deeply about batman and two face reading your critique youd think he is allan",2023-07-25 03:10:20
i share the horror of the heart being ripped outunneccessarily terrifying and added nothing to the film  and kids loved indiana that was a low blow scene,2023-08-06 12:16:39
i think that movie would make sense to kids more than barbie i mean the violence isn’t really appropriate but there are no ideological concepts they can hold t understand it’s straightforward adventure,2023-08-06 15:00:14
but they did they started moving forward and giving the kids more roles in their society exactly how women were slowly given more roles in our society over the past 50 to 60 years,2023-09-14 12:56:45
really it’s pretty clear and intentional,2023-11-06 10:41:20
i like to think thats my reaction to sculpture makes sense,2023-07-23 04:35:22
yes magical,2023-08-05 00:46:36
enjoy being sad and unfunny ,2023-07-22 01:28:30
yeah it was pretty quick so could be easy to missforget,2023-07-23 22:18:02
and people who like both john waters and stanley kubrik movies,2023-07-23 22:02:23
2001 a space odyssey references seems odd,2023-07-23 21:52:39
im pretty sure its clear she was able to become human because of some magical influence by ruths ghost,2024-01-04 11:17:44
eh i think they could become incels eventually but at the end of the movie they didn’t hate the barbies for not paying attention to them they just got carried away with the idea that if they were in power they’d be respected and you know could have homes like the barbie’s,2023-07-25 02:05:12
that seems more akin to low self esteem seeking validation than incelness to me its lacking the anger and the specific  intimacy topic,2023-07-25 02:15:55
"looking at your profile it looks like youre really committed to hating this movie and i simply do not have the energy to debate you 

you clearly dont understand the portrayal of women in media on an intrinsic level i implore you to beef up your media literacy but you may be a lost cause",2023-07-26 04:44:49
the law itself seems sexist and is passed to protect those who discriminate while the burden of proof placed on those discriminated against the disadvantaged would remain so,2023-08-08 14:15:44
seriously there’s no need to start down a path of insults we’re just having a conversation about a movie,2023-09-14 18:46:24
ha yes i meant allan well our opinions differ cest la vie,2023-09-14 19:23:44
its funny how dumb you sound when trying to dunk someone for a valid critique of the movies weak message i would advise taking a critical thinking class at your nearby community college,2023-09-17 04:11:55
" 4 out of the 6 weve ever had are currently serving

yeah there isnt a very long history of women being on scotus i dont know what you are getting at its a recent development even though theres 60 years of women as judges

so again the kens get a lower court seat at the end of barbie and maybe in 60 years there will be 4 kens on their scotus since barblielands antiken is a satire on real world misogyny",2023-09-08 04:11:46
"if all they did was an uprising but offered nothing of value then yes they were useless lol

they were portrayed as empty vessels that revolved around women only  what is kens job  the beach ",2023-09-09 17:15:08
were the kens not also brainwashed,2023-09-07 02:02:04
well at least he is true to himself which is one step ahead of kens the next step would be to realise that being himself is kenough and his life is not worth only as much as how many times barbie looks at him i suppose,2023-07-21 23:09:34
considering it has a very positive reception all across the board from both critics and audiences as well as an outstanding box office performance i think maybe it was just you who didnt want that,2023-07-28 06:17:52
"yeah it was an over the top parody the ending made fun of the idea that the kens would solve inequality overnight just like the start makes fun of the idea that barbies fixed real world sexism overnight it acknowledges things are complicated 

as a guy i felt like i was laughing with the movie when that ken was overexplaining the godfather i laughed in a literally me way some people rush to get offended instead of laughing a bit about thenselves which is healthy",2023-07-22 14:32:40
true but im talking about the norm which its not tons of movies that should of at least been nominated havent cause the voters are mostly pretentious old dudes,2023-07-26 01:39:28
"you get it but your still seething lol

 you can’t say that with a straight face dude incels are everywhere and their lack of woman is their core personality",2023-07-28 19:20:56
"that’s a feminists idea of what is good for men and what they should want  95 of men don’t care or agree

and thats the problem there we may not agree or want that but it is something we need reality says ad much look at the manosphere its literally fueled by hatred of women no longer needing men and taking our masculinity and manhood thanks to evil feminism mens rights activist movement is all about how men see perceived double standards that they feel women foisted upon us even though they often miss the point that the patriarchy created those standards originally if us men were as fine and dandy  with our relation to women as you seem to think women would not have lost their rights to their bodies last year homophobia which like transphobia is linked to misogyny wouldnt still be rampant in mens spaces still

us men do not have a hard time obtaining a sense of self without a woman that’s totally laughable and just something feminists tell themselves

the reason why so many young boys and men flock to male self help gurus like kevin samuels and andrew tate and others is because they mostly want advice on how to feel powerful in order to attract girls and women it always comes back to obtaining the affection and love of a woman this is the dilemma of the kens thats why what barbie says to ken is so heartfelt and positive us men dont need to revolve our lives and worth around obtaining and dominating women",2023-07-29 01:25:56
ohhhh i see thanks,2023-08-05 14:41:48
jesus youre not kidding  did he just search for every reddit thread mentioning barbie to make comments complaining about it,2023-07-30 07:25:45
yes but what are the things you like take the time to be positive about something and put some good in the world i’m listening,2023-07-30 14:04:04
sure it was always going to do well regardless of the content due to the great marketing campaign and well known ip but the second weekend looks like it’s going to do very very well at the box office with a relatively low drop that signifies a film with positive reception,2023-07-30 20:19:08
eh thats basically teaching the reverse problem male centered shows  over the years have gone to great pains to make women into equal stars this here is going in other direction,2023-07-22 16:29:13
talk about missing the message,2023-07-22 17:00:52
kens are just as much natives of barbieland as barbie what lol,2023-07-22 22:31:50
wut,2023-07-22 16:44:48
they said theyd get a spot on the lower court after a ken asked for a token on the supreme,2023-07-22 16:48:17
"its dumb because kens whole arc is how patriarchy is harmful to men as well 

hes and men arent the focus but were the c plot next to barbies self actualization and the motherdaughter bond

if anything its my criticism of the movie because barbie kinda gets overshadowed look at the reactions from critics and social media a lot of deserved ryan gosling praise they kinda overshadowed barbie",2023-07-22 16:49:34
again there are exceptions and it’s not perfect but there is clearly more of a sisterhood with women anytime i go out with my girlfriend she almost always gets compliments by other women on her outfits or appearance same with my exes the way all my exes friends group supported each other was amazing to see i’ve never had an ex jealous of their friend it’s anecdotal but i believe experiences we see over internet also support this,2023-07-22 22:50:44
ken reminds me of tyler durden a spoof of masculinity and materialism i actually believe fight club was an influence on barbie i was surprised when i found out it wasnt an entirely unique theory,2023-10-24 01:26:32
" i felt very weird about the justification being that they had no immunity exposure to it

the smallpox metaphor made no  sense

fun movie but completely falls apart if you try to think about it  which is fine not every movie needs to be serious  except this one is clearly trying to be serious in parts which leads to a frustrating experience on the whole and moments of tonal whiplash",2023-07-28 14:35:42
" with equivalent female dominant society

i get theres a parody element and the joke worked insofar as it was funny but it still kind of shocked me that part of the resolution was nope were going to make you second class citizens and repeat the mistakes of the real world and nobody did a double take at that

it takes everything that is so close to what every rightwing  thinks feminism is and says yep were going with that

and everyone is applauding it for its feminist cred

it feels weird",2023-07-28 14:38:12
i dont think anyone who seriously understands feminism thinks we need to balance it with anything,2023-07-22 23:31:19
it would certainly be fair to say you dislike the theme but calling it thematically incoherent is completely inaccurate it has several very clear themes which again may or may not resonate with you but were not muddled in the slightest,2023-07-24 01:09:15
it made fun of that though the narrator said something like maybe someday the kens will have as much power as women in our world,2023-07-22 09:02:33
thought for sure when ken starting selling in the real world the two world would swap in terms of who runs them and then the message would be finding balance,2023-07-21 12:15:53
"	itd be far more interesting to see gerwig conceive of a world where men and women are equal than depicting a mirror of our current one 

i honestly thought this is where we were going and wouldve made for a better message but i still think the final result was ok maybe gerwig thought itd be too soft of an ending just being like hey we know you just  up barbieland but why dont we just all get along",2023-07-21 08:43:44
men confused by message of barbie movie news at 11,2023-07-21 16:50:41
"i hate that they introduced a plot point of a character experiencing an onset of mental illness which an implication that she may be experiencing suicidal ideation at the very least contemplating death  which lets not forget is the inciting incident for the entire movie  only for that to never get any depth or explanation and it turned out to be just plot point to get the characters from a to b  

for a movie that is getting fulsome praise from people for its depth i loathe that mental illness got the throwaway treatment  ive seen the suffering that illnesses like these can exert on people and no it doesnt get fixed with motivational speeches

the mom still needs help at the end  the movie is just very good at making us forget that",2023-07-28 14:25:17
or gerwigbaumbach could have just written an alternate reason,2023-07-21 16:25:00
if thats the kneejerk reaction you got from rhea perlmans line which you heavily paraphrased to begin with i would suggest watching the movie again,2023-08-10 19:34:39
and laura dern had something similar to say in marriage story during a conversation with johansson coincidentally or not written by noah baumbach,2023-07-21 06:05:17
a lot of people a lot of people havent heard it and theyre specifically mad at this movie for having the message at all,2023-07-21 13:43:31
it’s almost like the speech is being said to a doll  who has never had any kind of concept of being a woman before and is brand new to it or something,2023-08-01 15:51:24
i just checked out your comment history and  go touch some grass,2023-07-22 16:24:45
satire might not be for you youre allowed to laugh at jokes at your expense,2023-07-23 15:36:56
" you might have a point  except for the fact the real world men were also dumber than their female counterparts so it really just seems like a continuation of just making all the male characters dumb

i didnt find the real world men particularly dumb i thought that will ferrells character was going to be a typical out of touch villain and while they played with that trope a bit but overall it seemed like the movie portrayed him and the rest of the board as competent and understanding characters the thing to remember too is that the real world was still a heightened reality and the chase sequences made that pretty apparent

also re ken crying again i didnt think it was specifically played for laughs the way he came to the i am kenough realization was pretty in line with how the character had been portrayed up until that point barbie and ken were both showed they dont have to tie their selfworth to external sources i thought it was a nice parallel 

i really didnt think the movie was antimen at all in fact i found it to be quite promen in a really touching way",2023-08-08 13:32:33
but they wanted to capture barbie to send her back to barbieland barbie went back on her own so what was their goal,2023-08-23 13:50:50
ken was the antagonist also their goal was to put her in the box and ship her to her world anyways like they were there for a reason but they really didnt do anything what happened when they actually got to her world they showed up at the end and didnt do anything,2023-08-20 06:31:23
i haven’t seen op yet i heard it was also kind of disappointing,2023-08-17 07:31:35
i understand that but we dont see it as the audience its a very shallow beginning the character we see change the most is ken,2023-08-06 15:18:50
"i did not see much depth to the older woman scene i think it is something they could have given more resonance to 

i felt barbie was crying not because of the complex actions but because the world was different from barbie world she decides to leave the human world because of what she sees not become human she does not decide to become human until the end of the movie they werent tears of empathy or desire but fearful and emotional tears the act of crying itself also scared her that wasnt her wanting to become human that was her wanting to go back to the doll world she goes to mattel to complain about the human world and how its backwards she then flees from mattel when she realizes she doesnt want to be in the human world anymore she then goes back to the barbie world to hide from mattel 

theres no depth to that human world interaction she doesnt show any desire to want to be human if you want to suggest that bench interaction is her catalyst for wanting to be human the movie simply doesnt do enough to show that her time in the human world lasts about 25 minutes and that is an accurate time count i just made 

she then goes back to barbie world and as you said the movie becomes about ken because ken has now changed from who he was at the beginning and ken will again undergo another change with his character having a beginning a middle and an end he goes from someone who is unhappy with who he is to going on an adventure to having made a significant change but also not finding happiness hitting a rock bottom and then through a struggle finding a new purpose he has the changes barbie doesnt

this is me complaining that the movie is focused on ken because it is if we want our barbie movie to be about women this movie is about men both in how men affect women and how a male character changes and grows i think it could have been different",2023-08-06 17:24:37
at the end of the movie when she’s talking to ruth barbie says she wants to be someone who creates not just a product that is created she realizes there is more to life than just having a perfect day in your own pink world and wants to be part of that,2023-08-05 15:51:53
are you kidding she went to the real world and developed a desire to be human when with weird barbie she had no interest in anything changing at all in her life ever she was terrified by thoughts of death and then willingly chose death she left everyone she knew well except 2 new friends to choose adventure and self exploration you are saying the literal canonical bildungsroman structure isnt development,2023-08-06 13:46:48
maybe they’ll tackle it in a sequel how do you propose barbie overcome thoughts of death,2023-08-05 10:01:40
"i dont think the message is all men deserves no power and i think youre interpreting it as a slight against mentaking it too personally when its very clearly a deliberate parallel to the real world 

women had to fight really really hard for equal representation in government and are still fighting for it to this day women first started holding political positions in the us in the 1910s but we didnt have a female supreme court justice until 1981 it didnt matter if there were women back then who earned it or deserved it they were shut out of top government positions because they were women 

thats the joke thats the parallel the movie clearly shows that kens are discriminated against in barbieland and lack political power the barbies acknowledge that but theyre still reluctant to actually give power to kens kens are going to have to work for it even though they shouldnt have to just like women in the real world continue to have to work for equal representation even though we shouldnt have to",2023-07-24 21:25:01
the movie doesnt say its fine its not hypocritical or vindictive its a mirror of the real world but with kens instead of women the ending is like that to highlight the fact that there is still a lot of work to be done in the real world when it comes to gender equality it makes complete sense and i think an ending with a perfectly genderequal utopia wouldve felt wishy washy and odd in a movie with a theme about the inherent complexity of being a person,2023-07-22 02:18:27
"nah the thing about films is that they need to perfectly explain the premise feed you context and develop plot points a good movie will end with a wrappedup conclusion but an even better movie will allow viewers to further contextualize the themes in the film and maybe try to think for themselves a comedy film has the added layer of having to drive the point home but still bringing it back to the initial funny jokes that built the storyline up to the final conclusion of the film

barbie does this well it spends the whole film showcasing how a patriarchymatriarchy is a detriment to society and at the end through the commentary and speeches of barbie the mother and the president you can understand that they are aware of this the subplot of who am i if not a stereotype of the perfect girlbarbie or guyken is also addressed and concluded with comments from barbie and ken there is enough nuance for the viewer to also understand this theme and conclude that any kind of triarchy is bad and we should have balance and respect for each other and ourselves

however its a barbie film and still a comedy film so you can wrap up all those important themes and then continue to make hypocritic jokes about said theme with the confidence that the viewer has understood the initial theme but can still laugh at the joke any comedy film that fails to do this would be considered a bad one",2023-07-21 22:56:27
"a lot of those movies with main female characters are also written and directed by men so they’re not exactly real representations but a male caricature of what a woman is so many movies have the end goal achievement being the woman got married disney is notorious for this hitchcock is an outlier but at the same time he was extremely sexist and awful to his female cast members tippi hendren went public about how abusive he was — he literally had her mauled by real birds instead of the fake ones he told her they would be for shock value so not the best example to use here

and it is mansplaining like i’ve said before barbie in the way she was intended by the founder who was a woman was a feminist doll she was forced out of the company very early on and then it was controlled by men literally look through a list of all the high ranking people at barbie just like your point on how i can’t fairly judge the movie because i’m not a man you can’t fairly judge barbie because you are a man and not a woman like me",2023-07-23 18:19:36
i wouldn’t equate it to mr darcy — i think it’s more on par with like magic mike,2023-07-24 12:27:35
"yeah i get why it was done from a writing perspective

but the characters who do it just seem like there acting out of character and weirdly mean",2023-08-07 08:07:20
"i was literally trying to explain the monolith scene to the little sister of a friend of mine 

to be fair it was more of a explaining to the kids what they have been missing out rather than textbook mansplaining i for one didnt catch up with kubrick until i was 16 or 17 nonetheless i still felt called out super hard",2023-08-06 23:32:10
yeah i felt called out but thats why its funny,2023-08-06 20:58:23
" i do wish the real world wasnt quite so silly and overthetop dominated by the dumbest men around 

me too man me too",2023-08-06 21:47:27
"i do wish the real world wasnt quite so silly and overthetop dominated by the dumbest men around

i agree honestly i think the repeated mattel board gag was funny so id say keep that but have another male character involved thats more grounded maybe make use of the husbanddad character instead of just the gag about him learning greek

that said they werent all dumb there was that dude who ken was asking for a job who said that they just got better at hiding the patriarchy which was creepy as  especially in the irl context of a seemingly growing contingent of men who wish for the good old days",2023-08-09 02:53:20
you say the kens are shallow because of little girls playing with them but you also admit the real world men are shallow and also  so maybe gerwig just wrote all the male characters as  because she thought it was funny and there is no good reason for it,2023-08-06 20:56:03
the mattel board is all men because the ceo is the escaped ken he behaved exactly the same as the ken who returned to barbie land,2023-08-07 22:16:44
" kind of making fun of how men put pressure on themselves to posture toughness

thats kind of worse though because that would even more clearly contradict the inspiring monologue to barbie about how women are all struggling but put on a brave face anyway",2023-08-08 12:02:08
"also sashas dad is he her dad im talking about this random dork in glasses who appears randomly twice in the movie learning spanish and stuttering on some words not knowing how to read the room and being so  that his wife does not even bother to fill him in on the details of what theyre going through and that there is a real barbie with them

if genders were reversed there like if it was a man and his  wife it wouldnt be funny then why is it funny when it is a woman and her  husband like why would you want to have a character like that

why not portray a healthy relationship between wife and husband where they work together on a solution",2023-08-06 23:47:02
thats a good point though i didnt think of it that way when i saw it but i see exactly what you mean maybe they just did it as some comic relief i dont know was goofy though that bit,2023-08-06 22:01:49
"random fact but the first time i saw it in nyc greta gerwig herself came out before the showing and gave a nice speech about the movie  was pretty cool

even more random i saw her like a month earlier across the street from the same theater randomly walking out of a dinner after the asteroid city premiere both times i saw her she was super interactive with the people around her and incredibly nice",2023-07-25 18:19:21
i agree with all this i don’t think it was meant to be an ideal society either but i was hoping they would change in the end to make it into one i thought after they had experienced kens patriarchy they could realize there is a better way to run things and they could work together as equals to run their land but i suppose barbieland is just another place run by people so maybe the message is we will never be able to do this…,2023-07-28 20:16:10
it was implied by the one day kens will have the same power as women in the real world ironic joke wasnt it,2023-07-25 03:01:33
the solution they gave is the same one women live with today in the real world thats kind of the point no its not going to be an automatic 5050 and why should it be if men really felt this way the supreme court would have been split 45  menwomen or vice versa 103 years ago in the wake of the 19th amendment instead the furthest weve gotten is what we have now a 63 split,2023-08-14 02:07:13
agreed with the ending i also think the kens were treated worse than women in real life being forced to live in the streets like stray dogs the message would have been much stronger if they lived with the barbies as a reflection of real life and if the mothers relation with her husband reflected the barbieken relationship,2023-08-20 23:10:37
"teach your son to go mgtow mgtow is enlightenment no marriage and no kids  just like nikola tesla

the mgtow lifestyle for men should be the message in movies",2023-08-13 20:51:53
"i liked that they said that but was so confused when they made fun of the pregnant barbie is pregnancy gross to them idk felt kind of anti women with that moment 

the rest of the movie yeah it was prowomen in my opinion it didn’t feel genuine just because of mattel being there but whatever but that moment caught me off guard especially with the talk of motherhood throughout the film just gave me an ick",2023-07-31 14:47:57
ahh okay thank you ,2023-07-31 12:20:13
it’s very likely people are reading all kinds of things into this movie simply because they want to believe everything that is or isn’t in the movie is brilliant satire because they like the director,2023-07-30 08:56:37
just trans in real life i don’t think there was any characterization to highlight that at all,2023-07-23 06:06:13
"hahaha i mean it’s definitely one of the “don’t think too hard about it” moments of the film 

i’m sure that it was meant more as her pinocchio moment rather than a deeper context on identity but maybe it was another morsel of higher level ideas sort of left to the viewer to make of it what they want",2023-07-23 14:03:31
"the barbies are the ruling class each with strongly defined roles and purpose doctor astronaut novelist president not just beach all also with their own houses and accessories etc they dont have to compete for anything and they all support and appreciate each other too

i think it was meant to be the opposite of the stereotypical kind of mean girls female group dynamics no jealousy no pettiness although it creeps in a bit with weird barbie the only lesson the barbies as whole learn is to include weird barbie more but the film was focused on the main barbie and ken so its not a huge deal",2023-08-03 15:15:16
"yeah i really don’t agree with that i don’t mean to be rude but this feels like a really naive take

barbie seems to be a movie that’s a lot more concerned about tackling the patriarchy than it is about having female stars for the sake of female stars

feminism is something that so often simply gets framed as a women’s problem or a cause just for women to worry about the fact of the matter is that men have to start learning how the patriarchy has shaped their lives and the lives of the women around them and how they may be making things worse themselves imo ken is such a good satire of so many harmful tropes from men that i think a lot of young men can learn from going forward this is one of the first very mainstream movies i’ve seen that really pushes this concept that men need to start understanding and changing themselves and their behavior

i still do think barbie got her own story that felt satisfying and i think the prevalence of ken was totally justified based on the arc he had",2023-08-04 10:49:23
same i didn’t care for ryan a lot of us actually found him annoying or overdoing it and i love ryan i would’ve preferred zac efron he just had more natural comedic timing and more musical fitting than ryan margot was the true star of this film,2023-08-07 09:28:49
i understood the joke thanks,2023-08-03 19:12:22
how am i not getting it i understood the joke and i liked it but thats not what i was talking about as you said its a reference to the reality but right now it would be like the past when they let women vote and men thought that was enough now kens are happy cause they got more rights but that doesnt mean they wont try to get equality or even try to make it kenland again to get more rights and in the second case it would be as i said and everything would be repeated,2023-07-22 12:03:06
yeah thats why i didnt understand why people kept calling kens villains when barbies where no better,2023-07-22 12:08:05
i got that but anyone else in the theater did lel a proactive movie about social stuff must be conscious of his public instead barbie looks like a movie that wants to win an argument in a pub,2023-07-24 00:17:15
polyester isn’t very breathable a polyester hoodie sounds terrible grab your favorite hoodie and i bet it’s not 100 polyester,2023-07-23 02:34:28
in my opinion paying 60 for a 100 polyester sweater is a problem in and of itself,2023-07-23 02:46:13
haha yeah on some level i was happy i didnt just spoil the entire plot for myself by accident on the other hand i thought what we got is a great movie but at the same time only an pok kids movie,2023-08-25 03:24:04
"no idea why you think this is some gotcha post  the moment is literally youre so beautiful i know it chuckles just like any oneline stan lee cameo

" the comments it shows men as  so its bad

 you theyre not mad they made ken  it represents all men as bad

ok buddy im going to let you get on with all the other people youre currently arguing with about this movie because from my brief glances at the comments it was a lot with a lot of people explaining to you how your interpretation of the film is short sighted or flat out incorrect but you dont want to hear that you want to cry about barbie on reddit and im not going to let you waste my time doing the same",2023-08-02 19:04:52

i wouldnt bring like a four year old to barbie but anyone older than seven will probably have a decent time my friend took his ten year old and she loved it though obviously thats an anecdote and i have no wider polling,2023-07-22 06:30:57
our theater was packed with parents who brought their children,2023-07-22 06:30:19
someone else mentioned that before i just watched the sequence again and the only word that’s visible in the whole montage is “goodwill”,2023-11-16 17:25:27
they definitely got some shots in which might be surprising mattel was willing to be criticized at all but yeah i think they definitely slip probably thethe hardest question of “did barbie actively harm feminism”  i heard second hand that gerwig had to fight to keep the scene of sasha directly criticizing barbie in the cafeteria which probably was the harshest criticism in the whole movie,2023-12-24 13:06:22
"our world is obviously imperfect youve laid out plenty of evidence to support just how unfair and imbalanced our world is i do not deny that women have been historically treated unfairly same for just about every minority

it’s especially funny because the thesis statement of the movie was essentially that neither patriarchy’s or matriarchy’s work let’s find a harmonious balance for ken and barbie

so when the movie reflects our world and denies progress it doesnt strive towards a proper solution like is implied by the parent comment theres no real effort towards true equality at best we see dismissiveness and outright denial the barbies do almost nothing to improve their society for kens

what couldve been a truly inspiring message was instead played for laughs and ruins a lot of context for the previous 90 minutes of film why spend all this time about gender identity gender roles and gender inequality just to turn around and promote more gender inequality they didnt need to end in a perfect egalitarian utopia but they definitely shouldve shown the desire to get there",2023-07-24 15:40:32
ken literally sings a song about how he cant process his repressed emotions and people still misunderstood the message,2023-07-23 16:33:53
my point exactly and you’re using it exactly as i described to essentially call men who don’t agree with your point of view weak it’s just good old fashioned shaming of manhood from women dressed up in feminist language,2023-07-23 16:27:40
women have been talking about the media which is offensive to them and demanding it change for decades don’t they have bigger issues to adress as well so why is it a problem coming from men because men are meant to shut up and just take it like a man according to who patriarchy as feminists would say or feminists themselves because here it’s the latter,2023-07-23 16:15:29
watch any movie from the 60s and back and tell me the women in those movies weren’t portrayed as complete morons or a sidekickside interest love part in a story that completely centers around a man everything done in this movie to the ken’s has been done to women — except it’s in the real world,2023-07-23 17:29:27

"her arc was that she didn’t have to be exceptional she can just be barbie she didn’t have to live in the context of barbieland her house her clothes or even all the made up and unfair expectations put on a doll they kind of summed it up perfectly in that last conversation “you don’t have to ask permission to be human”

it’s not exactly a subtle movie",2023-07-23 23:25:20
i mean crying and babbling about mini fridges seems like a whole lot of fuss over not a lot  kens problems are ridiculous and petty and hes having a full on despair cry  as the viewer we know and understand the full picture  but ken doesnt his paradigm has shifted twice and hard  there are deeper issues there that barbie didnt dig a whole lot into  kens not her problem he needs to figure it out for himself,2023-07-24 19:27:33

mean girls

literally mean girls

every single girl in that film is a  a  or gossipy or mean even our teacher who is the supposed voice of reason had her chest exposed and was seemingly able to be manipulated by teenagers 

and just like barbie that film was social satire not to be taken as an indictment on the entire female gender",2023-07-27 18:38:47
"it’s a really weird and narrow guidelines that any movie has to have the same set up showing “every member of a large female cast as a ” most movies just aren’t set up the same way 

anyone who thinks this movie is antimen is clearly missing the point 

all the kens being portrayed as bumbling doofuses that only exist to support the barbies is not supposed to be seen as a good thing 

a good portion of the film’s message is that you shouldn’t take your own social movement so far that you trample on other people that if we don’t give boys good role models love and support dreams to strive for there’s a good chance they’ll get swallowed up by the manosphere and turn into bitter angry assholes 

barbie didn’t owe ken a relationship but she should’ve been more respectful towards him she should’ve been more kind seen the value in him 

how can anyone watch movie see the scene where barbie admits she owes him an apology and only think “this movie  hates men”",2023-07-27 13:25:40

"theres also no movie outside of the barbie franchise that portrays men and women as plastic dolls that can magically travel to the real world but you dont see anyone complaining about that do you

you dont understand why people say that its satire its not to say that the movie can do no wrong its to point out that it can exaggerate if it were an exact reflection of the real world the message wouldnt be as strong",2023-07-27 15:51:15

lol thats too funny,2023-07-24 03:00:07
"i agree the speech bothered me too i think for me though it was because just saying these are then problems does not fix them it also wouldn’t magically stop someone from being “brainwashed” the issues of the patriarchy how it started and how to get out of it are waaaaaay more complex than what they showed 

also yes why would i feel bad for the barbies at least at the beginning when they literally have everything as a woman i didn’t relate to the barbies at all and i thought that was the point until the end of the movie",2023-07-22 07:32:08
this movie is sending the wrong message and its sad that somehow in the last 30 years we forgot that listening to each other and trying to work together is extremely important without men we arent enough and without us they arent enough,2023-07-22 08:02:26
"the director shows us kens being bullied getting refused invitations to hang out being told to leave owning no land basically being eye candy props

the director is basically showing lives of the traditional women in ken lol you know how men will have sport or poker night and women is supposed to just be the main who serve thats what the women night was about",2023-07-22 13:01:13
"i am glad to see so many talking about the movie 
yeah the context of the movie was they were trying to make a point at the end that it is a constant process for women to be respected in the world 
it did seem like the last joke was saying that ken s should reflect the real world that was my only point 
obviously men in the past didnt respect womens metal faculties thats wrong the point of that should have been that it is wrong to treat the kens that way too 
either way having a confusing narrative doesnt make the movie worthless the  im kenough quote is a wonderfully positive message for men to not find their self worth in a woman",2023-07-24 20:14:55
exactly why are so many people happy with what is happening in the real world,2023-07-22 22:42:59
eh my opinion is that the actors are directed to do certain things so they most likely asked him to make it funny but maybe not who knows,2023-07-22 08:08:45
"the men who are born now did not make the patriarchy they were born into it as well also the barbies did decide to reinstate the matriarchy at the end after the kens made pace with each other and did the fun dance

also i do agree that the movie is parodying real life but flipping the switch however i don’t think that’s what they intended i’ve seen real people saying that they don’t care what any man has to say about the movie and that the kens deserve to be treated that way because of the patriarchy but don’t mention that the matriarchy of the barbies has been around waaay longer 

i feel like they didn’t really mean to show that or if they did they did not do it very well since no one is saying anything bad about barbie they also don’t acknowledge the point you made about how if it was a matriarchy then things wouldn’t be better it would be the same just reversed",2023-07-22 20:12:35

i cant speak to other peoples reactions but i also felt the movie itself had a really good balance of relatable themes comedy and clever nods ignoring the obvious fact that it was about barbie to me the movie felt like it had something for everyone",2023-07-21 20:04:57
this film clearly doesn’t view the matriarchy as a utopia either  it’s repetitive and simple also i feel if you think matriarchies being utopian in feminist theory is a big deal you missed the point  imagining these sites of matriarchy are a form of resistance for feminism against patriarchy these generally aren’t the goal of these authors necessarily but just a way to imagine and work towards a better world,2023-07-24 13:23:44

dont make me beach you off,2023-07-22 02:39:30
i dont think they were portrayed as the bad guys because immediately afterwards the narrator said that kens would have the same rights in barbieland as women have in the real world i thought the message of the movie was muddled and odd but i dont think barbies in that moment were portrayed as antagonists,2023-07-22 17:39:39

all i did was answer your question for you it’s not like you’re going to change how i interpret the film’s message so why bother

like i said everyone has different opinions and perspectives so you’re entitled to that however you’re strawmanning and insulting the character of the women that enjoyed the film and that’s not just a film opinion that’s just misogyny

i’ve never said you weren’t entitled to your opinion so it’s just you putting words into my mouth meanwhile you’re going on tirades of “barbie’s humor is comparable to how racist films have portrayed black people” “any woman who enjoyed the film is an antiman feminist” jesus christ i wish that people were just allowed to enjoy a fun film that pokes fun at literally everyone barbie is portrayed as a vapid character weirdbarbie is poked fun at midge the pregnant barbie is poked fun at it’s not just the men that are poked fun at but it just seems like your feelings are hurt a funcomedy film about imaginary toys is nowhere near comparable to racist films and it’s ridiculous to say so i will be blocking you because you have nothing worthwhile to contribute to the conversation",2023-07-26 13:15:10

"i actually dont think that the message is that barbie world is better than anything even at the end because even though they celebrate it feels gross and stereotypical barbie doesnt even want to play that game anymore to me it reads more like here we have a pendulum swinging dramatically in opposite directions and neither one is the right thing

 i think it was kind of meant to be a role reversal for men watching it so that they could get a feel for what its like to live as a woman in this world and if this is the first time theyre realizing it that could be a big revelation in a mans life so i dont know its still a barbie movie thats ultimately weirdly about educating men while just celebrating women which at that level puts been in the position of what its like to be patronized

i kind of think men are supposed to be pretty picked up by that and fearful by these ideas so that then they can make that leap of oh yeah this is must be how women feel 
 so i dont hate it its just a little messier than i was expecting",2023-07-31 22:25:45
it doesnt matter if i think its good watch it yourself and form your own opinion dont let others think for you,2023-07-23 17:42:19

allan is good,2023-07-29 03:28:26
"also the whole thing of barbie needing to lecture ken on how to find himself is deeply patronising and only a feminist would consider that a good ending

you mean the exact same thing barbie struggles with herself in the entire film 

having an existential crisis but empathizing with someone else going through it is patronizing because its a female to a male

you just sound like an absolutely miserable person to be around",2023-08-02 18:35:53
no greta did that to show how it really feels for the women in real world to be treated exactly the same as the kens in barbieland it was a slap to make people feel in a hope for change,2023-08-02 19:46:28
"i see right so why are the real world men also so dumb compared to the real world women

lol whole lotta people seeing whatever they want to see in this movie because it appeals to issues they’re into it’s funny to witness here’s a better explanation  whatever point she may have been trying to make elsewhere gerwig wrote all the real world men and kens as dumb because she simply followed a lazy “man dumb woman smart” trope and actually has a lot of bitterness toward men 

pray tell what was the brilliant genius satire in the way gloria’s husband was looked down on by his wife as lame the eye rolling the comments on the old boyfriend teaching her to drive 

over and over in this movie whether it’s the kens real world men or even the human female hero’s husband men are shown as morons to be mocked and it’s hilarious to see people tie themselves in knots to explain it as brilliant satire because admitting the feminist movie made by greta gerwig was sexist against men would violate their ideological principles or something",2023-08-02 18:15:51
me too barbie was a miss for me though maybe if it was in french,2023-09-17 08:30:33
my mom has a really wonderful story about this sort of thing though worth noting that it is from about a decade ago she was put in a position where her management was asking for increasingly impossible things refusing upward mobility or even bonuses requiring her to travel routinely out of state despite having a small child while admitting that she was doing the job of a better titled better paid position when she finally cracked and left the position they told her that they felt like they could keep her there under their heel because shes a good mom ie they knew they could deny raisesforbid role changesask for the moon because she wouldnt leave the job so she could support her family,2023-12-25 06:41:04
i see the criticisms frequently all over from men yes but even moreso other women maybe not directly towards me but passive aggressively or in the media im fortunate enough to have great men and women in my life so i feel supported but the modern world is very harsh towards women were truly doing more than any generation before us and society just loves to kick us its wild raising two boys and trying my best to not contibute to the problem,2023-12-26 07:15:49
i was addressing the comment i responded to they asked if women really experience these expectations,2024-02-08 06:42:19
"eh most of the illiterates would still take issue with gender being a topic of the movie at all theyd just complain that the movie was arguing women are better than men because they fixed gender inequality when it made no sense for it to work like that or some bs

i for one dont think art should always cater to the lowest common denominator for fear of  off the reactionaries theres no bottom to the depths theyll go to to mine outrage bait out of the simplest most nonoffensive messages i mean just look at how mad people get about the idea that black lives matter",2023-07-22 22:19:26
you didnt answer my question,2023-07-27 20:01:53
"the kens have to work their way up to it in the real world women werent declared equal one day and it all happened at once it was and still is a slow painful process you mustve missed the line where the narrator said and one day the kens will be just as equal as women in the real world

the movie literally acknowledges that it is unfair and the joke is that women have been treated unfairly for centuries",2023-07-27 16:06:21
its a fantastic escapist movie my dude it doesnt need to be pitch perfect just because its targeted at women,2023-08-10 11:05:04
but it’s clearly not just supposed to be just entertaining and fun it’s very clearly a commentary with multiple themes layered together some of which are philosophical some of which are about identity some of which are political it’s meant to be that,2023-08-10 17:39:50
"so you see the barbies as an antagonistic force in the movie the allegory only works if people leave going wow the barbies really  


because most people here are not walking away with that view",2023-07-22 20:43:42
fwiw i really cant believe that this dark comedy ending were discussing was their intention particularly with how heavy handed so many of the other good messages the movie went over i feel like its just an unintentional outcome of trying to address more than they intended kinda like how theres a bit of an issue with xmens mutants being an allegory for marginalized people when said mutants can blow up cities almost making the fear of them justified in a way,2023-07-22 19:49:35
"yet they have the depth of emotion to understand and empathize with what america farrera has experienced in her life as well as the plight of women in a society they know nothing about their emotions for that are strong enough that it makes them emotional as well as removes their brainwashing doesnt make sense does it 


farrera talks about the struggles of motherhood when none of the barbies are mothers and midge is just a joke yet the barbies get emotional hearing her speech but kens they have known and have a good relationship with saying they feel disrespected they definitely dont have the depth of emotions for that seems kind of sexist to suggest that the barbies connect with women and their struggles such as motherhood and appearances even though the barbies have never experienced those things but they cant understand a kens need to be respected appreciated or feel equal


not to mention that at the end barbies say well give you a small position and you can work up they fully understand the kens should have more but choose not to give it to them as revenge  even saying one day youll have enough power as women in the real world that is clear vindictiveness they emphathize more with the plight of women in a world they dont know than kens they know and understand deserve more and are willing to keep the kens down to prove that point",2023-07-22 20:58:34
the metaphor is that it absolutely sucks to be the gender oppressed in a society controlled by the opposite gender they’re seen as dumb by the opposite gender — the same way as some women are viewed in real life,2023-07-23 22:29:56
embrace the horses leave the rest at the door,2023-07-24 09:48:09
codependant yes but not the point of aggression barbieworld is uneven and encourages unhealthy dynamics but kens dont view barbies as possessions nor do barbies view kens that way the patriarchy and presumably the horses as well cause the early rivalry between ken and ken to escalate to violence before that it would be a beachoff,2023-07-24 16:18:18
"the barbie movie did have a good ending though both barbie and ken got their happy endings just not together and thats okay part of the point of this film is to find your own happiness and path in life you dont need to follow the one that is expected of you 

ken gets to go on and discover who he is outside of his relationship to barbie he learns that just being ken is enough that he doesnt need barbie or material things to prove his worth he gets autonomy 

barbie gets to be human she gets to experience a full life she realized that being perfect isnt all its cracked up to be she gets to experience a full range of emotions  the good and the bad she gets to set her own destiny barbie gets autonomy her life is no longer dictated by the person in the real world who is playing with her 

you keep pointing out how this film is too heavyhanded on the feminist themes but you seem to be missing the more subtle themes here when barbie tells the older woman at the bus stop that shes beautiful it isnt just a surface level thing she sees a woman in the last chapter of her presumably welllived life barbie sees aging for the first time and she finds the process beautiful and wonderful and wants that for herself life is complex and she understands that deeply when she experiences crying for the first time

ive read a few of your comments and you keep pointing out that people are reading too deeply into this movie but i feel like you are being dismissive because you cant see past your feelings about kens portrayal maybe it is because you dont understand what it is like being a woman in this world because weve often been portrayed the same way ken has incompetent nothing without our male counterparts etc i mean the fact that youre upset that barbie and ken didnt end up together really shows how much you do not get the themes and commentary in this movie even when the film is slapping you in the face with them 

when ken goes to the real world and gains a very limited view on patriarchy and what it is like for men in the real world of course it is going to seem shallow it is shallow hes experiencing these things for the first time and of course he is going to be overthetop about what it means to be a man and what comes with it its a mirrored critique of barbie and what it means on a surface level to be a woman i think it is also a critique of some forms of feminism there are absolutely brancheswaves of feminism that are men  men dumb women should rule everything etc the goal of feminism  at its core  is equality and a lot of the time that gets lost when one group is also trying to empower themselves barbie because she experienced humanity understands that being who you are finding your own path empowerment and lifting up others is important she explains that to ken ken was an agent of misdirected change once before so maybe he can be an agent for change in barbieland to make it a more equal place for all of its inhabitants or maybe not thats up to him to decide maybe one of the other kens will be that change they get to work towards that just like women and marginalized groups in the real world are still working towards that",2023-07-25 11:24:00
i’m a regular civilian with no interest in politics what am i going to do,2023-07-25 03:06:32
"yeah  her boyfriend means they are together barbie has been like 19 for most of her existence ken and barbie being together is totally in line with the nature of barbie it’s the entire point of making ken it’s laughable to call it antithetical to the nature of barbie

ken ending up with barbie would do for barbie what ken was made for in the first place  give her a good boyfriend she liked yes i get that isn’t in line with feminist don’t need no man ethos  but it’s entirely in line with the entire history of barbie until this movie",2023-07-25 06:39:22
"i dunno this thread topic has already shown that a ton of far older dudes 100 missed subtle details like the audience isnt expected to cheer on president barbie explicitly saying no to a request for equality with no justification attempted

or that the the kens will have equal power to irl women followup line should either sound like a happy ending to anyone who feels equality is 100 solved and should really only sound like a bad end for ken if someone feels like women today have a rawer deal than theyd like to see ken have",2023-07-25 08:02:41
because barbieland is pretend so i’m guessing they want you to reflect on the inequality in the real world and how it feels to have crumbs of actual power just like the kens,2023-07-22 19:42:53
agreed it was so out of place too like why,2023-08-01 03:42:43
yes for sure she cant simply be known as barbie anymore because she is white needs to be stereotypical barbie something with a negative connotation very weird indeed it was just doing too much at some points the more i think about it,2023-07-31 21:20:42
yeah i was disappointed as it just felt like a load of silliness nowhere near as deep as people made out it was going to be should’ve spent more time in the real world learning things,2023-08-03 12:23:53
yes the most interesting part of the movie was barbie in the real world watching everyone experiencing complex feelings about real life  realising life isn’t perfect thought we had a whole journey in the real world coming but they just went back to barbie land where things can just be silly for the sake of it,2023-08-03 12:25:17
"thats thematic still 

if ken can figure out who he is in barbie land why cant barbie why does changing her species help her figure out who she is shes changing herself 

and the negative pileon isnt going to go away because shes more used to it 

the decision of barbie as a person not as a message about authenticity and selfacceptance is bizarre and not well set up",2023-08-07 02:15:38
"that scene is near the end of the movie when she gives up defeating the kens and rescuing the barbies because she doesnt know how to fix it 

it has nothing to do with wanting anything to change or getting sick of every day being the same 

she specifically says she has never ever wanted anything to change",2023-08-07 02:41:14
that seems obtuse when the obvious reference is right there,2023-07-22 16:24:22
lol it wasnt,2023-07-22 16:35:38
they also don’t seem like they have an weather in barbieland the ken’s just stand in their assigned positions like toys or background actors in the truman show just extras and barbie’s are the main character’s,2023-07-23 17:38:08
barbie was not once mean to ken she was dismissive and not reciprocal to his feelings at worst he basically in return tried to jan 6th barbieland they are in no way comparable she was nice to him,2023-07-25 22:59:07
im talking about the movie here got no interest in discussing the history of mattel but knock yourself out what i can tell you from experience working with different brands is that this movie was not an easy pitch easy to say now cause weve seen the result but as a concept its pretty out there in a good way thankfully,2023-07-31 18:44:44
what,2023-07-22 10:21:12
do you think there could possibly be a reason the movie wants people to leave it feeling that the ken’s were still being treated unfairly i’m pretty sure it’s intentional,2023-07-29 13:44:11
"right that was what i expected this was me

yesss kens plan to vote and participate in the government amazing homage to the suffrage movement oh oh no whats happening",2023-07-28 17:36:43
" they couldve used ken fighting for respect in barbielands matriarchy as an allegory of real life feminism

yeah but at the end of the day ken is a man and theyre promoting feminism maybe if ken transitioned to female",2023-07-28 16:08:54
nah lol hes trying to mansplain about how evil the movie was outside of enjoyment dudes a freak,2023-07-28 19:16:15
it’s also never followed up on seems like it would have made more sense to somehow help the barbies from outside barbie land if what she does in the real world can effect barbieland,2023-07-28 19:08:37
i mean yes there was a whole montage where barbie didn’t even consider that a mother was playing with her,2023-07-29 12:37:31
yeah and i think that all of what you described is where the nuance of his character lied he wasnt a character with a lot of obvious definition to him his personality was subtle and as an audience we were never blatantly fed an idea of who he was other than the discontinuation feature and the isolation that he maybe experienced this movie did a lot of telling instead of showing and with allan they allowed him to reveal himself to the audience slowly through his behavior instead of giving his exact personality and motives away up front through his words he never outright states that he feels isolated or identifies more with the barbies than the kens or even that he has some serious self defense skills he just does the stuff instead of talking about it and it allowed us to make our own inferences it gave his character unexpected meaning and i enjoyed that,2023-07-28 16:44:01
i’ve never seen george of the jungle in fact i’ve not seen many movies at all i’ve not seen lion king or harry potter or lord of the rings or star wars… last time i went to the cinema was to see dark knight rises and it was because my older brothers were going with friends and i was jealous and wanted to go watch too so yeah a lot of modern references are lost on me,2023-07-29 07:50:07
"it was sort of but there wasnt a magical resolution where everyone is suddenly equal kens are getting more job options and more agency but still arent equal to barbies

which mirrors real life feminism in that things are getting better but inequality isnt yet solved its more realistic to be happy with progress in the right direction than a magical instant solution",2023-07-21 12:29:01
yeah i think you’re right,2023-07-23 21:27:37
to be honest i felt like allan represented  or lgbtq men who tend to ally with women don’t have the same systemic misogyny because they also don’t benefit from the system because they are  or lgbtq,2023-07-23 21:42:39
well put,2023-07-27 13:49:30
i thought the theme of the film was in existentialism and absurdism you need to choose what to be in the world to feel fulfilment at the beginning barbie had no choice and was an object in the world and ken was defined by being barbie’s boyfriend it was only after they went to the real world that they decided to have agency as per the end of the movie,2023-07-27 21:54:35
"this exactly 

i can’t directly relate to the things the kens were going through but i saw a lot of value in the story being told 

that a lot of men and boys these days feel discarded forgotten and unloved i try my hardest not to be a person who contributes to those feelings and i like to think i wouldn’t be friends with someone who does but i am willing to listen to people who experience this and i think their feelings are valid",2023-07-27 17:02:21
 the inconsistencies are generally a part of the satire man the patriarchy is also inconsistent in real life i love how you’re just saying it’s badly written as a fact are you going to still be crying when it gets a screenplay nomination,2023-07-29 03:27:46
you clearly do not understand the movie lmaoo,2023-07-29 05:21:29

"how do you figure they were not even people 

they literally had nowhere to live or any rights

so considering the kens just started being considered for positions of power id say the portrayal is pretty accurate 

so its ok for the show to embrace a message of ultra feminist inequality after calling out the inequality in the world",2023-07-31 22:23:34
they asked for a single supreme court seat  are you going to say did the president just appoint 1 woman to the supreme court,2023-07-31 22:18:50
i think the joke is more like a lot of people were all of a sudden really interested in and advocating for the zack snyder justice league when they had never knew it existed or wanted it before felt like this manufactured movement that came out of nowhere,2023-08-06 02:19:51
ok cool tell that to all the women trying to tell men the movie had a super awesome message for them if it’s just a commiseration and whine fest for women to rip on men seems like it then ok but that opens the door for that to be ok for men got it,2023-07-30 03:16:49
good effort wonderful explanation that unfortunately was wasted on usernamesaysitall,2023-07-30 22:05:21
"yeah men don’t define themselves by women at all that’s a made up talking point sure some guys on youtube talk about picking up chicks  but then so do women talk about the same that’s been going on forever since long before the internet it’s for teens who are insecure and trying to date but not nervous adults don’t take all that noise seriously

and no women do not do just fine without men having broken gender roles at all actually in reality even though many women may not want to be dependant on men as housewives  they still are relying on men to hire them to promote them into positions of power and so on so in many ways many women “breaking free from gender roles” and achieving “equality” are still totally dependent on men even if they’re able to overlook that

doing just fine without men would be not wanting or caring if men promote women at work not wanting more women on corporate boards doing that all for yourself and starting female only workplaces without men’s help etc 
so you might say some women do fine without men in their personal lives and some men struggle without women in their personal lives but a whole lot of women do require a lot from men in their professionals lives and a whole massive lot of men do just fine without women in their professional lives

but regardless of all that everyman in this movie is written as a  and that it’s what makes it man hating this movie will be as cringey in future as old racist cartoons are now",2023-07-30 11:08:41
"the barbies are much smarter than the kens and more competent and want to be in charge while the kens actually don’t

if it’s cathartic to see some sad female revenge fantasy and that’s what supposedly makes this movie good that’s quite pathetic imo",2023-07-30 07:03:13
"so its critiquing movie tropes from 80 years ago that had already begun to be questioned and parodied 40 years ago and gosh  forbid that women receive protection from men that type of oppression has got to go

this movie is being sold as subversive but so much of it is just plain stale and occasionally veers into mean spiritedness",2023-07-22 17:06:56
"no but it does stem from the patriarchy

women have those expectations of themselves bc they know that thats whats required of them if they want to succeed but even if the expectations come from their own drive the requirements came about due to the patriarchy 

you see its bc men in power come in all varieties u can be obnoxious or crass or timid or funny or rude or anything else but there are strict requirements for women bc in a patriarchal society women have to be exceedingly competent to get the recognition that men do while still being careful maintain an image that shows that we know our place and still have traditionally feminine characteristics of being kind and gentle and motherly and all that

and what do you mean by without the patriarchy there will be much worse pressure for working women  if the patriarchy didnt exist then women would be able to rise through the ranks exactly as men do without having to be conscious of everything that gloria mentioned

and i asked what do you mean rhetorically  you dont need to answer i saw some of your past comments in this post and your opinion of women is pretty clear",2023-07-30 18:41:05
"exactly its very clearly a conversation starter this big badass biker dude came in with his wife and daughter and sat next to my gf and i you could tell he was mildly confused at the beginning but was laughing his  off half way through the movie with the rest of us and even laughingly said “that really is what men want deep down” at the ken war and dance “fight” scene i bet they had a good conversation and my gf and i did too after the movie 

it was honestly a very refreshing and entertaining movie",2023-08-04 23:03:25

"of my top 5 major issues with the movie the ceo thing is one of them they came all the way to barbieland and for what what was the purpose 
that’s why i think the first hour of the movie was so good because it introduces all these plot lines and themes that were so genius but there was no good way to give each theme and plot line a complete development so they just had to do their best i wouldn’t have minded the movie being longer to develop things but it was just all really ambitious the first hour was stellar and the last part was them trying to play catch up for all the things they introduced the plot holes were soooo noticeable",2023-07-24 23:31:39
i think she just didn’t trust them and was scared of them going in her own back to barbieland was less scary,2023-07-25 00:27:22
so with removing evil or intention barbie would be the antagonist and ken would be the protagonist if you follow their character arcs ken follows a dramatic comedy more closely than barbie would follow a dramatic tragedy as per your comment barbie represents more of the mass establishment while ken is more the individual underdog thus from a storytelling perspective it seems more like a ken movie than a barbie movie i got some glimmer of that feeling during the movie and with the commentary ive read afterwards its slowly confirming it,2023-07-27 01:36:49

i totally agree if you literally have to tell the movies message through a monologue then you havent told the story well or at least didnt believe you did with the social media today where we get inspiring messages every day on basically every topic its  unnecessary to do the same in a movie maybe if this was 20 years ago it would have been impactful but now its just annoying cause not only is it preachy but it has been done far too many times,2023-08-01 20:47:06

but isnt the whole dudebro schtick who can sleep with more women going to the gym to look fit and hot whos the most manly man the whole red pill andrew tate alpha male bubble im aware that thats an extreme but also its still disturbing how much of a reach guys like andrew tate have

and maybe men should have a desire to cry more or reflect on their feelings

but glorias husband was done dirty for sure",2023-08-01 16:25:58
if barbieland is just a mirror of the real world then the “kenough” message is just the mirror of weakass feminism in the real world without any structural changes for women it feels empty because it is empty just like it is for women in the real world,2023-08-01 09:54:26
kens whole arc is him learning that its not who his partner is barbie who gives him worth  ken was never really a person in the world of barbie just literally an accessorie to barbiein the movie barbieland and literally with the toy brand  i am kenough is to say that he no longer needed barbie to feel like he has purpose or value,2023-08-01 07:33:37

the kens did just try to coup barbieland and brainwash all of its residents expecting shows of good faith before you just put them in positions of high power isnt imprudent and it isnt really trampling on their equality either they need to be responsible to be in those positions thats a trait thats demonstrated not inherited,2023-07-22 02:29:26
how else would you like me to say it the point of the movie was to mirror how society is now in barbieland and have you say “wow that seems uncool that ken gets treated like that” and then think hey it’s uncool in the other direction too and that’s a lot like how the real world is now,2023-07-22 01:14:35
"i will maybe give it a rewatch but from memory this isnt explored she says that in the middle of the chase im just a boring mom whose daughter hates her so it isnt like even in the moment its given much thought because so many other things are going on

again there is no motivation behind everything why does her daughter hate her does she work too much does she not talk to her just because her daughter is a teen she supports her mom but it doesnt take much effort kinda showing their relationship wasnt that bad to begin with then we dont really get introduced to her job or what she does at all

like was she already responsible for barbie in some way since she worked at mattel or was truly only at the lower level we dont really know i just feel like so many details were skipped over and forced her daughter in the school scene is painted as a mean girl but no reason is given like you said in the heat of the car chase the mom says her daughter hates her but no reason why when the daughter decides to go back and help barbie nothing has happened but taking a tour of barbieworld and seeing barbie give up  its like we get from point a to c with little mention of b

x200b

edit yeah she pitches normal barbie but it doesnt feel personal to her character at all we know nothing about the mom except she has dark thoughts for some reason any human could have pitched normal barbie and to me the impact would be the same because we dont know the mom or the daughter much they are filler characters",2023-07-25 02:53:27
yeah so what even if one thing or another resonates the focus is on women,2023-07-23 00:10:57
"no they really dont have to do that

because the patriarchy exists and it is bad this doesnt need to be balanced out to make men feel better while watching the film

women constantly have to watch  where they are basically props thats why the bechdel  a thing

but  forbid the barbie film do a send up to the most negative aspects of masculinity in american society horribly offensive

good lord",2023-07-21 18:50:17
yes the marketing did promise a deeper exploration of the entire barbie verse and how it measured out in the real world the acting and set design was topnotch but it came down to actual plot exploration the movie didnt live up to that hype,2023-07-21 13:14:37
does she she chooses the highheel shoe first,2023-07-21 11:11:04
i agree but in the context of the film when barbie land is newly exploring equity the kens ask to start at the supreme court and the barbies say no because kens need to pay their dues so to speak i dont necessarily agree with the message but i do appreciate the parallels the joke provides,2023-07-21 15:11:39
how long has the us gov been around and how long did it take for women to hold as many meaningful positions,2023-07-21 18:53:43
"same i didnt even register that until reading reviews i just thought it was a funny call back yeah i thought the rest of the story would be her in the real world but it was like a 510 minute stint 

yeah i think i felt most let down by the lack of development in the mother daughter relationship i also dont get why the dad was on the sidelines so much i thought in the beginning it was gonna be a set up of she was a single mom or the dad died so she had to work more and that strained her relationship with her daughter except no dad is very much alive and practicing spanisheven though there is no reference to why he is doing so no clear confirmation the family is supposed to be hispanic even though we know america is it just felt random and like why put him there if hes gonna do nothing i just felt lost about why she or the daughter were there i guess it was just for the big speech but honestly it did nothing for me and felt out of place 

yeah i wish it had utilized the real world more or just been a comedy all the way through it wasnt bad though just something i wouldnt rewatch though i would rewatch kens big dance number beach off",2023-07-25 00:03:05
agreed,2023-07-24 23:10:59
i watch a very wide range of movies i like to view a movie on its own terms i’ve seen oppenheimer and barbie although not on the same day and i’m still flabbergasted there is a “barbenheimer” article at wikipedia i love christopher nolan and cillian murphy and emily blunt and florence pugh but i liked barbie more even though i rarely like films written by noah baumbach i think oppenheimer is overrated that could be because i had no expectations for barbie and high expectations for oppenheimer or maybe christopher nolan really needs a cowriter or a different editor,2023-07-22 04:39:04

and if you reverse the genders in your comment sounds like a  of movies “women presented as disposable idiots in awe of allknowing men who have to learn to treat them like autonomous beings” is an incredibly common movie trope it’s almost like that’s what the barbie movie was going for with that plot line and the joke about how the kens would have as much power as human women in the real world crazy right",2023-07-23 10:17:02

that’s just the last ten years…prior to that it was “useless and hot female love interest” in much of cinema,2023-07-24 17:00:04
also men are a privileged class of citizens who have been oppressing women for centuries we’re allowed to make fun of them sometimes did you see get out and how it portrayed white people it was brilliant satire as was barbie,2023-07-24 22:44:39
i think you’re angry at the movie’s portrayal of men and will shut down anyone who thinks differently from you what you consider to be a well rounded female character might not be what i consider to be one and i have studied and taught about this issue before i recommend checking out miss representation to learn more about the issue,2023-07-24 22:43:08
"it’s not revenge  though that implies the audience should feel satisfied with the ending

are we sure though the framing within the film is that this moment is portrayed as a triumphant moment for stereotypical barbie the kens being tricked by the barbies emotional manipulation is played as a joke  negating their victimhood in the process the unfair result is delegated to a handwavey explanation from the narrator content wise i get that its supposed to be a mirror of our world but tone and delivery wise its too dismissive to carry the sincerity such a comment requires

you are so close to the point but aren’t quite getting it

thats unnecessarily condescending im simply discussing the movie as it is presented to me but i wont say youre the one whos not getting it simply because we get different interpretations of it",2023-07-26 06:37:34
"this year was a landmark year for gender equality for the first time in history there are more women ceos leading sp500 companies than dudes named john

it has nothing to do with getting square it was simply a reflection of the state our society is in right now for all the complaining about this unjust ending to one particular storyline the narrator literally calls out that we as the audience actually have the power to improve the kens ending by fighting for womens equality in this world

dont you see the irony of you and other men complaining about the injustice of the kens ending while literally living in a society that has been even more unfair to women and still has a long long way to go why are you complaining about the unjust ending of a movie about a doll while you are living in such an unjust world",2023-07-26 09:28:18
" to know there isnt an easy way to overcome inequality doesnt mean we shouldnt still discuss it or shine a light on it gerwig wasnt going to fix sexism in 2 hours

perhaps i wasnt being clear enough my problem is exactly how gerwig took the easy way out the majority of the barbies and kens have learnt nothing and stereotypical barbie just  off to try being a human instead of staying and trying to work out some semblance of equality for both barbies and kens since shes the only one who sort of gets it at the end of the film

i would also point out how barbie doesnt have any love for ken and her realworld counterpart doesnt look particularly interested in her own partner as well again i do find the movie is incredibly layered and so much can be taken from it",2023-07-27 10:09:45
"ahhh my trick is if i already want to see a movie i don’t watch trailers or go looking for people’s reactions that helps to keep my expectations in check i might peek at a few letterboxd reviews to take the temp of things but i don’t like to know anything about movies that i’m already “sold” on seeing 

in general i find it’s actually better to go into most movies with low expectations the only thing i “knew” about “barbie” was it looked goofy and overthetop",2023-07-25 18:03:48

men have never been underrepresented in positions of power and didnt have to fight their way into it black people have had to fight their way into positions of power they had to do that because of their race and not their gender white people have never had to fight into positions of power you might have had to fight as a woman into position of power but not because youre white and it has nothing to do with your race

regardless of the fact not every man has had power the vast majority did and used it to stack the cards in their favour",2023-07-22 10:01:51

at the very least try coming up with something that isnt just blatant chauvinism and gendered insults it would at least give you some credibility or prevent you demonstrating my point further",2023-07-24 22:19:55

"i think that barbieland is kinda meant to dumb down the real world and have the roles reversed to basically show how a man would feel in the shoes of a woman and because it’s more simplified the man’s position feels more blatant and isn’t covered up like women’s struggle in the real world whether or not people realize that just falls on them 

i do wish that there was some kind of morality change in the barbie’s where they decide to establish a society better than the real world because otherwise they’re just painting themselves as no better than men in the real world and i just think that really hinders the message but that’s really my only complaint",2023-07-23 18:03:53
"hes excluded from the most basic of activities because of his gender girls night every night is a pretty disgusting and sexist statement and thinking that is wrong has nothing to do with entitlement that certainly wasnt the only problem too  

historical societies with equally systemic misogyny where women are subject to violence  etc

the existence of crime is pretty far from systemic misogyny not just because it happens to men in far worse numbers than it does to women but because its most certainly not systematically encouraged legalized or tolerated its an absolutely insane and extreme take to pretend like the real world hates women because crimes happen to women too 

the comment section here shows why this movie is still very much needed but of the course the people needing it most are oblivious to that same fact

comments like yours demonstrate why this movie was not needed and why pandering to misandric extremists like you is so dangerous to begin with feeding delusional manhating beliefs like the one presented by this movie will only cause more harm maybe in barbie land going around spewing hateful propaganda to women is liberates them but in the real world is just creates more contempt hatred inequality conflict and destruction",2023-07-24 04:28:23
 90 of both critics and movie goers like it it definitely doesn’t objectively  i think you do deeply offended by barbie,2023-07-28 03:43:09

haaaaa ok,2023-07-22 00:19:20
of course that’s possible with most behaviorscharacteristics there’s a mixture of nature and nurture however evolution does help explain why on average women are more attracted to peopleoriented careers and men are more attracted to thingoriented careers and thingoriented careers tend to be more lucrative because of the market also men have more incentives to a lot more money bc there is more competition amongst men for  women simply don’t need to make a lot of money to attract a mate or have  it’s complicated but i think it makes sense,2023-07-22 15:47:51

i feel like you’re at war with an issue that you don’t understand please read the responses to your posts,2023-07-27 03:04:47
yeah that’s what they don’t understand they equate gender stereotypes and objectification to actually vilifying an entire gender and it’s not like old movies didn’t have male stereotypes though they generally didn’t prevent men from being relevant to the story or like new movies don’t objectify men a lot too but i can’t remember any movie that actually criticized women and treated them like a problem to men and society as a whole i can’t imagine a movie like this being made in hollywood much less reaching mainstream,2023-07-21 13:27:26

"satire ie exaggerated humor ridicule or irony to critique stupidity and vices especially in a political context

it’s a black comedy that is very exaggerate saying this film  meant to convey men are  is a surface level interpretation that completely ignores the greater  critique of our society and media it’s not a critique of the male gender

seriously you think one movie meant  to be an exaggerated comedy is worst for the portrayal of men than women casted seriously in the  role for decades   


using women as plot decides becomes problematic when majority of films are maleled and women have limited options for the types of characters they portray and consistently suffer from  lazy writing   


i used marilyn as a classic example but  this is not an issue of the past margot  robbie has openly spoken about  how she had to fight  against being typecasted in roles like her character in wolf of wall street whose only purpose is to be an object of  desire for the leading man and audience and homer simpson is anmisted character not an actual person like robbie who these issues have reallife impact on   


that is one dramatic comparison tell me when did me a marginalized group dealing with legal segregation on and a lack of civil rights last i checked  men still hold majority of the positions of power in the world this film  won’t change that

if you think the purpose of this film is to mock men you completely missed the actual messages being conveyed the end of the movie clearly acknowledges and validates the suffering of  both men and women‘s suffering under both the institutions of feminism and patriarchy it says the institutions are the result of people trying to survive in a world  for both genders barbielland is not  an attack on men it is showing us a world where gender roles are reversed to illustrate how ridiculous it is on a society and cultural level

im a big fan of barbies and the animated movies and shows and hes always thoughtful and nice like hes sometimes a goofball and sometimes hes smart but hes always got barbies back  


like overall its a pretty good characterization of ken in this film but for me its a little eyerolly because any major film thats like a comedic take on the barbie franchise the first thing they do is make ken some sort of  antagonist yknow",2023-07-21 14:31:09
the point is many women in the us are no longer allowed to make their own decisions regarding a medical procedure while men do not have an equivalent procedure they arent in charge of for themselves so actually the opposite is true you need to present a procedure that only men in the us are not allowed to decide to have for themselves barring things in clinical trials or things that dont exist do you have examples of such a thing,2023-07-22 23:26:47

"to add to your very valid points i think it is worth adding that many movies about transforming robots time travel and aliens are in fact social commentary too

aliens is in part a commentary on the vietnam war

avatar is the most unsubtle commentary about environmentalism and  of native populations ever made

robocop corporate greed and privatisation

star trek everything i mean the black and white faces episode i think that might just be commentary on something

i watch movies precisely to get away from  that barbie stands for

and if you did just an ounce of research yourself youd know perfectly well that barring women from positions of construction is illegal its called the equal employment opportunity act something that all businesses big or small public or private are all required to obey i didnt even have to google this all businesses hang up the equal employment opportunity law poster in the break rooms of businesses ive seen them since i started working jobs when i was 16 lol",2023-11-06 05:53:53
"yeah but gender didnt play a part in how i enjoyed the movie i like plenty of movies with female leadscasts alien aliens miss congeniality  bill doubt the descent drop dead gorgeous etc if the movies are written well and enjoyable to watch

barbie despite being told that its a multilayered satire its not but whatever if were told thats what it is and it must be true right just isnt an enjoyable movie  even as a comedy which is what its supposed to be i got a chuckle here and there but all the funny bits were things we already saw in the trailer barbie is a social flagwaving battle call for new wave feminism rallying gullible women

greta gerwig is probably the most repulsive female director in the history of movies given her recent films",2023-11-12 02:35:24
thats a good way to look at it its just too bad that the script and dialogue did a  job of portraying that,2023-11-12 02:42:13

"actually no it’s not a problem with men the problem is in thinking there’s something wrong with men because they don’t feel the same way as women and believing feminist women know better than them what is good for them emotionally that’s no different than men insisting women are too emotional and need to repress what is normal for them the problem is taking the emotional state and expression of emotion that a woman finds desirable and holding that up as the standard which is good for both men and women and men just don’t know it and need to be corrected that’s actually very arrogant

you do realise there’s a wide array of men who don’t throttle their wives both in this era and in every other era gone past well before feminism was a thing right the choice isn’t between throttling your wife or doing whatever bell hooks says

the third alternative is accepting that there’s actually nothing wrong with men on the whole and they aren’t really any  different today than they were 500 years ago and that’s absolutely aok and accepting that the reason they’re not receptive to bell hooks or gerwig style feminism is because they don’t actually emotionally need or benefit from the things that feminist women agree with other feminist women that they need yes some of them will sometimes do bad things to varying degrees  and most of them won’t but that will never change no matter how much feminism you try to push on them",2023-07-26 13:54:47
"i can gauge whether or not there is hype for a movie the same way i did it before social media by going outside and talking to people  or reading the newspaper  or checking how many showings of a film there are at my local theater  

and to clarify further the movie seems to be getting a mid level amount of hype  i wouldnt be surprised if it did better than oppenheimer given it has wider appeal and a shorter run time",2023-07-21 17:49:28

edit typos",2023-07-23 13:06:55
"i think thats definitely what they were going for im just not sure if thats the best way they could have ended it i mean even in the real world women have more power than the kens in barbie land even with the supreme court example used in the move 

i get its just a silly absurd movie and im probably overthinking it but the barbies are supposed to be the good guys were rooting for and its a bit disappointing to see their society seems to learn nothing from the whole ordeal",2023-07-23 12:40:32

"its not artificial if someone is able to perform the physical activities required to achieve the goal of the sport more emphatically and with greater adeptness they will often be more exciting to watch its like competency  people like watching experts in their field demonstrate their craft why do people watch some line chef who can skin an apple in 15 seconds in a youtube compilation and not some average guy who takes a full minute to do it

"i think they conveyed that ken’s existence revolves around barbie a lot throughout the movie just think about how he remarks it’s always girls night when she doesn’t let him stay over after the first party

no in barbie land we dont really know what ken gets up tomaybe ken is out doing cool things and then he comes home and adores barbie  thats the point  its not about ken  ken has his own thing going on  barbie has her own thing  barbie can do cool things hang out with her friends and be smart and be gorgeous or whatever and ken loves her  is greta saying that being all those things erodes masculinity  also is greta suggesting that barbies are not worthy of love  greta takes us backward the men are threatened vapid and insecure  is greta a manhater  it was painful to watch,2023-07-22 16:42:41

"i think it is harsh to draw the conclusion that the op is just anti feminist text when they criticise lazy writing and a poorly constructed monologue

moving onto your initial question i think the fact that legally blonde comes up in this thread is very interesting you can also bring up films like bend it like beckham and erin brockovich that conveyed messages that didnt remove you from the plot 

in saying that the first 20 minutes of this film were great but instead of maintaining the barbie and ken duo ww saw ken going off on his own  then we got nothing but patriarchy and cheap jokes when we couldve had barbie face more challenges i wouldve loved a scene where ferraras character took barbie to hide from mattel at her house because they wanted to put her in the box to which barbie questions the living situation and understands that dreamhouses dont exist also an interaction between ken and the husband learning spanish wouldve been just as beneficial to the characters learning that self improvement can go a long way in developing healthy relationship",2023-07-23 21:02:34
yes i agree with your interpretation too… resenting in this case is a little strong but it’s clear america’s character is struggling at the concept that her daughter is no longer the young and carefree little girl that loved to play barbies with her mom,2023-07-21 21:57:16

"1 this is correct and true for lots of things and will remain a valid point to use until the end of time

2 many if not most fields are far from equal women dont seem to want to do some jobs just as men also have low counts in some professions like child care airline steward etc men  women are apples and oranges neither is better and they have different tastes 1920 women have superior multitasking and linguistic abilities 1920 men have better abity to rotate 3d objects in their mind for example but legally either  can do either job if you are unable to get a job due to your  its time for legal action i dont know what else to say women have a legal recourse kens did not they were given the opposite",2023-07-23 13:56:43

if you were a hiring manager and had to choose would you ever dare to not choose the woman 



please tell me a fieldjob that a woman cant do

the barbie land was clearly portrayed much more positively than the kendom and it’s not a credit to the subversive nature of the film that the kens are watching the godfather  that’s just a chance for gerwig to take a shot at men and your giving her far too much credit reading into messages that aren’t thereintentionally ,2023-07-30 05:01:09

"i didn’t say that you lacks media literacy because you don’t like the movie 

i said you lack media literacy because you misunderstood the initial set up of the movie which is supposed to be developed and changed as the movie went on as something that movie actually believed

this is so incredibly clearly shown when the kens have to start from the bottom up with the hope of getting more rights its pointing out the stupidity of what a lot of society used to be and still has attachments too it wasnt an attack on men it was an attack on the undermining of women",2023-08-03 07:31:04

"violence is inherent in society no matter what without the threat of violence you don’t have any law and without violence you have no way to enforce law so logically speaking even a total matriarchy or total gender equality whatever that means would require men to be violent in order to uphold its laws and to punish men who didn’t go along with them

so it’s pretty naive to say that without “patriarchy” society wouldn’t be violent actually without violence society wouldn’t be society and there would be no law unless humans turn into mindless drones chowing down grass in a field any type of society will always be inherently violent",2023-07-27 11:51:43

"“because ken is at once a representation of the toxic and limiting effects of masculinity and the patriarchy on real men and a direct allegory for real world women and the proteas of women on film”

i know this  this is why the messaging is so convoluted and seems man especially man hating though every man in this being dumb didn’t help either it’s why it comes off that ken is bad when he does something about his oppression while real world women good it’s why people are confused on whether it’s meant to be an inverted world or the kens are bad it’s just bad writing  you can’t successfully make a character 10 conflicting things and expect it to be coherent

i understand what they tried to do with the writing but they failed it also doesn’t help that they made every single real world male and every ken dumb as  and had them do bad things  of course when you so completely caricature a gender like that it will come off as bitter and resentful of that gender 

also how is the look of the barbies and barbie land in the 60’s when the barbies are diverse in race and size that’s not 60’s barbie at all i think your reaching and seeing things that aren’t there to try to make an intellectual argument which makes sense of a film  which actually doesn’t make that much sense",2023-07-23 19:01:02

it was certainly deeper than most of comedies that i watched this year

oh yeah thats right at the end of the day this movie is supposedly just a comedy its meant to poke fun and jokes silly and goofy the whole time

its a comedy that has incorporated deeper themes but not at all a serious drama that should explore the themes with more complexity

"but is there noteworthy screentime showing how ken puts effort into  fixing himself a remark and a color change to frunturie is not character development that also doesnt answer barbies and kens coexisting together i am talking about a harmonious relationship for mutual benefiet

its still a weird message for a toyline that its creators do not manufacture for multi purpose play use a better end to get the same point acrosd woyld ken storming down to ynon kreizs house demmanding his company to change barbielnd but that would mean barbieland is not autonomous being the way it is becsuse its creators forced the setting to be as such instead it is its own secondary world realtily where the male gender has a hive mind until they wake up and realize o we dont need to act like this

barbie steorytpes exist because theres not a lot of options of how to use them just like army soldiers so it would make more sense to do a toystory esque story where the live action barbielanderd fight back against the toy compnies that make them ken could have ended up with a whole new ken line beyond a new physical appernces and name  a line of ken that forces kids to factor in a persoanitly different from what has been typically ascribed to him though kids these days already do that on their own    so


idk sounds like theres no major long lasting on screen evidence to support gretas and noahs theme again a last mintue line and pink to green blue doesnt sound like enough seems plot needs fixing

ken  self improvement

i want to know is it given an acutal plot line

a quick one liner at the end does not show a protaginst sovling their problem instead this form of dialogue stands out as a conflict resolver put on instant easy mode unless theres a barbie part 2 a lot is left up in the air

i still dont get it though based on the spoilers i read here girls and boys are known to play with  barbie the toyline in steoryptical ways because the company specialized in making those steorytpes stick as a lin of dolls theres not much diverisity in their play use so a change in the toy players imagagtion would need to be the foucs of change and the comapny ken as part of the toyline has no agency its weird to not have us in the movie influcining how they act we we humans are the reason for generic kens it is our mindset not his

"fair enough thanks for engaging in the discussion

i suppose my issue is i’ve always viewed these things from a ‘gender neutral’ view eg the traits of toxic masculinity are toxic when in either men or women but the concept of masculinity promotes them in men same for toxic femininity those same traits are toxic when a man does them too…the same for the historical stuff i tend to view it as rather than a gendered thing it was a power thing and you are right it was men who had the power…i don’t think in a female dominated societyequal society the government would run things any better apart from maybe things about abortion etc because it’s the power structures rather than the people’a gender which is the issue that said once there is a distinction drawn between people then it becomes ‘us’ vs ‘them’ again it’s an intersectionality thing for me i think being from working class northern england i’ve got more in common with women from my same position than i do with men from middle class america or women from here do with americans and we can draw up other divisions eg women got universal suffrage in 1928 in the uk…men got universal suffrage in 1918 just 10 years earlier and it was rich and powerful people who stopped everyone before that—i focus on the richnessclass aspect rather than the gender aspect…as it was done to disenfranchise both men and women


as for your last bit that does make more sense my wife and i were just having a conversation the other day about the beauty standards she feels even when being told not to by me or by others in society now there’s a shift to more body positivity—there is a total element of selfefficacy and expectations linked to the story of growing up and realising life won’t be the idealised view you had of it as a kid",2023-07-28 08:21:29

well you see it might make the kens think they are human beings and not slaves its a dangerous notion,2023-07-21 10:21:37
you do understand youre just being facetious the movie is obviously not saying that talking about our interests is bad,2023-07-21 13:50:02
of course i can  you talking about,2023-07-29 20:19:57

what a weird statement  i’m sure your girl just agrees with whatever you do or believe,2023-07-31 23:13:25
im beginning to think that this  movie is rorschach test because everyone is seeing something different,2023-07-23 08:43:41
ken is a satirical depiction of how women have always been portrayed in film he’s not demonizing men it’s reversing the roles,2023-07-23 09:48:02
"they didnt watch action movies and drink beer and talk about horses  is up with this its so random

ken saw dudes riding horses in the montage and clasped on to that because the person playing with him is a horse girl",2023-07-23 10:54:49
the problem is you don’t understand the difference between lecturing someone and talking to someone if this scene really went over your head that much then you are one of the men they are making fun of they aren’t making fun of you liking movies they’re making fun of you forcing a clearly bored woman to listen to your lecture about it,2023-07-23 09:19:06
the message of kens ending is that he should get a life instead of being so obsessed with barbie and trying to get her to become his girlfriend,2023-07-23 08:48:03
the horse thing is not that deep it’s a joke,2023-07-23 12:47:50
"sure i agree with you of course the whole movie is mattels pr they paid for it and thanks for the short history of the doll that wouldve been a whole movie in itself but barbies impacts on girls and women still remain even if that wasnt and isnt mattels primary goal money is and even if mattel is using all of this to pose itself as a female empowerment force just to gain more customers it would be dumb for them not to support female empowerment considering their main target audience those impacts still remain
sure she might have started as a  bombshell doll as you say but i dont think everyone would share that idea of barbie nowadays as a decades old toy she is history and in some ways mirrors the different time periods and the ways femininity is perceived performed and enforced
as for your questions if you want a pacific barbie movie you have the animated ones i guess is it negative to use gender wars as a theme for the movie i mean its an evergreen topic the movie poses questions and possible solutions for this topic and we need both of those i think and no it doesnt solve sexism no movie could do that and it jokes about that too in the beginning by saying barbie solved every girl and woman problems xd",2023-07-25 15:52:50
do you think the average women thinks theres full gender equality,2023-07-25 15:13:06
"i think i wasnt clear i wasnt calling the movie disingenous i was trying to respond to the criticism that this movie shouldnt have touched the gender wars topic by saying that it would be disingenous for the movie not to address it
i think the movie succeds in ruffling feathers and starting conversations it doesnt seem to me that the creators were trying to make something that would be easily received by everyone as for being a true reflection of society there isnt such a thing even in a documentary and this is a movie about living dolls that exagerates a lot for comedy its tone isnt that serious and when it gets serious it is shortly cut by comedy and self awareness it makes fun of a lot and that irked some people but thats not a problem its intentional provocative subversive",2023-07-25 15:25:17
"i think the difference is about filmmaking  you want a masterpiece film and i said thought provoking specifically referring to the themes and ideas expressed  that is the wording which you criticized  i admitted technical flaws with the movie itself particularly how they said their main point outloud at the end in a kind of hamfisted exposition dump ironically reminiscent of a lot of nolan movies  it didnt have any particularly interesting cinematography or filmmaking choices except when they needed visual gags or playing on the barbie aesthetic  

as a filmmaking study oppenheimer probably has a lot more to look at but as a work of art which i think is the greater purpose of filmmaking as a tool barbie did a much better job by creating something enjoyable entertaining and thought provoking

nolan made a perfectly passable historical biopic and i would certainly watch it along with the likes of the imitation game or darkest hour or the post but it is nothing new or groundbreaking or particularly relevant today",2023-07-23 03:21:44

its kind of like pinocchio

actually its nothing like the classic and nigh perfect tale of pinocchio it is an insult to say that it is in this essay i will",2023-07-25 00:51:35
how did it say masculinity was bad i agree with the below that it says patriarchy is bad i think it celebrated things men like to do while calling out the societal roles of men and women,2023-07-26 00:41:24

but the entire point is that barbies in barbieland never experienced any of those things under a matriarchal society i honestly loved the first half but if youre asking me to accept the cause of total matriarchy with no male representation in government as the movie concluded then ya i would very much struggle to accept that,2023-08-18 00:53:58

or we can have open discussion instead,2023-09-09 00:42:45
"i think the “sentimental treat for many” would be the barbieland portion of the movie i can see where many of us doll collectors would love to see our favorites and not so favorites poke fun at themselves and concepts and see them come to life with exquisite costumes and sets

the concept of “whacky barbie” is hilarious i knew from reading many interviews that most of the movie was not going to be like the trailer though so i can appreciate reading how others felt on other sites like a “bait and switch” when the movie morphs into the real world plot and speeches",2023-07-22 15:05:17
yes it looked great but had no plot and seemed so full of insider jokes that it was lost on anyone who didn’t either live in california or work in hollywood  i should have guessed when they cast will farrell  any movie with him is either really good… or really bad,2023-07-22 12:39:53

and i think it was a good call out to us women as well the  way barbieworld was juxtaposed with the real world made the treatment of the kens highlight some of the cognitive dissonance i see in some womenfeminists because just like the kens started looking down on the barbies when fighting for a place in society ive definitely seen women do that as well this among other themes in the movie that juxtapose gender nuances in reality with the fantasy world of barbielandare why i see this movie as being for both supportive yet a cautionary tale for both genders which surprised me tbh,2023-07-25 03:03:33

i think you’re looking a bit too deep into it no pun intended it’s just a joke the joke is you think she’s going for a job interview but haha muh  instead that’s it i’m just wondering why the most important thing barbie gets in the real world is a  almost seems antifeminist in a way to be like “being a woman is just about having a  you are a ” instead of showing her integrate with others in more meaningful ways,2023-07-26 19:08:01

they also explain who handler is they represent matteld involvement in the climax honestly im not gonna say the movie is super tightly written but them being there makes way more sense than staying in the real world while barbie takes two humans to the barbie world they want to keep things normal and thats not normal,2023-07-25 19:07:35
"oh okay so its not like this is the literal end of barbie like without that one barbie all of barbie and mattel ceases to exist

cause when i watched the ending i was glad stereotypical barbie found her answer but i also felt like once she left barbieland for good her world is erased and mattel stops making barbie and such personally i would have freaked out as i am telling the truth but sdcc made me get alot of great toys from them including monster high and the megablok set of magikarp

as long as this isnt like some endgame to say barbie is now retired and she wont come back i at least can say thank you since i dont want barbie to go away i always saw men and women equality in a very lighthearted and serious matter i see women as powerful as us men and have alot of smarts and talents as guys and i would never think less of the female gender at all

overall this helps me as i dont want anything to be erased or end in a sad depressed nightmare since barbie to me i always thought everybody can play with it as well as ken

this cheers me up since i just thought this movie was truely saying to me barbie is now human her toys are history and we have to move on cause to me i like when fans are dressed up as barbie and ken and still have the toys

yes you can mature and grow up but dont forget your past the good parts and dont become cynical and cruel

and for that sophiewalt i humbly thank you for your help 3",2023-07-31 05:56:26
"thats a very good if not creativetheory here since i never thought i would hear petrr pan here

that does help since that is true we only followed the stereotypical barbie in the movie meaning she was one in a million so barbieland is safe then 

good cause i would have somewhat worried if the animated barbie films were in jeopardy since those were made for kids xd im silly btw

still this helped alot so thank you 3",2023-08-02 04:08:27
i dont think theres any chance of mattel retiring barbie theyll have increased sales from the movie tons of publicity also people collect barbies regarding their continued popularity check out what people are charging for vintage barbie clothes,2023-07-31 05:51:38

"thats not the movies fault they even acknowledge your point with the average barbie scene at the end with the mattel execs yes its all cynical when you think about it deeply but hey we live in a capitalist society

also i feel bad for wanting one of those kenough hoodies im a sucker for tye dye",2023-07-31 16:31:48
well thats not fully mattels problem either thats resale culture  which does need to be regulated a but thankfully in a free market society we still have a choice in what we consume  i wouldnt buy the movie dolls as much as i love this film were it 20 dollars 50 dollars or 170 dollars im not interested in that i have already seen this movie twice and plan to cop one of those ken hoodies mattel has enough of my money lol,2023-07-31 19:34:54

i really didnt get this implication that hed be so  that even after a decade of trying he cant even properly greet somebody even because if the movie didnt insult the airheadness of macho kens why the  should they take an issue with a real life character doing his best  and if any the fact that he was using duolingo was making him even more relatable",2023-08-07 00:52:05

my theatre only got a few chuckles out of it and yea its a bad feminist movie,2023-07-22 16:38:05
"yes agreed and the rich are mostly made up of… men

how do you figure for every wealthy ceo you see on the cover of forbes youre not seeing his wife and family who enjoy all of the riches with none of the work 

on that point theres lots of wealthy powerful women in the real world in barbieland literally no man had any influence political power or cultural cache whatsoever 

regardless the vast majority of men are not wealthy so it seems unfair to castigate the entire gender for what is actually the actions of the relatively small wealthy donor class 

it’s bonkers you think sexism and classism aren’t interrelated issues that need to be addressed together while also saying that they exist

i didnt say that actually sexism obviously exists but you cant tell me that goslings character getting inspired by a midmovie montage about various types of millionaires and ceos is somehow a reflection of male privilege and not class privilege 

this is actually a widespread issue with feminist narratives many things attributed to the patriarchy in fact class issues not gender issues but you can bet your  that the wealthy are perfectly ok with this divideandconquer strategy that keeps the working poor at each others throats by obfuscating the abuses of the rich against poor as abuses of men against women",2023-07-23 08:10:54
"yes things are made by men i understood that part of the movie barbie is not made for men so that part of your statement is moot assuming you’re not specifically talking about any part of the movie and i did not perpetuate that you did say that women can’t enjoy masculine things i was asking a question

edit the “for men” in your statement could be about the profit from selling feminine products but in my comment i’m only talking about entertainment value",2023-07-23 15:11:37
"it’s not about the threat of those comments it’s about the value we put on women the women themselves in that movie in subtle ways appreciate the physical value of a woman first they loudly stated they liked other internal characteristics but if you pay attention it’s not what they only care about

the threat of violence women receive is its own issue that i have my own disagreements about it was portrayed but it’s not strictly relevant to this point",2023-07-23 15:16:27
"perhaps thats a good point although i think that sentiment was captured more specifically by the lady asking him for the time it was a totally neutral inquiry but to him it was some weird kind of validation that he later mentioned verbally and nonverbally

rather i think the purpose of their juxtaposed lines was to highlight the stereotypical difference between the basic in public operating mentality that men and women are perceived to have

the problem is that this stereotype isnt entirely accurate as men dont inherently feel safe or admired around total strangers in public

this is just one of several scenes that revealed a general ignorance by the films writers of actual male psychology they seem to be deep into the fringes of modern feminist political dogma which generally holds men in very low regard we see that throughout the film with the total lack of any positive male role model or frankly any male character who wasnt an idiot pervert greedy  or some combination thereof",2023-07-23 09:41:34
can we recognize how depressing that is,2023-07-23 12:41:28
i think were talking about people writing a guy as if they have no experience what its actually like being a guy,2023-07-23 08:14:23
"on the contrary i think the juxtoposition of their two lines was specifically to highlight the differences in these purported mindsets

the political argument in the real world is that men are literally oblivious to the danger women face as they dont think about the world in terms of danger like strange men lurking around a parking lot

ive said this in other comments but these writers are clearly deep into modern feminist rhetoric because they get the womans perspective right but not the mens and generally assume poorly of them which explains why they think men are naively confident and feel admired for no reason too",2023-07-23 10:16:31
it seems like hes internalized a lot of inaccurate feminist tropes about men because most of the  in that movie is ideological nonsense the idea that men walk down the street feeling admiration from total strangers and have no sense of any underlying danger absolute nonsense and a totally ignorant depiction of mens experience,2023-07-23 08:13:28
but thats exactly what i mean barbies issues are framed around her own internal relationship to women not womens relation to barbie as a product,2023-07-23 11:36:32
why is there such a sneering condescending attitude to some women not enjoying this film in this post it has been advertised as a fun whackadoodle barbie goes to the real world campy fun adventure,2023-07-22 15:19:45
they certainly are not imaginary and most certainly not dumb and if youd read my comments youd have seen that i have no issue with this film as i havent seen it i just find it odd that a film based on a toy brand is aimed at people in their 20s no need to be rude you  stereotypical glob of reddit phlegm  calling my wife and 15 yr old daughter  dumb gets upvotes ok reddit whatever,2023-07-22 12:49:30
"i think you see it as making fun of men because you are a traditionally masculine man and the movie skewers toxic masculinity which overlaps more with traditionally masculine concepts

im a man im even straight married and with kids but at no point did i feel like the movie was making fun of me and its because im wholly uninterested in dominating women fist fighting other men riding horses etc

in fact its very tender with men like me

1 i think barbie tells ken its ok to cry movies can sometimes make me cry when ken is busy being ashamed of it barbie apologizes for not spending time with him the idea of crying being a shameful womanly act is a feature commonly associated with toxic masculinity

2 the movie encourages men not to define themselves in terms of getting a romantic partner this is something ken struggles with throughout the movie when barbie tells ken to figure out who he is by himself rather than who he is in relation to her this is something ive had to work on and get better about personally the idea of only being a real man when youve got a woman to protect is a feature commonly associated with toxic masculinity

3 i think the most likeable man in the movie is allan who decides to leave rather than support kendom and he only resorts to violence when he and his female colleagues are forced to by the hyperaggressive kens the movie made this conscious choice to contrast his manness with the toxic manness of the kens sorry i dont have the academic terms for this stuff

point is the movie skewers a common image of what a man is supposed to be but thats not the same thing as skewering men which would be more like lol penises are so  men are all irrational beings etc",2023-07-25 20:08:10
no it just means i have an idea of what a liberal barbie movie looks like,2023-07-23 22:58:31
"plenty of men care about what patriarchy and toxic masculinity does to our psychology you just happen to not care maybe thats a blind spot maybe youve already gone through a personal growth era idk 

i also thought it was a bit weird that they never really resolved what the kens get up to in a matriarchy but then again that was partially the message consider the line eventually the kens will have as much power in barbie world as women do in the real world considering whats happening in the usa to womens rights i think thats a totally fine criticism and it makes sense that women would enjoy a fantasy matriarchy movie as a break from the real world",2023-07-22 04:19:25

look at any popular  blockbuster and none of them focus on making a gender look   they focus on characters and their arcs  this charcter is   this one is intelligent  this one is unhinged etc ",2023-07-23 05:36:48

"the gynecologist scene is a joke its been seen universally as a joke it is delivered as a joke i am not suggesting visiting a gynecologist is a joke but the movie treated this scene as a joke there is absolutely 100 man or woman no way to begin a discussion on if the gynecologist scene is a joke or not 

the misdirection on her visit being for a gynecologist is a shock its misdirection thats the point thats why they didnt say good luck at the gynecologist because it would give the joke away if they said in the car good luck at the gynecologist and she walked in and said my gynecologist it wouldnt be a scene it would be nothing

we cannot get anywhere in a discussion if you are unwilling to admit the truth this is the most absurd thing i have ever been a part of as a discussion you cannot accept a basic fact about the movie  so there is no point in having a discussion here 

i understand the issues between the genders i dont know what this rant has to do with the movie or my criticism of it

for the record 10 minutes before the credits is will ferrel talking about tickling people are you perhaps thinking 10 minutes before the credits was a different scene because its a short scene youre telling me you teared up during a joke the beginning of any dramatic emotional parts begins with like 6 minutes left in the movie because as i have said the movie is very very very brief on any development or even action for its lead character 

but yeah if you dont think the gynecologist line is in the movie as a joke  there is no discussion here i absolutely will not have a conversation with someone who does not understand basic comedy in a comedy",2023-08-07 03:13:52
"you’re being willfully obtuse to try and maintain your stance and it just makes no sense i cannot in good faith just go “boohoo men are so oppressed by women” because it’s just not  true the entire reason we have  like this movie today is because men have the power and don’t lie and say that it’s 2023 and women do because men took and decided women’s bodily autonomy just last year when they overturned roe v wade women have been oppressed for years upon years just like  people and now that we are getting movies that call out the system now that we’re getting  representation in media people wanna be like “everything is woke these days and pushing an agenda” but men have been pushing an agenda for years we have these movies because those minorities were repressed and still are repressed i’m not antimen but i don’t feel bad for you because you’re wounded by the barbie movie

i read your other comment about letting women free meaning 60 of men will have no love or  life and to that i say boo  hoo maybe they should actually try harder instead of just expecting women to come to them or complaining about it online women don’t exist for men to love and have  with get over yourself

you’re not being bullied because you’re a man you’re being “bullied” because you’re an incel you want love or a  life you ain’t gonna find it in the thread for the  barbie movie

"im not so sure my take is correct im simply surprised so many people arent seeing what i was able to see pretty easily maybe its because im slightly familiar with the history of storytelling through visual media

however the general public like to be spoonfed information from start to finish and any points left unresolved are instantly seen as plot holes and bad storytelling when it could just simply be that the filmmakers wanted the viewers to use their own interpretation for once 

the good thing about comedies with deeper plot points is that for those of you who dont want to or cant decipher the deeper meaning shown through subtle jokes and preachy ending scenes you can simply enjoy the movies jokes on a surface level and go about your day",2023-07-22 22:43:05
oh i definitely agree on the comedy point i was very much the target demographic for the depression barbie bit especially lol maybe thats why the movie felt a bit disjointed for me,2023-07-24 00:39:32

 also i would say loneliness is one of the biggest things effecting many from all generations since the beginning of time

i agree

 that won’t change

maybe maybe not but highlighting it and recognizing it isnt a bad thing and regardless of the creators intent this movie really resonated with me in that way from the beginning you can see these guys struggling with feeling lonely and unseen and at the end of the movie they still largely feel that way in dealing with that emotion very little changes for either ken or allen whether you find that to be because the creator hates men or because thats how life goes and thats what men deal with thats up to you",2023-08-01 19:19:31

its a great emotional relief you dont have to cry regularly but you also shouldnt hold it back because of societal norms

what if men don’t need or get a lot out of talking about feelings like women do

do you really think that that talking about feelings is a women thing if yes then thats a big oof from me

getting rejected by stallone who then told her she could find herself would be played as a positive ending for the main female character of one of his movies and if it was women watching would be insulted by it

ah yeah because a female characters only positive ending could be getting together with a man",2023-08-01 17:11:18

because the barbie matriarchy isn’t really a deep critique of feminism itself it’s simply a shallow vision of a female dominated society even if you take the barbie land matriachy as a critique of feminism  look at how it is compared to the kendom the barbies are competent they want to lead they get along then look at the kendom they’re idiots they fight ken literally admits he doesn’t even want to be in power the whole kendom is a comedic take down of “patriarchy” and obviously meant to highlight and exaggerate negative male behaviour  you can’t say that the barbie matriarchy is written in such a way that it comedically skewers and highlights negative female behaviour and paints it in a comparatively negative way,2023-08-06 17:03:16

what moment of the film do you think was saying haha men bad,2023-07-24 00:53:44
"yes firstly that doesnt matter because the ken also represents women in the real world as do the barbies more aspirational than the real irl scenario of course so both are about women and thats wonderful  


secondly yes saving barbieland from patriarchy doesnt work as they throw barbieland back into somewhat the original status quo where the kens are somewhat powerless a bit less than they were before perhaps but still  


and it is supposed to not be the correct solution it is a satire of how women are given irrelevant or at least comparatively inferior positions of power in order to pretend equality has been achieved when it really hasnt just like kens didnt achieve it by the end",2023-07-24 17:04:58
yeah the point is it wasnt funny at all  it was ridiculous  in the worst possible way  lots of tellingpreaching which wasnt funny at all and wasnt intended to be funny it seems like this supposedly being a comedy very little meaningful showing,2023-08-24 00:17:54
they also dont use it correctly a guy sleeping with hundreds of women is called an incel,2023-08-01 11:52:50
i think the entire point was that kens arent violent and egotistical because they are men but because their only purpose is to be a boyfriend and nothing else in the end they do let the kens be their own people and while i admit that the ending with the president felt a little misandrist i interpreted it as lets do it slowly because we have a difficult past and giving them too much power could lead to another ken war and while the movie did try to be serious most of it was meant as a joke anyways,2023-07-23 07:46:52
lol this thread spiraled its sounding like the matrix  serve so a husband can not just cheat abuse you toss you like an employer could and of course there are good men that dont abuse the power that comes with being the sole incomebreadwinner but unfortunately ive seen too much pain misery and literal life threatening things happen to women who have no own money what so ever and fully depend on their husband that tend to abuse the power he has boosts his ego i guess makes him feel important and mighty would you feel comfortable in handing all your autonomy and control over your life to someone else would you like the idea of serving your spouse and giving up all your independence,2023-07-23 23:38:40

"he is not shown as a villain at all the whole time ken’s are fighting and supposed to be “evil” there is an entire song playing alongside with lyrics that specifically highlight how sad ken’s situation is you feel for him and that’s also why barbie apologised to ken in the end 

like i’m genuinely confused how anyone could hate ken in the movie because it didn’t come across like that to me even once he is just shown as misguided after having played support role for so long

there is a reason why ‘ken stole the show’ it’s because he was written like that complex and grey and sweet and sympathetic not as a caricature villain",2023-07-24 11:15:21
no this is exactly how men treat women didnt you lke it women dont like being treated like that either,2023-07-24 09:06:57
"well during the whole film they were constantly repeating that barbie is barbie and ken is only and addition 

at the end the barbies are the one who rules kens stayed where they were 

it’s absolutely normal that silly characters are taking most attention of people same goes in many movies and cartoons i cannot imagine barbie being all that silly as ken was he added a bit of humor there and there is nothing wrong with that moreover because of him they showed us that men are also people like us that have emotions and many other things",2023-07-24 07:19:52
hmmm i thought it pulled its punches quite a bit but fair enough if its generating discussion i guess thats where maybe more nuance can come in anyway i guess,2023-07-21 17:11:15
"i meant that the movie portrayed men as morons not that barbie herself said it the ending  dude i’m not saying it’s wrong not to want to be with someone who doesn’t want to be with you but to paint that as a some big satisfying ending is laughable the whole movie was a downer

i’m just saying  this is the movie the kids will have seen they won’t care about anything else so do i really want my small kids playing with a doll set with themes of gender war and oppression even if they’re presented in a light hearted way yeah that’s gonna be a great play time between my daughter and son",2023-08-02 08:26:36
"men raging at the movie are just mad because for 2 hours they saw how bad men could have it the tables were reversed so close to understanding that non men have been second class citizens for thousands of years i’m a man and i got a pretty hearty laugh out of the whole movie i even got “personally attacked” a few times like the over explaining nerdy stuff scene the zero self worth unless an attractive woman values you or the relentless guitar playing

i think it helps that ken is just a toy and barbieland never has bad weather but even as a simple minded toy brain he could understand that he’s treated like  when woman have nice houses and he’s just a background fixing",2023-07-23 17:34:53
im not sure if i remembered but didnt one of the ken elected to be a part of the government too,2023-07-23 16:42:38
"honestly i dont think dumb man is petty revenge because its been done for a long time by the industry ran pretty much by men they didnt mind it as much because it never meant or amounted to anything and honestly was also true to some extent like men being raised and cared for by women to be dependent on women for food clean clothes etc and taking care of the home and kids hence it was the standard for men to be helpless in those areas 
still men being more powerful in other areas could afford to have some shots taken at them in the form of some homer simpson or hundreds of other examples just like mattel is seemingly taking shots in this film but the company wont be hurting for it



regarding kens and what theyre expected to bedo i honestly dont know about them  but i do agree with the film in the area that there are double standards for women and minorities and as a man i can see this more clearly the older i am and that everyone including women themselves will always find a way to  on the woman and in situations where two people in the public eye do a similar type of misdeed the woman will often take more  for it on the other hand i can also see that women can be hampered by having too many expectations and goals that are difficult to combine like wanting to achieve something or be the best but also being universally liked and respected and or raising children and or managing others peoples emotionsexpectations etc and generally caring too much and too intensy about precisely what other people will thing as well as other stuff that men generally can afford to care less about 

also i do still feel that pretty much all the kens were  with low social intelligence very little knowhow about anything other than beach or dancing they had construction workers who didnt know how to build a wall a skill that most toddlers are capable of and who were all beaten by one allen who is obviously less physically fit than all the kens they also uncreatively all sang the same song to their barbies right next to each other which is just plain silly 

overall i liked the film i liked the acting i laughed at the jokes i felt like the film was quite messy and chaotic in what it was trying to achieve and there are plenty of elements and messages that for me dont blend together even though they might be valuable apart from each other",2023-07-25 12:14:29
"men being a dumb stereotype in a feminist movie being “expected” hardly excuses it it actually says something quite negative about feminism and the director that it was expected

maybe gerwig just wrote all the men dumb because that’s how she really thinks and that’s why the barbie matriachy is obviously better portrayed than the kendom and real world or maybe she just sees it as fine to make all men into a strawman character of idiots to make her feminist point 
i think people are reading some compassionate genius into the portrayal of men in this movie which isn’t there at all",2023-07-25 12:01:24
"right

it is hilarious though how many people in this thread are simultaneously whinging the movies not subtle enough and making it clear they havent seen or didnt get it 

one crackpot has spammed his wildly wide of the mark take all over the topic at least 50 times over a movie it isnt clear hes actually seen bonkers",2023-07-25 16:03:44
you think this movie has a deeper meaning but it was honestly very surface level i want you to find yourself ken except were gonna go back to how things are and the kens can start at the lowest level of society again and maybe work their way up over time,2023-08-02 07:42:55
the dumb bait and switch take feels like a very specific kind of  which one of the stooges gave them that,2023-07-25 17:12:36
sure but that would have been the whole point its not barbie and ken its barbie and its ken the movie was so close to the kens figuring it out together without input from the barbies,2023-07-29 18:30:44
" i think the fact that the battle ended up a dance battle that turned into a coop dance scene was really good progression

which then felt undermined by the barbies celebrating keeping things the same by tricking the dumb kens it really took the wind out of the emotion all the kens dealt with and made them seem  for being so easily manipulated

its not barbies place to fix ken but dont have ken go through this  then immediately play it out like a joke ken finally feels acceptance and respect but then it turns into an obsession with horses and going full incel ken deals with heartache and jealousy but the joke is hes dumb and fragile for having those feelings ken deals with loss of power and confusion about purpose and its played for laughs with him blubbering

they couldve had a film about ken and barbie both individually discovering themselves and their purpose but they put ken in the villain role for a significant section of the film i liked the message about an existential crisis but it felt spoiled by the gender wars",2023-07-29 22:01:54
" why would they make half the movie about men when part of the theme is that women

thats a good question why did they quite frankly i was surprised by how much focus on men there actually was in this film",2023-07-29 22:06:07
they already made half the movie about ken by virtue of him developing into the primary antagonist of the film the payoff could have been delivered without diminishing the barbie story at all,2023-07-29 04:47:57

"you can’t guarantee that at all

once upon a time in america has a clever woman who is portrayed roundly  bad  happens to her but it’s not meant to make her bad

knocked up  the woman is smarter than the man

the social network  again the women aren’t portrayed as morons 

if you mean donnie brasco that’s not sexist at all it can’t even be suggested

last tango in paris is a   romance which also isn’t sexist

wolf of wall street  how is this sexist there’s not a negative overall portrayal of women in relation to men a  woman who is a gold digger is one character not an entire gender

transformers  lol what how how are the women in that portrayed negatively i see the problem here you think that women not staring in something means the movie is sexist or a negative portrayal no  what makes barbie so sexist against men is their entire gender is portrayed as idiots you can’t honestly say that is the case in transformers at all

i think you should continue because none of the movies you’ve mentioned portray the entire gender of women as  and doing bad things  they may have portrayals of a single bad female character or even just have bad things happen to a female character ala once upon a time in america  but none are so uncomplicatedly potraying a whole gender as idiots doing something wrong

 assault and women being brutally hurt men are also brutally hurt on screen is in no way sexist like the barbie movie because it isn’t making a generically bad image of an entire gender like barbie does

you need to get over yourself because your comment is very misguided it’s not one negative portrayal of someone of a specific gender which makes a movie hateful  that’s one character  it’s when every character from the same gender is portrayed as  and in the wrong

this is a sub for discussing movies if you can’t handle a different opinion without getting mad at the person making it that’s not my problem it’s yours",2023-07-24 17:50:38

it doesn’t have to be relatable to all men to be a positive message for men we watch films all the time about characters who aren’t like us,2023-07-22 16:13:17

" the choice to make all the ken’s kind of a joke was not to be taken as a literal description of real men 

it quite clearly was most of the jokes dont land if you dont interpret the kens as either real world women for the first 15 minutes or real world men the behaviour the kens exhibit after ken returns is textbook toxic masculinity if youre saying that isnt meant to be taken literally then youre discounting a key message of the movie  one that isnt exactly delivered subtly

im not sure youre understanding my point i was fully up for a movie that flips the roles and puts men as victims of a matriarchy to highlight womens struggles in the real world but it doesnt do that well it does but only for 15 minutes the rest of the movie flips it back to a patriarchy and continues to attack men the whole time the movie wants to have its cake and eat it it wants men to be the victims when highlighting womens struggles but also simultaneously maintain them as aggressors when critiquing the patriarchy its attacking them from two fronts a satirical one and a sincere one women are never the bad guys in this movie whether theyre representing realworld men or realworld women",2023-08-05 22:29:46
give me an example,2023-08-05 22:33:27
"i agree as a women i related to ken the most in the movie since he was treated the same way i am 

which makes me sad when he cried the audience laughs when he says how the small thing being important enough to be asked the time is big for him they laughed at the end when they explain why he went crazy they didn’t say it’s because of the way he was treated by the barbies they say it’s because he was in love with barbie which completely ignores the theme that kens are being treated the same as women and the barbies are just as bad as men 

then saying that the kens can not have a spot on the supreme court as well was laughed at and the narrator said “once the kens get it they’ll have as much power as women in the real world” which says they still will be treated badly since us women are still treated badly

if they made it more clear that the barbies were in the wrong too i would like it more maybe i missed it but can you show me besides the one line barbie says about girls night where they show the troubles ken goes through i can give you probably over 50 were they talk about women in the real world which isn’t a problem i just wish it was as obvious about the ken issue too 

also i get the kens we’re treated that way to mirror the real world but i was mainly replying to your response about women being treated bad in movies so it’s okay for the kens does that mean you do agree that it’s okay if this movie made all the white barbie’s bad just because poc women in movies have been treated badly i’m genuinely curious about that",2023-07-23 00:24:38

this is precisely why it is bad and awful because it is sexist so all commentary about how oppressed women are become irrelevant when in the next scene it gleefully treats men the same way it critisizes society for treating women do you comprehend what i just wrote

about oppenheimer the cast doesnt matter for this movie because it is about the atomic bomb not about gender and if it tries to be realistic then it is expected to have fewer women considering the time period  the target audience is for people who are interested in history and philosophy if more men are into this so be it it doesnt make it sexist",2023-07-26 14:41:14
"yeah  those are two characters not an entire gender in case you didn’t realise al bundy is also the butt of the joke and dumb actually the whole family is a joke but here only ken and men are while barbies aren’t  that’s the difference actually the movie suffers in another way for it  the barbies are more boring then the kens because they’re not allowed to be the butt of the joke a lot of potential humour was missed by not having some of the barbies be more in line with the  people thought of them as and others be clever like a beach barbie and a scientist barbie instead they’re all clever

i’m not just saying ken is an idiot  i’m saying all the kens and real world men are portrayed as idiots if it were just beach ken or even a lot of other kens it wouldn’t be a problem 

again ken being unimportant doesn’t bother me if anything he is too important and it detracts from barbie who is boring as a result ken was a doctor and a bunch of other jobs though he was often released with the same job as barbie

oh yes we’re just too sensitive i’ll be sure to use that line on women when they’re offended by a movie and see how it goes down i heard all the speeches and what not  but really i could have been far more sympathetic to them if they didn’t come in the middle of a movie which clearly has a lot of bitterness toward men and since so many women can’t recognise it then i can’t really be assed to care about the point of the movie from womens point of view 

women wouldn’t like it if a movie for men spent the entire time ripping on women and their interests and portraying them as nothing but dumb caricatures at all",2023-07-24 14:20:00
not that i have a dog in this fight but why are you referencing shows from 3035 years ago for an argument in 2023 if thats how far back you need to reach then women arent being placed in those roles anymore but its ok for men to be in 2023,2023-07-24 14:10:52
perhaps it would be easier to get into the bits which encourage empathy for women’s experience if the rest of the movie wasn’t a joke at the entire male genders expense as it is even though i’m sure feminist women will love it and a lot do women will probably like it most men either won’t care or it will actually have a negative effect on their view of feminism,2023-07-24 14:24:33
no we all understood it we just didn’t like it it’s funny how it’s not ok to stereotype groups unless they’re men this movie even pointed out how sexist it truly was against men when they made the quote ‘i don’t know where the ken’s livesleep’ because they didn’t care they only cared about being the ones in charge it’s funny how a group that complains about being oppressed all the time loves oppressing others a woman world wouldn’t be any more loving or great it’s only an inverse to the modern world,2023-07-22 22:49:42
it also depicts the kens as morons who are incompetent once they take over and shows they don’t even want to be in charge how is that a pro equality message if anything from the way the kens are shown in the movie they shouldn’t have any power as the barbies are clearly smarter and morally better than them,2023-07-31 10:32:48

sensitive has kinda gained a negative connotation when originally it just means being aware and taking care of others feelings and my own now it’s like interchangeable with “easily offended” i can recognize a bad line of dialogue is a bad line this particular piece of dialogue tries to do something deep using an actual horrific event like a pandemic like yeah we all know human history sucks i wasn’t crying about it in the theater or was so angry i zoned out of course not i just recognized the line of dialogue being a poor explanation and also tone deaf using a smallpox analogy in a film is not wrong when it makes sense but like this was dumb,2023-07-28 15:50:12

"thank you for clarification of your original statement i appreciated it

however even though one of the messages that was given was to be yourself that does not make the movie in general a promen movie the men still have to live under a matriarchy by the end of the movie which i understand is supposed to be a satirical parody of today’s world by being an inverted society but the thing is that the matriarchy is viewed positively in this movie instead of being viewed as an equal evil to the patriarchy this i believe far overshadows the individual character development of ken",2023-07-23 18:43:17

that’s a bad justification even a comedy fantasy should have some logic random things that made no sense within the movie didn’t happen in the flinstones movie or the addams family,2023-07-28 03:19:53
"those are the things that’s understandable because they’re dolls they have no mirrors as well so they don’t judge themselves and be happy i get that point but those scenes where even the ceo jumps out in front with his group tickling him idiotically and asks president barbie to call him mother and minutes later the maker of barbie ruth handler out of nowhere shows up in barbieland to give her version of wise lady speech and turns a barbie doll into human if only that technology existed i’ll reverse the process become a plastic doll just to not remember that this garbage is getting so much praise how do you defend that kind of nonsense seriously

i genuinely thought that the movie might be silly at times but things are just happening in this film for no good reason whatsoever it’s just really disappointing and lazy writing",2023-07-28 01:54:19
"it was hard for me to accept that barbie was doing anything wrong because the beginning was before things started changing once america ferrara started drawing her weird barbie’s barbie in barbieland was just stereotypical barbie doing stereotypical barbie things she didn’t have any agency or the ability to think thoughts outside of the norm she wasn’t capable of realizing ken was her boyfriend and should sleep over once in a while 

if she was aware of how she was shutting him out in favor of endless girls nights then i could blame her but the movie sort of sends mixed messages in that area she apologizes for it once she has the benefit of hindsight but nothing indicates she was mean to him on purpose

i think i’m over analyzing that’s just how i took it",2023-07-29 20:48:56
i don’t get it you can look into the serious topics in frickin’ spongebob if you want to but that doesn’t make it an adult show spongebob is my favorite cartoon ever and the spongebob movie is my favorite movie ever but that doesn’t mean it’s for adults why should fox news be freaking out about it and vice versa why should adults be saying that if you don’t like it you must be a trump supporter isn’ just a kids movie for children,2023-08-01 21:10:30

right ,2023-07-23 17:05:32
"if everyones got it then why didnt they get that the kens are being treated the way women in the real world are being treated why are you still mad about that or is it because you refuse to acknowledge the issue and women arent in fact treated like that 

if the message of the movie seems muddled to you then you havent got the ability to look at the nuance of it its artfilm mixed messages is a poor way to classify this since anything other the depthdiversity of ideas presented would be boring and shallow its supposed to get you to think you cant just give up when you find something confusing did you even do math in high school lol 

finally everyone in my circle that ive spoken to havent had the same impression of all the men being dumbidiots maybe consider that youre possibly projecting you should read baumeister et al 1998 for more evidence on that 

ps just to clarify kens are not men barbies are not women",2023-07-23 18:44:21
"what is the takeaway from the movie because it genuinely did seem a bit muddled

i mean initially it seems like the kens in barbie world are supposed to an analogue for women living under that patriarchy safe and secure and meaningless existences with literally no agency barbies have all the agency and all the intellect and control of the world

but then ken goes to the real world discovers patriarchy and brings it back to barbie land and somehow dominates and brainwashes the entire matriarchy upending it and turning it into a patriarchy so then its not about the kens being an analogue for women under the patriarchy 

so is the film then saying that its not about a flipped patriarchy but the fact that kens when they gain power will inevitably make a patriarchy

the film seems to play odd beats with the story and who exactly is meant to be running the show its got to be the barbies to begin with but one trip to patriarchy land the real world and ken is suddenly capable of upending the status quo because the barbies are helpless and without agency of their own and this is reversed again because the kens are dumb and can be tricked into fighting each other letting main barbie convert the other barbies back to the way they should be 

the film cant seem to decide whether the kens are supposed to be weak and incompetent or overpowering and duplicitous its got to be the former for the start and the end of the film to happen but its got to be the latter for the middle to make any sense

as far as i could tell the kens are dumb without agency and if they get agency theyre oppressive but theyre too dumb to hold onto their oppressive agency so they go back to being regular dumb without agency im not sure im really seeing a positive representation there ryan gosling may be kenough but that appears to be the extent of it",2023-07-23 16:37:02
"whatever you say but your clearly incapable of sticking to talking about what is said and instead resorting to calling a man fragile when you disagree with him  so i’m gonna stick to saying it’s a rather hypocritical and sad attempt at good ol fashioned shaming of a man’s strength as a man

so what if i’ve commented 50 times maybe i wanted to talk with people about the movie don’t be upset by it",2023-07-25 12:39:53
"oppenheimer was amazing especially when ken said “now i am become ken destroyer of barbieland“ and nuked the barbieland capital building

barbie was also pretty good especially when oppenheimer had to go on a soulsearching journey to discover theoretical physics that part where he flew on the nuke was a complete 1010",2023-08-03 14:29:53

viewing everything through the prism of group identity probably isnt healthy  do you think a majority of fortune 500 ceos being men does anything to help me pay my bills  it doesnt,2023-07-22 02:01:53
it works on so many levels the patriarchy movement in the film could also be seen as a critiquesatire of real world feminism which when taken to extremes could be harmful in the end though the solution as presented by the film is respect and selfdiscovery not a system of matriarchy or patriarchy although these things still exist in both worlds,2023-07-26 09:31:52
ken’s weren’t the only men in the movie thank you for carefully treading around the full picture to make your point,2023-07-26 06:39:51
"nah it’s tying in men’s enjoyment of certain things and then talking about them with negative “toxic” masculinity which is absolute bs
by the way for all the repetitive and basic  he’s done  stallone has also created a couple of far better and more positive movies than gerwig ever has or likely ever will",2023-07-26 04:43:45
no i get it but it’s just such a mean spirited movie in general i’m sure men could make a movie about the sometimes annoying way women talk about their interests and turn it into a huge montage but that would be a pretty crappy thing to do as it is here and women would see it as obviously mean spirited as it is here,2023-07-26 05:01:45
"i watched it in my native language so maybe the english version was better i  cant think of any off the top of my head but basically they used big words  that no one would ever use in normal conversation the type of words that you would hear in political talk 

overall if you saw the movie as bashing on all men then you might need to challenge the way you see men men can still be masculine without the toxic derogatory traits seen in the movie

thats the thing i would never catch myself doing any of the toxic things men did in the movie i feel like the film tried to potray masculinity as something bad theres nothing wrong with having big cars or working out tho these are not inherently masculine things but it was somehow put in the same category as slapping  random girls  on the street i feel like normal masculine things were put in the same bag as cat calling and just being an  to women thats where the  manbad comes from trying to prove that being masculine is bad look at alan the only guy that wasnt masculine was somehow the good guy if it wasnt for him than all the men would be portrayed as assholes

the movie is saying that matriarchy is the best and that only women should be leaders i think we can all agree that matriarchy is just as bad as patriarchy there should be a balance",2023-07-22 02:10:37
it does show up though thats how were seeing it and commenting on it,2023-07-22 02:45:28
nice to know that you cant have opinions in this sub first time being here and also the last  you mods,2023-07-22 00:43:58
i’m sorry but i really think you missed the point at the end of the movie barbie herself acknowledges her previous behavior toward ken wasn’t good and that going back to how things were in barbieland wouldn’t be for the best either she talks about how ken should feel secure enough to have self worth outside of her shadow the movie literally outlined how the patriarchy and “menhating” feminism are both negative,2023-07-22 02:33:53
how can i as a random redditor “force” something i’m just expressing my opinion and what i’ve seen from around me too many feminist hate men and think they don’t need them but when they grow up they realize they do which is ok,2023-07-22 01:44:44
"i respect feminists who aren’t hypocrites and a lot of them tend to be 

tell me do you think a man being the provider is sexist or no i’m curious since you’re a feminist 

the idea of self fulfillment is false and that goes for both men and women that’s why you see women who are career woman end up hating their lives and they realize they want to raise a family and focus on her kids and husband what’s wrong with that 

thanks for at least responding back i’ll admit my original vent was a bit too much but i do think feminism is harmful more then anything especially in the west where woman are sexualize and promoted to dress half  and for some reason that’s considered ok",2023-07-22 01:36:11
i can say the same things about the west who have so many problems yet try to act all high and mighty over traditional values i’m sure you split the bill 5050 on a date right is that empowering for you,2023-07-22 03:28:30

"yeah he’s someone who is content and secure in himself but being content and secure in yourself doesn’t mean that you can’t also be lonely in search of a relationship or feel overlooked 

his goal isn’t necessarily to be with barbie we don’t know that about him what we do know is that even though he doesn’t exhibit the traits that the movie decries he is still constantly forgotten about and treated as an afterthought not even from a relationship standpoint there were times when characters just forgot he was there is he lonely does he want a relationship who knows nobody has asked

trying to put real life people into movie character boxes is always a bit messy i related to both ken and alan at different points in the movie to me i saw a lot of loneliness in both of them with alan not having the self identity issues in the same way ken does",2023-08-03 23:23:26

" yes thats a reflection on my parents which is a whole other conversation but we have to acknowledge that reality that many people have such stories from their childhood like mine

i grew up in the middle of football beer gym guns hunting going muddin and etc  im a nerdy weeb who liked the powerpuff girls and my little pony and is a furry and etc  it was also straighty mcstraightville where i grew up and despite not really having a strong attraction to guys and the pressure around me i had accepted i was bisexual and accepted that by like 20

during the very early years of me being a furry and bisexual both were grounds for literally being beaten and liking girly  was definitely more of a social ostracization thing

nbsp

that being said  hasnt been like that for 30 years  roughly 30 years ago society and expectations rapidly started changing  and today that  is almost completely in the past  but people still cite out of date  from decades ago like you are now that is not reflective of current society

nbsp

 thats why we actively work to normalize it while yes it says a lot more about that person we have to consider that theyre just perpetuating what theyve been programmed to so much like america ferrera in the film actively working to break it for those people is a good thing

youre too  late its already normalized  people talking  about it now are those people you get a school project with who are never there when there is work needing to be done but show up at the end for the final few days and try to take credit  the work has been done  the social pressures if anything actually lean in the favor of the previous outliers these days  

ive grown up and lived on the front lines so to speak

nbsp

yes even in deep country where my family is and i still regularly visit  they might think youre weird but if youre reliable and responsible and you can handle your  and tank the slings and arrows of life theyll respect the  out of you  now if youre a weak  entitled little  who catastophizes everything and makes minor life issues into big problems  theyll hate you  but thats less to do with what you are and more to do with how you are  

people are not always great at communication but conservatives value heavily maturity self reliance and toughness  and alot of the modern non conforming folks youre looking for acceptance for do not have those things  theyre still figuring out themselves and extremely emotionally vulnerable they often cant do  on their own and need constant help an validation even for normal life  and every little thing in life becomes something to be angry and depressed about

nbsp

and thats where much of the current cultural divide lies  not in terms of your identity but in terms of all the other baggage  the difference in ideals  conservative folks valuing independence and toughness and capability and self reliance while most of these other identities are interreliant to the point of codependence on each other hurt by everything often very world dumb and unable to do alot of common things for themselves etc

nbsp

nbsp

people that hate specific identities or races do exist but they are a tiny drop in the bucket today its mostly about value differences and most of our nonconformists being so weak and cringy that its a complete turnoff

nbsp

nbsp

but even then the people who would have felt pressured to fit in back then will still feel pressured to fit in now  theyll just feel pressured to be bigaytransetc instead of being pressured to be machostraighttoughgirlyetc  and were seeing alot of that  the social pressure hasnt gone away or gotten healthier  its just changed the stereotypes it pressures people into",2023-07-25 14:24:58

is it better or worse to name the song after them,2023-07-25 21:50:05
i think that’s a fair take but i have to imagine they chose to do it because the exact same scene without that joke would completely lose other people maybe even for the rest of the movie i mean you can just look at her and think “is this seriously what’s bothering her she’s gorgeous” even though i feel it’s a very valid point she brings up even if it might seem very frivolous,2023-07-23 04:35:32

exactly this i played with barbies as a kid and it was never as deep as some of the feminists make it out to be barbie was fun because you could change her clothes and play any situation you wanted with her and ken

is feminism’s end goal equal treatment for women or is it “women dominate the world and men are their subordinates” the movie seemed to be going for the former but then careened toward the latter and it left a not great taste in my mouth

" you dont overturn years of disenfranchisement with a few nice speeches and people believing things should be better

i agree with this and your overall point but in the framework of the barbieland society they movie presented the entire society was completely overturned earlier in the movie by some speeches given by gosling ken barbieland isn’t a mirror for how things work in the real world they’re basically a society run by extremely ignorant and malleable dolls that presented society absolutely could have set up any system they wanted

barbie and her rl friends were the movie’s “conscience” at that point telling the ignorant dolls what was right and wrong so them being aok with the dolls setting up yet another unfair society shows that they and be extension the movie aren’t interested in a fair society but rather ones where women rule and men get their comeuppance

just seemed to unnecessarily detract from the movie’s call to the audience to all work together to make things right in our society",2023-08-23 16:58:08

that’s not what fascism is those groups being being treated as second class citizens isn’t fascism fascism is a far right wing ideology with an authoritarian leader with a focus on nationalism we don’t know anything about barbie politics that indicates any of that we don’t know if there was nationalistic views we don’t know if the president was authoritarian we don’t know if their views were far right wing we don’t know if their government controlled the means of production there also wasn’t extreme militarisation i don’t think we can conclude barbie is a fascist and doesn’t realise it because she displays none of those tendencies the only thing they display is a massively imbalanced power dynamic due to their society being purely a matriarchy which isn’t fascism  they could be communists or capitalists they didn’t delve into the political ideologies of barbieland,2023-08-11 09:26:21

also youre full of  anyway because ive never met a single decent woman who gives a single  about any of the things you listed earlier but if you keep blaming everyone and everything except yourself you will never be able to grow 

the things i used to get my self worth from were very different than they are today just like everyone when i was 5 i got my self worth from being able to do my letters and numbers when i was 13 i got my self worth from people seeing me with a pretty girl when i was 17 i got my self worth from believing i was smarter than everyone around me when i was 21 i got my self worth from simply not dying of frostbite sleeping in my broken car for months in the winter with so many weird and bad ones in between

 and now i get it from a lot of things some external and some internal from beating the boss of a hard game from finishing a project i had been delaying for too long from washing dishes without getting water on my shirt from being able to stand up to my  dad showing someone a band i found that they end up liking and them getting all excited about it watching people i know and love grow and evolve you get the picture 

nobody even knows how many vacation days i have nobody knows my annual income nobody cares what car i drive i have a nice car because i place a high level of importance on being able to reliably remove myself from situations and a  cannot do that i live in a small house intentionally because id prefer having extra money around for creature comforts nobody cares how big my house is at least nobody whose opinion i value most of the women i have ever dated have never known and none of them have cared about any of it 

youve convinced yourself youre a victim of society and maybe thats true but we all are even elon musk the richest person on the entire planet still cannot get enough approval to satisfy the empty hole inside he has unlimited vacation days and his wife still left him bezos wife left him big house didnt matter bill gates also got divorced if status success and money are all that matters why are they all so alone and unhappy",2023-07-23 06:25:09

the two people i listed are my entire support structure you come in here and just make  assumptions i was harsh entirely because i had an overwhelming amount of  challenges for many years and made many of the mistakes that people like him and you make and know exactly how hard it is and that makes it all the more important to stop that  immediately",2023-07-21 10:46:00

"for real if anything the movie highlights how men as well as women are victims in different ways obviously of being brought up in a patriarchal society 

especially in a world that is just now shifting at least in the anglosphere to something that is even mildly more balanced than things were even 50 years ago  even 20 years ago young men are still being raised with examples of toxic masculinity everywhere around them ken’s infatuation with the examples of masculinity he came across in the real world was an alltoo uncomfortable callback for me reminding me of my friends’ behavior growing up and especially my own behavior as well

the movie served an excellent reminder that toxic masculinity also tries to force boys into unrealistic examples to strive for both from a physical appearance perspective as well as an emotionalbehavioral one and that we should be seeking to deprogram the younger generation from these harmful stereotypes

the movie was primarily about empowering women and highlighting the awful  they have to deal with in society even today but it also served a good reminder that only empowering women isn’t enough if we don’t also change the narrative for young men the erosion of toxic masculinity is delayed for another generation",2023-07-23 05:39:58

personally i thought the movie was saying to ken and those he represents that you do not need attention from women or a mojo dojo casa house or beach to be a complete human being that you need to find yourself and what drives you and what gives you life it was a positive message

thats the whole point recent developments have been showing exponential improvement compared to the past   


the movie simultaneously says now kens have as much rights as women while ignoring how we have almost half of the current scotus made up of women lol its not a good example",2023-09-08 10:27:49
the context of the movie is that barbie is the main character ken exists for her because in real life that doesn’t happen for women this is a female fantasy the kens weren’t “brainwashed” this is just what they were made for,2023-09-07 02:25:51
"outstanding box office was expected because the film looked gorgeous in the trailers and the marketing of the film was masterful plus the whole oppenheimer meme added to both films’ hype and the idea of dressing up for the films everyone really wanted to see it with their friends in barbie themed outfits

i think time will tell if the current hype and rave reviews are accurate to all audiences and if the film ages well i’ve seen a lot of positive reviews and a lot of negative we gotta let it marinate

i wanted depth and heart wrapped in a fun and campy packaging … not depressing i left the film less happy than how i walked into it i was oddly quiet and down when leaving so yeahhhh didn’t expect or want that from a movie about a franchise that brought me much joy as a child",2023-07-28 06:27:28

yeah sure there may be some woman hating in this things you describe but there’s also simple politics surrounding custody laws or whatever else regarding men plenty of the gender specific concerns of men aren’t focused on relationships at all i could likewise say that much of online feminism is fuelled by hating on men big deal 

see the mistake you’re making is thinking that some teenage boys looking for advice on picking up girls is “focusing their entire personality on women” it’s not that’s something that’s always existed for both genders  advice on “understanding” the other gender there’s all kinds of similar advice for women you really think teenage girls aren’t preoccupied with boys lol step into the real world buddy

you know what’s also positive simple loverelationship stories that is what our species depends on to exist after all and given that barbie and ken have been thought of as boyfriend girlfriend for like 60 years i don’t think it’s really odd to expect it in a barbie movie and be like “that was weird” when the writer is so determined that barbie must no have feelings for ken

like i said the ending was a simple playing out of a feminist fantasy that really only resonates with feminist women because as i said it’s their fantasy become ideology

i just find it ironic that a woman who has chosen to make a movie where the barbies don’t want ken and push the message we’re both talking about happy ending as women in power not wanting ken and men getting to cry or some  and seems to be focused on ensuring the audience knows that barbie doesn’t need ken and ken has to accept that  has chosen to make the movie in a way which is entirely focused on ken and all men that’s the movie “men this men that blah blah” lol she could have literally made any story she choose and focused entirely on barbie and women yet actually the movie is deeply obsessed with men just in a rather deluded way of what feminists imagine them to be and feminists imagine they should want",2023-07-29 03:47:02

i watched some good older thrillers not too long ago birdcage dead of winter and what happened to sheila all very entertaining

because thats how it is in the real world for example women got the right to vote in 1920 and it took 60 years for one to make it to the supreme court it didnt all change in a day and the balance of power is still not equal the kens are better off than before but theres still a long way to go",2023-08-02 00:37:47

" but were not muddled in the slightest

you didnt think it was just a little bit muddled to spend the third act and much of the second attacking the concept of patriarchy only for the woman at the end to dismiss the concept of patriarchy as something we make up to blame our problems on

its not that it cant be explained or interpreted but the fact that it would require work to make sense of when the movie had no problem devoting extensive time to a monologue detailing problems attributed to this framework is at the very least a muddle",2023-07-28 14:45:19
"i was happy with that to be honest as troubling as the kens’ treatment was in the status quo i was worried for a bit that the kens were going to make it out of the final act with barbieland becoming a fully egalitarian utopia 

not because i don’t believe in that being the hopeful end state of human society but instead because the movie spent so much time discussing how much inequity and  women have to deal with in real life it would have felt extremely unearned and honestly a bit of a slap in the face to the struggles women still have to deal with today to give the kens that quick of a reward

like yeah obviously we should want a society where all differences  gender race age etc don’t play a factor in your standing in said society—just from a narrative standpoint i’m glad that they didn’t go down that route and honestly i shouldn’t have expected anything other than what we got",2023-07-23 05:08:20

the film acknowledges that telling girls they can be anything is simplistic when the world doesn’t always agree and when getting through the day sometimes feels like an achievement in itself but it’s not a rebuke of corporatized feminism so much as an update that concludes with a character suggesting an “ordinary barbie” and another affirming that idea could make a lot of money — the film’s shrugging sigh of “it’s complicated” and “i’m tired”

id recommend watching it sometime in the future from the comfort of your own home where you can turn the volume down put the subtitles on look up the names of some of the famous scientists on wikipedia and pause at your leisure for food and restroom breaks because its three freaking hours long",2023-08-20 06:04:39

"and this barbie movie is making sweeping statements about men and has a lot of men in it and it’s directed and written by a woman so it’s just a female caricature of what men in the world are and how they act what’s your point

getting married is an achievement and was in those days is an adventure story ending in lifelong love really so terrible a message in film the movies also ending with the men getting married  to the women who were getting married however hitchcock acted off set is irrelevant to the content of his movies the man’s been dead for more than 40 years i can’t get worked up about that

well then i guess mansplaining is a good thing because apparently you don’t know much about barbie or mattel  ruth handler the created of barbie wasn’t forced out of the company very early on by men she was in charge of it for decades a simple google search will tell you that  “she served as the mattel companys first president from 1945 to 1975” she had to leave because there was a scandal effecting the brand due to her suspected tax evasion she wasn’t forced out in some sexist plot

that character is just another man hating brick in the wall gloria is meant to be the sympathetic main character and she’s rolling her eyes at her lame husband and reminiscing about old boyfriends you can bet if a main male character acted that way he would lose a lot of audience sympathy and be thought of as an  yet for a lot of the audience they don’t even notice it in this instance,2023-08-07 03:47:40

i know that totally threw me off at first but then i realized its because theyre reacting to how weird it was for this doll to exist in the homes of families for example my daughter had the golden retriever like it was shown in the movie but instead of pooping she gave birth to baby puppies we thought it was so cute but i had a lot of adult friends that thought it was super creepy i think it was meant to be like a pregnant doll would be creepy because i looked her up online and you literally pulled off a removable stomach and there was a fetus in there,2023-07-31 22:56:10

i getchu to me there was still a missing element of genuine connection between the barbies it was very prowomen and sisterhood but it was contradictory at many points and lacked a lot of intersectionality that relegated many of the barbies dynamics as typical of white feminism ironically despite the representation,2023-08-04 11:11:20
"haha well have to agree to disagree it was very much a movie that was about the female stars being stereotypically female as per myopic white feminism with its lack of intersectionality penchant for reinforcing the existing binaries and the way that translates within the cinematic gaze as flat and uncompelling character development hence considering some internalized misogyny 

i dont expect barbie to be radically feminist but a barbie movie sure as  better be about barbies journey making a movie about barbie with the focus predominantly on kens arc is hilariously ironic using a girls franchise as a means to educate men women already educate the men in their lives even in the movie barbie still has to handhold ken to his revelation greta didnt have the selfawareness to comment on that happening via another character its not very good satire when writers do a fakeout on tackling a dynamic its skindeep feminism and social commentary still too unaware to keep it that real though she came close at some points with the bit about the kens wanting a supreme court justice appointment 

if anything it seems like barbie was meant to be the wasp liberal feminist who thinks shes comprehending social dynamics and is capable of transcending them that would have been more interesting if it was actually challenged",2023-08-04 12:02:18

you are correct i think i guess i didn’t hear it unless there’s a different theatrical version but i don’t think so 

but i did find one thing though i’m certain i didn’t see it the first time so it’s just a new find the scene with the girl turning her doll into weird barbie is also gloria and in the background there’s some tiles in her room spelling her name out super hard to catch that is the only thing i could find and i didn’t catch it anywhere else on my own",2023-11-18 18:06:28
i think this film was written to be accessible at different depths i think at a surface level the cafeteria is the loudest and most clear criticism in the film because the daughter comes out and says her criticism directly and with sincerity instead of humor i feel the cafeteria scene was balanced against other scenes with the mom to guide viewers to a kind of “two sides of the story”conclusion that barbie has created both insecurity and empowerment in women the more satirical scenes don’t have any silver lining or balanced defense of mattel when will ferrel says “i never see the bottom line” my reading of that is basically “mattel only sees the bottom line and doesn’t give a  about women” or the “just call me mother” line  “mattel is a patriarchal organization that is appropriating femininity to market a product to women” but because these lines are said in a way that is sarcastic and indirect and over the heads of some of the audience it feels less harsh than the cafeteria scene,2023-12-24 14:17:26
"margot robbie’s barbie took gosling’s ken seriously and equally at the end though the only thing she didn’t reciprocate were his romantic gestures

"i’ve watched many movies from then and they aren’t in loads and loads and loads of movies and there’s nothing wrong with being a love interest in a movie for men  just like there’s nothing wrong with women having male characters as side love interests in movies which appeal to them there’s plenty of romances and romantic comedies and jane austen where a man is just a side love interest for a female story and that’s fine idk what you’re acting like it’s a bad thing for men

but even if what you were saying is true it’s not  you seem to think it’s a bad thing so why would be repeating what was bad to do to women in the 60’s to men now be good what kind of rationale is that

yeah perhaps everything done to the kens has been done to women in the real world but what of it if you’re trying to make the point that it’s bad then that point is lost with the mixed messaging of the movie with kens being idiots compared to women and it not contrasting effectively with the real world women being portrayed so positively the message is lost 
and they could have shown kens being burned at the stake or  to as it’s really happened to women in the real world so what
it’s a  barbie movie why did they take this depressing preachy angle",2023-07-23 18:18:54
yes those movies exist and theyre also very sexist whats your point,2023-07-23 17:25:33
two wrongs dont make a right sexism against men is okay because misogyny was and still is widespread is that what youre saying,2023-07-23 17:46:25
but men have been portrayed that way in media for decades its not a satire if its just another in a long list of other shows and movies that do the same thing,2023-07-23 19:25:23
i really disagree a 5 year old would be fine seeing this there is nothing explicit no  the fighting scenes are comedic and not brutal or anything crazy just silly action the messages are healthy and a 5 year old will likely just enjoy the stylistic looking film and find it cute and funny theres not even a kiss scene nothing crude only thing would be her saying i dont have a  she might have actually just said reproductive organs instead of  which i dont think is inappropriate its just body anatomy,2023-07-22 20:33:48

perhaps the barbies at the end couldve realized they had a matriarchy and there way to show the world a more proper way to live would involve giving the kens some power like the supreme court judge spot

"this movie makes it very clear to not blame men of today for the patriarchy  it shows how the patriarchy also adversely affects them mentally and emotionally the expectations that are put on them and how they have to have a woman to fill the void of lacking their own self worth these are societal stigmas that affect us all

anyone saying the ken’s “deserved” to be treated that way is being quite a bit overzealous  this movie isn’t supposed to be women revenge  since i think a lot of men could benefit from being able to laugh at themselves but also realize they are kenough",2023-07-22 20:22:58
" this film clearly doesn’t view the matriarchy as a utopia either

thats still not my point

 these generally aren’t the goal of these authors necessarily but just a way to imagine and work towards a better world

imagining a better world that so happens to be matriarchal did you not understand what you said

they depict a world thats basically their ideal and youre saying thats not what they want   
its not a big deal in the sense that the society depicted in their books is what they literally strive for mostly because its impossible to do so they have to be realistic rather it shows feminists do think these matriarchal societies are the most ideal

also i didnt just intend to mention the realm of fiction i also mean feminist historians that glorify matriarchal societies in history feminist neopagans this goes beyond coincidence",2023-07-24 13:45:23

you seem to be forgetting that a lot of millennials and even older gen zs are toy collectors this is evident with most of the movie dolls of margot ryan and the other cast and even the mini replica of the corvette are in the 50100 usd price points with certificates of authenticity attached meaning these toys are aimed for an older market,2023-07-24 00:33:45

"hi i actually have experience in the toy market and this is my thought because i also disagree that this is a kids movie after seeing it id say 10 imo and 1012 is dependent on how socially literate they arestrive to be

the line of barbie movie specific dolls  the  plaid dress president ken  are all 25 25 or 50 which is a high price point for a single doll iirc the holiday collector barbie is 50 and thats the market  collector 

theres actually a lot of adults buying toys  dolls specifically because its a collectible niche like squishmallow funko pop etc it kind of skates the line as all those brands do because theyre definitely toys and kids can absolutely buy and enjoy them but each brand also creates for adult collectors 

the higher price point  some toy features indicate products being more collectororiented while still living in the toy category and also being accessible to the primary consumer kids 

for ex  movable joint barbies used to be more often collectoradvanced barbies because they were less sturdy  more delicate and probably pricier to make but i think those are more common in playline barbie now",2023-07-24 01:02:25
im a 36 year old and have 3 barbies in my home office thanks,2023-07-24 01:32:35
if you say so but i guess now we can really go nuts and make many many more since it’s alright again,2023-07-30 18:46:19
"no i get the point but i don’t agree to some extent all humans measure themselves by relationships women are no different i don’t agree that men define themselves especially by women in any way that’s unhealthily overall or to a greater extent than women define themselves by their relationships

i think that’s just another feminist idea which sound ls good to feminist women so they run with it regardless of reality",2023-07-30 03:07:23
"wow you sure are one triggered straight dude as you would say lol it’s weird how the people who really ideologically agree with this movie go straight to insults when other people don’t like it highly emotional and says a lot about them

it is patronising whoever does it if ken had of had to explain life to barbie and then said he didn’t want to be with her do you think that would be seen as a happy ending no it would not it’s just that that particular ending in the movie is in line with feminist ideology of patriachy being bad for men and men getting to find themselves without it etc so some people are wetting themselves over it",2023-08-02 18:55:05
yeah bro has like 100 comments on just this post about why this movie hurt his feelings,2023-08-06 19:11:53
like i said the message was lost as the kens and real world men are shown as dumber than women and morally worse so why would you think the kens should be in charge they’re clearly worse than it than the barbies,2023-08-03 04:25:45
"thank you for sharing a clear cut example of bad criticism

the real world men werent dumb id say will ferrells character maybe but everyone else wasnt shown as such 

glorias husband wasnt shown as dumb either he was learning the language of his wife and child to be supportive he was struggling with it maybe but at no point did they make him seem like a complete idiot hes onscreen maybe like 8 seconds so thats really not a good example your demonstrating

if the film was men bad men  then the logical ending wouldve been to banish the kens from barbieland and it be an only woman paradise but instead barbie realizes sge has sone responsibility in the way ken was acting and that she treated him as what was expected of him not as what he would want to actually be she forgives him and apologizes for treating him so poorly as does the rest of the other barbies forgive the kens and start to slowly have them take part in decisions in barbieland she encourages ken to be something more than whats expected of him just like she wants the sane for herself 

like i know for some people reading and media comprehension in english class was the part every skipped and most of them became right wing outrage artists take everything at face value only but it literally couldnt be spelled out any clearly 

this is like the same willful ignorance people complained about with glass onion  its embarassing 

wig wrote all the real world men and kens as dumb because she simply followed a lazy “man dumb woman smart” trope and actually has a lot of bitterness toward men

as a straight dude thats embarassing as  to read",2023-08-02 18:32:11
,2023-09-17 08:32:59
everybody hates women men hate women women hate women ,2024-02-01 11:09:54
no i heard that i still interpret it differently because we are now in modern day it comes off as though women are still far more oppressed than they are because its a modern day film not set in the past,2023-07-27 18:28:00
no one said it had to be people can enjoy a movie as a whole but have critiques of certain parts,2023-08-10 17:46:03
no the barbies arent really capable of being antagonistic theyre dolls the ending is just the influence of the real world being removed and barbieland going back to its rather one dimensional perfect day existence albeit with the kens slightly better off its why stereotypical barbie chooses to leave because its shallow and she now knows what a complete but imperfect existence feels like,2023-07-22 21:02:41
they dont get emotional they get deprogrammed theyre dolls not people they dont have the capacity to understand the actual emotions behind glorias speech its just the antidote to the messaging brought from the real world none of the barbies except stereotypical barbie are capable of real empathy because again theyre dolls stereotypical barbie doesnt gain that capacity until she goes to the real world and that capacity is why she chooses to leave in the end,2023-07-22 21:07:06
"i get the themes if it were just about the stuff like the old woman it would have been nice the woman on woman themes work well  it’s where gerwig tries to deal with men that her bitterness and desire to make them the butt of the joke shines through there is a lot of compassion for women in this movie so i can see how women would concentrate more on that and be more likely to overlook just how badly portrayed men are in this as we can all overlook bad portrayals of those who aren’t like us or at least downplay thembut the reality is the portrayal of all the men in the film isn’t unlike old racist cartoons where members of a race were all stereotypical morons it’s closer to that than any movie portrayal of women because there is no movie that goes out it’s way to portray the entire female gender as negatively and as  as the barbie movie does for men


the real world patriachy and kendoms are portrayed very negatively in a way the barbie matriarchy never is men are portrayed negatively in a way women never are so you say it’s a message of equality and not women should rule everything  but when you take into account the portrayal of the barbies as competent great leaders and the men and kens as morons  i don’t think that’s the case at all if it were gerwig would have shown the barbies as more incompetent and villainous ala the men but they are not when you portray one group so positively and another so negatively whether they have power or not how can that be a message of equality 

i understood the ending it was just a lame “barbie don’t need no men” ending because it wouldn’t have been empowering enough for modern feminism to have barbie actually like her boyfriend since like 1965

the barbie land ending of ken also kind of echoed the feminist idea that patriachy is bad for men and when it’s gone they’ll be able to cry and find themselves even though most men don’t care and women should be given more power and somehow that means equality so i think the barbie land ending was an expression of that idea as well it’s basically what a feminist woman would think should be a happy ending for a man whether or not he actually agrees

so i’m not ragging on the other themes or the speeches about how women feel or the scene with the old woman which are probably reasonably done  but in the midst of basically portraying all men as badly as racist old cartoons portrayed black people well yeah it’s hard to be positive about it and i know some will say that’s genius satire but i really don’t think it is it’s just a lame “man dumb woman smart” trope and echoing a negative sentiment about men which isn’t uncommon amongst some feminist types

tbh the fact there’s a barbie movie which doesn’t just have a funny story and barbie and ken ending up together and that’s though of as the height of intellectualism and satire just shows the state of entertainment and media today people in the 60’s or 70’s would have thought this movie was absolutely  and juvenile to try to be adult intellectual entertainment",2023-07-25 12:37:03
"just try not to be part of the problem  in whatever way makes sense moreorless

maybe that means not outright staring at an attractive person for a weird amount of time maybe that means to make a concious effort to be sure youre not assuming someone is less knowledgeable or capable because you havent seen many menwomen in a specific position before if youve notices a friend doing those things maybe give em a heads up about why not to do those things

not meaning to imply you do any of those things today but there are plenty of small things people can be conscious of",2023-07-25 03:07:43
agreed,2023-08-03 20:56:20
it didn’t make sense your totally right a lot of people are just so into the themes of this movie they don’t want to admit it has a lot of very sloppy writing,2023-08-07 04:03:24
"so what are you even talking about the initial push for her to check outside

of course theres no barbie world where you can project your own body or mental issues  but thats kinda part of the premise of the whole fantasy movie isnt it

ps of course nobody wanted anything to change thats not the same of saying she wouldnt have tried to fix herself anyway",2023-08-07 02:53:13
could have referred to both,2023-07-22 16:25:24
"barbie was very mean to ken being annoyed when he followed her to the real world not letting him come over every night is girls night the way they talked down to him woman version of patronizing 

he started a revolution for his gender similar to the woman’s movement of the 70s ken is a metaphor for women living in a patriarchy

it’s not even close to january 6 — people died protecting the capital",2023-07-25 23:14:51
i am talking about the movie mattel made the barbie world,2023-07-31 18:54:31
"yes of course i just didnt like the way it was done they made it seem like the kens had no agency and thats what bugged me they could have still been treated unfairly and even sexualized or portrayed as accessories but the fact that they just forgot to vote was weird does that make sense 

the writers could have found some other way for the barbies to make sure the constitution doesnt change
actually if only all the barbies went to vote  midge and allan the referendum wouldnt pass

if the movie was consistent in portraying kens as women have been portrayed throughout the history of cinema i could still accept it but it wasnt consistent and thats why it didnt sit right with me 

but now that i think about it i need to see it again maybe im wrong about the consistency thing",2023-07-29 18:54:48
they all have no genitals anyways,2023-07-28 16:15:00
i try and read poststexts in a neutral tone and i dont assume malice maybe you feel like hes a freak because there are just so many actually malicious people all over social media and so many misogynistic reactions to the movie that you automatically have your defenses up,2023-07-29 00:05:35
thats fair but his character was so thinly drawn that i almost think his entire presence in the film only exists for the weak imo joke about an awkward guy beating some dudes up,2023-07-28 22:46:37
"maybe and i mean that sincerely i might agree with you but it feels like all the women characters get everything they want barbie has the 100 happy ending and the mom and daubers relationship is fully repaired 

the kens have agency and a sense of self but are laughed away when they ask for equality and not even with a it takes time though at least the narration says theyll keep trying for more

edit i saw a comment elsewhere here that stuck with me this is a story of an oppressed group kens rising up in a misguided way and then being kinda ok with being less oppressed at the end and the ruling class gains some empathy to their subjugates but still wants to rule in the end

i dont know if you can waive that away with it mirrors reality in reverse",2023-07-21 13:19:37
"i feel like you’re the one who’s trying to simplify a complicated subject 

of course people would miss certain aspects but you don’t need to be in a relationship to have  or intimate discussions you don’t need a relationship to have someone love you and being in a relationship doesn’t guarantee that the concept of “love” in a marriage is a surprisingly modern concept

and again those things aren’t what give you inherent value as a human being",2023-07-27 15:11:02
on a scale of 1 to 10 how clever did you actually think you were being typing this out,2023-07-22 13:13:45
"thats a possible answer but id rather account for his actions by having at least one guy realize that what the kens were doing was wrong

perhaps im unbearably naive",2023-07-23 22:18:41
"exactly but also i do not understand why men who do not treat women bad feel guilty when women shine light on men who does

x200b

why do they get defensive and feel guilt i dont feel guilty about anything that has nothing to do with me",2023-07-27 17:09:29
"lol “the inconsistencies are part of the satire”  oh man how convenient 
i’m sure i could not give a  about a nomination for this or any other movie who would",2023-07-29 03:50:28
you go ahead and educate me then,2023-07-29 08:23:12
they sure did,2023-07-30 20:02:53
"thats what this movie was missing  scissoring  

x200b

i bet gerwig thought about it lol  somewhere in the middle of the missing  opera",2023-07-30 22:56:55
kennapped an odd girl to want ken yes at least not barbie i dont think i even had ken outfits,2023-07-30 21:20:17
i mean the answer to that question would be the same as the answer to my question which is no it took almost a century from the first woman federal judge to first woman sc justice of course it took even longer if you count from americas independence in 1776 to sandra day o’connor,2023-07-31 22:35:30
but theyre probably mostly men so i think thats connected to the joke,2023-08-06 02:22:13
"i meant that scene is about an experience women have to process and deal with  not the whole movie

you want to flip the script on that scene and say “what if the genders were reversed” but a dude in that position wouldn’t be apologizing and trying to help the person they rejected feel better 

and dudes don’t experience the level of extreme pushiness women do when being told no so you can’t recreate it with flipped genders 

and yes men should watch it to understand the  women experience on the regular  but that doesn’t mean that its for you",2023-07-30 03:49:51
"you are so wrong in so many instances it is actually difficult unpacking it all you lack a general understanding of gender roles and gender dynamics but i suspect you dont really care about getting educated nonetheless throwing this out there in case you wish to understand what i actually mean when i refer to women being mirrors and foils to men  not in a romantic way  read a rooms of ones own by virginia woolf   

go talk with some women in your life your mum your cousin a school mate develop an empathetic ear and grow up a little because you sound very young   

and finally stop caring if 1 piece of entertainment doesnt cater to you you have the whole world to choose from bye bye",2023-07-30 11:17:13
hey buddy everyman was allan or did we not watch the same movie,2023-07-30 19:44:03
"i replied to your comment before i saw that you literally created a reddit account for the sole purpose of  about how much the barbie movie hurt your feelings lmaooo

clearly no point in trying to continue having a discussion with someone so convinced of their own infallibility but  greta got you gooooood",2023-07-30 07:48:53
you say it’s from 80 years ago but it still exists to this day regardless if you’re a man and you’re hurt by the ken jokes then get over yourself i’m an adult man who got a chuckle out of all the “big car truck” jokes cause yeah i do that too me and my gf were just laughing cause at first i was like “that’s not true” and then i had to remind myself about how i’ve been badly trying to get a ford bronco for a while or how i use finance jargon from my work that nobody really understands,2023-07-22 17:17:57
"no it doesn’t stem from patriarchy at all that’s totally made up and based on nothing
i’ve seen loads of incompetent or rude women succeed sometimes both so what your saying doesn’t ring true

i mean without so called patriarchy women wouldn’t have the choice to stay home and not have a career or go part time so every single woman would be under career pressure all the time regardless of what she was doing

men made the ranks when the workplace was totally male dominated it’s sci fi level speculation how women would do in a world where that wasn’t so",2023-07-30 19:07:28
"same i’m a 59yearold lifetime feminist i went to see it with one of my best friends and we 1 laughed uproariously for 2 hours 2 couldn’t stop talking about it for the rest of the day and 3 have started calling each other “fundraiser barbie” me and “social worker barbie” her in all our texts lol 

it’s a brilliant piece of filmmaking that deconstructs the wall of pink that we all grew up with and asks questions we can linger on for years to come it’s not a feminist screed or an antimale screed or procapitalist propaganda…even with all the “mattel”s splashed everywhere 

i think it asks simple questions of its characters and audience like “who are you at your core” and “do your behaviors serve you and the people you love” and then the much more complex “how do we live fulfilling lives in a patriarchal society that serves no one anymore”",2023-08-04 23:14:25
the moms standing still line confused me the most in the film i wouldn’t describe my mom this way,2023-07-24 07:35:21
"yess i completely agree the first half was the best and probably too ambitious 

i would keep the first half until depressed barbie i absolutely hate their emotional manipulating kens plan instead the execs arrive and that’s how everyone finds out that ken’s mojo dojo casa house is being produced in the real world  so what they create in barbie land is influencing barbie production in the real world and it’s about barbie land learning that they too can become anything they want to be  the message is not just for little girls in the real world barbie land was meant to be better than the real world but they were becoming just as rigid in their matriarchy ken was created to beach but he could become horse ken even weird barbie gave herself a sick mohawk and cleaned up her marked face the real world can change them but they can also create themselves other barbies should confess that they too find themselves doing the splits and one of them is hiding an undercut they’ve all been played with a lot and hiding it out of shame to stick to their image but it doesn’t matter when they can change themselves too stereotypical barbie realises she doesn’t have to just be stereotypical barbie and can be any barbie even create a new barbie and doesn’t need to be afraid of change when she’s also in control",2023-07-25 00:00:37
" they came all the way to barbieland and for what what was the purpose 

i have no evidence for this other than it making sense plotwise but i suspect the original plan was for the mattel ceo to be the true villain manipulating the kens into hypnotising the barbies putting them back in their boxes but at some point mattel decided they didnt like being portrayed as the bad guys so it was hastily rewritten so that they were just comic relief",2023-07-25 00:23:22

also people like you movie of the year the messages are so important

baby jesus you cant have your cake and eat it lol",2023-08-01 19:31:25
"
you’ve missed the whole point of the movie we are audience members witnessing a woman barbie learn about the patriarchy for the very first time she is not teaching you the audience member about feminism she is teaching barbie who had just learned about the real world for the first time this scene was emotional not because we already knew this information but because we are identifying with barbie and that younger part of us that first learned about the patriarchy and how unfair it is it’s emotional because we’re tapping into our younger selfs’ hearts and emotions when we first learned about feminism and we’re able to heal through that and witness it through someone else and that’s why that monologue is impactful and important because we are witnessing someone else learn about it for the first time",2023-08-02 20:44:41
agree it’s like they thought we missed the point beforehand  it was like the most overstated movie ever before the speeches began,2023-08-02 15:31:41
it’s pretty simple and self explanatory the whole kenough bit and being able to cry and find yourself is the message to men but it’s not one they actually need or care about,2023-08-02 04:02:42
i feel like that’s reading satire which isn’t actually there i see that a lot with this movie people who like the themes or director are covering all bases with their interpretations of parts of the movie which aren’t actually present i actually do think the kenough but was supposed to be a positive message and it’s very in line with what feminists like gerwig would consider a happy ending for men crying more finding themselves etc that ending is essentially what people like her mean when they say feminism is for men as well,2023-08-01 09:59:18
yeah but there was almost no integration of the kens i like main kens arc where he learns not to be an accessory but at the end the other kens wanted to be part of their society and leadership but the barbies were basically like nah kens  up for sure but was barbieland really that perfect in the beginning,2023-08-01 07:45:21
i mean that’s not exactly true ken has loads of jobs in the toy line from president to doctor often during the 60’s and 70’s ken would get the “man” job and barbie the “woman” job like doctor and nurse or president and first lady,2023-08-01 08:37:13
"good for you you don’t rule a north korean country by any chance do you

but regardless obviously i don’t think a barbie movie needs to honour or prioritise men if anything i would say this movie payed far too much attention to men even if the portrayal wasn’t positive i was just replying to a commenter saying that it did",2023-08-01 05:47:45
and that happened the very day that women were allowed to be judges,2023-07-22 09:05:40
accusing people of being incels is just this person’s way of saying they have no valid arguments against yours,2023-07-21 16:23:55
so your argument is that the ken’s are irresponsible because they… rose up against their oppressors,2023-07-22 03:41:28

no theyre  not

so what 

nice",2023-07-23 00:58:28
i just dont see the point in separating humanity into different groups i was raised to see that as bad its disheartening to see it considered good by some people a movie that pretends trying to be many things to many people is a man problem is also annoying to me,2023-07-23 00:12:18
ik that thang stank,2023-07-29 11:57:05
"what a deranged comment i do find it funny though that you’re turning to stereotypical sexism and trying to shame someone as a man because you disagree with my take on a movie how wonderfully old fashioned and stereotypical of you isn’t your precious feminist barbie meant to like teach you better or something

well guess now i know who enjoys man hating movies",2023-07-29 08:18:15
"and men watch things were they are props as well  how many movies feature some brooding love interest type often rich or these days supernatural  twilight 50 shades a bunch of jane austen adaptations men are props in those movies for women’s fantasy and that’s ok  because although men might not be portrayed in a way men care about they’re not insulted

and the point wasn’t that barbie couldnt talk about sexism  it was the mixed messaging in portraying the underclass kens as bad when they rose up yet portraying women in the real world as valiantly struggling against the bad patriarchy 

and the bechdel test isn’t a thing most people don’t care about it or know what it is",2023-07-21 19:01:45

the movie is an allegory about the audiences reality our reality is 2023 not 1823,2023-07-21 19:01:18
 the dad i totally thought she was a single mom honestly the only point of adding the dad was for a quick laugh when they cut to the learning spanish scene i’m not sure how that contributed to plot at all…,2023-07-25 00:45:35
the dance scenes were a highlight for me as well the opening disco number and ken’s numbers were phenomenal it kind of confirmed to me the movie should’ve stayed in that arena there still could’ve been room to develop the deeper themes and keep a more fun upbeat tone,2023-07-25 00:41:38
the dad was there so they had another dumb man to make fun of that’s literally it,2023-07-25 04:52:37

my theatre did not have coordinated timings for a double feature at least three people excluding myself got out of barbie screening and immediately got tickets for oppenheimer for tomorrow

ironically the hype is only online so going outside would just confirm their opinion,2023-07-21 14:13:16

"i understood it fine even though it had a bunch of conflicting themes often playing in a single character and was muddled and poor writing 
i think feminists who enjoyed the messages in this movie are overly defensive of what is actually some pretty bad writing",2023-07-24 14:48:09
"no it wasn’t the 90’s was full of female fbi and police movies with women starring and being bad  and solving crime the 70’s has all manner of films starring women in different roles there have always been pictures with women as the leads and love interest doesn’t equal useless and dumb 
obviously in 50’s movies women were generally in stereotypical gender roles because that’s how society was  but that doesn’t mean they were being portrayed negatively  they could still be good or clever it was just a reflection of society",2023-07-24 17:53:37
"get out was great  but it didn’t have the same bitter and hateful undertone of this one that was brilliant satire  barbie is not the white girlfriend character in get out is not a  the entire white population is not portrayed as morons men are here

and that whole privileged class so women are allowed to make fun of men but not the reverse is just a hollow justification for wanting to have fun at someone else’s expense but not wanting to take it in return people will often come up with a justification of why it’s ok for them to do something to someone else but not want it done to them and that is what’s going on there

also men have not been oppressing women for centuries the uncomfortable truth for feminists is that women didn’t care or think about equality as far as having the same jobs and political power as men until well after the industrial revolution women’s place in the world before that is absolutely not comparable in any way to oppression on the base of race",2023-07-25 06:05:06
"it’s not about well rounded female characters or not  i am not saying all women characters are well rounded and i don’t think it’s a problem if they’re not either  just like i don’t think it’s a problem if male characters aren’t well rounded there are hundreds of womens movies with male romantic leads that are basically interchangeable and not well rounded at all that’s fine
it’s not about that i don’t expect every character to be brilliantly and fully realised especially in a  comedy   it’s about portraying an entire gender as  and doing bad things don’t act like women wouldn’t hate that too there are very few mens movies that intentionally seek to send that message about women like this one does about men  yes women are sidelined or sexualised but that doesn’t equal a knowingly negative portrayal of all women as morons who are in the wrong

sorry to pick on you specifically but im seeing too many comments along the lines of gerwigs allowed to be a feminist but she should really be nicer to men while she does it that frankly is not the point of this specific movie there are plenty of other femaledirected comedies that express their feminism in more palatable ways this wasnt that",2023-07-26 06:54:38

of course it is a commentary on our own unjust world i left confused because this was a movie with constant speeches telling me women can change things and have power but the actual message being shown and highlighted through action in the film was that woman dont have power should not aspire to have power and are just dumb

if they had done a better job showing rather than telling that woman have a chance whether they represented it with ken or through barbie i would agree that it was trying to highlight change for rl issues but it fell flat

tldr they chose ken as a symbol for how women are mistreated which is already an odd choice and that symbol became more important for representing the message and the theme than the actual female characters meanwhile the actual female characters had flat plots and relied too much on telling over showing leaving the overall message muddy",2023-07-26 16:48:26

yeah thats the point she was showing a genderflipped reality we are in a dystopian patriarchy right now its not changing,2023-07-26 18:01:59
what you can take from that is greta gerwig clearly has a lot of bitterness about men i mean cmon the husband is an idiot for no reason at all it’s a barbie movie but of course barbie has no feelings for ken it’s just trying to tell you empowered women don’t need or want men is all after watching this i’d say gerwig is a very bitter woman inwardly about men regardless of how many people enjoy the movie people are so keen to see some genius level satire in this movie and so worried that they might be a bad person if they don’t see it that they’re missing the obvious explanation for the constant portrayal of men regardless the situation as  and unwanted by women  and that’s that the director doesn’t like men much,2023-07-27 10:58:57
i have definitely learned my lesson,2023-07-25 18:08:17
exactly  neither men nor women are usually portrayed as badly as an entire gender as men are portrayed in the barbie movie that’s what makes it so wrong,2023-07-31 14:35:40
"wrong and wrong one being that queens existed the other being that in the west white did not “hold all the power” there was a ruling class of nobility of the smallest portion of the population which held all the power who happened to be white in the west at least the majority of these white men were poor peasants who lived under autocracies with little to no control over their daily lives they did not have voting rights  there was no democracy it took entire revolutions before democratic ideals became established in the us landless white males could not vote until somewhere in the 1840s both men and women have lacked power and control over their daily lives for centuries while men did get those rights first women got them soon shortly after

if there’s one take away i’d want you to have it’s that the majority of men did not hold power for a very long time until recently for most of these centuries you speak of men didn’t hold power and were mostly peasants trying to feed their families",2023-07-22 20:26:04

if you go into this movie feeling attacked for being a guythen youre exactly the problem yourself  im a guy  been a guy my whole life  never been made to feel lesser than by any of the women in my life routinely propped up and given many advantages in fact by them

and i didnt feel attacked whatsoever  because i actually understand and recognize the message of the film  if you feel like youre seeing this a lot in movies its because you are because so many men like you still arent getting it

women in movies had to just shut up and take it for so long as misogynistic and gross film depictions of women were made for 70 years and if they complained they were a problem   now only a specific subset of men are getting the same treatment in a tiny window and their refusal to learn and adjust their  worldviews is what keeps having to have these messages taught until you inevitably learn from it or die

"

it’s not barbies responsibility to take care of ken though he has autonomy and control of his own life he just chooses to attach himself to barbie even then the movie acknowledges at the end that barbies neglect of ken was wrong

sorry did the end of women’s suffrage lead to women in power immediately it’s realistic… we haven’t even ever had a female american president yet ",2023-07-24 06:27:00
"i think the very minor morality change they had was a very suitable ending the movie also said that kens reached the same standing as women in the real world… so it’s literally identical in that regard 

why give men in this fantasy land closure when women haven’t had it in the real world  i think it would be tone deaf to do anything else because it simply isn’t realistic and would be effectively downplaying women’s issues in the real world by implying a click of the fingers would solve them

also that barbieland is meant to reflect social standing in the real world ie how patriarchy ken dolls started selling there is a lesser need for ken than barbie in the real world because of systemic patriarchal issues still  so barbie is still prioritised in barbieland",2023-07-23 21:27:59
"i refuse to believe someone watched the barbie movie let’s be honest you didn’t  and even if you did you didn’t  and thought the biggest genderbased issue the movie raised was that ken wasn’t invited to girls night and that that’s worse than any treatment of women throughout history… holy  

also because the movie literally acknowledges that “girls night forever” is a problematic statement in the end as well…  

but even then that’s only a problem in the context of barbie land where they’re dating forever and permanently intertwined because a man isn’t entitled to anything in a woman’s life without the woman’s consent even if they are dating of course that statement is also a two way street with consent and the man has every right to leave the relationship if he feels he’s being neglected 

 that  argument is the most basic discredited  alive you can’t have stats without context and the context behind those numbers is that even if slightly more men are  than women and that’s because only officially reported numbers exist where a lot of people do not come forward after being  the vast vast vast majority of rapers of men are men and the vast majority of rapers of women are … spoiler alert men",2023-07-24 05:30:09
"the hollywood reporter is saying plus 70 but there are differing stats depending on the country and the sources i have no idea how they’re collecting the info so couldn’t say how accurate that is
i have no idea why you would be surprised that a movie based on the most feminine toy of all time that most girls owned but almost no boys did would have an extremely female audience",2023-07-28 10:57:15

what selling point real human women do have vaginas im genuinely confused about your interpretation of this she was not real before and had no genitals now she does and she has a  instead of a  because shes a woman not a man wheres the issue,2023-07-22 03:06:29
exactly which for a whole movie that’s about gender gender roles and empowerment they circled back to the same “genitals  gender” garbage that the director told us this movie would be against kinda gross how the last one two punch joke in this movie is basically “haha she’s a woman now get it  haha”,2023-07-21 17:16:22
yeah because it doesn’t at all once again whatever satire or point it supposedly has  it’s layered under a movie which portrays all real world men and kens as idiots or idiots doing something bad even the teenage girl dad is a bumbling fool contrast that with the portrayal of women and barbies,2023-07-27 03:27:58
i actually can’t imagine even a movie with themes against  feminism being made with this much bitterness toward all women  even that would be sure to include some “good” ones as a contrast but in this even the dad of the teen girl and america ferraras husband is in his brief onscreen moment shown to be an idiot and mocked i mean really why he’s not the mattel president or related to the ken story line he’s not even being sexist  he’s just shown negatively as a joke for no plot reason at all,2023-07-21 15:09:48

"i feel that i think it was all very satirical the men were wild in the real world the barbie’s also super unrealistic in their world while the opposite gender was subservient i felt like it touched on men having to be “masculine” in a way that makes them appear one dimensional which just isn’t true it felt obviously satirical there was more but this is barbie’s movie

i’ve just seen it so i may be defending it lol

edit to say men don’t have to be “masculine” to be respected",2023-07-23 06:26:35
i think they didnt go into this too deep because kens had less struggles than reallife men ken is comfortable crying and displaying emotions in public most of the time he isnt judged for being fashionable or into his looks etc and because of his role in their relationship he doesnt feel the pressure to be a provider to his partnerfamily,2023-07-23 07:49:51
"so what i know what satire is  and satire can be disgusting bigoted and wrong i’m sure nazis satirised jews politically and with black humour as well saying it’s satire like i don’t understand what that means doesn’t mean it’s a good thing something isn’t morally ok just on account of it being satire

nobody forced margot robbie to do the wolf of wall street  she could have taken another part which didn’t focus on her looks and see her get  but she didn’t she used her looks to help her career and even said in an interview that women who didn’t take their clothes off for roles that needed it disgusted her and yet here she is today saying she had to fight against getting typecast in the role she chose to play lol ok i really feel for her

again if your gonna make a movie where all male characters are simplistic bumbling idiots and the female characters are competent clever and sympathetic then it is an anti male movie whether or not it excuses that with the veneer of feminist satire or not

finally well if men never stopped them they can just keep going forever then seeing as it’s ok",2023-07-26 20:04:28

"so actually the opposite is true you need to present a procedure that only men in the us are not allowed to decide to have for themselves barring things in clinical trials or things that dont exist do you have examples of such a thing

yea no i dont op claimed

 women have even less bodily autonomy in the us than men  


if thats the case then its your job to give an example of a man being allowed to do something a woman is not a man is not allowed free abortion  just like a woman is not

also just to make this even more apparent a pregnant trans man who by the government and law is recognized as a man  are limited by the same abortion laws as a woman",2023-07-22 23:35:41
"men can get a vasectomy if they wish  they can buy condoms over the counter

how is that relevant in our current discussion about abortion and bodily autonomy

women need to get permission to get their tubes tied

they dont women cant force a doctor to do something  doesnt want a doctor only has to give lifesaving support if someone is dying

the law doesnt limit a woman getting her tubes tied  the difference is that some doctors just wont do it the same way a doctor can refuse to do a vasectomy

laws have been passed to allow rando pharmacists to deny contraceptives if they have a moral or religious objection

how has that anything to do with bodily autonomy what other people have to sell or not has nothing to do with your bodily autonomy and are pharmacists only allowed to deny selling contraceptives to women the topic was less bodily autonomy than men

corporations are allowed to cut birth control pills from their insurance coverage

again thats not your bodily autonomy your bodily autonomy doesnt include getting to force other people to pay or sell you what you want

men and corpses are allowed to deny the use of their organs even if it would save the life of another

yea and so are women

women are denied this final authority over their own body

men are not allowed to get an abortion either a pregnant trans man who has been recognized as a man has the same abortion laws to follow in other words women does not have less bodily autonomy",2023-07-22 23:29:49
are you dumb or what if tampons were illegal that still wouldnt mean women had less bodily autonomy your bodily autonomy does not mean you have a right to demand stuff from other people,2023-07-23 08:57:39
"i dont care about downvotes 

all i can do is encourage you to do some earnest reading on the experiences of women who have been denied safe abortions

how is that relevant their experiences doesnt change what is a fact or not im not here advocating that abortion should be illegal  not my fault you and some other people got reading comprehension problems

trying to argue that women have less bodily autonomy than man by using a medical procedure that men in general dont need as an example is dumb as  also abortion is not like other procedures because it includes the life of another human being  though thats not really important to the argument

regardless if a pregnant trans man recognized by the law as a man is limited to the same abortion law as women then they both have the same bodily autonomy",2023-07-23 09:06:54

wow the nerve of people insunating that we are these sexist pigs who have not thought about how society has treated women and do the same we have wives and close friends  we are not some cave trolls that have not seen or interacted with women the problem is that the message in each feminist related media is that all men are kens or misogynists there is no favourable representation of men  check the previous movies by greta where each one had idiots that were either getting rejected or lied to the female protoganists i will die on this hill  there is still a massive amount of issues related to women in the real world fact but attacking and focusing on men as the sole source of women problems is sexist at the very least women are more than capable of bringing each other down  you do not need kens and showing how all barbies got along was such a pathetic lie and what is exactly the message here that kens were actually right to enslave the barbies or that the barbies were right to continue be in charge or that we must abandon every stereotypical and sexist representation and go to the real world where the same is waiting for us,2023-07-21 22:53:41

"i mean sure but the barbies got to have rich inner lives while the kens were essentially mindless zombies who only existed through the gaze of barbie who never thinks about ken to the extent of having no idea where the kens even live the last scene of the movie is ken realizing that he exists outside of barbie and ken kens job is beach while the barbies are president doctor lawyer astronaut and so on  the joke is that ken only cared about the patriarchy because he thought it was all about horses but the original barbieland was all in furtherance of womens empowerment  unless the sequel is about the kens search for selfactualization they got short shrift here

and sure the kendom scenes were fun but why is it played for jokes when men are interested in movies or cars or music like the slam on the zack snyder justice league was great but is it really something to be laughed at when a guy likes lou reed and wants to share that interest

for women the message was clear as told through america ferraras speech that was ripped off from gone girl for men i have no clue what greta was trying to say

thats not to say i didnt like the movie but i thought it was a very muddled film that only really sang when gosling was on screen",2023-07-21 14:54:28
yeah no one wants to watch the movie you’re asking for you’re literally upset because the barbie movie didn’t touch on every single women’s issue it touched on plenty also many women want a 1010 guy that’s reality,2023-08-02 14:51:03
is it just me that the im a ten so i pull in a ken means that barbie is already enough or kenough lol in her own lifecareer and only after that she is attracting or pulling in a ken in her life  its just to show that barbie is not pulling a ken to feel wantedseenadd purpose to her life by being kens barbie,2023-08-02 19:27:26

but also not one person said women were banned from construction jobs but when they do work construction jobs men harass the  out of them and make them feel like  sure makes more of them want to work those jobs eh are you 16 now because you argue like a teenager",2023-11-06 05:57:01
"to be fair to you it is perfectly fine if you dont like a movie or if in your opinion barbie wasnt wellmade

that aside objectively speaking a lot of the movies you mentioned with female leads are still in the male gaze to put it more simply they just happen to star women gerwigs movies are about women

barbie is very in your face they tell you right on your face that men often mansplain things women either didnt wantcare to know or already know the finance bro the tech bro the whole godfather joke the kenssingingatbarbie joke the barbie vs feminism points sasha and her friends are meant to be bratz dolls thats clever they are all meant to be explicit when the movie mattel is trying to be woke just because it sells they know you know that the real mattel is doing the exact same thing

i would say that your gender does seem to weigh in on how you seem to evaluate womens experiences lol ik women as young as twelve getting catcalled even margot robbie if she got catcalled at 12 itd be terrible most women are very familiar with stares and most women will also tell you stories about how it became more than stares at least once in their life unless they have lived a very sheltered life in which case great for them honestly this again was done explicitly by greta to show people who have the mentality of barbie that oh sexism is solved because women can vote and  that helloerm no

perhaps some of the jokes cracked would make more sense if you actually lived through the experience even then you cant blame a movie for having a target audience its like if someone went to watch spiderman far from home and said i dont get what the hype is about ignoring that they need to have a certain kind of knowledge about what the film is portraying in order to understand what the hype is about loose example but you get what i mean hopefully most women i know not all resonated deeply with barbie and every one of them came out of the theatre acknowledging this was an experience of a lifetime",2023-11-30 18:46:34
"am i not allowed to comment on why i didn’t like the movie isn’t this thread for opinion on the movie

anyhow to answer your question on how it’s anti men  every man in it is written and portrayed as an idiot or an idiot villain and the butt of the joke all male interests are mocked as are males talking about them this is not true of the barbies or real world women on top of that in spite of people saying the barbieland matriachy  is a contrast with the real world the barbie land matriarchy is never shows in the  and overtly villainous light as the real world patriarchy or kendom so keeping that in mind it can only seem to suggest that women do a better job in charge

i think after decades of man dumb woman smart sitcom tropes and the past decade of cringey tik tok and instagram style man hating feminist reels and whatever else that the obvious idiotification and bashing of an entire gender doesn’t seem like a big deal to a lot of women is a problem

 the barbie movie is basically does the equivalent of what old racist cartoons of the 40’s did to black people  portrays them all as morons who are doing the wrong thing while the white people or women in the barbie movie are all clever and rounded and generally much more competent those old cartoons were defended for decades as light hearted fun that only someone taking life too seriously should have a problem with as well and no saying the barbie movie is satire does not excuse this

if a movie which portrayed women as negatively for comedy purposes and to send a message came out women would absolutely hate it and there would be campaigns to have it banned and no mainstream studios would green light it in the first place

but i’m not “insecure” as you try to dismiss me as being  i’m talking about why a movie which negatively portrays men in this way is so bad aside from that i also think the movie kind of  as a story and has a lot of other things wrong with it",2023-07-26 04:57:49
"the point isnt to be emotionally mature because its desirable for women that literally runs contrary to the themes of the movie and what weve been talking about ken didnt share his feelings and all of a sudden become attractive to barbie he saw what you described  theres nothing wrong with just being a ken a man  and was able to become a healthier version of himself where he wasnt fighting his bros just to get the attention of barbie thats the point that is emotional maturity

emotional maturity isnt doing everything women want its saying motorcycle rides are important to me i understand it worries you but this is the life i want to live and if you cant live with someone who likes riding well it might just not work out instead of lying to yourself selling your motorcycle and then being resentful of your girlfriend because she made you give up a passion

i like riding motorcycles but you can replace that with whatever you want",2023-07-26 14:20:00

i think this interpretation makes me sad too  the idea that parents are resenting their children for growing up and growing out of their youth i think it’s fine to be nostalgic for those young days  which is maybe what they were trying to get at the idea that parents are attached to this fun youthful innocence that young children have when playing with toys but all children grow up and children don’t exist for your entertainment i think it’s great and interesting and fun when children start to try out their own ideas about the world  like the teenager was doing in the school scene  even if it is a little extreme those are the building blocks of who this person will become one day

"yea it looks very much like a joke about mansplaining the thing with mansplaining is its a man condescendingly explaining something to a woman who already knows it 

except the conceit here is that great movies like the godfather or nerding out about stock markettrading was never present in barbieland when the barbies were in charge they were very much new things  brought in by the kens when they awoke

so yes can be superficially viewed as laughing at mansplaining but on closer look its basically saying a women led world wouldnt really be interested much in nerdy cultural areas",2023-07-30 20:10:45
"the cowriter of this film is noam bauchman whos biggest influence is  allen ie clever writer that didnt much bother with feminism

maybe im giving him too much credit but barbieland was positive only on a very superficial level on closer look it was intellectually dead 

this kinda reminds me of starship troopers where the future looks very cool even though it makes more sense to view it as a satire on fascism it can be hard to miss since so much of it overlaps with the current reality of the audience 

the big speech that apparently broke the brainwashing looks genuine since that thought is mainstream but it was almost intentionally made to be an incoherent rambling lots of people are viewing it as cringe when really i think its best to view it as satire on modern feminism 

likewise the master plan in destroying kendom involved the barbies explicitly being told what real women do which is blatent manipulation of men to get what they want lol i mean im sure on an emotional lots of people liked that but their probably oblivious to the message they are actually endorsing 

another example is in the end where the ceos instantly accept her idea on a future line the second they learn its profitable they didnt become enlightened on women to accept her plan any idea that sells works ",2023-07-30 07:22:45
so… you should be glad that the film is highlighting for the audience how  inequality is  and showing how strong that inequality is since it feels like a massive injustice for kens to experience it,2023-07-30 04:51:47
how many reddit comments have you made about women’s issues vs complaining about kens fate in a fictional movie,2023-07-31 14:20:45
"  instead of acknowledging neither a patriarchal or matriarchal system is good for anyone

yes thats the point congratulations

point me to the point where the movie goes this is good barbieland is a utopia now you cant because it doesnt

the entire point is to hold up a mirror to real life inequality you going this isnt good enough thought at their token offers is the point

now you understand how women feel about irl inequality",2023-07-30 19:16:31
"youre so close to getting the point of it  its satire  

its holding a mirror up to the actual inequality in the world by putting it in a different context to highlight how absurd it is",2023-07-30 22:49:36
name me a single instance in reality where the first woman on any country or states supreme court had no prior legal experience or had to serve in a lower judgeship before being appointed,2023-07-31 14:19:45
the men and kens are clearly far dumber than the real world women and barbies comparatively,2023-08-02 17:00:22
and the idiot realworld husband,2023-08-05 07:59:47
women also get the same in this very movie its all in good fun,2023-08-02 22:02:47
id say part of the humour is the fact its not really been done before taking the  out of women in the same way has been done in lots of comedies,2023-08-02 20:18:35
they literally single out the supreme court ehhh you can start in the lower courts and then the narrator says that someday the kens will have as much power as women do in the real world when we have 4 female supreme court judges right now,2023-07-23 11:31:19
"the film only deals in subtext there is little to no conventional narrative text if thats what weak writing that’s your option cool there’s more than one way to write a film its not a subjective exercise 

the messaging isn’t convoluted but it is complicated because barbie is a doll made in the image of real women and woman are complicated just like all people 

not that hard to follow when you follow the subtext the films not exactly subtle about it 

the films message is very clear that there are  no good guys or bad guys we’re all impacted negatively under any gender term e ding with an ‘archy’ suffix 

ken has a break down because he lives under a suppressive matriarchy barbie has one when she’s exposed to the horrors of the real world patriarchy it’s all bad humans are the victims the systems are the villains very clear 

not sure about your fixation on the real men appearing dumb the husband is literally learning the second language sure will farrell and the board are goofy but that’s got more to do with making fun of capitalism and corporate america so it’s not exactly punching down 

and the kens are very clearly only “dumb” because they live under a matriarchy that smothers their identity limits their potential and expects nothing from them hence all the existential crisis stuff kens goes through 

your last point makes no sense or you failed to understand mine obviously it isn’t the 60s barbieland is very clearly in step with our timeline because the dolls are indeed very diverse 

barbie was invented in 1959 so barbieland can only have existed for 64 years just 64 years of ‘growth’ or change can have occurred 

the modern women’s suffrage moment has been in motion since the early 18th century and there’s only been 6 women on the supreme court today only use it this example because the film does 

so with that breadth of time in mind and knowing that ken is an allegory for real world women its still going to take a good while for any serious change to manifest in their society

merely mentioned the decade to give an indication of how many years behind their world is by nature of its relativity recent inception",2023-07-23 20:14:02
"in the context of how you framed it “ no we won’t let you be president yet” when hillary barely won the female vote shows how shallow that argument is if that was really that important to you it would have happened right there 

there’s a reason men convert to women at 3x the rate of the reverse happening despite the surgery for it being absolutely horrific there’s also the dating scene that expects the man to pay for everything and casually overcome 80 of women exclusively going for top 20 of guys divorce court that heavily favors women for child custody high paying stem field starving for more female applicants and hiring basically any of them with mildly competent education the list goes on",2023-07-23 11:22:34
what do you take the message to be,2023-07-23 23:24:05
"the message in this movie is so on the nose i think itd make an old soviet propogandist say ehhhh this is a little too much


perhaps its because you see yourself in the message

heres the deal im a husband about to have a daughter what about the message dont you agree with

i speak for all men when i say id give my life 100 times over for my family perhaps you havent reached that point in your life yet but women are our mothers our sisters our cousins our kids even if barbie was bashing womens rights over your head over and over again surely its a bad thing that it has to do that the world is that  that they still cant catch a break

i think its message was justfied very well with the real world evidence we all can vouch for that scene where barbie was describing how she felt completely vulnerable and open to attack while ken was just loving every minute of it is a play by play into the lives of every single women that exists right now not even can they trust the  police not to do something unspeakable to them

like the movie is so hamfisted because its a  accurate portrayal of being a women and i thought the ending was completely spot on with the deprogramming scenes and that monologue of describing what it was like",2023-07-23 23:59:21
yes because you dont understand satire its funny seeing insecure men take it personally,2023-07-24 16:21:01
the kens are portrayed as  and pointless because thats how they are portrayed in the franchise kens have no jobs no dream houses no carsthe movie lampshades this nothing they literally exist to serve barbie quite literally great gerwig cleverly played off the biblical story of adam and eve as the basis of this movies story barbie was created by her  ruth and ken was created some time after as a companionboy toy for barbie similar to eve,2023-07-31 15:57:43

"thats the thing though i wanted a comedy instead i felt like i was hit around the head repeatedly with a twitter handles sudden discovery of feminism anyone who has been a woman and is above the age of 12 knows what its all about so the amount of exposition and repeated preaching about basics when it could have actually been funny satire was excruciatingly shallow and the fact that viewers  that this country  is patting itself on the back for it just shows how bad it all is

"they are the antagonists sure but they arent meant to be evil and by the end of the film they are good guys again 

yeah they are portrayed as  and clueless but that wasnt meant to be a statement on all men many of the barbies are fairly vapid as well even the main one that we follow starts off incredibly shallow the whole point is that their world is shallow and unrealistic the kens are more like misguided children than actual evil villains the main ken even admits that once he discovered patriarchy wasnt about horses he lost interest 

to be fair ill agree i wish they had explored the ken side of things a bit more and fleshed it out but i dont think the point was to say all men are idiots or wrong",2023-07-23 15:33:24

"yello my nation has had female prime ministers my state and a few others have constant recurring female chief ministers women run companies lead international business teams… and all this while still without the garb of the garbage spouted in the film 

also us hasn’t had a female head of state in like since 1776

women voted for the first time in general elections here… back in 1919  a year prior to the us also our neighbour nation who we are sometimes in war with… who are hardcore religious conservatives  had a female prime minister twice 

this is a us problem 

we have our share of issues in other spheres… but equal rights isn’t one of them",2023-07-21 22:37:12
"it paints that way because they were codependant think back to how women were perceived in the 40s50s just a dumb blonde  housewife dependant on their husbands its the role reversal then when they tried to claim their power back they went too far and made their whole personality about their masculinity and their power and it became toxic in the same way that women who go too far and become a feminism or guys become incels or obsessed with alpha beta culture become toxic it wasnt until they realised they could be individuals and found equilibrium that the balance started to restore and like the real world there is not equality yet nor in barbie land
ultimately in my view it was as anti men as the real world is anti women today",2023-07-26 11:11:54
mmm no the “intended” message was pretty clear and hamfisted just entirely off the mark and in many ways just resorted to attacking men and acting like everything would be peachy if women held greater power than men,2023-07-25 20:39:11
"i would not have enjoyed if kens plan to bring patriarchy to barbieland involved violence against the barbies or any other depressing real world example of patriarchys harms

but it did they were literally brainwashing the barbies and effectively pressganging them into service as the barbieland equivalent of  waitresses if this movie had an r rating theyd basically be the equivalent role of wwii comfort women for the japanese invaders 

the entire purpose of this was to tarnish all other malecentric activities as guilty by association depicting them all as aspects of the patriarchy

youll notice that the kens didnt watch action movies or ride horses or drink beer from mini fridges before ken went to the real world and after the resolution of the film all the ken party toys were cleaned up with the rest of the imported patriarchy paraphernalia",2023-07-23 09:01:08

i think thats what happens when the writing is so confused the main message was clear barbie needs to have realistic expectations for herself and other women but the side story messages were confused and inconsistent with contradictory messages that seemed to validate some things when its all women but demonize them when its all men like the supreme court or the presidency the end result is a mess of double standards and inconsistencies,2023-07-23 08:47:58
women haven’t been portrayed that way in film always though very few old movies if any portray all its large female cast as idiots with dumb interests i feel like people saying this haven’t even watched movies older than a decade,2023-07-23 14:42:07
"in a very general sense kens character arc starts as a domesticated house pet reaches a climax with his seizure of power then ends with him being knocked down a peg held accountable and him resolving to change 

switch the sexes and this doesnt sound like how women have always been portrayed in film ill be honest im not quite sure what you mean by this or what era or genre youre even referring to

like i can see your point being true for the first bit of the film when hes an emotionally frustrated domesticated house pet but his role in the film and his characters import for the viewer is more complex",2023-07-23 10:09:11

it’s kind of ironic that a film as preachy as this is trying to make that point,2023-07-23 14:44:56
"its not that he was obsessed per se its that he was literally designed to be her accessory out of his control and to find happiness he needs to realize that hes his own person and not just a barbie addon

the problem is that the movie demonized almost every activity he may have participated in as a guy exploring himself so hes not left with any viable avenues for selfgrowth except what the barbies approve of the message for him is that he needs to become his own person but within the walled garden of behaviors that barbie deems acceptable which means no action movies and no horses apparently

the poor guy cant even go horseback riding without people whispering about how hes an oppressive patriarch because of it",2023-07-23 08:50:41
" the kens have no concept of manhood theyre girls toys so there idea of manliness is from the perspective of a young girl playing with her barbies

did you even watch the movie this isnt true at all 

the kens got their idea of manliness from goslings ken going to the real world literally reading textbooks on the patriarchy and then importing all of these real world tropes to barbieland

youre too caught up in your head

a  in a movie doesn’t equal sexism it’s part of the plot and isn’t saying anything negative about women on the whole and a  is a character  a movie about prostitutes doesn’t make the movie sexist any more than a movie about male drug dealers is i don’t think the sopranos hates men because they’re all criminals that’s not the point at all lol,2023-07-24 17:58:10
"i can’t really say it was supportive of both genders when every man and ken in the movie is a  and doing bad things perhaps it could have been if some of the barbies had of been portrayed more obviously villainous when they ran barbie land as the ken and real world male patriarchy was but they weren’t nearly as much so as such it just comes off that gerwig really believes women would do a better job than men and falls into the whole tired comedy trope of “men  women capable”

i think a lot of women are reading into this a positive message for both genders whereas a lot of men can sense the overall bitterness against men in the movie but then it’s targeting women so that doesn’t hurt the bottom line

also would have been a funnier movie if the barbies had of been able to truly be the butt of the jone like the kens but because they have to be empowered women a lot of comedy was missed and the kens are the best part which is ironic",2023-07-25 03:13:03

"no they really don’t feminist women agree with each other that they should care but the vast majority simply don’t and those messages don’t resonate with them

i’m not against the matriarchy element of the plot  but as i said if your going to portray mens patriachy as run by idiot villains and the barbie matriarchy as ran by competent brilliant barbies of course it will come of anti man because it is",2023-07-22 06:34:31
"the point was that this thing that feminism claims men want but are held back by patriarchy from doing  to cry more and express their feelings etc which is presented in the movie as ken crying at the end and going off to find himself  99 of men don’t actually care about it at all and don’t want that it’s something feminist women say men want and then use as an argument for why feminism is good for men etc etc

and no this has nothing to do with not centering men equally which no men expect in a barbie movie  if anything they should have spent less time obsessing about men in the movie it has to do with the reality that literally every man and male interest in the movie is portrayed as a joke and the women are not something which women would hate done to them also but now we have feminists making up false reasons for why men don’t like the movie like it not centring them which is bs

and no feminism was not invented to help men find themselves or whatever lol actually feminism was invented as an idea by a socialist man as a subset of socialism which would deal with women in a theoretical socialist society obviously the original invention is irrelevant to what it is today",2023-07-23 14:01:10
"yeah i dunno  kens being portrayed as a jock airhead was funny  but the portrayal of the mattel board was a little weird  i’m not really sure what they were going for or if it was simply “these men are dumb”  maybe it was just that as most messages in this movie were just beaten over our heads  

i was on board with most messages until the end though when barbie forms a matriarchy after we had received a message of equality throughout the movie  the denial of supreme court spots to ken on the basis that women don’t have that privilege in the real world was also kind of odd",2023-08-16 06:01:57
"first of all he’s been dead for ages and would get a ton of flack today  so i’m not sure that saying it’s the equivalent of something which would be viewed as woman hating today is good but regardless even in his work it’s not every single woman in the books as a statement on gender for the most part  it’s specific where as in this movie every man is portrayed very similarly and the bitterness shines through

and i said movies not books but i guess if i take your word for it about those writers then those writers were actually doing nothing wrong if the barbie movie is cool",2023-07-23 06:31:07
"there’s films and books where female characters have complexity and those we’re they don’t so what it’s fine for women to be side characters in male stories sometimes men are in women’s stories women just don’t perceive it that way how many women’s stories from jane austen to twilight to 50 shades have some broody guy whose either rich or supernatural in some way and is very generic not that women notice loads and i don’t care about that at all it’s fine just like it’s fine for men what’s not fine is making every one of the many characters of a gender to be a idiot or an idiot and a villain

as i said i expected barbie to be all about women probably would have been better if it focused more on women instead of obsessing about men and the patriarchy actually i expected girl power i didn’t expect the obvious sense of misandry hidden under a thin veneer or a social critique on equality which shone through in the movie

and obviously things had stereotypically gender roles in the past as that was all people knew you can hardly paint that as some terrible thing when nobody even cared about it including women until the last century or less

is this academic discourse on hitchcock films by feminist types by chance sounds like it so the women get rescued and why is that bad would it be bad if a woman rescued a man i just watched rope and strangers on a train the other week and no women were rescued in those also i would hardly call gangly awkward jimmy stewart who stars in many hitchcock movies the “archetypical hero” nor bruce dern as a cabbie nor many others 

and i’ve already seen marnie and it ruled not misogynistic at all underrated gem whatever his treatment of tippi hendren which i gather was some form of  harrasment or inappropriateness it’s hardly going to effect how i watch his movies now seeing as he’s been dead for more than 40 years
marnie in marnie is portrayed far more sympathetically than any man in barbie so if your calling that misogynist then barbie must be a category ten hate crime",2023-07-21 20:32:47
a hierarchial system of power that advantages and privileges women in virtually every respect the vast majority of women are far better off than the vast majority of men the fact that there is a small fraction of hyper successful men doesnt take anything away from that reality  your perception on what a patriarchy means is completely skewed and not actually rooted in reality it is just rooted in a shallow view of success and a contempt for men,2023-07-24 17:44:32

ask some women in your life how they felt about it

ruth doesnt want barbie to stay in barbieland she just wants to make sure she understands what shell be giving up and what shell face in the real world",2023-08-06 17:16:37
ah i see you just want to feel smart,2023-08-06 18:03:55
" but the movie treated this scene as a joke

they set up some kind of punchline to then subvert yes i didnt say its not a joke 

 the misdirection on her visit being for a gynecologist is a shock its misdirection thats the point

you should really read better the messages before replying i said that its not supposed to amuse you because the thing is gross like a child trying to be funny because they yell  or  

 for the record 10 minutes before the credits is will ferrel talking about tickling people

i was more like talking about the part between kens resolve and ruths speech but i suppose thats also inbetween",2023-08-07 10:52:38
"a lot of people understanding something isnt a good barometer for what the filmmakers are saying when most americans lack basic media literacy

that might be true but if you make a movie thats so preachy or overbearing as barbie is with its message then it doesnt make sense to end the film with a message a lot of people is not getting thats straight up bad writing if the film was actually subtle and deep the entire way through or at least just in general then making such an ending might have made more sense and come out as good writing because you are kind of expected to think more deeply about the movie the rest of the movie is pretty much just hammering us on the head with its message",2023-07-22 21:49:31
"the good thing about comedies with deeper plot points is that for those of you who dont want to or cant decipher the deeper meaning shown through subtle jokes and preachy ending scenes you can simply enjoy the movies jokes on a surface level and go about your day

again if the movie didnt go with a hammer of morals constantly smacked on the head of the audience then maybe people would be more open to think deeper about the movie when the movie is not subtle at all and straight up is spoonfeeding us the message with speeches then acting like its the audience fault for not thinking deeper about the movie is kind of weak when the movie throughout the entire runtime pretty much spoonfeed us what to think",2023-07-22 22:53:34
"i agree i think the way barbie is played in the beginning is perfect as well as the elder millennial references i prefer bbc pp over keira knightly version and was busting up i took the blatant talk about the patriarchy tm to be campy but america ferrera’s monologue seemed so obvious and forced to me so it was hard to watch that obviously climactic scene  i hope it helps younger women and men though

i thought barbie feeling the injustice in the real world was enough to demonstrate what that monologue was for but i guess we needed the humans to fix the problem so it would make sense in a storytelling way",2023-07-24 14:19:51
"they said towards the end that they are open to having kens run things as well as long as they behave which i understand after the ken war 

the movie is called barbie because the whole franchise is named after barbie and calling it something else would spoil the story 

the fact that its actually more kens story was kinda the point of the movie because the trailers made it seem like it was about barbie alone while the main conflict is actually about barbies and kens roles and relationship to each other 

saying that barbie only cares about her feet and ken about his whole purpose doesnt make sense the whole plot is that those events were intertwined and that barbie didnt realize until things went wrong for her that ken was miserable as well  sure that made her the bad guy and ken a victim but they ended up acknowledging each others struggles and start to live their own lives kens last scene is literally him wearing his im kenough sweater which just emphasizes that he finally learnt how to accept himself while the barbies are now also open to actually being equal instead of above the kens",2023-07-23 07:38:07
" sure the theme behind barbie as a doll was as ruth said  a way for girls to aspire to be more than just mothers as the opening sequence also explained this meant barbie literally thought she had changed the world for girls for the better so after hitting rock bottom and realizing that she’s instead viewed as just another tool of the patriarchy by gloria’s daughter and others she decides that after revolutionizing her own world she wants to do even better and being an impact to not just the outside world but to herself as she has now fully realized that she is more than just a doll  she is barbie
to talk about the “men” theme people keep spitting out others are saying the whole ken sequence was him discovering in an ironic way that men in barbieland don’t have to just be dumb himbos meant to swoon all the barbies  almost like how girls in the real world used barbie to see how they don’t have to be just mothers and trophies for men there’s no actual “misandry” involved in conveying this it’s quite literally just a genderbent story of equal rights that ends with everyone deciding they should live their lives freely of how they were initially designed
i hope this was clear for people who intend to actually listen",2023-07-23 07:28:11
in what world is ken a  none of the kens were at all how did you come up with this conclusion after watching ken go through an entire self transformation and fight with the message that he was made solely for barbie by mattel is the “i am kenough” shirt not on the nose enough for you,2023-07-23 07:20:50
"wage gap 

before you argue that isnt a thing lets use the barbie movie as an example it was newsworthy that both margot robbie and ryan gosling were paid the same salary 125 million because historically female actors are paid less than men across all roles also 125 mil is the most margot has ever been paid in 2022 all thirteen of the highestpaid actors were men no women 

also please point me to these femninists who hate the era as feminist groups are the ones who wrote and pushed for it in the first place",2023-07-23 07:32:23

"i’d say that depends where you are in the us like mormon or amish communities they really are living in the 1800 and very sexist also with your point about how women have greater legal protection again that depends where you’re at i know for a fact certain industry’s or places usually more rural “follow” the law to get the bare minimum they need for women and treat them like absolute  the us is a very big county with very different culture depending on where you’re at

edit also saying that this is an issue of women versus men is part of the problem too since i am sure there are other reasons that men in power or even without power might also not want that to pass and vise versa",2023-07-23 07:22:04
" if you read my post in its entirety you would have seen that i referenced how barbieland is flawed and that they acknowledge it

"“it’s a great emotional relief”

is it i’ve never found it so

“do you really think that”

yes at least to the extent that they do it which is what this is really about because men already do cry and talk about feelings to differing extents just not the extent feminist women feel is appropriate  ie the same amount as them

call me crazy but i just find it quite offensive and rude that feminist women have decided on men’s behalf that men need to change emotionally to be more in line with those same women i mean it’s ridiculously arrogant of them

no i’m saying that that would never be the ending of a female characters arc and presented as a happy or hopeful ending because there’s really nothing particularly positive about it",2023-08-01 18:56:14

"considering the patriarchal system that takes over forces women into the ken’s slaves yes you are meant to cheer for the barbies the barbies demonstrate empathy for the kens though so it signifies there will be progress whereas ken never apologised to barbie and still tries to kiss her when she says she’s sorry because he believes he’s entitled to her love some kens and allan were very happy before eg ncuti’s ken saying “i just want my best friend barbie back” and she appears by his side

i mean come on its not a bad movie but thats pretty on the nose",2023-07-24 08:50:40
the concepts that were presented in this movie as patriarchy and matriarchy were completely wrong onedimensional superficial and unrealistic it was like one giant farce and it would have been okay if they had maintained that this was a result of being the fabrication of naïve and ignorant children much like what barbie world was but then they persisted this narrative into the real world and narration,2023-07-23 03:16:06

"so a husband can not just cheat abuse you toss you like an employer could

women file for divorce way more than men do and they often get the kids child support and alimony even if she cheated or the kid isnt biologically his not saying a woman cant be  over by a guy but when one does people actually care when a women screws over a guy its a celebration

x200b

ive seen too much pain misery and literal life threatening things happen to women who have no own money what so ever and fully depend on their husband that tend to abuse the power he has

and ive seen guys get the johnny depp treatment where they are blackmailed usually into giving money or they will be accused of sa if a woman is being abused physically or financially there is the police and there are womens shelters and there are online fundraising options

there seems to be this myth that all men are abusers and all women are victims when men are abusers society drops the hammer on their nuts and rightly so but when women are the abusers nobody seems to care there are no movies or tv shows or political lectures about how women cheat or manipulate men where its also seen as a negative quite the opposite

x200b

would you like the idea of serving your spouse and giving up all your independence

a man is expected to protect and provide for his spouse which is serving his spouse men work awful dangerous jobs or grueling 12 hour shifts not because they enjoy it but to provide their wives with the best possible life we encourage men to do this but if a man loses his job the odds of his wife divorcing him skyrocket

if we are going to encourage women to treat their husbands with less respect than their boss then is it no wonder men are refusing to marry whats the point why bust your butt to share what you earn with your wife when society encourages her to hate you and leave with everything",2023-07-24 03:35:24
who said anything about choosing between love and financial independence do you see everything in black and white so if women and men both work there cant be love or a sacred family unit what is your solution to this then,2023-07-23 23:21:21
"perhaps i just love the fact that men are constantly told that they need women while women are told they not only dont need men but theyre better off without them

there is plenty of chance for silliness with the barbies they just didn’t take it barbie was often thought of as a stereotypical popular girl or a bit of a   you could have had some of the barbies lean into that and had some more serious and clever  then you would have had funnier barbies as it is they just made all the kens doofuses and all the barbies clever and empowered and it ironically makes the barbies boring,2023-07-24 08:27:08
the stereotype of dumb blond isnt so fun when its flipped the other way no one cared when it was women portrayed this way no one cares that women are treated this way in real life if its upset you its done its job at making the point but i agree that overall this movie is too down our throats about the message its nothing new and its been done before i would have much preferred to see this told in a different way not because its not effective but because its really not original and when you have the same message portrayed the same way too many times you get to the point where it becomes a trope that genuinely upsets people and can backfire,2023-07-25 12:08:45

i didnt say that its not serious its very serious almost too serious for the comical overlay i said the movie should not be taken at face value its deeply satirical and in ways that as you point out can backfire if people take it at face value instead of digging deeper idk who said quit reading into it and they can just sit down because i literally cant stop reading into and about it heh,2023-07-31 12:28:04

so the point is that you need a  to be a human ,2023-07-21 22:23:50
personally i would not say that thats the point the movie is trying to make at all i would say the idea is more that you need to have organs to be a human which id say is pretty unimpeachable but your mileage may vary either way hope you either saw it and it wasnt distressing or you didnt see it and are happy with that decision,2023-08-17 21:50:37

"“patriarchy”  many of the in jokes  i mean i only knew what the synder cut was after i saw the film and came on here the overall reliance on the “man dumb woman smart” trope the heavy heavy reliance of the stirring of women’s emotions via speeches which aren’t likely to be as hot in all times so won’t have people primed to enjoy the rest of the movie the casual man hating gloria and daughter rolling their eyes at the idiot husband for no reason the whole not putting barbie and ken together because she’s an independent woman which won’t seem like a happy ending in future most likely just the reliance of the audiences knowledge of tik tok style feminism and assumed care for those themes

i could easily see people pointing at movies like this where all the men are morons and the women competent and it looking highly tired and dated",2023-07-29 18:55:42

"beyond that they were treated little better than family dog

 most men wouldnt just treat women like dogs because that is not how most men would want to treat women in the first place that is not nature nor is that inherently innate to male behavior men may not have respected their inputs when they tried to interject themselves into fields that men had been working in for a very long timeaka womensplaining but that certainly does not mean that they just treated them like dogs this is revisionist history 


 marriage was typically not about valuing women but about controlling them

 men loved women as much then as they do now it was never about controlling them and this false narrative that men just sought to control women is incredibly harmful it is just poison and more revisionist history which seeks to further enable women in their bigotry and extremism towards women

also most of those abusive men were chosen by women and a lot of that abuse came from a lack of support for mens issues at the time in some situations it was also because we lived in a society that failed to hold women accountable for their actions and husbandsfathers were expected to take accountability for their wives misbehavior men were often punished in lieu of women which then led to certain men becoming more abusive in response abuse against women was still however regarded as immoral and illegal 

men also most certainly had to develop a strong cold and violent disposition in order to even attract women gentle men still are to this day often viewed as weak cowardly unmasculine and unworthy of a womans affection that hasnt changed either 

and men did things for themselves what is this  about doing it for women 

invaders fought wars to provide resources and wealth for the women of their countries or to end a threat before it reaches their home countries invadees fought to protect the women of their countries so that they wouldnt become victims of war youre also really missing the point if youre going to go pick one example that you think harms women men worked so that they could provide a home and life for their wives and children men took roles of leadership because that was the role that women expected of themthey were labelled all kinds of nasty things if they werent much like they still are now men created societies and laws to protect and support women 

human history is cruel to anyone without power 

human history is far more cruel to men than it was to women but you just wont read about it because no one cared for the men who suffered

 and for boys like you it is threatening to live in a world where people are treated equally

quite the opposite i would love to see a world of equality the problem is that you have people like you who are either completely blind or who have a very twisted view about equality trying to make the rules its like youre trying to blindly balance a scale that was already completely slanted in your favor because you cant even recognize just how good you actually have it you are effectively capitalizing on male disposability to further a cause of misandry and female chauvinism there is nothing equal about that",2023-07-24 04:38:16

it seems like you do get the point  everything is an outgrowth from this idea of what if we make men the accessories a reversal of the dominant portrayal in media where a woman exists only in the context of a man where they exist only for the mans gaze and validation 

i found the execution of this idea lacking but to be upset and see it as a man hating movie is pretty absurd and imo says more about your fragility than anything else the whole point of barbie land is that it is not for it to be representative of the ideal real world where parity exists between men and women but rather a place that exists for the uplift of women 

yes all the men in the movie are  but think of the countless movies where women are mindless objects for the desires are stories of men also men arent exactly an oppressed class of people and should be able to understand the point without their fragile egos frying",2023-08-06 13:15:01

if the movie had made all the white barbie’s bad because of poc being treated badly i honestly as a white woman would not care i’m assuming it would only be done to prove a point just like it was with the barbies and kens and just to make sure this is clear i think how the kens were treated in the context of the movie was okay because it was to show how women in movies and irl are treated

yes more men have died in war than women why do you think that is could part of the reason be that women weren’t even allowed to be in the military for a long time and even now when they do they’re treated poorly by the men so why would more want to join 

i definitely think suicide and homelessness this also effects a large number of lgbt people btw are big problems that everyone should be working towards solving i don’t think using them to invalidate women’s struggles is a very fair though no one is saying men don’t have problems things are still generally easier for them than they are for women if you really want to get into it we can also look at how many women die from domestic abuse pregnancy complications and how men try to control our bodies",2023-07-23 00:54:06

"you’re right i was overly harsh and i apologise if you’re honestly asking in good faith i think buffy did a great job promoting strong women it was groundbreaking and ahead of its time that being said the show was created by a pretty  guy who masqueraded as a feminist  public while cheating on his wife and abusing the actresses who worked for him for the most part buffy has aged very well but it’s still guilty of playing into some harmful tropes and there are elements of the feminist messaging that don’t stand the rest of time

to answer the rest of your question i don’t think barbie does make men look weak or incompetent there’s a really important message about how patriarchy as a system harms men as well as women ken arguably has just as big of a character arc and journey of self discovery as barbie does he starts off as an accessory to barbie his only purpose in life is to be near her in the real world he learns about patriarchy and loves the idea of a society where men and horses are powerful and in charge he goes back to barbie land to turn it into a patriarchy but it still doesn’t make him happy instead of defining himself as barbie’s boyfriend now he defines himself by his house and his car and his clothes and possessions all he wants in life is a sense of identity and to feel needed and wanted and powerful but instead the system that he himself has put in place holds him back and imposed strict roles on him that he doesn’t want he only becomes truly happy when he starts looking inward to define and accept himself for who he is as a person and realises that he’s kenough there’s a really sweet message in there about how society hinders men from living as their authentic selves because of the roles we as a society place on men as well as women all too often men are defined by how much money they make and how many beautiful women they have around them instead of who they are as human beings the whole andrew tate idea of hyper masculinity encourages men to be as shallow and materialistic as possible and then blames women for expecting them to be rich alpha males

ken isn’t an idiot because he’s a man he’s an idiot because he’s a doll with a child like mind who doesn’t understand the real world when he goes back to barbie land he single handedly transforms it from a matriarchy into a patriarchy the barbies go from presidents and nobel prize winning scientists to maids and housewives in the time it takes for barbie to get back does that mean that women are being portrayed as weak and incompetent no it means that the barbies and kens are children’s toys

the message of the movie isn’t ‘men bad women good’ it’s that humanity is complicated and messy and we put systems in place that harm us all",2023-07-23 00:20:55
"well yes the kens lose because the movie is a lightheaded satire about the juxtaposition of a girls doll in the greater feminist movement guys arent gonna come out of it looking like the good guys because ofwell being thier constant opposition in real life oppenheimer was a story about the bad guys too due to creating a tool to melt japanese people

for a villain plot the fact that it was a positive message instead of mustache twirling villains was more than surprising",2023-07-26 15:32:15

you know adults typically make the purchasing decisions for a household right the movie was mattels big push to get parents to buy their kids barbies it wasnt to get kids to like barbie it was to get moms to like barbie,2023-07-26 04:16:05

that would just super thanks a lot bye bye now",2023-08-01 21:45:30
"they do get that  what they’re objecting to is in the real world of this movie the women are portrayed as competent and worthy battling the dumb bad patriachy  but kens are still portrayed as dumb and the barbie matriarchy isn’t all that bad at all so it’s just a negative portrayal of men whether they’re in charge or oppressed

it’s not my problem that making the kens represent both patriarchy and women in the real world was bad writing so don’t be triggered by me pointing it out btw referencing academic books in your comment doesn’t make them seem more intelligent just more like intellectual wannabe stuff",2023-07-23 18:53:52
to be fair i agree with the majority of what youre saying i feel like they couldnt find the right groove with the barbieken dynamic and i wish it had been explored a bit more its probably my only real issue with the film that being said i dont think the issue is that its attacking men i think thats just more of a story telling issue i think this movie could have benefitted from either being longer or split into two films one about margot barbie discovering herself and one about the barbieken rift because it felt like they were trying to do a lot and as a result some things got lost in the plot or became unclear id love to have seen the kens fleshed out as characters a bit more,2023-07-23 16:52:05
ken is representing too many things is one of the big narrative problems he’s women he’s toxic men he’s men finding themselves or whatever it’s too much,2023-07-23 17:40:20

how do women have more legal rights than men because i think you’ll find the right to control over our reproductive systems is being attacked atm",2023-07-22 00:27:37
its easy to look at writing on paper and claim that there must not be inequality because there are certain rules in place i dont know enough about law to engage in that discussion with you but the reality is regardless of laws women are still very discriminated against usually without even realising because thats been the reality for so long could you explain how legal rights directly translates to privilege,2023-07-22 00:25:06
i mean as a man i think any man who was offended by this movie is just plain too  to actually understand that it wasn’t an anti men movie,2023-07-23 22:06:58

"please be for real 

you are projecting things that are not part of this movie onto it for no reason she didn’t want to leave barbieland because “it’s perfect” and that is where she lives barbieland is her reality because she is a doll she’s not even human if there were moments where she was dehumanized that’s partially why because she’s not really human so that’s kinda the point she’s also a woman and women are dehumanized so that’s another way they can hone in on the theme 

i also don’t believe she ever mentioned wanting to commit suicide she mentioned thinking about death but that’s not necessarily the same thing yeah they probably shouldn’t have laughed but it’s also something they have no experience with because they are barbies and not real people 

i think you’re struggling to grasp the difference between reality and fantasy",2023-07-23 06:02:25

go on football twitter for 5 minutes and youll read floods and floods of homophobic misogynistic and racist nonsense look at the growth of incel communities online reddit have attempted to crack down but 4chan and other sites are still full of misogyny and bigotry

if you dont believe there arent vast numbers of people who hate specific identities and races then youre simply ignorant on top of that you dont have to outwardly hate women even though a lot of men do  see the rise in the likes of andrew tate to be a misogynist misogyny is still rampant even if its not as socially acceptable to proudly admit you think of women as less than men",2023-07-25 20:49:04

lol no  male culture is what you get when you take women out of the equation and then allow men to use the patriarchy against each other it manifests in some truly odd ways for instance aging for a lot of  men turning 30 can truly feel like the end of your social and romantic life its commonly referred to as  death  turning 25 can be depressing the obsession with youth in the  community can verge on insane,2023-07-30 15:34:56

for me it’s not a matter of is nolan has better films than this i just go with which movie is better and better directed between the two actual movies getting compared and i love barbie but i really don’t think it’s as impressive as oppenheimer was which is why i wouldn’t give it to barbie,2023-07-23 17:40:52

i agree the rest of the examples can range from somewhat annoying to downright toxic ",2023-07-23 13:47:46
is it still mansplaining if you do it to everyone not just women and not because you assume they don’t already know what you’re talking about but because you just want to make sure that everyone on the same page and not assume everyone is knowledgable about everything or maybe just because you think something is really cool and you just want to talk about it,2023-09-04 15:55:03

the us didnt have a woman on the supreme court until the 1980s about 200 years after the supreme court was created barbieland has been introduced to the idea of equality for about 5 minutes the entire point of the scene was the progress takes time even after the problem has been acknowledged,2023-08-22 23:35:50
"i felt the same way

the parallels between the barbies and the patriarchy are pretty obvious barbies are the patriarchy of the barbie land the matriarchy i guess barbiearchy

and the barbies learn the hard way that being treated unfairly sucks barbie enters the real world and shes treated like  ken brings the patriarchy back to the barbie world and all of the barbies are miserable 

and they resolve that by overthrowing the kens and putting themselves back in power the barbiearchy resumes itself bringing us right back to the status quo

i thought for sure there would be a little twist in there especially when barbie realizes she doesnt know where ken lives i thought hed give his little speech and the barbies would have that moment of realization that maybe their barbiecentric society wasnt the fairest to the kens either much like how normal society isnt always the fairest to women either and then the kens and barbies would learn to treat each other with respect and live happily ever after",2023-07-30 22:37:25
"nope because that outrage that you’re feeling is immediately acknowledged by the narrator and the point she makes about the progress still needed it reality makes you realize the outrage you’re feeling over conditions in a fictional  barbieland…should be applied towards the real injustices in reality  

if you’re someone as the viewer that already understands that yay  the message was for the people that don’t",2023-07-30 23:53:47
well the point of the movie isnt menbad womengood nobody should be opressed period the barbie society isnt perfect it looks like a paradise but it isnt and just because barbie won at the end doesnt mean that this society will immediately fix all of its problems and get a perfect happy ending it will take decades for kens to slowly get all the rights they deserve just like it happened in real life for women there are no 5 minute solutions people have to work hard in order to reach true equality,2023-11-21 18:37:52
"aren’t interested in a fair society but rather ones where women rule

yes that is the entire  point because this is what happens in the real world in reverse the movie is a social critique not a happy ever after that would completely defeat the point of the film which is that we dont have a happy ending 

ending the film by wrapping it all in a nice little bow so people can leave happy and think everything is solved would hilariously undermine the point of the film",2023-09-02 23:40:18
"i left the movie with the impression that the kens situation will improve over time just like with women in the real world  there will be a time where there will be 4 kens in the supreme barbie court just not now

so yea it still kinda sucks for the kens and its played for laughs but theres optimism there at least as much optimism thats in the real world",2023-07-28 15:57:28
me and my girlfriend both came away wondering what the message of the film was because feminism is about equality and this seemed more like supremacy than anything and even then ken seems to be treated worse than women today and the outright denial of a supreme court seat seems to indicate it won’t get as good for them as it is for women in the real world,2023-07-27 01:32:17
"i still dont see it as a retribution i see it as a way to hold a mirror to an audience to show them all the kinds of inequality women face that is not even being noticed you probably heard people saying that feminism is no longer needed in civilized countries but only ignorant people can think that thousands of years of misogyny can be undone in less than a century

one of the best ways to wake people up is by showing a parallel reality with roles reversed  this was what this movie intended to do not a retribution but a wake up call that this  is not fine it shouldnt be taken as a norm",2023-07-25 19:41:09
"based patriarchy predominantly helps the men in power remain in power while trying to control the men not in power with their standards of manhood men who dont fit the standards are often cast aside or seen as weak allen fits the men who are discarded

completely agree with you especially in regards to the compliments thanks for the ego boost lol no you nailed it the reflection of the theme of the film on twitter and reddit and probably other spaces is either real irony or the alanis morrisette version see i’m not actually smart just wordy greta and noah’s writing was sublime but mr elevated it all beyond a level i thought possible for a film like this i was a huge fan before but am an even bigger stan now if she doesn’t win it better be a loss to an absolute powerhouse performance in a worthy drama of some kind i haven’t seen anything close yet but i also haven’t seen joy ride you hurt my feelings or past lives yet so perhaps some of those female leads will challenge will be fun to watch how the race unfolds i’m rooting for her though,2023-07-24 05:47:47
not arguing with you but there’s a lot of people who use “men” and “patriarchy” interchangeably which is why people read it that way a lot of “pop” gender thought doesn’t acknowledge that everyone holds up the patriarchy in some way,2023-07-25 03:02:25

"“yeah but men go through it too“ “oh but not all women“ is such a lazy response especially when the movie specifically showcases the difficulties that men face in society as well  men and women face different obstacles in society and they do not face it the same way that’s what the movie is trying to show no one is saying “only women” or “every individual woman” faces these things 

this messaging in movie just doesn’t seem like it’s for you tbh and that’s fine doesn’t make it wrong necessarily just not for you",2023-07-25 05:27:41

i think we got enough view of barbieland to suggest that its a bit fascist  they vote for the president but if shes literally president barbie do they really have any other choice  she might as well be putin  and when weird barbie does something outside the norm they ostracize and exile her  everyone has a role theyre seemingly born into,2023-08-11 13:16:52

1 the bench scene with barbie seeing the real world
2 the guy explaining to ken how the patriarchy has essentially gone underground 

that second scene lays out the movies most sinister villan everything before that felt like cartoonishly bad that felt actually sinister it touches on how men can be impacted by the patriarchy by the adding of stricter requirements to gain access to circles of power needing mbas and phds and how sinister the origins of those requirements often are designed to exclude women and other minority groups",2023-07-21 11:04:53

first you dont know if they are aloneunhappy or not second i never said that status success and money matters i do not cast a moral judgement i just said that they are important determinants of self worth in our society and you dont get to choose it third youve convinced yourself youre a victim of society and maybe thats true but we all are is exactly my point

yeah you dont get a pass to be a  incel by bringing up the potential lack of free will we all have that same lack of free will and most of us arent  heads about women nice try changing the subject though

i dont try to change the subject at all this is very on topic with my first comment underlying that you dont necessarily choose what determines you self worth that you read it as an excuse of misogynistic behavior says more about you than me its not because you dont have free will or limited free will that you have no responsibility i never claimed that

thank you for sharing your personal experiences but i dont think that they are relevant to the discussion that you think your sources of self worth have changed they have not really changed that are just different situated expressions of a reduced number of fundamental needs doesnt mean that you changed them access to women is important for a mans self worth because we are bombarded with titillating content or power couples imagery that you think you escaped that which i doubt does not make it untrue

thats why margos character leaves for the real world she doesnt want to be perfect she wants to help the world change for the better i feel like thats why the ending was so profound to me she gave up everything to go to another world where she already knew how hard it would be for her as a woman to work towards true equality to help with the problems in the real world,2024-01-24 14:29:39
the fact that barbie is only an idea until action has been made no real change will happen thats what i feel like margot robbie did an amazing job with her role she really conveyed that message it wasnt til she took that first step to change and become human that she stepped away from being just an idea and by that step she took the first step to real change,2024-03-19 16:54:50

"just got back from seeing the movie i think that the male characters in both the real world and in barbieland were portrayed in sort of a similar way to the barbies at the beginning of the film we first see the barbies as these perfect ultrafeminine girlbosses only to realize that this perfect world is really harmful to some of the people both within and without of barbieland even though barbieland has unrealistic beauty standards and is full of toxic positivity barbie sees it as a perfect place due to her surfacelevel view of the world

ken experiences something similar when he steps out into the real world he only sees the good instead of perfect pink houses and a female president he sees horses and bill clinton he latches onto these things as do all the other kens despite the fact that not all of the kens really want that sort of life just like not all of the barbies mainly stereotypical barbie dont want the lives that they were given we see that regardless of the patriarchy that he established goslings ken was never really happy because he still felt empty inside

also while the real world men were hardly portrayed well from the random catcallers to the matell board i dont believe that this was meant to offer an objective view of the world as a place full of evil men one of moments that the outside world really grounds itself is when barbie is sitting on the bench and looking around at the world from a distance she sees the trees a couple fighting and then a man just holding his head in his hands the men in this world arent all just having a great time but from the perspective of barbieland it might seem that way at first

but even the mattel board isnt portrayed as happy in the end ferrell talks about how he sometimes wishes that he could ticklefight with his mates and i feel that this was a wonderful way to show just how touchstarved and isolated a lot of men can feel due to how our culture sees certain things like tickling and holding hands as okay for female friends but not okay for men and for the mattel guys that closeness wasnt found within the bounds of romantic love but between male friends i felt that it was a lovely addition to kens resolution where he realized that he didnt need a woman to be whole

cant believe i just wrote an essay on this movie i didnt even like it but i also dont believe that the film was unnuanced in its portrayal of men",2023-08-19 23:28:52

"im gonna say to you what i said to myself and every other single dude i knew when we were all in our early 20s and noting that every single one of us are all married without a divorce among us there are plenty of women out there for you you need to figure out what you actually want

you are not in love with love you saw peter parker get married to a model and think you deserve that too without wondering if you bring anything more to the table than a vague idea of loyalty any good relationship is already loyal do you have a smile that makes that 1 in 1000 girl swoon even if its a dorky one she cant help but find cute do you make her laugh do you help create good times for you both do you want to wake up to her in the morning without her makeup or hair done as she breathes morning breath in your face do you want to alternate cleaning the toilet you both  in thats what life is you dont think of women as people just an object of desire and yet you never think if you were a woman would you actually date you you can get there selfreflection and improvement is one of the most masculine things a man can do",2023-07-21 18:51:29
"late stage capitalism really has us in a bad spot i appreciate the kind words

still women arent a hivemind that go for the top 25 of men what does that mean really top 25 in income looks humor personality all of that combined okay how do women judge all of that combined to find the top 25 nah that doesnt make sense

i think being 24 and having no love or relationships of course will do horrible damage to you i have a lot of empathy for your position despite you having seemingly none for the womans perspective loneliness is soul crushing there is no doubt about it and loneliness is increasing so much in our world our society is changing for the worse in that regard

women do go through this too 

you sound like youre in a horribly dark place it doesnt have to be like this 

when you look out at the world and think that everyone hates you thats actually just you you hate you and youre projecting that onto everyone else

at least thats how i was just speaking from experience 

and if women gaining independence and no longer being forced into relationships no longer being forced into being homemakers and mothers hurts some menthen so be it neither gender should be held back so the other one can thrive

both genders should have the opportunity to succeed",2023-07-21 19:09:40

methinks the reception has been too overwhelmingly positive for there to be some massive critical reevaluation where a few years from now everyone goes hey ya know what we were all wrong none of us liked that movie it has high 80s on rotten tomatoes on both sides a 42 on letterboxd an 80 on metacritic an a on cinemascore 75 on imdb despite review bombers the only thing is a mixed user score on metacritic but many of those are review bombers who think the film is misandrist without having seen it you are allowed your own opinion on the film but its very safe to say that the general consensus is that people liked it,2023-07-28 06:51:19
lol this movie doesn’t hate men it hates men like you though i think,2023-07-29 03:29:06
" youre way more misogynistic and dense than i initially thought its not just women that say this about men but men ourselves and for a long time if you actually were cultured or learned or literate its male scholars and thought leaders and novelists and philosopers and political leaders and activists and artists for a very long time feminism is also for men too its an ideology and movemen dude its not created by women for women soley i hope you know that or this conversation will die quickly 

but there’s also simple politics surrounding custody laws or whatever else regarding men plenty of the gender specific concerns of men aren’t focused on relationships at all

and who pray tell came up with those structures and ideals and why its almost as if the patriarchy indeed hurts everybody

see the mistake you’re making is thinking that some teenage boys looking for advice on picking up girls is “focusing their entire personality on women

no im fully aware that boys are into girls and want to be with them but what compels so many boys and men to feel worthless with the love or attention of a woman why does that mean they hate women so much they will actively take away their rights but you want to complain about a fictional fantasy movie of matriarchy

no barbie and ken is never thought of together typically thats the point of the humor of the movie ken is very much not popular and has never been they literally discontinued him briefly little kids rarely played with kens the humor of the movie and why it plays off gender politics so well is built into the franchises history itself if this movie had been a typical barbie movie where its barbie and her friends doing  while the men are left behind conservatives would still be mad that the kens are pointless in barbie land no  its how its always been 


feminist fantasy that really only resonates with feminist women because as i said it’s their fantasy become ideology

fantasy turned ideology my brother im trying to keep this convo civil but you and these comments are starting to send me 

yes thats right this movies message is how barbie doesnt need ken and it is that way because thats what barbie and kens dynamic has always been like its why ken doesnt have a job or a car or a dream house the barbie world is inherently matriarchal and feminist ken mirrors women in our real world who have to fight for power and rights and privilege and agency yeah thats why greta wants boys and men to pay attention to the kens and their story its like you dumb misogynists cant understand that a critique of patriarchy isnt some instant we hate men bashand since women just lost their right to choose maybe feminism was right all along and maybe we should actually out the patriarchy more aggressively you claim this movie bashes men but reject its message that men are fine on their own and dont need women to affirm their sense of self again more humor is tied to the brand  history no this isnt gonna be a  love story about barbie and ken because thats never what barbie has been about

im not sure how old you are but i sincerely hope you expand your worldview and sense of self to where a fictional romp on gender politics played out with toy dolls doesnt rock your world too much",2023-07-29 10:16:29

"i never said that crying is a negative experience i said the scene in question showed barbie as scared because it did

yes she eventually leaves that was not her intention the entire time she literally willingly goes to mattel and then willingly gets into the box did you watch the movie

she did not decide to become human until the end of the movie how is that patently false you literally agree with me in your this is patently false rebuttal she didnt know she could become human so how could her character journey be barbie wants to become human 

she went to mattel to complain about the human world and to speak to someone in charge when she realizes there isnt a woman in charge  she literally returns to barbie world i dont know what your argument is lets phrase it a different way  if you could go to barbie world would you

how long is she supposed to be there  that depends in this movie she is there for just long enough to move the ken plot forward if this was a movie about barbie shed probably have been in the real world for longer but the movie is about ken not about barbie which  is my complaint

you write that barbie had changed a great deal when she returned to barbie world and yet the second barbie world phase is to return barbie world to normal thats not change 

i dont think ken still being a doll has any impact on the movie which is part of the point where barbie becoming human has no impact on the movie ken as a character has changed barbie has not 

do you want your barbie movie to be about men because that doesnt seem right i think theres a lot to say about movie directed and half written by greta gerwig still being a movie focusing on and seen through a male lens theres an idea out there that because female artists are taught in a chain that begins with a man there is no truly female art i think you can make that argument about barbie what we are given in a movie about a little girls toy in a movie covered in so much pink it depleted the worlds supply of it in a movie focused on women  is a movie about a man i think that says something about the efforts we still have yet to accomplish in regards to feminism equality and the realities of the human world more than the barbie movie itself ever made",2023-08-06 18:35:08

"yeah that’s totally fair if we don’t agree

i think you make a really good point about barbie handholding ken to his revelation though and i made a comment to my friend after watching the movie that ken got off pretty light considering how terrible he was

but what i also do find fascinating about ken in this movie is that he really experiences all angles of the problem  he starts off the movie as the role that women often get pigeonholed into as someone who is really just an accessory to someone of the more powerful  then he goes down the incel type rabbit hole becomes a massive misogynist gets tricked into fighting people with a common goal due to fear mongering then in the end eventually does learn that he needs to find value in himself outside of the context of just his relationship to women

there’s so many little parts of his story line that many different types of people could take something out of

but back to the ending like i said because of how cartoonishly evil ken was during the movie it feels almost gross how kind barbie is to him in the end but we also cant really forget how the barbies themselves didn’t really have any interest in creating an equal world at the beginning of the movie and even beyond that i also don’t really think that allowing forgiveness and redemption to those who seek it is necessarily a bad message to send  even if not done super well",2023-08-04 12:31:03

holy  there it is i mentioned this to my wife and she said “well then she’s the one who made weird barbie weird” which makes so much more sense when gloria says “i had a weird barbie” and weird barbie says “yeah you did” we just always thought that meant most or all girls had a weird barbie but it really seems now that that weird barbie is gloria’s which really ties the entire story together in a way thanks so much for reporting back you’ve blown my mind in such a good way,2023-11-18 20:10:07
i think i agree with most of that i’ve only seen the movie once so far and i did really like it i want to watch it again to be able to clarify some of my thoughts on it i think the only reason the mattel issue sticks for me is it did everything else so well that those bumps are a little more noticeable to me i’m also aware of fact that the criticism “yeah the movie was a good critique of patriarchy and the struggles of modern women worked in enough nostalgia to make people who loved barbie happy had a compelling and funny plot and tried to tackle its complicated meta context while still being able to be made and make a ton of money but it wasn’t exactly the takedown of the parent corporation i was looking for” is a troubling parallel to the “women are expected to be everything all at once” speech,2023-12-24 16:54:32

overall… i was kind of disappointed in the movie  last night i watched it on a whim for the first time because i had heard nothing but good things about it  my concern had been that it would be way over the top like the brady bunch movie which i really didn’t like… but i kept hearing that it was so much more than that that barbie even deals with death  so maybe i had too high expectations… it was probably done slightly better than the brady bunch movie but mostly it was just too surreal for me  i mean a guy gets on an elevator to go to the very top or whatever and there’s like one button and it says exactly that…",2023-12-31 05:30:19

i think the whole purpose of the movie is to highlight that it doesn’t feel good for any gender to live in a society where the other gender dominates the goal should be no dominate gender ruling society",2023-07-23 17:48:49
she said ,2023-07-22 20:58:32
yeah thats where the gears grinded a bit  still an amazing movie and there were several issue to nitpick but the overall message and theme make for great discussion  whole family had a lot of fun,2023-07-24 19:45:17
if you make a barbie movie with a 150m budget and merchandising as well you should really lose your right to make anti capitalist critique imo it’s like promoting animal rights while on a hunting safari,2023-07-27 14:13:09
the irony of primark having a whole barbie line coming out at the same time as the movie,2023-07-27 13:05:45
did you read my comment yes the movie portrays them as morons but we the audience is not supposed to celebrate that we’re supposed to recognize that it’s  up and that they deserve better,2023-07-27 14:11:53
nah he’s shown as a bumbling fool and his wife also doesn’t care for him,2023-07-27 14:35:20
just one more small example of the movie continually going out of its way to portray every man no matter the situation as an idiot to be made fun of,2023-07-27 14:34:52
i mean narrative wise yes it would have been the whole point i think was to show the kens ie women that you dont need to depend on no man ie barbie so if they put the two together then it would have undermined that point,2023-07-25 16:04:05
that’s true,2023-07-22 08:11:09
"i think so too i saw the movie as that way but everyone’s reactions was that everything the kens went through was funny or deserved that the matriarchy and barbie land before the end is the perfect world the movie says they don’t want things to stay the same but don’t actually say what that means which i think would help and that this movie is very feminist most ppl sadly don’t include the troubles of men in feminism and say anything a man says about the movie shouldn’t be considered 

i feel like the movie did not be clear enough with its message if what you’re saying is the intended message i mean seriously look on twitter right now they also never really say “hey what the kens go through is bad in barbie land” while they have many speeches about how the ken land and patriarchy hurts women and say that straight up but with the kens it’s all implied",2023-07-22 20:26:30
you did not understand what i said about utopias  not every matriarchal utopian fiction is literally the best possible world you do realize people can imagine alternative worlds because they have positive ideas without wanting necessarily to live in them your argument waivers on the idea that when someone writes about an imaginary world being good they want to live there that’s not a good stasis of anything,2023-07-24 13:47:30
i understand what youre saying but the point was that things are equal for ken in barbieland just as things are equal for women in the real world  that is theyre not and men shouldnt get upset at the barbieland inequality because were the ones causing the real world inequality again i dont think that message is thoughtfully constructed or withstands scrutiny but it seemed clear to me that this was the message,2023-07-22 17:43:47
"well i just answered that it makes revenues please go back and read

yea you answered why they lied but that wasnt the point i was replying to you first claimed that it was made clear that this was not for kids

i called that out by explaining how it wasnt made clear when the actress playing barbie herself claimed that it was for everyone when directly asked if this was for kids

i know why they didnt tell the truth but its irrelevant to the point of whether it was made clear or not that barbie was for kids

who cares if they understand or not parents taking little girls to see it was definitely a thing which would profit them more

also i ignored this before but just gonna call this out also what kind of opinion is this you are straight up here defending or at best saying it doesnt matter an employee lying to costumers so theyshe can take advantage of kids for profit",2023-07-23 22:42:48
"it seemed marketed more towards adults imo but i also thought that most of the humor was something that would still work for most kids age 11 and up even as a fair bit of reference goes over their heads  

then there was broad physical comedy throughout that would work for kids 67 and up like just barbies life in general in the first act little kids can see the humor in someone fake eating because they are supposed to be a doll",2023-07-23 22:54:17
 that’s like saying kids now days don’t play with spider man i played with spider man when i was younger but that doesn’t mean kids now days don’t play with it you can act naive all you want however barbie has always been a toy and brand for kids the barbie brand’s whole target audience is kids they gave out toys to kids to promote the movie yet if you want to deny the facts you go ahead,2023-07-23 22:47:09
sorry i’ve seen too many men define their and other peoples manhood by how many women they can sleep with and rule over in the home to agree maybe visit a battered women’s shelter and listen to the stories about how some men are defining themselves as men and teaching their sons that’s what it means too,2023-07-30 10:38:11
"wow you sure are one triggered straight dude

says the guy upset and angry over a movie about plastic toy dolls for little girls",2023-08-02 19:41:36
generally speaking don’t you think women are seen to be inferior in terms of capabilities in the real world which is why the higher positionssalary etc are reserved for men idk i felt greta just tried to show that same thing,2023-08-03 16:36:11
"actually they all were all the real world men were clearly written dumber than the women and gloria’s husband is mocked by his daughter and his wife rolls her eyes at him then later is reminiscing about the cooler boyfriend that taught her to drive fast implication is he’s lame and it’s a joke and that’s the sympathetic female hero

yes i saw the end of the movie as well  no need to write up the entire plot again my man point was whatever the attempted message  the men are indeed written as comparatively dumb and morally lacking compared to the women kendom is clearly more dysfunctional than the barbie matriarchy

lol you typing “as a straight dude that’s embarrassing” is truly embarrassing my  that’s like the most hilariously “progressive ally bro” thing i’ve ever read to the point it seems like satire itself as it’s such an absurd thing to make a point of calling yourself a straight dude while defending feminist barbie",2023-08-02 18:40:43
if you think women and men are truly equal in the modern day i have a bridge to sell you,2023-07-27 19:09:40
so any positive is its an allegory but any negative doesnt count because theyre just dolls theyre real enough that they can be influenced by external factors such as the real world but not real enough to be antagonistic,2023-07-22 21:15:05
"in the scene at weird barbies house when america farrera first gives her speech they literally have all the barbies stop in their steps get sad and hang on to her every word they emphathize with her theyre not being deprogrammed 


also the barbies do have real empathy because they explicitly apologize to weird barbie at the end because they feel bad for how they treated her



also the antidone thing is the least established part of the movie we arent even explained how the kens brainwash the barbies and then somehow the antidone is exposure to a world that they have no capacity to understand if they have no ability to connect with this because theyre dolls then why is that the antidote just that ken said pro patriarchy and this is anti patriarchy yeah very deep insightful writing s",2023-07-22 21:24:28
"why are you so invested in this being a romance like barbies ending wasnt that she doesnt need men its that she gets to be her own person and choose her own path that doesnt mean that she is going to be single in the real world the  she gets to chose her partner instead of settling for the one that was assigned to her ken gets to find a barbie that actually has feelings for him too like i dont see what your issue is here your takes are so baselevel it isnt even worth arguing with you 

go watch the snyder cut or something",2023-07-25 13:15:42
"what im saying is very simple

her decision to become human doesnt make sense from a character perspective she was happy in barbieland and they never explained what she wanted about the real world 

she wants to create something one of the barbies wrote a book in barbieland",2023-08-07 02:55:31
bro it refers playing with dolls just give up,2023-07-22 16:40:49
“getting annoyed at a man and not letting him come over to your house is very mean” it really  isn’t he was friendzoned and the film frames that as a bad thing ken was basically an incel,2023-07-25 23:16:58
"mattel the corporation who brainwashed women young girls and the whole barbie world into tacitly accepting patriarchal hegemony

this is not the message of the movie but you do you bro",2023-07-31 18:56:04
"then itd be easier to do so

its just a thought experiment but if ken decided he was a barbie would a house appear for her",2023-07-28 16:42:43
idk lol i think i got a bad image from him “trying to explain” instead of him actually having a conversation… but a lot of what he’s explaining is just plot points and elements of the movie saying “that was bad” like i think a lot of the contractions he points out are really contradictions in society like ken not really being a bad guy and the mixed messaging of patriarchymatriarchy… again these are interesting conversations i think the film is starting but him “trying to explain” a very black and white read on it is funny,2023-07-29 01:52:10
yeah and thats also completely possible too,2023-07-31 13:31:09
"obviously its just my interpretation

its mirrored as well in the real world will ferrell seems to be genuinely invested to do best for the dolls and for women in general and seems willing to improve things meanwhile the board of directors doesnt have any women present and seem surprised when questioned on this

edit to clarify this is how i interpret the intentions of the movie if you agree with that message or not is a different discussion obviously but in my opinion its at least consistent with itself and a more interesting ending than everyone lives in equality and harmony now",2023-07-21 13:23:05
"to give an anecdotal example my ex boyfriend is my best friend we talk all the time we love each other and frequently have deep and intimate conversations he challenges and stimulates me intelligently 

we’re not in a relationship because we just don’t work that way his goals and interests in life don’t really allow for him to be partnered and my feelings and struggles make it difficult to give him what he wants 

we know that we’re fundamentally incompatible but we’re still very important to each other",2023-07-27 15:17:20
i don’t think kens did anything wrong they revolted against an unjust oppressive society,2023-07-23 22:31:01
"right if anything i welcome hearing about it because i want to evaluate my own behaviors and see if there’s anything i should change 

i used to be someone who would laugh at prison  jokes i’m glad that i got called out on that and i don’t do it anymore 

i’m not someone who physically hurt people but that doesn’t my behavior wasn’t toxic and harmful",2023-07-27 17:30:03
convenient that you left out the second half of what i said ,2023-07-29 05:00:36
when i was growing up my sister had several barbies and one ken who was always  because she would give his clothes to some of her barbies to wear,2023-07-31 05:15:07
cool  excellent defense of the hypocrisy of the movie,2023-07-31 22:37:10
dunno why i’m trying to have a conversation with someone who’s clearly just mad that something was made that’s not all about dudes being awesome always,2023-07-30 03:54:39
or perhaps men would realise exactly how condescendingly  that would seem and be aware enough not to write it and your not giving them enough credit,2023-07-30 05:03:19
my comment was relatively short if you could “unpack” it you would in reality you have no idea how to and now you are trying to deflect from that,2023-07-30 13:56:07
so true she really irked some men by pointing out exactly what the world is actually like,2023-07-30 13:06:54
if you say so lol however i just see a  movie with a man hating bent made by someone with a lot of bitterness about men even apart from the casual misandry of the movie it’s not well written at all and the themes are all over the place as well as the world of barbie having no internal logic,2023-07-30 08:54:47
its so silly to get upset over the ken jokes they are stereotypical barbie and ken they are supposed to be exaggerated versions of the most stereotypical male and female get a grip people,2023-07-22 17:59:01
"its a very frankly existentialist movie heavy on the simone de beauvoir disguised as a toy commercial 

i definitely have used “kenergy” and “kenough” and “kenbo” far too much today we saw it last night  

its honestly like you say an incredibly basic and mild movie philosophically and politically but extremely well done and fun which makes the “manosphere” and conservative media circus who are all coincidentally obsessed with being seen as erudite around this movie even more funny and i say this as a middle aged man that was far too serious about philosophy as a younger man and its a sad indictment of our culture that it is being treated as radical 

it’s not even as radical as star trek really",2023-08-04 23:36:04
that’s ok not everyone will,2023-07-24 07:45:49
"and just like that you’ve dethroned greta 
i don’t get why they showed the connection between what happens in barbie world with what happens in the real world if they weren’t going to play around with it more 
i had said to someone else the first half was good because it incorporated all these awesome ideas but then it was too hard to give each idea proper development so they skipped a lot of stuff",2023-07-25 00:18:19
yeah that would have been great but if they did that they wouldn’t have had the chance to beat you to death with how bad patriarchy is for an hour,2023-07-25 04:50:55
i can see that maybe they should’ve just been done with them when they left the real world if they weren’t going to properly add them to the storyline barbie got away and they never came for her ,2023-07-25 01:04:29
alright man kinda made that up considering i never said that but alright,2023-08-01 21:02:21
i think feminism is talked about a lot a lot why are people acting like it isnt,2023-08-01 22:02:27
" people digest movie’s differently so the monologue was very important 

youre implying that people are so  dumb they need to be literally told the message this might as well be a documentary or a lecture if this is your argument

it is not unnecessary to put this message into a movie 

i can tell youve never written a thing in your life one of the first things they tell you is not to be preachy let your message be natural theres nothing natural about grinding the movie to a halt to say something that we all already agree with the character might as well have looked at the camera saying this

like i’m sorry if feminism is annoying to you but personally i don’t think people talk about it enough

are you blind we are more hyper aware of gender and race than ever before in the history of human kind

like the reason you hear about it all the time is because nobody is actually listening to it or taking it seriously

the people who you should be trying to persuade are not going to be persuaded by a cringey embarassing monologue do you actually like being lectured to do you know how people work 

heres a life lesson people absolutely do not respond to be lectured to ironic im doing the same to you lol",2023-08-01 21:39:06
thats actually a good point,2023-08-02 21:40:54
it’s obviously there i don’t know what to tell you barbieland is a matriarchy and greta makes obviously ridiculous jokes about denying ken representation in its political structure there’s no way she actually thinks men shouldn’t have major political representation so everything that happens in barbieland is intended to be an imperfect system,2023-08-01 10:02:16
no but it’s true in the year 2023,2023-07-22 13:59:12

"tell me what do you think of the phrase black lives matter because the point of that is similar black people have it hard theyre being murdered in the streets by police thats a problem doesnt mean nonblack people dont ever have it hard doesnt mean those problems are not somewhat universal in every society in the moment were just trying to say hey can we do something about this that is seriously affecting the lives of black people

likewise women do share a lot of problems with men doesnt mean they cant talk about it doesnt mean them complaining about it from their womanly perspectives is wrong or self centered",2023-07-23 02:22:32
it starts there then its a problem for you and not for me in fact i see them all the same but that doesnt stop people from wanting to do something specific lol and well they are all separate the biggest minority there is is the individual,2023-07-23 00:14:03

the writing is made to sound like little girls playing with dolls,2023-07-24 15:06:49
i will have to agree to disagree even in leading roles women were often oversexualized and needed help from men in order to solve problems that’s just one example there are plenty others women are still fighting to be fully realized characters on screen yes there have been a lot of great female characters but there are far more problematic portrayals of women in film just because it’s gotten better over time doesn’t mean the problem doesn’t still exist,2023-07-24 22:40:59
again we’re going to have to disagree on this because you don’t believe that woman’s oppression is as serious as it historically has been there was a bitter undertone to the movie because we are bitter we don’t even have reproductive freedom in the us of course racial oppression is horrific but i don’t think you can discount the suffering of women just because you subjectively don’t think it’s as bad you do know that women in iraq are killed for showing their hair in public and that child marriage still takes place,2023-07-25 12:05:38

cool man i think everyone gets what your opinion is and yet you seem to find it hard that people’s opinion of that opinion is that’s it’s incredibly arrogant and self centered i’ve raised two 5 year olds at this point and while their stories can be pretty entertaining at times definitely wouldn’t come close to 2 hour movie filled with satirical commentary on todays sociopolitical issues the arrogance and hubris of your comment is the thing that is throwing others off not the fact that we don’t understand what you said,2023-07-21 16:17:03
dude i want some of what you are smoking if you honestly believe the barbie movie is the worst representation of men in media,2023-07-31 14:58:20
"there was a ruling class of nobility of the smallest portion of the population which held all the power who happened to be white in the west at least

they didnt happen to be white they were purposly only white in the us black people couldnt vote and were enslaved

the majority of these white men were poor peasants who lived under autocracies with little to no control over their daily lives

and so were black men but with the addition burden of their race

they did not have voting rights  there was no democracy

meanwhile black people were slaves 


in the us landless white males could not vote until somewhere in the 1840s

thats not oppression because of race and gender it was because you were landless if you got land you could vote the same could not be said about black people and women so yes you had more rights than them

both men and women have lacked power and control over their daily lives for centuries

men havent lacked power and control over their daily life for centuries because of their gender 

if there’s one take away i’d want you to have it’s that the majority of men did not hold power for a very long time until recently

again not because of their gender

 for most of these centuries you speak of men didn’t hold power and were mostly peasants trying to feed their families

meanwhile black people were enslaved and women were legally owned by their husbands",2023-07-22 21:18:29
"i don’t think they are the same but the movie doesn’t say incel does it i got the impression that all men are incels and that’s certainly not the case 

i think the movie had a chance to show that a man can only be strong because of a woman or without a strong woman men would be weaker or something along those lines they could have done that without being like “men are idiots” 
but whatever i’m a guy so my opinion on the movie is already “oh you’re just a sensitive incel” 
i agree with a lot of the themes in the movie just felt they were presented poorly 
so whatever guess my feelings are hurt guess i’ll go cry about it or something",2023-07-27 16:27:16
yes they did while some of the barbie’s became maids and other things many became housewives which the film explicitly stated as them “being programmed” or in other words bad while they didn’t diss it constantly they took quite a few swings at it,2023-07-22 04:01:41

"why give men in this fantasy land closure when women haven’t had it in the real world 

i think that it should have better closure and a bigger morality change because this movie should be a message for what our society is striving for not to emulate it in vengeance but be better overall",2023-07-23 22:12:37
"and thought the biggest genderbased issue the movie raised

i never said that ken being treated like a second class citizen was the biggest genderbased issue raised by the movie it was just one of the many problems and childlike attempts at genderbased issues presented by this movie 

 that’s worse than any treatment of women throughout history

the treatment of women throughout history was never its boys night every night men didnt really just exclude women for the sake of excluding women there were usually other reasons behind it men usually want women around even if just for the company and that wasnt really any different back then 

also because the movie literally acknowledges that “girls night forever” is a problematic statement in the end as well…

one passing comment of well maybe i was wrong i guess i wont do it as often anymore isnt really addressing it acknowledging a problem is a bit different from addressing it 

 because a man isn’t entitled to anything in a woman’s life without the woman’s consent even if they are dating 

why do you keep bringing this up its completely irrelevant to the topic at hand its like youre just repeating the same feminist catch phrases over and over hoping it will have some kind of meaning here it doesnt nothing that i discussed relates to entitlement and saying that men arent entitled to women when no one implied as such is not arguing in good faith either 

the vast vast vast majority of rapers of men are men and the vast majority of rapers of women are … spoiler alert men

you believe this because  against men is hardly ever reported and because when women  men it is also hardly ever considered  its very easy to argue that its mostly just men that  when the data is only really recorded under that scenario on a cultural and systematic level if would be like saying its mostly black people who are violent in a culture that only records and recognizes violence when its committed by black people and then uses onesided statistics it created to justify itself  most western countries still do not even use the word  when a female teacher rapes an underaged boy 

regardless the point remains that the existence of  is not a demonstration of systematic misogyny especially when it is criminalized and universally despised  i was also talking about violence not just  and men are far more likely to be targeted for violent crime in general and often in far more brutal ways

and that is what is so dangerous with movies like this it creates this really twisted hateful and false revision of history and then gullible women just buy into it and fall into it and use it as a way to justify their own prejudice and chauvinism against men its everything feminists accuse lonely men and incels of doing only worse because women already are in such a position of power and privilege this entire movie played out like if someone tried to approach the subject of gender issues with a very shallow understanding of those issues and only using sites like tiktok or twoxc as reference",2023-07-24 05:44:40

"you do if you want your argument to be taken seriously by anyone i was genuinely curious if you had an example of men in general being denied the ability to make decisions regarding a medical procedure bonus points for finding me a  specific medical procedure as abortion is 

seems like you cant 

your last point reeks of gotchaism but i will say if a trans man wants to have an abortion his prior biological female  is unfortunately whats keeping them from doing so",2023-07-22 23:41:47

i literally just told you  if men have something inside their body that they do not want they can have it removed  that does not apply to women who may have an unwanted pregnancy don’t act so ignorant when you know  well what restrictions are placed on women’s bodies,2023-07-22 23:06:50
"yeah well women need to realize their experience isnt anywhere near as dire as modern feminism wants them to believe  somewhere around 58 of college grads are women  most high school dropouts are men  90 of homeless people are men  military where people go to die is 90 men  men are victims of violent crime by far more than women   

by every metric men have it worse than women  the truth is no one gives a  about men and nearly every woman has someone that cares enough to help them out which is why they dont get as low as homeless men",2023-07-26 06:54:22
"that is very black and white thinking i sense youre angry and you view this movie as just another drop in the bucket without considering the nuances of character and story all feminist media is not manhating or misandry some may be but you cant paint the whole thing with the same brush if you see it that way i think thats showing you something about yourself that you arent interested in addressing

in the barbie movie ken reaches a healthy understanding of himself at the end he goes to one extreme then he realises he doesnt have to be an  to everyone and he doesnt need barbies attention to be worthy as a man how is that not favourable he thought he had to be a sexist pig in order to find his power and worth then he realised that its all  and found his own way of being that isnt dependent on whether a woman looks at him or not is that not empowering or are you fixated on the fact that men arent the ruling class in barbie land and that fact alone means men dont matter in this movie 

the message is

 other people dont get to define your worth
 you are more than your appearance and wealth
 you dont have to dominate and subjugate others in order to be a valid person worthy of love and affection
 if one gender holds another down and denies them equal participation its a bad thing thats why its satire
 sexism harms all genders
 its not black and white one or the other  that kind of thinking leads to problems that was barbies whole character arc and it was kens too  black and white thinking got them both in trouble

tbh im sensing a lot of anger about women in general fixated on feminism as some kind of evil thing feminism at its core is about equality not only civil rights legalities but about both men and women viewing and treating each other with respect we dont have equality when were harbouring anger hatred and resentment towards the other  in our hearts and minds

gender stereotypes dont help us move towards equality theyre harmful to everyone and keep us in boxes take the high suicide rate among men clearly there is a mental health crisis among men the gender stereotypes of men being expected to be stoic and solitary never crying or acknowledging let alone expressing a full range of emotion is literally killing men men  all over each other and call each other  or feminine for trying to form close friendships women often  all over men who dare cry or express vulnerable emotions saying they arent being manly clearly that version of masculinity is harming  not helping  men how can we be equal when were reinforcing these harmful stereotypes and policing everyones masculinity you get to decide for yourself what it means to be a worthy respectable man apart from all the hatred and vitriol and shame  what other people think

and ken went through that character arc in the movie he refused to let people see him crying because he said it was weak but he was miserable he had no sense of selfworth because he based it all on whether women gave him attention once he realised that he is enough just by being who he is he reached a resolution and found his own inner strength with his best bros whom he no longer saw as enemiescompetitors but as friends 

ken learned about patriarchy in the real world and brought it back into barbieland it looked ridiculous and terrible because patriarchy is ridiculous and terrible and satire is intended to point out the vices and moral failings of social systems like that matriarchy is ridiculous and terrible too the point at the end of the movie is not that theyre going to stay the same forever in barbieland but that both barbie herself and barbieland are at a point of transformation where they can find a new way forward that doesnt maintain the old status quo the movie ends with the implication that they still have work to do to move forward because where both societies are now is not perfect",2023-07-22 01:05:17
"the brand new barbiemovie tm dolls that we are all supposed to buy are very stick thin  not realistic same as old barbie i also noticed america f made a pointed effort not to be present with the cast when they did their pr playing with dolls time video segment and stated in the cut article that she was very uncomfortable with her character being made into a doll she sees the hypocrisy even the very progressive female author who interviewed america in the cut has a very “cutting” line lolol pun intended that the brand new barbiemovie america doll for 50 dollars is very much more svelter than real life america with a “blowout” hairstyle

this very progressive and contemporary female journalistreporter sees through the hypocritical hype machine after the movie says to be yourself be comfortable with yourself and yet america was not allowed by whom greta margot robbie the coproducer to …just say no to a doll depiction which america knew she would not be happy with but she had to play along pr wise

margot chose to get into bed with the all “evil” mattel ditto greta  both are women themselves with agency but also want to make lots and lots of money no matter what i’m not going to say america was taken advantage of either since she has agency and chose to accept the role  with all that would entail in order to make lots and lots of 

i do think though that margot and greta want to have everything both ways and do not want us pointing out any hypocrisy that selfidentifying progressive woman reporter for the cut calls it out why can’t anyone else",2023-07-24 01:19:47
well does not barbie get kicked out or does she leave of her own accord precisely for being imperfect flat feetcellulite by other women the men are not kicking her out or making her feel bad other women are aghastmocking her for not conforming to their perceived standards not those of the men,2023-07-24 00:31:45

but seeing the old woman and people of all ages in the park and meeting ruth and seeing sashamom interact i took to all be confrontations with agingdeath in small bits all along i didnt think it was weird that it ended that way especially since seeing ruth again telegraphs what the last convo is gonna be about

"dont get me wrong i agree the messaging overall was muddled at best also agree on the examples chosen to represent i guess toxic masculinity  especially so coming from greta gerwig given shes been very heavily pushing for this movie to be thinkpieced in every interview before it was even out not to mention the implication that women dont like sports etc as well

but the kenssupreme court thing at the end was relatively clear cut to me at least in terms of what the attempted messaging was",2023-07-21 15:11:28
"nah i am not upset at it all i happily paid money to see and enjoy it for as a fictional movie with my teenage daughter because thats what it was a silly movie and thats where it sits in my estimation

"a lot of the criticism from guys sounds like it is coming from incels i watched the movie with my girlfriend and we found it hilarious 

a lot of the behavior of the kens after they discovered patriarchy reminded my girlfriend and me of things i have totally done before explaining moviesmusic mounting big tvs etc",2023-11-13 22:12:26
i agree with this personally i like superhero movies most when they have something to say least when they are just cgi fights with nothing behind them i love watchmen i love guardians of the galaxy i adore super i dont give a  about black adam or aquaman or even endgame really,2023-11-30 21:21:46
"no of course you’re entitled to your opinion it just seems like you’re mad at a lot more than the barbie movie more about feminism in general  also this all started because you were hating on my interpretationopinion

i can understand why you’d be upset that the men are written like that if you don’t understand the metaphor and deeper meaning behind it

the barbies are written like that too btw when the patriarchy takes over they talk about how all they wanna do is serve the ken “brewskis” and not have to think which is how women used to be shown in television too… silly housewives obedient to their partners you don’t see women getting upset about the barbies flipping from feminist to complicit in 5 seconds because 1 it’s not personal 2 it’s all a metaphor and 3 the behaviors in the movie are exaggerated so that everyone can understand what’s going on no room for confusion when trying to dissect the deeper meanings of the movie 

i think it’s good that guys are  off about how the kens are treated because if you’re mad at how the kens are treated how long until you connect that with how women are treated in the real world it’s supposed to  some people off people who never would be able empathize with us otherwise you’re upset that the kens are shown as  accessories… so are you also upset about people like ben shapiro who literally make jokes about women like that 247 or movies and tv shows that hypersexualize women

i’m glad we could talk about this and i really hope you try watching the movie again maybe this time a little more open minded look past the way ken is written and think about the symbolism and what the writers might be trying to say or show",2023-07-26 05:16:42
"what are you talking about where did i say the point was to be emotionally mature because it appeals to women when i said “appeal” i didn’t mean that men sharing feelings would turn women on as if i thought that was the feminist idea  i meant that it would appeal to women to share feelings and cry etc  so feminist women think that doing that should appeal to men as a thing men should also want to do but mostly don’’s got nothing to do with being attractive to women 

my point was that what feminist women like bell hooks claim would be good for men is stuff that has always been normal to them as women and they think is good for them as women   so they’ve decided that the status quo for them sharing more feelings crying etc is the right way to be for men despite what men actually think or want they think they know best that’s the arrogance of that type of feminism of thinking it knows what’s best for a men even when most men don’t agree",2023-07-26 15:19:56
lol you have no idea what you’re talking about at all also kind of insulting to noah baumbach he’s an experienced writer this definitely reflects his perspective,2023-07-23 20:18:49
it almost gives the movie a darker and black mirroresque twist like these people you were rooting for the whole time end up being just as bad as the oppressors they fought against would have been kind of a cool moment for sasha or even stereotypical barbie to point this out and then have some kind of compromise between the barbies and kens instead it just kind of gets handwaved and i feel like its not only a major missed opportunity but takes away from the likeability of these characters weve been following the whole time,2023-07-23 18:02:43
she managed to convince the barbies that patriarchy was harmful but you think she couldnt convince them that an equally discriminatory institution was also wrong,2023-07-23 12:54:01
"the parameters are contrived that doesnt mean that competition in any and all its forms is artificial

part of human survival is competition be it against nature or each other sports are a diluted and filtered impression of that someone who is good at gymnastics may be better at climbing a tree to get fruit someone who is good and wrestling may be better at defending the tribe from wild animals or an invading tribe

and if a manifestation of competition takes the form of some contrived game with made up parameters its predictable that those who enjoy the game will find those who are more adept at it more exciting to watch",2023-07-22 17:19:24
"sport is inherently a way for men to express superiority over one another and especially women  
you described competition not patriarchy  women also compete among one another it is a human thing to feel envy  


and i see no men challenging women out to sports frequently it usually used to be a girl power type of move to push a message good or bad when matches of gender would occur because unless man was extremely cocky and old these matches almost always resulted in men winning due to the biological advantage and when people found it out that biological truth it stopped being pushed because it was going against the message that we are equal in all the ways  


and no competition is not artificial it is literally hard coded into us as animals nature is competition which makes me question if you had any idea about anything you are talking about  


a lot of animal species compete for partners attention so they can reproduce which is a literal biological goal so a species can thrive entire species compete for food and then herds packs of animals also compete for food and territory tribes of humans competed over resources and in fact still do long before we even created a concept of patriarchy when you think about it evolution itself is pretty much competition who is going to adapt better to fill in a niche in the foodchain first to manage to survive   


in short please read a biology book before you write anything on the internet about patriarchy",2023-07-22 17:54:29

yes,2023-07-23 07:14:10
because no one is being mocked,2023-07-23 15:42:46

" they were very much new things brought in by the kens when they awoke

based on what we see that politics exists they have tvs etc maybe i missed the “barbie has never seen the godfather” scene but i don’t think so  

they also make a point that they’re pretending to not get things ironically you’ve done what the kens were  doing and assumed the women don’t know anything they haven’t explicitly shown knowledge of to you",2023-07-30 20:25:03
another interpretation of the barbies final manipulation of the kens is that the barbies are using a tool that the patriarchy itself employs  in the real world pitting women against each other keeps them too distracted to demandwork for change,2023-07-30 18:56:48
yeah i think your giving it too much credit,2023-07-30 08:57:44
"did i literally not just say that in my previous comment it’s well established in the movie that being treated as less than due to your gender is hurtful and wrong and leads to all sorts of negative consequences for society 

my disappointment lies in the fact that the protagonists knowingly perpetuate this treatment because they enjoyed living in a society where they were the ones in power call me crazy but i believe that we should all be treated equally regardless of our gender or race or  orientation etc etc",2023-07-30 04:58:09
because they were used as himbo accessories thats the entire point of the joke,2023-08-03 03:25:59

they clearly don’t,2023-08-03 04:21:40
actually it hasn’t in those comedies men are mocked as much or more there is no comedy which shows all women as relatively dumb compared to males and also “toxic” it’s more comparable to an old racist cartoon than anything else in that way,2023-08-03 04:23:46
"there’s inherent violence because as long as you have laws and people who disobey those laws you’re going to need a way of enforcing the law  and that will always be violence i mean that’s what the law is  when the police come and arrest you they overpower you physically and then you are imprisoned and if you try to escape you’re again overpowered physically so that’s all violence the law is violence and the threat of violence it’s pretty simple

there will never be a utopia where no one commits crime or isnt unhappy enough to try to go against accepted law so you always need violence and because men are bigger and stronger you’ll always need their violence

if your asking which would be more or less violent between a matriarchy or patriarchy i think it’s kind of a pointless question as because a matriarchy would require male violence in order to enforce its laws on men it can’t really happen unless men collectively decide that women are better off in charge than they are which lets be real they won’t why would men in the long term enforce matriarchal laws they didn’t agree with on themselves so considering what a true matriarchy would be like for humans would just be a pointless fantasy which was actually totally impossible if you ever got too many women in power making laws to the point of approaching a matriarchal system which the majority of men didn’t agree with enough for them to want to do something about it there would just be an overthrow of the women’s power because men have the violence that’s needed to enforce law and women don’’s that simple it’s neither good or bad but that’s the way things are and have to be at least i can’t see any other possibility

so like i said it’s not really worth thinking about because true matriarchy is impossible for humans",2023-07-27 14:03:58
"…because that’s quite literally what happened to women

the entire point was that even though strides have been made…we have a loooong way to go",2023-07-23 11:40:59

"yeah they get the funny parts because they’re made a joke of  which would be fine if that happened to barbies as well in the same way that’s what’s unintentionally ironic about it because the kens and men are the butt of all the jokes and  characters kens patriarchy is easily the best part of the movie  whereas because the barbies are super perfect and competent and working together and the real world women are that as well as giving grand speeches  they’re just kinda boring 

i’m not harping on it for female empowerment  i’m harping on it for bashing men the entire time kens are the underclass in barbie land and kind of an avatar for women but that’s not so bad but then the real world patriarchy is super bad and the patriarchy of kens is bad and gets overthrown there’s mixed messaging in making the kens represent both women and the real world patriarchy if the barbieland matriarchy was shown as bad in the same light as the ken patriarchy and real world patriarchy the movie would make sense but as it’s not it just seems to push the message that women are better and men are incompetent morons literally every man in the movie is an idiot or an idiot villain even the real world husband of america derraras character 

again with mixed messaging  that the ending both seems to want to paint the barbie matriarchy as the real world patriarchy but worse in that they promise to listen to kens more but also makes them the hero’s of the story is weird on top of that goslings ken is also some kind of representative of real world men at this point  and apparently the message is that equality means men get to cry like ken or something lol er what",2023-07-21 14:55:24

"i think allan was a good male character he supported the barbie’s but also wanted his own independence he seemed to me to be the example of the men that are rejecteddon’t fit patriarchal standards he was different than the kens and seemed to be ignored because of it i found that interesting

also even though he didn’t have a lot of screen time america’s husband was depicted as just nice and normal lol 

there’s also the 2 reject kens i forget their names but i think one has an earring lol who are in weird barbie’s house i think they were rejected by the patriarchykens too as a point",2023-07-25 03:31:57
" every man and ken in the movie is a  and doing bad things

the kens were never evil  just like the barbies they heard about something called patriarchy with only a surface level understanding brought back from the real world and it acted like a virus resulting in both barbies and kens acting like they thought they were expected to act in a patriarchy 

a major point in the movie is that men are also subjected to conflicting expectations that can wreck them too

for example ken feeling like he was defined by things he owned or by the partner he was with or ken feeling like it wasnt okay to let out his emotions or feeling like he had to be a leader since he was a man  even if he didnt really want to lead 

or how it turned out the ceo was genuinely all about female empowerment over profits despite all the earlier jokes implying an old rich guy caring about women yeah right or the ceo wanting to hug people more  all positive examples of men breaking out of conflicting societal expectations placed on them

i think a lot of women are reading into this a positive message for both genders whereas a lot of men can sense the overall bitterness against men in the movie

as a beared guy in my 30s i absolutely did not feel bitterness towards men from this movie theres definitely shade thrown towards a certain type but i definitely did not get a generalized men bad women good vibe from the movie",2023-07-25 05:05:12

maybe this hasnt happened that often to you but ive worked under so many blatantly incompetent and clownish yet somehow ivyleage schooled executives that i had to start wondering why the  it was always men i was having this problem with not like every woman boss i had was competent but it just kept happening again and again with stereotypical ivy league men

"i dont have a problem with making a group dumb or act stereotypicaly for the sake of humor  it has been done and masterfully  many times especially when two different groups interact  each other  everything and everyone is a fair game for humor  all that matters is how artistically you do it  

allow me to draw a comparison  in hobbit trilogy the dwarves are  dumb  unhygienic  aggressive  and have deep mistrust towards elves  the movie uses all of these traits beautifully for humor   

but at no point you feel like elves are superior than dwarves  bcz when they both interact  their banter is balanced as both parties jab at each others faults and the director is not using it to show which race is superior  his motives are pure comedy and it results in quality humor  

its not about male vs female   i would have retched  similarly at the directors talent if the entirety of  female gender were portrayed this dumb and were mocked about things they enjoy  imagine a blockbuster movie making fun of women gushing over twilight  really mf  that is your humor and talent level  i am just baffled about why are people defending and celebrating  these poor creative choices ",2023-07-23 07:24:41

the movie demonized a huge number of benign activities as manifestations of toxic masculinity  the patriarchy like watching action movies exercising and horses like  how is liking horses toxic all of these traditionally masculine activities are being construed as guilty by association as if men oppress women so anything men like is also oppressive and bad  
  
the message seems to be dont follow culture just be yourself but if youre a man and you like anything stereotypically associated with masculinity this is by default toxic and bad so it doesnt leave men with any clues or any direction except a nebulous sentiment that you shouldnt do anything unless barbie approves of it which actually is misandrist  
  
the film seems to embrace the men are defective women trope which is definitionally misandrist  
  
then theres the fact that every single man in the entire film without exception was portrayed as inherently dumb morally weak and some combination of crudely sexist proudly selfish and joyously oppressive  
  
there wasnt a single positive male role model in the entire movie and no hint of a suggestion of what positive healthy masculinity looks like beyond femininity with a

the point which the narrator literally states is that barbieland will eventually become as equal as the real world so if you believe we’ve already achieved equality then you should see it as a good ending for the kens and if you see that as a bad ending why aren’t you doing more to combat or atleast complain about the real inequalities in the world instead of griping about barbieland,2023-07-31 14:02:27

when the barbies are sustaining a matriarchy there is no introspection as to why thats a problem it seems the writers couldnt even face having women be the bad guys when they were representing men which is just weird

the movie tells us that the matriarchy is an innocent mistake but when kens patriarchy takes over its presented as an intentional and malicious thing where the women have to be literally brainwashed to go along with it

the whole thing of calling men who don’t agree with you emotionally fragile is so passé and transparent  it’s basically the progressive or feminist equivalent of calling a man a girly man or a weak man as an insult and is used as such except when your a feminist or progressive you can’t say that as it goes against your ideology in which men are supposed to be allowed to be weak or feminine  so you say fragile in a condescending way how very ironic that those who are supposedly all about letting men be weak and sensitive try to insult them using terms like fragile and don’t pretend it wasn’t meant as an insult because we both know better 

and that’s the attitude i see in barbie as well which is very bigoted you take all the ribbing you want and never advocate for yourself if that makes you feel strong and not fragile but then again if your a feminist ally man shouldn’t you be allowing yourself to be fragile like the barbie movie said men could be what a conundrum must be weak enough to cry but also take insults without complaint to prove your not fragile the contradictions the feminist man lives with ironic stuff",2023-08-06 18:53:06

yes  and women hate being told they’re too sensitive

it wasn’t cool at all it was lame it was just a very obvious “barbie doesn’t need a man and ken needs to find himself”  it would have been more shocking in a feminist film if barbie and ken actually ended up together you know like they’re actually bloody designed to be for the past 60 years

about what the sequence of events or my understanding of the joke i no longer care about the joke i made that clear already,2023-07-23 18:56:04
happily i like the movie,2023-07-23 23:59:45
"interesting interpretation 

i actually got something else out of that scene the kens end up where real world women ended up when they first started to get some semblance of representation

the narrator straight up says “maybe one day the kens can have the same amount of power women have in the real world” it’s purposefully left back to the status quo with a minor improvement because it’s parodying the real world

i think this is a flaw of the movie in that it spends its time before that scene providing a serious solution to the problem it spent the runtime explaining only to switch it up where it matters and instead parodying the real world bit of a whiplash and leaves it open to misinterpretation",2023-08-02 07:02:27
i expected more for that bit too they do start giving the kens minor roles in government and tell them to work their way up though so i think they acknowledged it enough,2023-08-02 00:39:25
i’m glad you used it as a learning opportunity rather than doubling down on the default toxicity good on you for improving and reflecting ,2023-07-25 00:48:08
well they are supposed to be dolls so its fine imo when the barbies are just jobholders it of course yes gets messy later when the movie is trying to make a social statement,2023-07-31 17:26:35
i think part of the joke is that their highlevel knowledge is honestly pretty remedial the godfather thing for example was no more highlevel than the throwaway joke in family guy when peter says he doesnt like the godfather,2023-08-08 18:54:39
yeah it was kind of funny  she knows im really into oppenheimer and physics in general so throughout the first act i kept giving her tidbits on fun facts during the manhattan project  then when the godfather scene showed up i just kind of slowly turned to her and see her completely losing it lol,2023-07-23 12:37:42

woman hi im the author of this book thanks for coming to my release party

man so the thriller genre revolves around scary or unsettling events and the protagonist has to figure out how to survive or overcome whatevers happening to them

woman im the author i know the thriller genre i write thrillers

man ignores her i once read a thriller by stephen king years ago have you heard of him hes quite well known anyway continues blabbering on about thrillers

totally agree the only reason i’m more hesitant on him than i am with margot is just because like 15 dudes just gave amazing dramatic supporting performances in oppy but hopefully if it’s like 3 oppy and leo for flower moon then that final nom will go to ryan i could see any oppy noms cancelling each other out like i think lead dramatic male will wsuccession at the emmy’s it’s just difficult to compete against dramatic performance ex even if you’re giving the funniest one of the decade it’s also really hard to beat leo if jesse plemmons really is lead in this and leo is supporting i’m convinced  win that category tbh deserved or not,2023-07-26 00:35:26
"the rest of the movie does a great job at pointing out the injustices of the patriarchy so that’s already well established at this point the movie’s addressing what the characters learned from both the injustices of the real world patriarchy and the barbie matriarchy and how to better things going forward

having the barbies decide to just reinstall the matriarchy while giving kens a bit more agency which equates to what women had irl about 40 years ago the movie’s lesson goes from “patriarchy bad” to “power corrupts” which i’d say misses the feminist angle they were going for

men had power in real world created an unfair patriarchy barbies had power in barbieland created an unfair matriarchy kens seized power in barbieland created an unfair patriarchy barbies learned the faults of both sides regained power in barbieland and … created an unfair matriarchy again",2023-07-31 16:40:56
"i am late to the thread but i dont see how people are confused by this the whole point of that scene is that progress doesnt happen immediately just because people recognize that there is a problem 

it directly parallels the realworld presumably if you asked many of the barbies they would say things like kens have always been happy with jobs like beach or surfer going against that is destroying traditional barbieland values or kens dont have the right cooperative spirit to take leadership roles

you hit the nail on the head if someone thinks it is wrong that the kens are still treated poorly they should focus on what is happening in the realworld",2023-08-22 23:32:43

agree on all and no hard feelings was my favorite film of the year i loved it soo much but i think it suffered from a bad title  bad prerelease press about the premise love seeing these female producers nailing it,2023-07-24 11:40:12
i dont disagree but the people who do that arent worth listening to,2023-07-25 10:33:33
i love the idea that michael cera always plays the exact same character except in the movie where he played himself this is the end,2023-07-24 16:10:25
i just don’t like how the matriarchal barbieland was portrayed as a perfect utopia and the patriarchal real world portrayed as horrible when both are just as bad the movie should’ve ended with the barbies apologising to the kens for treating them unfairly and giving them their own houses and proper jobs,2023-07-25 05:41:31

because he wasnt a  communist he was an anarchist and fought for the anarchists in spain and then watched as successful anarchist communes were butchered as the marxist leninists turned on them per orders from moscow he was a radical leftist anarchist who saw 40s communism as nothing more then soviet hierarchical dictatorship which it was,2023-09-15 05:17:08

"ostracising and exiling people for doing things outside the norm isn’t fascism

opposing the authoritarian president barbie might be but that’s not why she was and outcast she was only on the outside because they thought she was weird not because she opposed president barbie’s dictatorship also is she truly ostracised if people turn to her to fix things dr barbie literally sent margot barbie to weird barbie they’ve just socially ostracised her not in the same way a fascist would at all no barbie is not a fascist and there’s nothing that can claim otherwise 

i agree though that sasha used the word incorrectly though

what do you consider to be a fascist i think we disagree because we have different understandings of the word",2023-08-11 14:07:03

"the point was that its possible to grow and change even as victims of society because people do it all the time and then gave examples a complete thought not sure why it was so hard for you to follow 

i dont think i escaped anything i am saying your premise isnt true in the first place 

if what you think is true why are there so many  poor weak men in successful and happy lives with beautiful wonderful women what are they doing that you arent think about it 

the fact that you can even say the phrase access to women non ironically is horrendous and monstrous all on its own my guy of course no women want anything to do with you you view them as commodities and not fully formed people if you desire access to women so badly maybe figure out what they actually want first instead of just inventing what you think they want and then getting mad about it 

ill give you a hint you can start by removing access to women from your vocabulary they dont like things like that 

and i will say it again if a woman actually likes you they will never care about any of the things that you think they do they only latch onto the surface level things when there is nothing else deeper to connect to

as a fun side note we absolutely know elon is lonely and unhappy because literally every single thing he does and says is due to that 

does a well adjusted happy person lie about someone trying to  him and blame it on an airplane tracker when it turned out it literally had nothing to do with elon at all and was just a creepy grimes stalker that he never actually helped her with even though he claims to love her not usually does a well adjusted happy person cosplay as a perverted 5 year old on a social media network they got forced into buying after a failed pump and dump scheme i dont think its particularly common",2023-07-23 08:56:34
"i mean im confused obviously society can contribute to negative self worth but thats not helpful on an individual level saying you feel bad because you live in a capitalist hellscape get used to it“ while potentially true seems equally useless as what you seem to think the other commenter is saying 

finally obviously if someone is suffering to an extent where basic survival needs take up most of their energy thats an entirely different situation to the sort of incel personality that is being discussed nobody is saying oh you and your children are starving just find self worth elsewhere“ and i feel like your suggestion that extreme poverty and living in homelessness is a counter example is insane obviously the first steps are to do whatever you can to survive mental health can only come after physical safety and some level of security 

i think that the suggestion is that for people who are physically safe secure have basic needs met and arent worried about being unhoused etc these are the people with the luxury of working on changing their mindset“ its absolutely a valid solution to some issues but were not saying it is some panacea that solves real and physical dangers my ",2023-07-21 14:25:14
"i wasnt making an assumption i was agreeing with you you said yourself its hard to not include unhealthy external factors in your sense of self worth those are the mistakes im talking about 

i was homeless for  sake my mother who i hug and love in the previous comment abandoned me for an  man who abused her and just left me alone and we didnt even begin to repair it until he had died all of my struggles and the work she and i both had to do repairing that relationship is a major factor in my attitude to you and him about this whole thing you are not getting my points at all and you should just exit the situation because i wasnt talking to you and you arent understanding any of it anyway

this isnt the suffering olympics

this isnt about boot straps this isnt about being social creatures its about understanding that you can work towards having better and healthier ways to create that self worth than how often women are willing to  you your  social status and your bank account and the only person  that can find those healthier sources of self worth is yourself because thats what self worth even is its the value that you see in yourself you are completely misreading this entire situation and i will not be responding to you any longer",2023-07-21 11:20:17

but i would refer you to the wikipedia again because you seem to be approaching it onesidedly   yes feminism understands the various ways women are coerced and oppressed under a patriarchal society but feminism is also about the oppression and inequities experienced by men and other genders under patriarchy  you can see feminists are upset that women are forced into domestic roles and thats certainly true but you seem to ignore that feminists are likewise upset that men are drafted into the military or forced to work dangerous jobs  

feminism correctly identifies the problem as patriarchy and sometimes capitalism  feminism does not blame men though  men are victims too",2023-08-11 18:14:38

actually ken has always had jobs in the toy line they actually brought out president ken and first lady barbie doctor ken and nurse barbie and pilot ken and flight attendant barbie before barbie was president doctor or pilot don’t know if she’s ever been pilot yo say ken hasn’t had jobs is just spin for the movie the reality is ken was often made with the “man” job and barbie with the “woman” job as a pair when they made kens,2023-08-01 04:09:56

and you have a point perhaps as shown in the movie barbieland is still just a relatively quick trip away from venice beach i mean its not like the undying lands in lotr where theres no turning back forever and ever virtually infinite pros for what cons

still she did want to go out living in the real world either for her own growth or selflessly for the others im unsure and i didnt really think there was that much to explain considering all the other media that already covered more or less the same dilemmas about freedom free will the human condition and so on and so forth if that still didnt satisfy you as a logical incharacter reasoning then maybe just pretend shes supposed to be an allegory for the spectator

no i’m not saying the kens overall portrayal isn’t analogous to real world women i’m saying goslings ken getting to find himself and cry etc  isn’t meant to represent “weak  feminism” it’s meant to represent how men will be free to cry and know themselves once they drop the “toxic” masculinity and “patriarchy” is gone it’s actually supposed to be a happy ending for him this is kind of a big thing with “feminism is good for men” style feminists like gerwig and she talked about it in the lead up interviews to the movie,2023-08-01 10:10:49

the problem is a movie literally portraying an entire gender as morons doing bad things it’s not that the men aren’t fully realised or whatever  it’s that it’s obviously bitter toward them and intentionally portraying them badly",2023-07-25 05:44:40
"what i meant by womens “oppression” not being as bad as racial oppression was in reference to what you were saying about women being “oppressed” for hundreds of years i’m not saying every culture today treats women right or tragic things don’t happen to women on account of their gender

i’m saying that there’s a difference between some happy farmers wife or landlady hundreds of years ago before women even showed the slightest inclination of wanting to step outside of traditional gender roles and someone who is enslaved because of their race or had their country invaded by a different race one is truly opressed   the other isn’t oppressed at all she’s simply in a gender role as all people were at the time and they didn’t think anything else was even possible

how can i think a woman in medieval times in europe is oppressed when neither she nor her husband nor anyone else in the world has ever conceived of a world without standard gender roles that world was really only practically possible after the industrial revolution which explains why no one considered it women living then weren’t all being oppressed just because they’re doing a gender role and more than male chimps are oppressing female chimps they’re just both following animal instinct and that’s why they had different gender roles back then

and i don’t think a barbie movie which will be seen by kids and young teens is the right place for a bitter undertone for a gender battle or that anything good will come of it",2023-07-25 13:05:57
"i haven’t seen ladybird most of her other movies are more female focused so it’s probably not as apparent ironic that the barbie movie isn’t as female focused as them but there is something in little women i recall where jo kind of poo poo’s professor bhauers advice for her writing which she asked for and that’s not something which is in the book in the book she respects his advice it seemed to be that she couldn’t bring herself to write a female character actually being instructed by a male character and appreciating it  even though he’s literally her teacher and she asked for his advice 
i get why she changed the ending to have jo not marry bhauer but throughout the movie she really makes his character much less than what it is in the book and for no apparent reason

it’s not that she’s obviously making a  bad point about men or anything if you’ve only seen the movie of little women but when you realise how the jo and bhauer relationship has been subtlety changed from the book to movie it’s hard to see any motivation for the changes other than wanting to show that jo didn’t need a man’s help

i think she does have some more positive portrayals of men but they are usually less stereotypical and more feminine men more like those timothy chalet plays in her other movies which is more in line with the less masculine allan being not as bad as the kens",2023-07-27 12:10:14
"it easily is as far a movie that is seeking to portray and comment on their entire gender i mean obviously silence of the lambs or something has a worse representation of a man but a movie like that isn’t looking to use that character as a comment on the entire state of the male gender

the only other movie i can think of were many men are portrayed quite badly as a comment on gender is thelma and louise  but i wouldn’t say that was man hating at all because they still have normal male characters they don’t make random male diner owners or cops into moronic villains barbie does even men like gloria’s husband are mocked for zero narrative reason",2023-07-31 15:05:47

for voting being restricted to landowners is oppression oppression is not defined by race or gender it is one group over another also getting land back then is not as easy as you make it out to be

also the men are not the villains  theyre the antagonists sure  theyre not villains though  and thats fully acknowledged at the end  the kens overcorrected and barbie admits to the mistakes she made without ever trying to justify the kens actions so they can both live happily and harmoniously without there having to be a shadowed minority

the only way they could have conveyed a bigger morality change would have been with a large jump forward in time but even then … why would they that gives society the benefit of the doubt that these issues will be solved when in reality there is no current end in sight for women’s issues even if there is continual progression in this regard",2023-07-23 22:59:40

"i am just going to leave this here



you are correct that i am upset but this in no way makes my comments less meaningful or on the spot

the way you treated my response is precisely why i am upset you are talking down to me precisely like the movie talked down to men especially

x200b

men  all over each other and call each other  or feminine for trying to form close friendships

x200b

which is sexist and not correct at all 

and you think that i did not catch all of the intended messages 

but that does not change the fact that barbie was the one that transcended to the real world ken had a basic redemption and empowering arc while barbie was the one who straight up evolved into something else entirely and this is enough to tell you what greta thinks of men capabilities 

but then we got all of the wonderful portrayals of men via the various kens their weakness their pride and ego of course  how original you go to the real world  not a single man worth mentioning barbie is assaulted immediately after entering  how lovely was there a single man in the whole movie that had dignifying portrayal or women think the simpleminded kens are the peak of what men can be 

i especially liked how barbies stuck together while the downfall of kens was that they were put against each other which brings me back to this shallow piece of insight  


men  all over each other and call each other  or feminine for trying to form close friendships

in my experience it was men that formed the strongest of bonds between each other me and my friends can say what we want to each other we can be openly angry with each other can share intimate moments and help each other with basically anything women in my life always had to be other people around their girlfriends  relatives  colleagues and if for some reason one of the gals stood out the others would isolate her from the group quickly i have been witness to this so much in my personal and my work life so much jealousy and so much gossiping my wife works from home and i hear everything then she can not say where we have been to her friends because they shunned her a lot in the past for even mentioning something foreign but  people are not everyone right 

guess what everybody is  and this is where we men excel  we do not pretend to be something which we are not  i can tell you that men are going to love the kens and will connect with them not giving a  about how we are portrayed in the movie this thread is a proof  ryan gosling received so many praises watch reviews of the movie from men  it receives appraisal from everywhere we are the ones who are going to be open about new experiences about harsher words of wisdom about rejections about living our own life without caring about what other people think when it does not matter we are  and we accept other people to be  as well

it is women who misunderstand us and try to change us to something we are not if ken remained oblivious to the patriarchy and still supported barbie all throughout the movie i would have been the happiest man because this is what i know to be true we no longer crave power we do not want to metamorphose to something which we are not and we do not need the approval of someone that doubt herself every second give us the toy we like and we are going to be the most satisfied people in the world it is women who will always want more from us and not the other way around 

but if you are going to be talking about equality about how graciously you portray us and how barbie is for everybody at least have the balls to walk the line and have us at the front row with you do not portray us as this misguided codependent airheads that are going to be seduced by power the second they see it and women have to fix us

"well it was that to me maybe not to you but everyone interprets things differently especially in a complex movie like this  and as a woman in my mid to late 20s i needed to be reminded of some of the messages in this film i have been struggling with looking different and aging and this movie was a friendly reminder of how i don’t need to look perfect i’m fine the way i am

i think many of the things they said went over my head and only after thinking about the movie after seeing it i have discovered more underlying meanings i also believe that what you get from the film depends on your life my best friend doesn’t work totally fine btw i wish i didn’t have to lol she never experienced being in a mostly male school or work environment and her direct family doesn’t seem to have any toxic males in it so i don’t think this movie would resonate the same for her",2023-08-04 00:19:27

"as i said excusing writing the men as all morons as a metaphor or satire is just a lame excuse if a man wrote all the women in a movie like that and then was like “so what it’s a metaphor you just don’t get it” it wouldn’t fly and neither should this i don’t not like the movie because i don’t get it  i understand the attempted symbolism but because of the overall portrayal of men in the movie that is lost under the man hating vibe of the whole thing

no women didn’t used to be shown as silly housewives subservient to their partners  yes some female characters were housewives but they could still be good or clever they’re not all portrayed as morons at all i wonder if you’ve seen many old movies to think that was the way way were portrayed often

it’s not about guys being  off  how the kens are treated i think most people with a brain understood they were a real world reverse of women although they also represent patriarchy which is why there’s some mixed messages that conflict  it’s about how all men including the real world men and kens are portrayed if kens were treated bad but the barbie land matriachy was portrayed more clearly villainous like the real world patriachy or kendom you would have a point but it’s not at all it’s competent and smart and doesn’t explore faults of the women at all in contrast the real world and kendom is full of  incompetent men and is all about what’s wrong with men if you make the movie that way then obviously it’s going to suggest that men are idiots and women do a better job running things how could it not
so the message getting out to a lot of guys isn’t empathise with women more it’s wow these feminists really don’t like men or anything about them

also hyper sexualising women isn’t the same thing at all you may not like it but it’s not the same the women’s equivalent of that is all those romance stories like jane austen or 50 shades with some broody rich guy or those teen girl stories with broody fantasy vampires or whatever those are just the different  fantasies of men and women it’s not comparable to portraying an entire gender as morons in the wrong and i don’t know who ben shapiro is sure some guy somewhere might make jokes about women  but if that’s wrong then why is this right and don’t tell me because it’s satirising that that a lame cope",2023-07-26 08:00:19
"what ken did in the real world would at best get him charged with breaking and entering trespassing maybe even fraud at worst it would get him charged with insurrection because barbie hurt his feelings ken would have at the hands of the united states federal government probably spent the rest of his life in jail meanwhile gerwig presents a different reality where this man is basically told to do some soul searching and find a therapist

if ken behaved in a way that aligned with what hooks taught there would have been no conflict no movie ken would have said the  is this  i want someone who appreciates me and he would have left he would have displayed emotional maturity

does your country conscript women as well as men or is it just men being sent off to die",2023-07-21 17:46:17
no one the point is they wouldnt be upset if they had done the minimal amount of research about the film and not taken their children you wouldnt have been disappointed the film didnt meet your expectations if you had informed yourself on the type of movie it would be you all can be upset all you want but the only person you have to blame is yourself,2023-07-29 22:20:48
"and was that good should we repeat it on men and maybe then they can get mad and start writing women that way 

but regardless the point was there are few movies were literally every female member of a large cast is negatively portrayed as a   yeah sure individual female characters  but not every single one that’s the difference like why is the dad of the teenager in this randomly a  who is mocked
that’s where the bitterness toward men is coming out in the writing",2023-07-23 15:18:53
"again i have to question your use of the word always 

female characters like this were common 40 50 60 years ago female leads have been increasingly common for decades and in the last 5 years things have gotten close to being equal

it seems like this is a topic where things have been changing significantly so when you say always i suspect you may be referring to anachronisms that arent accurate reflections of modern society",2023-07-23 10:31:20
"except that’s not true how was judy garland in the wizard of oz supporting male characters how are the multiple jane austen movies doing that romantic comedies movies starring women of all kinds marilyn monroe and grace kelly vehicles

and what’s more this portrays all men as idiots  women as a whole gender were never portrayed that way",2023-07-23 14:44:21
well that was just a creative choice on the directors part they had to include a small variety of stuff to represent modern masculinity as ken saw it in the real world and naturally some things had to be left out,2023-07-23 16:04:01
"but its not though

in the real world he goes and reads a psychology textbook literally titled the patriarchy

yep that’s the point  most men  barbie movie in a nutshell,2023-07-25 05:07:04
what i said happens in the end of the movie,2023-09-06 04:35:51
of course it doesn’ says something negative about the male characters who do it the  in once upon a time in america isn’t done to make the woman look bad it makes de niros character look bad and then the cabbie won’t take his tip it’s not celebrated as some heroic man doing a good thing,2023-07-24 18:40:29
americas husband is shown as a fool and mocked,2023-07-25 06:26:23
yeah allen was honestly my favorite character he didnt want to really fit into barbieland or kendom hes got his own thing and he owns it,2023-07-25 05:35:29
"the depiction of the barbie matriarchy is far more positive than the kendom or real world patriarchy  you can’t seriously deny that i never said the kens were evil  i said they and the men were all shown as morons doing something wrong

yes i get that the movie tries to portray the feminist talking point that men are hurt by patriarchy because they actually secretly want to cry and find themselves and don’t really like the things they seem to like  but it’s just that a feminist talking point  95 of men don’t feel that way at all

the reality is that the real world women battling patriarchy are shown as heroic and the barbies battling kendom are the ones we’re supposed to be rooting for  whereas ken is shown negatively even when pushing back on matriarchy as embodying “toxic” qualities 

the movie doesn’t explore anything fundementally wrong with the barbie matriarchy unique to women other than kens having no place  apart from that the barbies are all wonderful and competent  but when the kens take over they’re toxic and bad etc the kens interests are mocked whereas the barbies dance parties and whatever are shown positively

actually i think the barbie matriarchy ending is actually the embodiment of a lot of feminist talking points  women should have more power and make great leaders and when patriarchy is overthrown men will be able to cry and won’t have to lead and that somehow means equality meanwhile the majority of men don’t want to do any of the things feminism claims patriarchy is holding them back from doing so i would say the movie is gerwigs vision of feminist ideology rather than a depiction of reality",2023-07-25 06:33:55
"i totally hear you this is the kind of movie that works with a certain level of expectations going into it i guess since greta gerwig directed it and wrote it i thought it might be like her other movies and it doesnt help that the movie is being twinned with oppenheimer

ill watch it again with a different mindset going in i will admit there were two women talking loudly throughout the movie that may have hindered my experience and forced me to be overly critical",2023-08-01 01:26:53
they hate men   thats not the message i got  in fact it tells a very heartwarming story about how the barbies were wrong for making kens live in their shadows and that kens can and should exist as their own beings not just accessories,2023-07-22 16:41:40
"i did not say the issue was making women uncomfortable

the main demographic for barbie is girls 6  10  some boys enjoy playing with barbie too and it has inspired elements of the  and trans community and good for them but this is a tiny tiny percentage of sales the best barbie film i have ever seen is  cult director tod hainess superstar the karen carpenter story but that certainly isnt a kids film lol,2023-07-22 12:18:14

the guys you talk to don’t happen to be in your gender studies class do they",2023-07-29 19:03:52
one line proves nothing i’m not denying that men have written bad female characters and had male characters be mean to them i’m saying there are very few movies if any which so denigrate every single member of a large cast of the opposite  as either an idiot or an idiot villain like barbie that it does it in a “light” tone doesn’t change that it does it,2023-07-23 07:52:18
"misandric

do you know anything about bell hooks she was a voice within feminism pushing back against the antimen sentiment that does exist her take on the subject matter comes from a place of love for men

to create loving men we must love males loving maleness is different from praising and rewarding males for living up to sexistdefined notions of male identity caring about men because of what they do for us is not the same as loving males for simply being when we love maleness we extend our love whether males are performing or not performance is different from simply being in patriarchal culture males are not allowed simply to be who they are and to glory in their unique identity their value is always determined by what they do in an antipatriarchal culture males do not have to prove their value and worth they know from birth that simply being gives them value the right to be cherished and loved",2023-07-24 19:19:17
no she wasnt created to become a real life person but barbie wanted to become a real life person because her character grew and ruth then agreed to her becoming a real life person the end,2023-08-06 18:35:10
i agree with what you’re saying with the caveat of thinking the movie could have also had ken try to discover himself in a way beyond just saying “ken is ken” but that’s not the point of the film and that’s alright,2023-07-22 04:46:10
"this is so funny to be obsessed with wanting to debate when you have like two men in the movie besides ken himself who is seen as a positive figure to people at points or are you gonna say that gloria’s husband learning spanish was also a stab at men being 

don’t actually reply to this unless you want to like talk to me personally or something blush",2023-07-23 08:48:44

"i think the draft should be canceled for everybody along with genital mutilation regardless of gender yay we agree s

there are other factors in the wage gap issue that you missed women are more likely to have gaps in their resume due to raising a child or taking care of a family member and our current society penalizes resume gaps regardless of cause women also face barriers getting an education its actually easier for a guy to get into college than a woman with the same test scores despite women making up 60 of college students also a strict jobtojob comparison breaks down in highly gendered industries like nursing and teaching pink collar jobs have lower startingmedian wages across the board compared to maledominated industries even though wages within those categories appear equal

"uhhh dude a lot of people are born into those communities and either don’t have enough money to leave or feel like they can’t socially since their entire family and friends while excommunicate them 

also the draft we can agree sucks but it will most likely never be a thing that happens again not with the advancement of technology i mean sure we can change it if that’s what you want but realistically we will never see people be drafted again 

also your argument do men have it better isn’t the question it shouldn’t be “who has it better” it should be who is being treated unfairly and how and that answer doesn’t have to be only men or women it can be both 

also your wife is not the only woman in the world and us women do not have a collective mind or collective experience someone not knowing of that could be because of poverty or lack of education where they were act i mean i know men who didn’t know women got their period every month you would be confused if i used that as a staple for all men’s experiences yes",2023-07-23 07:55:26

"it’s not us vs them i’m just pointing out that the idea that men should cry more and talk about feelings isn’t coming from most men so it makes little logical sense to conclude it’s something most men want or need i’m pointing out it’s largely coming from feminist women is it not

it is true like i said “to different extents” if they don’t feel like they need to do it much then cool for them",2023-08-02 04:05:57
"feminist women didnt decide that

"the kens were never truely “oppressed” in barbieland they chose to fight for barbies attention and at no point did barbie force them to work or be their slaves nor is it implied that they ever tried to fight for more rights similiar to how little girls didn’t care to play with ken they only wanted to play with barbie and ken was just an accessory

the barbies took back their land when the kens had stolen destroyed tried to change the constitution and made them all their slaves and you think that’s just as bad as what the ken’s do the barbies acknowledge at the end that things have to change and apologise to ken that she took him for granted and give them the opportunity to start working for their respect and to build their own identities

so we “cheer” when the women do it because it’s acknowledging the errors that they have made and moving forward",2023-07-28 22:45:50

there werent any answers true equality wasnt even shown at the end of the barbie movie its left open ended 

never in my  life would i hear someone say gotg 3 is more real than a barbie movie which satirizies the real world itself james gunn is a  beast of a director but none of his films do not give comment of our society no one is going to remember gotg 3 for its animal cruelty messages it cant even compete its animal cruelty themes to the likes of okja or water horse",2023-08-24 22:15:47
"ruth handler said “my whole philosophy of barbie was that through the doll the little girl could be anything she wanted to be barbie always represented the fact that a woman has choices” handler specifically made the decision to keep barbie single because at the time barbie was made women’s primary goal was marriage she wanted to show them that women could make choices including the choice not to marry and have kids 

i’ll admit keeping barbie single probably kept it more interesting  watching a movie with a “willtheywon’tthey” plot is certainly more interesting than watching a movie where the characters are happily married i agree that keeping barbie unmarried probably sold more dolls  though like you said the common perception is that ken and barbie have always been together

but it is simply incorrect to assert “people think that barbie and ken are gf and bf and therefore the movie should have depicted them as such” the movie used the barbie lore correctly not knowing the lore is not a valid argument for why ken and barbie should have gotten together

"yeah totally they do but they also suffer from other issues that intertwine and affect and worsen them thats what intersectionality is and an explicitly feminist film in 2023 that isnt intersectional and only pays lip service to diversity through casting isnt one thats doing anything particularly good

like the struggles i have as a guy are inextricably intertwined with being trans i cant talk about one without also talking about the other unless im talking shallowly

and its fine to talk about things shallowly but the film is coming from a place where its clear they arent purely aiming for fun shallowness and if youre trying to make a work of art that says something about politics there are added responsibilities and nuances if the film was just a fun shallow romp i wouldnt have the issues with it that i have

except youre ignoring the parts where i very plainly lay out my argument of what the movie is trying to do male fragility is a thing  especially from straight men to be the dominant force in society and get upset when an oppressed group airs their grievances in a frothy summer movie as an attack on you is pretty weak,2023-08-06 20:14:59
nah i’m not going to because you’re already decided  chud,2023-08-07 12:01:04
"you do realize that there is a direct conflict in the barbie movie right and it isnt what youre saying i think youre honestly focusing way too  the fact that youre being represented in a bad light in the focus of the men that are displayed in the movie the whole point is for it to be like that 

barbie movies typically follow a formula where barbie is the protagonist and usually embodies positive qualities such as kindness friendship and determination these movies often revolve around themes of adventure selfdiscovery and overcoming challenges the reason why you dont see barbie being portrayed as the bad guy is because shes the main character there are plenty of times that barbie has her ups and downs let that be mood swings or just general plot but at the end of the day i dont really think that ken was seen really in that bad of a light either his character was meant to be exaggerated as stereotypical i know a horrible world as was barbie to be generic 

x200b

the movie tells us that the matriarchy is an innocent mistake but when kens patriarchy takes over its presented as an intentional and malicious thing where the women have to be literally brainwashed to go along with it

the movie is using extreme examples of matriarchy and patriarchy to illustrate how unchecked power regardless of the gender it is associated with can lead to negative consequences the innocent mistake in the matriarchy is highlighting that even wellintentioned decisions made without proper consideration can have unintended outcomes the malicious nature of kens patriarchy emphasizes the dangers of power being concentrated in the hands of a few and how it can be exploited for control anyone can have this i dont really think it was subject to just ken barbie and ken might learn valuable lessons from their experiences in both worlds which contributed to their personal development and understanding of the complexities of power and society tldr its showing extreme power imbalances and instead of looking at the movie and going wow only ken is seen as the bad guy go wow i see a lot of people struggle through this daily lgbtqa rights activist movements feminism politics etc 

x200b

again this isnt what the movie does it does this for only 15 minutes then it goes to a hyperpatriarchal real world and then back to a hyperpatriarchal kenworld they do not stick to the premise you claim they do

the initial shift from barbie land to the real world and then to the hyperpatriarchal kenworld is a deliberate narrative choice to create contrast and emphasize the extremes of different societal systems this narrative arc is used to underscore the importance of finding balance and collaboration between genders highlighting the negative consequences of unchecked power regardless of whether its a matriarchy or patriarchy  by showcasing hyperpatriarchal systems the movie is critiquing the excesses of traditional gender roles and power dynamics encouraging viewers to question the validity of such extreme viewpoints tldr the movie uses these different worlds to explore how gender roles and power dynamics affect characters and societies it doesnt only focus on saying one system is better than the other but it critiques extreme beliefs and shows how characters learn and grow through these experiences

hope this helped you understand a bit hopefully sorry its a bit lengthy but going into more depth might help you consider another side also i want to mention that youre free to have your own opinion wasnt trying to change it at all ",2023-08-06 11:19:34
the point is that barbieland learns that the matriarchy is flawed and looks to the real world to fix it they will slowly give the kens more voice and power over time its not saying one is better than the other,2023-08-06 14:55:40
"it did show that men have troubles this was shown through ken the most he obviously had his own arc but we also saw him trying to get a job and not being able to because he didn’t meet the basic requirements allan and aaron also had some struggles it also didn’t show them as one dimensional or evil like you originally stated dumb yeah i’ll give you that one i’m assuming by evil you’re referring to their takeover of barbieland if so that’s just how a lot of men actually act so it’s more realistic than evil 

honestly your point about male suicide is irrelevant to this discussion i don’t think the point of the movie was to say men have no struggles the point was to shed light on the struggles women face that are specifically caused by men you’re invalidating that by making it about issues men face but those issues while important are not caused by women i’d say male suicide is a problem caused my misogyny and patriarchy because men don’t seek out help for mental health as often as women due to toxic masculinity and the expectations people have of the male gender as a whole and while i know that women do perpetuate those ideas sometimes they were put into place by men 

now answer my question why is your response to a film about women’s struggles that men have struggles too why do you have to make it about yourself 

also  the sand post was fake and i’m pretty sure i deleted it",2023-07-23 04:22:07

"oh it was 100 meant as an insult i wouldn’t further insult you by pretending otherwise i would generally consider myself a progressive maybe not a feminist but only because i am not an activist not because i don’t agree with the idea that women should be equal in society it is absolutely not contradicting my personal ideals to laugh at somebody who found the barbie movie to be “bigoted” against men 

i don’t see any inherent contradictions in being a “feminist” male i just think your take specifically is silly and absurd and built largely on an insecurity about the place of male identity in our culture now that i simply do not understand 

of course men should be able and encouraged to express their emotions even those that are in opposition to the standard ideals of masculinity that doesn’t mean though that somebody will be exempt from being goaded by a guy like me because they’ve been triggered by a few jokes at the expense of a nerdy dad character which is a complete trope not even an invention of this movie

for men to coopt the language of the oppressed because there were no stallone very glad he and arnie were your examples i love them type men in a movie is in my opinion laughable this movie was not manhating it was just about and largely for women 

you use the word feminism like it’s a bad thing this is something i also do not understand 

you are right however that i cannot immediately think of specific movies where male “heroes” casually make dismissive remarks about women or mention women outside of their relationships in a favorable manner i just have this sneaking suspicion based on existing in the world that there are plenty of examples out there that just blend into the background of movies without much notice from bros like us",2023-08-06 19:22:00

"i brought up oppenheimer because i believe the two movies to be related in theme and both culturally relevant today both show that the status quo and the reality of our actions in the real world had negative effects and we have done something very wrong to others barbie experiences the world outside barbieland and how her empowerment movement missed the mark ken finds calling outside of obsessing over barbie and becomes his own man and oppie goes from being excited about science and the war to not even being able to look at the photos of the devastation his creation caused and tries to mitigate future use

but also i think we differ in opinion because you mentioned that matriarchy was painted in a good light i dont think matriarchy was shown at all in the film based on hellen mirrens narration in the opening sequence barbieland was an allegory for womens emancipation with the chief conflict being the kens obsession for attention and control being a lessthansubtle real world conflict that effects said emancipation",2023-07-30 17:55:53

i have a heart thanks i’m quite the opposite of a misogynist i’m also a lesbian so men don’t even play much of a role in my life aside from the oppressing women thing unfortunately i truly couldn’t care less about them generally 

i don’t think barbie is a comment specifically on hollywood it’s more of a critique of society as a whole  but yeah i agree that hollywood sexualizes actresses and uses them to get money from male audiences i don’t think that’s okay 

i didn’t even view barbie as some joyful happy movie it genuinely upset and frustrated me because of how women are viewed and treated in society i understand what you’re saying and obviously being sexualized all of the time is going to impact someone negatively in terms of mental health 

some of what you’re saying is valid and correct i just don’t agree with all of it and i think it’s absurd to compare the movie to  that’s just in bad taste the movie is supposed to reflect society and show the issues women face because of patriarchy so i mean yeah of course she’s going to be treated poorly at times and sexualized that’s what women go through irl dehumanization is another issue so it makes sense for her to be dehumanized in the film also because she isn’t human until the end i think overall you’re missing the point of the film and the intention behind it 

the reason barbie is portrayed the way she is is because she’s a toy and also a woman those two things together explain why she feels the way she feels throughout the movie",2023-07-23 06:39:22

"okay bisexual erasure is absolutely a very real thing and i certainly didnt mean to imply that it wasnt there are absolutely issues within the lgbtq community and people who consider themselves gayer than others and gatekeep that community ive no doubt people do get involved with the lgbtq community for the wrong reasons and attempt to wield power over others

what i was saying was that as a straight and cis man i have never felt any pressure to identify as anything i am not i would feel a lot more uncomfortable going out as someone who looked like a transwoman than dressing as i do currently i would also feel more uncomfortable walking around holding hands with a man than walking around holding hands with my girlfriend for fear of comments at the minimum i also have seen first hand that certain friends my girlfriend and nonwhite friends mainly are treated differently than i am because of who they are

one random experience that really stuck with me was when i was on a night out in a club and someone stood behind me in the queue for the bar gestured to a pair of men and referred to them as a pair of fggots without a hint of shame this man was extremely comfortable proudly displaying his homophobia

as i say no doubt people do feel pressure to be more  and are labelled pretenders but as a whole society is still far kinder to white straight cis men than anyone else",2023-07-25 21:38:23

"i mean i hear what youre saying  but its kind of an absurd take if you stop to think about it beyond the most surface level  humanity has had thousands of years of civilization and were still trying to get our  together with respect to patriarchy and other forms of oppression and discrimination  youre basically saying that the barbies within the span of about 48 hours should have learned about the concepts patriarchy and oppression fully understood how to address it and implemented changes to solve itwhile humankind hasnt managed to do that yet after multiple millennia

beyond that it would have missed the opportunity to provoke thought in the viewer  the point of barbies story wasnt barbie or ken  it was an analogue for our worlds societal problems  allowing the viewer to walk way upset that the kens still arent equal provides a great opportunity for the viewer to recognize how much work is still needed in our world  if youre upset at kens treatment you should be  furious at how actual human beings are treated every day  thats a far more valuable lesson and opportunity for selfreflection and growth

also it would have cheapened the human struggle on these issues implying that a snap of the finger can wash away all these injustices and oppressions  these are complicated problems that require real effort and sacrifice to address",2023-07-31 18:42:34

does the concept of child brides happening in certain times in certain sides “prove” for all time that women are always more mature then men seems like specious

i think what happen here is you have a certain view and are searching from random premises to support that view rather than the other way around

i think more accurately that some women experience what you describe while others do not and that there are also many men who are “more mature” perhaps this manifesta differently depends on the  and social construct in sum its much more complicated than your initial view and not some tautology you can just throw around and again frankly its a demeaning generalization that men somehow are “behind” in maturity",2023-08-31 01:19:41

"the fact that you can even say the phrase access to women non ironically is horrendous and monstrous all on its own my guy of course no women want anything to do with you you view them as commodities and not fully formed people if you desire access to women so badly maybe figure out what they actually want first instead of just inventing what you think they want and then getting mad about it

you are literally the one that used that vocabulary first im just using your vocabulary ive never had a conversation on reddit where someone wanted so bad to caricature my positions and put me in the bad guy box

im not advocating for defining your worth through having access to women ffs im just saying that yes having a  history or having success with women is something important for the self worth of the vast majority of men for societal reasons enforced through many ways from role models to commercials also for more biological reasons such as the need for intimacy but thats another topic thus its very very narrowminded and unhelpful to present the situation as your self worth shouldn’t and isn’t decided by your access to women

the point was that its possible to grow and change even as victims of society because people do it all the time

yes it is possible but it is a lengthycostly cognitively andor financially process not accessible to many people dont do it all the time otherwise we will be living in paradise by now and i even contend the fact that they do it on the basis of their free will or independently of specific social contexts eg meeting a very good therapist having certain predisposing personality traits

"not off the top of my head but i’d be surprised if there was one i fail to see how that’s relevant to this movie though 

the movie has flaws which i alluded to earlier but i think if you want to have a discussion about it you should probably finish the movie there is certainly a large chunk of the movie where the ken’s are full blown misogynists but it’s a cartoonish representation of it which is brought about by their misunderstanding of how the real world works in comparison to barbie land 

for example main ken thinks horses have a much larger role in the patriarchy then they actually do it’s played for laughs but i think is a hint that they’ve completely misunderstood the real world 

i think people are taking the movie either too seriously or too literally or both for me a mostly straight white man who is also fed up of the woke garbage hollywood has been putting out the last 510 years it was refreshing to see a movie with a lot of those woke talking points be undercut by the outlandish exaggerated world the movie takes place in 

for me it came across as satire of it all and a general message of men and women should all be pulling the same rope together because when we don’’s bad mix in some genuinely funny moments good dance numbers catchy songs and overall an entertaining movie this is why i’m surprised to see so much backlash but perhaps i’m giving it too much grace maybe others are being too harsh or somewhere in between all that to say i liked it lol",2024-01-08 18:07:13

"you do have some good reasoning ofc of course all that i am doing is projecting my own insecurities and the fact i ruined my own life even though there were also a lot of things about me that i had no control over that does not mean my arguments about hypergamy are invalid it wasnt like this in your time you also didnt have this level of white man hating in hollywood you know its true just like i admitted that what you said is true look bro its not like ive done nothing in my life but for some people its just over you know there is some truth to incel and right wing ideas its just super painful to admit it there have been plenty experiments and studies that prove some of the things ive said i just dont like how in reddit and leftists realities everybody has problems but the whiter and more man you become the less your problems become valid if you are truly a loser and you see everybody progressing in life except you you feel bitter at the fact that nobody seems to recognize your issues except andrew tate and his ilk i absolutely hate redpill andrew tate but it doesnt change the fact i never got to experience teenage love or any love from a girl whatsoever by the time i actually got a chance to  girl i didnt go through with it because i hated myself so much i knew i would never be able to get hard or enjoy myself making me an even bigger loser   


the point is in the west men are being spiritually neglected and right now and femininity is praised everywhere for the healthy men like you who are already men its all fine you take part in it and dont lose anything from it for the men who are struggling to stay afloat already who are extremely insecure in their attractiveness and masculinity it feels like a kick on the head causing me to drown further pushing me right in the hands of andrew tate id rather  myself before i become anything like that so thats what im probably going to do",2023-07-22 00:00:38
the line was more to the effect of maybe one day the kens will have more power in barbieland as women might have more in the real world drawing a 11 comparison is missing the forest for the trees i think,2023-07-25 21:20:17
i don’t really think the message of the movie was about finding equality the way i saw it i was about there being more to being a woman than dressing in pink and dancing as well as being more to being a man than hypermasculine traits and finding validity through women the kens having to “earn” their equality over time was a pretty ballsy joke but i don’t think it undermines the message and if anything just highlights the unfairness of the real world,2023-07-25 00:27:41

"that ending scene where barbieland is restored but kens gain a slightly better position wasnt meant to say that its right to purposefully deny kens full equality as a revenge or compensation for women being denied full equality in the real world the point was to showcase that the things move in the right direction for kens compared to how barbieland was at the beginning of the movie while making a satirical commentary about how that actually plays out in our real world  the advantaged class cedes just a tiny piece of power and acts as if the disadvantaged should be thankful for their generosity but isnt willing to share the power completely and so achieving genuine equally takes a very long time one small step at a time

tldr the scene isnt endorsing what happened its a satire of how progress looked and looks in real life",2023-07-24 11:49:39
"ok i was originally gonna ignore this specific part of the thread but your comment here convinced me otherwise there’s a few things i noticed about what you said which i feel like not a lot of people are responding to i have a few retorts even if you might not listen and i’m not doing them to hurt you… kinda the opposite while i’ll admit that i don’t like the way you see certain things it’s obvious that you’re  unhappy and i don’t think anyone deserves to be in the emotional space you’re in

thing 1
 my point is that mosts leftists simply cannot fathom the idea that women have a special responsibility when it comes to regulating the dating market i am saying that if women decide to be more promsicuous they usually do so with a small percentage of men leaving a lot of men out of the question men cant decide to be more promiscuous out of their own volition its always by the grace of women its simply a fact that women have a largely skewed amount of control over the dating market this sounds very incelly and right wingy but its simply the truth of survival and economic behaviour of women in the dating market 

most people will go after you because of how you’re talking about women here but i want to point out something something else that might help a bit you’re talking about the dating market how women regulate and control it you also in another comment talk about how women only go for the “top men”

while it’s lowhanging fruit to criticize how you’re portrating women you’re also framing men as an economic good and romantic love as a currency if the majority of men don’t find a partner they’re the equivalent of a faulty product they were discarded over the new superior model maybe try to consider that you’re objectifying men including yourself… which you shouldn’t do people be it men or women aren’t products or buyers  you are more than an object to be purchased you’re holding yourself to an unrealistic standard that only a fraction of men are gonna meet even though the amount of men who actually end up with romantic partners is way way bigger than that what i’m trying to say is that you’re holding a worldview where you’re permanently a failure if you can shed this worldview try if you can’t try to learn how even if it’s just to understand how it feels like to not hold said worldview for like half an hour it feels like an easy guess to me that the moment you stop seeing your romantic prospects as comparable to the competition between cocacola and pepsi you will start having the confidence necessary not only to have a partner but to live a fulfilling life as a person

thing 2
 this sounds very incelly and right wingy but its simply the truth of survival and economic behaviour of women in the dating market i know its not all women but i get to talk about it monolithically in this context because its still a large amount of women who control the dating market in western countries it seems like leftists just cant phathom the idea that some conservative values actually are good for society and were not just in place to only be a tool of opression

speaking from my own experience if we’re gonna divide this situation into two political sides the women to have a strict standard over “the 20 percent of men” you speak of tend to be conservative they’re the ones who tend to want a physically strong man who can provide for them and is strong enough to protect them this is a standard that in our day and age and for our generation is… not very achievable

most of my female friends are leftleaning and tend to have pretty average standards for men not supermodels not  not rich not poor not weird not ordinary or boring not mediocre not masculine or unmanly either they generally just want to date a good person they don’t want a perfect specimen they want someone who is right for them

i feel like dividing women’s taste in men into a political spectrum is a bit weird but i’m kinda trying to say that you maybe need to expand your circles if the only women in your life have strict standards easier said than done dating apps don’t count those are brutal

thing 3 which was the tipping point to make me comment

 yeah its absolutely horrible to go without love for 24 years on one side i pity myself for not having gotten the love that everyone deserves on the other side i hate myself for being such a loser i have already decided that i will not reach the age of 25

i just turned 25 recently have also never been in a serious relationship and have therefore struggled with feelings of loneliness and inadequacy the big difference is that i’ve been lucky enough to not fall into a place as dark as it looks like you’re in so i’m aware that after a certain point i can’t help you from a place of experience a quick thing i wanna mention is that barely now am i starting to form a more romantic bond with someone i’m not saying this to rub anything in but to tell you that sometimes it just takes “that long” and to be honest neither of us is old to begin with even if i sometimes feel ancient already romantic love is inconvenient a lot of us want it to fall on out laps even though that’s not how it works and then when we’re not looking for it it falls in our laps other times it does take some searching and some work i also need to point out that the relationship i’m in now started at a point in my life where i had already examined what i really wanted besides needing to have a partner i have longlocated my passions and things that bring fulfillment to my life so i don’t have to depend on someone else

i know a lot of what i just wrote probably sounds like “oh you’re depressed have you tried being happy” “you’re lonely just try having friends” “have you tried being  yet” and i don’t know what to say to that i never was an incel but i once did have inceladjacent feelings about where my life was heading i maybe still do what i try to do is be selfcritical about the way i feel about people change when i realize i’m seeing something in a way can hurt others and try to forgive myself for not being perfect

you said you were raised to be loving but not strong but it’s never too late to be strong but also be strong for the right reasons be loving and strong because that’s a path to having a complete fulfilling life and because it’s part of what it means to be a good person being loving and strong so a woman will find you attractive won’t give you the happiness you seek but that happiness does exist for you

edit but something i need to put my foot down on is that i agree with people’s criticisms your talk of a “dating market” is provably untrue and is unfair towards women and men in different ways while you at least think you care about women and probably want to you still hold prejudices that you haven’t examined on top of that last sentence you’re basically betting your purpose in life on women  which isn’t fair on them and isn’t going to have the outcomes you want i commented because i genuinely believe the peace you’re looking for is out there but beyond the obvious criticisms it needs to be pointed out that you hold and have been made to hold a perspective which is making it hard for yourself to find that happiness",2023-07-21 23:23:53
its really funny how youre literally going through the most conspiratorial angle this movie made look cartoonish and think yelling but thats how it is makes you sound like youre on a high ground anything except taking a single bit of responsibility for how or why your life has gone the way it has with all your interpersonal relationships,2023-07-21 18:43:35

also yes it needed to be stated image if i said that the big speech and every point about the patriarchy didn’t need to be explicitly stated people would say i am hating on the message and don’t want it to be said yes also with the confusing everyone has with how the kens are treated it show so needed to be stated",2023-07-22 20:38:36

also if theyre just dolls completely void of complexity individual thought empathy etc why do we even care about their world and what happens to them and whether the kens take over or not they have just as much meaning being brainwashed as they do not being brainwashed  because theyre dolls 


if the depth of their abilities is what children do and how they work through things even children understand the concept of sharing being nice and being empathetic to a lesser degree but theyre not completely devoid of it as you say these dolls are


and overall im just saying that the movie literally has scenes of barbies showing empathy when they deem it necessary as stated above they do empathize with each other  like with weird barbie they understand that they were wrong and they try to make up for their mistake this shows that they are learning empathy and understanding after years of not treating weird barbie right ken understands empathy he clearly tries to get stereotypical barbie to understand how he and the other kens feel scenes in a movie have to serve a purpose they",2023-07-23 02:51:02
"lol again where at all in the movie is it implied that barbie would end up single for the rest of her life her ending is that she becomes human are relationships not part of the human experience as well why does this movie need to take the obvious route there are plenty of other barbies in barbieland who ended up with their respective kens ken and barbie were never and will never get married that is part of the lore of barbie if you want to take it even deeper  in 2004 barbie dumped ken and started dating blaine for two whole years there were no new ken dolls produced it was barbie and blaine and then they broke up and she and ken got back together maybe there will be a sequel thar explores this maybe not 

for someone who is so mad about how ken is being portrayed youre really pushing this women bad strong women hate men barbie need man to have happy ending thing youre doing the same  youre accusing gerwig of doing youve got a big ol hateboner for this movie just admit it and move on plenty of people have explained the complexities and critiques of the movie and your takeaways are still so shallow and surface level youre caught up in your feelings and you cannot see beyond them",2023-07-25 17:00:13

it might be helpful to think about this in terms of levels i don’t think greta means to imply that men being free to cry and know themselves is the final state of feminism but yeah it’s a kind of progress at one point the mom says that she doesn’t know what the right thing to do is and the daughter says you can’t fix everything but you can at least make it a little bit better so if there is a thesis we’re supposed to get from this it’s a sort of slow incrementalism the real world today isn’t perfect but it’s better than it was in the 1960s “i am kenough” isn’t perfect but it’s better than how ken was before,2023-08-01 12:59:41

"how can i think a woman in medieval times in europe is oppressed when neither she nor her husband nor anyone else in the world has ever conceived of a world without standard gender roles that world was really only practically possible after the industrial revolution which explains why no one considered it women living then weren’t all being oppressed just because they’re doing a gender role and more than male chimps are oppressing female chimps they’re just both following animal instinct and that’s why they had different gender roles back then

x200b

you are just wrong you dont even understand what youre talking about traditional gender roles are oppressive to women you realize that right you realize that gender roles are constructed by society to dictate how people live their lives and arent actually based in biology 

you just compared women to animals and discounted what it was like to be sold off to be married to another family did you know that until the 1970s it was legal for husbands to  their wives in the us did you know that women are still  in some countries for infidelity or even for being 

you are part of the problem you dont know anything about this issue and yet you come in here trying to mansplain female oppression to me go get a life and stop trying to victimize yourself because guess what this movie isnt about you and thats the point",2023-07-25 16:34:07

there are plenty of people in this thread saying that they don’t like the movie and why and yet there was decent discussion the difference was they basically shrugged their shoulders and realized it wasn’t a film for them whereas your opinion was more along the lines of saying that everyone who did like it was wrong to because of how bad it was so wrong in fact that it lowers the bar of society that you now feel you are living in a dystopian wasteland where 5 year olds are somehow able to write movie scripts you used hyperbole and stated it in a way that was incredibly pompous and put a great deal of people down while lifting yourself up above them people tend to not care for that,2023-07-21 16:30:26

slavery happened in europe too

however if we’re talking about the us the point still stands the vast majority of men were still under little control of their lives 

not because of their gender

you seem to be trying to start some oppression olympics of “who suffered more”

it must be really convenient for you to claim men were equally oppressed to women historically and then claim anyone arguing that they werent are trying to start some oppression olympics

not only is that an odd thing to do but it misconstrues the point i was making i wasn’t trying to establish some quota of who suffered more

youre trying to argue that men have been oppressed too equally as much as women when its not because of their gender


 not that every group struggled equally but struggled nonetheless 

men have not struggled because of their gender it is an advantage

for voting being restricted to landowners is oppression

yeah oppression of non land owners not men

oppression is not defined by race or gender it is one group over another

so then why are you claiming men were oppressed

either way your argument boils down to nothing more than who struggled more which is poor way of looking history

we cant talk about slavery and civil rights it makes it look like black people suffered more than white people which is a poor way of looking at history they both suffered",2023-07-22 22:07:15

like what part of this don’t you get they’re literally saying “look she’s a real woman now and here’s why” as the closing point in the movie an opportunity to actually say something about the diverse experiences of women and we just end it with an unnecessary flat cis heteronormative joke that only reinforces the same patriarchal  the whole movie claims to be against cool",2023-07-22 03:25:40

the beach scene where the barbies pull out their cellphones to text in front of the kens or switch to other kens was also something that women sometimes do to toy with guys interested in them i think a lot of women consciously have done that and guys are almost always oblivious to being gamed in that way

all of that stuff is funny and cute when you are in a relationship or have been in many and see the parallels of course a lot of guys with partners are toxic and will still be offended but i think the most anger comes from guys who never got to get into relationships so the game of dating comes off as offensive instead of endearing",2023-11-13 22:56:06

are you at all versed in anthropology sure sports specifically are not integral to the survival of humans but competition as a concept isnt some artificial abstract notion

it comes down to questioning the premise which i buy into i dont watch sports myself and i concur that they are not super important but since these sports and audiences for them do exist lets switch over to a game theory approach if we model a system that has those rules and parameters and people are invested in them then the people who are able to excel will be more entertaining to watch or noteworthy to study",2023-07-22 17:37:04

if barbie had spent more time in the real world if she had spent more time talking to her reallife owner if she had learned how humans live and not just been explained it in a scene or seen it while sitting in the park for a couple minutes if she had come to understand the motherdaughter dynamic and wanted that for herself if she had interacted with more than three humans  you could argue this was growth this was a decision she made based on experiences we see

data in star trek wants to be a human in data episodes data goes to great lengths to explain why he wants to be a human we see him learn how to be human and we see him learn incorrectly how to be human we see him mimicking actors instead of finding that emotion from within and it being explained to him that mimicking isnt going to make him more human we see him grow as he learns to find whatever it is inside him that lets him perform not as a mimicer but as data that is growth barbie doesnt have that this movie doesnt do that going to a gynecologist isnt growth i think the gynecologist joke would have worked great with a setup as well if you spend time in the human world barbie could go to the gynecologist with her human owner be freaked out by it since she doesnt have and doesnt understand genetalia and it would make that decision at the end as a human to go to the gynecologist both a followup joke but also some depth shes literally overcoming a doll fear showing her growth and showing her humanity

ken is not portrayed as a positive role model throughout the movie hes depicted as helpless impressionable naive  emotionally immature and in the end his big achievement is realizing how pathetic and awful he is but do we see him get better do we see him turn into a selfactualized man who manifests a positive male role model  no not at all 

or are you gonna say that gloria’s husband learning spanish was also a stab at men being 

sasha literally accused him of cultural appropriation when he did that his behavior was explicitly and immediately castigated in the film and here you are saying he was portrayed as an example of a positive male role model its like you didnt even watch the same movie 

this guy got about five seconds of screen time he wasnt even named hes not a role model hes not even a character barely more than an extra with a single speaking line theres no male role models in the film

don’t actually reply to this unless you want to like talk to me personally or something blush

we can have a polite discussion about the film and the ideas presented therein or you can repeatedly make condescending snide remarks that show youre just interested in trolling",2023-07-23 08:55:46

if doesnt have to come from most men it just has to come from a few who give a 

so it makes little logical sense to conclude it’s something most men want or need

not wanting to confront their feelings doesnt mean not needing to  maybe because most men dont want to talk about their feelings makes it all the more important to tell them that they should

anyway its sad to see those incel i actually googled to learn the meaning and ultrafeminists toxic argument in this thread
deep down both groups are insecure lack of love and compassion from the opposite gender

this is also the reason why i was hoping this movie to bring the message of love instead of ended with the statement of how female are still mistreated irl

because female is still mistreated so barbieland will stay pro feminist

be better show that how the world could be better if both gender work together as a team to inspire the young people to be better

"seems like a cop out to me i went into the movie perfectly ready to feel challenged and invited to introspect trying to look objectively i just dont see any hint of a positive representation of men  while the movie was incredibly preachy about the struggles and virtues of women it just felt like 2 hours of men being laughed at  even for genuine concerns they have like insecurity

maybe this movie wasnt actually intended for men at all maybe its just for women to laugh at men for a bit i was hoping for something a bit deeper than that",2023-08-06 20:40:36
"male fragility is just a made up term used to insult men it’s just a way of calling men man babies or  but dressing it up with a feminist ideological language which makes it acceptable imagine if men started coming up with ridiculous terms like that for women

you say men shouldn’t be upset  well remember that next time women say they’re upset that a movie portrays them a certain way why should men care if they don’t",2023-08-06 20:58:38
translation i cant think of any so im going to insult you instead of acknowledging your point,2023-08-08 11:53:18
"right so you can’t think of those movies yet your sure they exist they must right otherwise this would simply be  and spiteful writing of men with no basis on satirising anything men have actually done and that couldn’t possibly be because if you admitted that it would mean you were fragile because you said something against the feminist movie

it’s funny because you seem the one who is goaded imo for whatever reason you can’t stand men saying this movie offends them and immediately jump to “well it doesn’t offend me i’m a strong man and not like those offended men feminist women say are fragile” and it’s so wonderfully stereotypical and very common that a progressive man tries to reassert the ol toxic masculine ideals of strength in comparison with ither man yet do it using feminist terms which make it feel acceptable to him  that my friend is the contradiction

and i’m not sure where you got that i wanted a stallone type man in this movie  i was saying that in movie men liked the main sympathetic characters didn’t treat their wives that way because it would make those characters look like assholes perhaps try to re read and comprehend what was actually written

and your right that this movie is for women but so what is tapping into the bigotry of one group against another group for laughs acceptable simply because said group is the target audience of the movie",2023-08-06 19:49:20

"sorry im not really following your train of logic here

i’m trying to figure out where you’re getting the idea that there aren’t plenty of male focused media we just have a lot more means to view movies  studios aren’t going to often going to focus more budget on less reach

not excluding superhero movies at all my original assertion was that everybody should be allowed to have their fantasies without interference

that’s never been the sustained business model of comic books or the resulting movies either it certainly still happens plenty but won’t necessarily be pursued at the highest levels because more budget means higher risk  alienating audiences is never a good idea at that level as you point out in some of your examples

the male villian in ant man is dispatched while ghost who is arguably more evil is forgiven becausewellshes a girl 

there’s a bit to unpack here 

1 cross was brought back so the intent clearly wasn’t to have his story close there

2 you’re confused why an adult in a position acting out of malice would be treated more harshly than a teen or young adult who can’t control phasing into different realms or whatever the whole point of the second half of that movie is helping her out so she stops the bad 

the black widow movie which portrayed the only real male hero character the crimson dynamo as a complete oaf and  did not do well at the box office

it was the 4th highest box office in 2021 and did better than bond which still definitely has bond girls they just rebranded  and is as male fantasy focused as barbie is female focused so probably not a great example

my favorite story out of this is that birds of prey meant to be a feminist superhero story that also put down men brought out huge criticisms because of its poor box office performance female audiences lamented that men werent supporting their super hero movie until it turned out that actually men accounted for more of the ticket sales than women oops

doesn’t this support not making exclusive content",2023-07-23 23:31:39

barbie however had a much more straightforward and generalized view of its main oppositiondifferent societies of being simply bad barbie did regret and reflect on some of the negative consequences of her actions  but she only acknowledged them and didn’t care to actually act upon it as she kept society the same way it was before

" what i was saying was that as a straight and cis man i have never felt any pressure to identify as anything i am not  i would feel a lot more uncomfortable going out as someone who looked like a transwoman than dressing as i do currently

not everyone is you  think of it this way  lgbtq people are born lgbtq right  we can agree on that as that is the prevailing theory of the current time

we can also agree that lgbtq people growing up surrounded by straight people often feel pressured to be and act straight

nbsp

so what happen if you grow up in an environment as a straight person where youre actually in the minority most times and lgbtq people are celebrated and compliemnted just for being who they are and there are low key disses to straight and cis people and you often get othered or excluded for being cisstraight

answer  its the same kind of pressure as the lgbtq felt  i dont have to guess i know  not only do i live in a very progressive city but before i moved here i have been a furry for many years and furries are 23rds lgbtq and have been sincewell furever  since their inception really

nbsp

 i would also feel more uncomfortable walking around holding hands with a man than walking around holding hands with my girlfriend for fear of comments at the minimum

alot of this feeling was instilled in your growing up  times have radically changed  weve gone from judging people for even liking a show like the powerpuff girls or my little pony to 20 to that kinda stuff just more or less being accepted  5 of people identified as lgbtq before 20 of gen z does  jocks and hard labor workers used to be the average working person who determined the status quo and brought home the bacon  now its nerdy people in tech jobs and people talk about stem stem stem

this is not the age your grew up in  and i get it i grew up in that i once got  with for eating a salad because apparently that was   stupidest thing ive ever heard till this day  but its day and night different from that today

nbsp

 one random experience that really stuck with me was when i was on a night out in a club and someone stood behind me in the queue for the bar gestured to a pair of men and referred to them as a pair of fggots without a hint of shame this man was extremely comfortable proudly displaying his homophobia

if you want to pretend 1 person is representative of the whole that  goes both ways and every single group has their dirty laundry  caitlyn jenner for example clearly represents the feelings and opinions of trans people  asia argento clearly represents the feelings and behavior of the leaers of the metoo movement  

point taken

nbsp

 as i say no doubt people do feel pressure to be more  and are labelled pretenders but as a whole society is still far kinder to white straight cis men than anyone else

is it now  ive worked in tech video games and social media and this is definitely not the case in any of those fields  its the exact opposite  this is also true based on your location like los angeles or austin or portland  heck even houston is at the very least neutral if not leaning positive  despite being a texas work city they care mostly about taking care of their families there  

nbsp

texas as a whole is going to be an interesting thing to watch in the near future  the old views on texas are outdated and people keep trying to make them stick  but texas has been majority hispanic for awhile now the irony of a minority being the majority of the biggest state in the country d  its not the southern white boy redneck state people like to paint it as  not just in terms of race but also its got alot of tech and tech is growing fast  houstons even slowly getting some tech jobs

if people dont change their views eventually there is gonna be a reckoning  people cant downplay the hispanic peoples by pretending their all straight white conservative rednecks forever",2023-07-26 00:34:54

girls being pressured to grow up faster in various ways isn’t about who is more mature if anything it’s ignoring that girls aren’t mature enough for the changes we’re expected to take on much earlier than boys who are allowed to be youngmake mistakesbe lazy for a lot longer

mansplain is such a boring word and used by feminists to try to shut down conversation it’s essentially trying to shame someone you don’t agree with i couldn’t care less and it’s very ironic your telling me not to victimise myself when your the one determined to believe women have been oppressed for all time  despite the idea of them being oppressed only occurring to them in the past century or so",2023-07-25 17:13:28

the ending was always going to be brief and yeah whilst i agree in premise with your message and that it could work in this context the length of time they had to convey that message whilst maintaining the nuance required to make it work as a message rather than trivialising women’s issues  just isn’t feasible imo 



i think this also just goes back to the core message of the movie  that monologue by america about how tiring it is to be a woman you’re placing  those same expectations on the movie that society places on women the movie doesn’t have to solve everything present a perfect solution or have an ending that’s better just because it’s a feminist movie… it already conveys its message better than 999 of movies yet you’re questioning where the 001 is rather than appreciating the work already done  if you get my vibe",2023-07-24 04:02:14
but having a  and being a woman are intrinsically linked even if that alone is not definitive what defines woman how is asserting the existence of a  reinforcing patriarchy you seem to think you really know what youre talking about but youve made this weird assertion that its somehow patriarchal or transphobic to associate women with vaginas in a final joke of a movie about a plastic female perhaps the joke didnt land for you you disliked it you feel it was insufficient but its not derogatory or mean thats the weird part not you having a negative opinion just your moral grandstanding you dont have to explain  if you dont want to convince anyone just stop commenting im not forcing you,2023-07-22 03:35:21
"weird take the last important dialogue of the film is about the human experience so the emphasis was on her being a real person the ending line is a misdirection to that end what was set up as a job interview turns into a mundane activity many women have experienced even postop trans women an appointment with your gynecologist

flat cis heteronormative joke that only reinforces the same patriarchal  the whole movie claims to be against

 i forgot that only straight cisgender women go to the gynecologist and all health problems associated with the  and neovagina are imposed by men yeah i should have remembered that

"are you only able to see  in black and white there are many reasons people advocate for specific rules etc

one is because of benefit to themselves andor society in most cases people in general think about how something will benefit themselves

people however also demand rules etc based on morality and one of the fundamental requirement people have from their government is that the government protect the human lives of society

people also demand stuff based on empathy

it’s pretty easy to see how society benefits from everyone having access to safe abortions

i agree but sometimes people are willing to go against what benefit society if that goes against their empathy or morals people generally value human life more than anything hence a lot of people are against abortions

when abortions are illegal people seeking them are subject to dangerous alternatives

thats true but we dont make stuff legal just because people doing something illegal will be hurt if its not legal you will find people stealing even though its illegal these people are hurt by the fact that stealing is illegal why dont we make stealing legal then because we consider stealing wrong as it hurts innocent people  the fact that thieves get a harder life is tough luck for them

the real doctors who seeks to provide safe services are persecuted wasting valuable skilled individuals not to mention the resources employed to prosecute them

if someone who helps society a lot does something criminal like  a woman they shouldnt be punished because we are wasting valuable skilled individuals what logic is that if the law has decided providing abortion is illegal because its considered killing a fellow human being then its irrelevant what good they are able to provide society otherwise they have still done something illegal

children of unwanted pregnancy are more likely to lead lives of poverty and crime

and children born from poor parents are also more likely to lead lives of poverty and crime heck children born from single mothers are also more likely  whats your point

women who face unwanted pregnancy must often choose between productive careers or lives of dependency on their family and the state women who are forced to give birth are more vulnerable to abuse by spouses they are dependent on for survival

so they are at fault themselves they became pregnant unless they were  see further down abusing your spouse is illegal regardless so what decisions you make in your life has consequences  sometimes they are negative

there are many women who require abortions for no other reason than to save their health or their lives

yea and pretty much all countries in the world allow these women abortions

finally young girls need abortions when they are  by predators so that they can avoid the continuing harm of their  by being forced to care for a child while they themselves are still developing

yea and pretty much all countries in the world allow these girls abortions

but just to argue against the point just because someone else did something illegal towards you  doesnt allow you to do something illegal towards someone else even if it makes you feel better or get a better life

the benefits of banning abortion seem to be limited to religious arguments which have no place in our government as stated in the constitution

the laws are not only made based on benefit  they are also made based on the empathy people have

what benefit do you see of not allowing parents to  their 1 year old child theyve decided they dont want anymore the reason thats not allowed is because we have empathy towards children and as such weve decided that this is not allowed even if killing unwanted very young born children would probably be beneficial for society",2023-07-23 17:23:36
"sure 

91 of  victims are women 20 of women have reported experiencing  assault compared to 4 of men 71 of human trafficking victims are women in a marriage when one spouse falls ill with cancer 208 of wives with cancer are left by their husbands compared to 28 of male patients who are left by their wives but yeah sure people always care more about women around 57 of women have their medical issues misdiagnosed because the majority of standard practicestraining in medicine are based on the male body the ratio of top earners in large companies for menwomen is 31 women are more likely to live in poverty than men 11 of women compared to 9 of men maternity leavepay isnt a standard in the us so working mothers are left in the lurch 

so no women arent better off by every metric women are thriving in some areas and suffering in others men are thriving in some areas and suffering in others stop looking at life in such a black and white lens and stop belittling the struggles of groups youre not even a part of you do not have to diminish womens experiences in order to bring attention to mens issues at all you do not need to pump the brakes on feminism in order to support men unless youre completely incapable of caring about more than one issue

"nice attempt at an internet psychoanalysis but its off the mark this person was being explicitly antagonistic and made other taunting replies to me throughout the comment section like i get your point but assuming their hostility in this case was warranted

for your part its pretty unreasonable to think that just because i bring up a previous relationship somehow means im dependent on another and frame my existence as a partner thats a huge stretch filled in with a big serving of projection and it wouldnt be unreasonable to detect a hint of condescending hostility in it either

the movie for its part had some good lines and setups especially in the first half but the messaging was confused the politics were hamfisted and super awkward and the ending dragged on until the last genuinely hilarious joke overall i think it was an ok somewhat mediocre movie but thematically i have a toddler son and the celebration of the jeering mockery of men in the film makes me concerned for his future mental health i wonder how youll twist that to make me seem like the unreasonable insecure loser that youre pretending to argue against in your head",2023-07-23 22:29:50

most countries do to some extent and the vast majority of those only conscript men that is a true example of systemic sexism you would have a difficult time finding one similar for women in the west which is why you havent

  as for the countries that do conscript people it is men who have historically controlled the governments that set up the systems to conscript men

this is such a backwards and truly ignorant world view how do you think societies functioned in the past you think men just decided everything with no input from women what a misogynist point of view it was not a shadowy gathering of men who decided on conscription it has its origin in serfdom and in my country further back to the ledingfleet",2023-07-21 18:58:27

 i support the goals behind affirmative action college and worthiness is about more than test scores diversity of thought and experience is also important in building a student body so if all of your best students are the exact same kind of person youre going to have a lacking class overall

 women dont always have the choice to go back to work especially when their partner makes more money so it makes sense for them to stay home with the rising costs of daycare staying in the workforce isnt always an option we need to reduce stigma against resume gaps to help everyone in the workforce including those who take time off to fight cancer or support a family member

 there are studies and anecdotes showing how women are often discriminated against or discouraged from joining certain industries like stem and construction i personally had the brains to be an engineer but was pushed towards the arts and i wonder what my life wouldve been like if id had the opportunity to try it out also the wage difference for pink collar jobs also hurts men who enter those same industries who could have higher wages if historical discrimination didnt suppress the job category as a whole and dont give me that  about physically dangerous nurses have to treat people with contagious diseases and violent tendencies on a regular basis",2023-07-23 23:48:58

why would not wanting to talk about feelings make it more important they should that makes no sense 

women try to commit suicide more and have higher depression rates i would guess mens are more and have always been more because there’s something in mens animal nature that makes it easier for them to just follow through on something violently so they’re successful more often also they tend to own more weapons so have easy access to effective means also i wonder about the impact of divorces where fathers don’t get to see their kids much and how that effects male suicide rates crying won’t help change that situation none

it’s not like most men are committing suicide they’re just puzzled by all these feminist women and a few men talking about how men really secretly want to cry more and the rest of that  and have no idea where they got that wacky idea",2023-08-02 08:33:53

i would like to clarify i don’t think you’re weaker than i am or that i’m stronger because i could handle the barbie experience without feeling attacked i just think this interpretation that barbie is antiman is silly and that it is overly sensitive to be triggered in such a way as a man by some jokes at our expense that’s all this movie is not “bigoted” it’s okay we’ll be okay 

you and i disagree about barbie’s relationship with the male species i think it and greta are perfectly fine with men they just point out some things about us that might not be the best qualities as a generality not in the husband he was just cute and that’s okay 

but i think we’re not gonna come to some kind of middle ground here i’d say we are both fairly contemptuous of the other’s ideas on the subjects of feminism and masculinity i don’t think it’s an issue of strength or weakness just sensibilities one of us is sensible
