"drax the dad 


thats such a perfect way to close his arc",2023-05-05
"
more i think about it high evolutionary is by far one of the best mcu villains
  

  
no jokes no quips dude is unrelenting and  detestable there is no  thats why i stepped up was hard as  ngl
  

  
chukwudi iwuji knocked it out of the park",2023-05-05
"this might be one of the most uplifting endings to a marvel movie so far every main character got a lovely sendoff i was amazed by how gamora was handled as well and i admired that they didn’t rekindle quill and gamora’s relationship ultimately the film was about found family and it never veered off course

i didn’t expect much coming into the theatre didn’t even watch any trailers but ended up with so many happy tears i think i won’t be watching movie trailers from now on…

fully expected drax to die but i’m pleasantly surprised that my expectations were subverted and that his ending was not tragic at all

also first mcu fbomb i think lol",2023-05-05
mantis hitting the ground awkwardly was my favorite recurring bit,2023-05-05
really felt bad for drax losing mantis…,2023-05-05

"mcus strongest showing in a while holy cow i knew rockets backstory was going to be sad and  up but man when the bunny was saying rocket teefs floor go now rocket teefs floor go now

and the fleshy prison break everything about the biological building was extremely unsettling",2023-05-05
what i really liked about this movie was the stakes were small it wasn’t “we gotta save the world” or “the fate of universe is up to us” it was just “we gotta save our friend”,2023-05-05
"personally i loved that after an entire marketing campaign teasing it none of the guardians died so many stories have heroes dying as the “ultimate heroic act” to save a future they’ll never see but gunn flipped that trope on its head by having all the heroes live to be the ones to build that future which is actually the most heroic act 

the dcu is gonna rock and i hope marvel learned as many lessons as they could from gunn’s time with them",2023-05-05
why did that girl have to get her face all  up from that monkey lol that was hilarious,2023-05-05
"the most emotional entry of the trilogy and a fitting sendoff to this group of guardians


 bradley cooper as rocket is the mvp his performance in the flashback is amazing
 james gunn again with his great direction the onetake hallway scene was great
 chukwudi iwuji gives a great performance first mcu villain in a while that was terrifying 
 adam warlock and ayesha storyline seem underdeveloped and pacing was a little slow in the beginning
 first fbomb in the mcu movies and it was totally unexpected
 appreciate that the villain was defeated easily and the main mission was saving people and animals
 bittersweet ending but everyone survived is the best case scenario
 dog days are over is the perfect song choice to start the 2000s playlist


mcus best movie in years and james gunn ends with a home run",2023-05-05
warlock was more menacing in that 5 min intro fight than kang was in the entirety of antman 3 lol,2023-05-05
"i always wanted an mcu movie ended with dancing to the music and this didnt disappoint me especially when they chose florencemachine  dog days are over

so good",2023-05-05
rockets first word was hurts ,2023-05-05
rocket…imagine minding your own business having a mini flash back listening to creep then within a moment you’re knocked through several  buildings  die go to what is purgatory and basically feel peace when you reunite with your childhood friends get told “not yet” come back   find out you are a raccoon reunite with your creatorabuser choose to not seek revenge and then boom…become captain of the guardians of the galaxy,2023-05-05
wow that was a blast loved how much they leaned into 70s scifi for this one may be my favorite out of the three the comedy largely worked and it still managed to be surprisingly dark,2023-05-05
the animal mutilation had me  up,2023-05-05
when will poulter called elizabeth debicki “mother”… same,2023-05-05
"something i havent seen mentioned that i loved is how much the darkbody horrorish aspects get amped up in this one the  up experimented animals that worked for the high evolutionary and invade knowhere were legit creepy especially the pig one that gets beheaded by adam warlock the cgi for them was great as well the cages rocket and his friends lived in felt so grimy and dirty the scene where ayesha and warlock are interrogating a ravager and adam lasers him and they show his charred  up corpse was also great and  hilarious

and of course probably the most satisfying scene in the whole movie when rocket shreds up the high evolutionarys face for a solid 10 seconds and at the end when they tear away his mask and show just how much rocket  him up

james gunn really wants you to remember he directed slither and that he could do it again if he so desired",2023-05-05
why does star lord not have his helmet and rocket boots,2023-05-05
"1 that hallway fight scene was rad as  

2 this  movie almost made me cry three times

first mcu f bomb and it was perfectly silly,2023-05-05

they should have given peter quill grandpa a warning before he’d be informed his lost grandson of decades would return  that sorta thing gives older people heart attacks,2023-05-05
was the elevator dialogue a little jabpoke at how the characters were treated in the non gotg movies,2023-05-05
the counter earth made a lot more sense after thinking about it sure they handwave the whole 80s vibe as the high evolutionary copying earth back then but theres subtle hints its doomed anyway hatsune miku playing on the radio means the people on that planet cant sing or create anything not given to them and cant evolve they need fake music given to them and thats horrifying,2023-05-05
"i was surprised not a single major character died in this

also has anyone noticed the guardians movies have the most deaths of the mcu movies in 1 they  off almost all of the nova corps in vol 2 all of the ravagers get killed by yondus arrow and in this a whole planet is blown up not counting infinity war since they get unsnapped",2023-05-05
"open the  door

that caught me off guard

probably the strongest mcu offering in a long time the action was great that final hallway fight was top tier the humour was solid and the emotional moments hit like a truck

also shoutout to iwuji as high evolutionary he brought that unhinged energy to the role and was freaking terrifying sometimes",2023-05-05
i love gamora’s ending of even tho she’s not the same one they didn’t make her switch to be a guardian  she truly made her own path and found her own family in the ravegers  the scene of her being welcomed back and hugged was a nice touch,2023-05-05
"i definitely didnt expect to cry three times while watching a movie where none of the main characters die how james gunn accomplished this i dont know but it takes real talent to be able to pull it off

guardians of the galaxy is my favorite mcu movie because the setting is very unique and fun the second movie was a disappointment to me but this one is on par with the first if not better the action is great the characters are perfect the plot has a payoff for everything and it is very emotional

theres something that bothered me throughout the entire movie though what happened to quills mask and jet boots dude almost died frozen in space for no good reason

im definitely going to miss this old formation of the guardians but at least it ended on a high note and i will forever cherish those movies",2023-05-05
the gag was seamless but high evolutionary stepping up on a riser to talk to his assistant at eye level killed me,2023-05-05
"me i want to know rockets background
also me no not like that",2023-05-05
"teef and floor’s final moments watching lila die and then their sweet friend rocket who they’ve known since he was an infant murdering people when they thought they were free and going to see the sky is just so  sad


this is probably the first mcu film i don’t think i can rewatch like it was great but i just can’t handle seeing that again",2023-05-05
well i guess star lord was right it was a face off,2023-05-05
"“cause i’m a freakin guardian of the galaxy”

leaves him for dead on an exploding spaceship",2023-05-05
"the story is about selfhatred mostly mantis says this explicitly when she yells that drax is the only character that doesnt hate himself and that nebula puts down others to make herself feel better these remarks dont just apply to this set of characters they shadow the entire series

the high evolutionary kills his creations because they mirror his own flaws and this constant selfflagellation causes him to hate rocket most of all because he is possibly the only creation that might have surpassed his creator and he does so while being a small one off experiment rather than any of the intended breakthroughs the high evolutionary seems to hate himself even more for that fact and all of his screaming and violence towards rocket might as well be directed at himself for envying a cybernetic raccoon so much

rocket clearly hates himself for basically every reason anyone ever could with denying his existence as a raccoon being the most apparent reason hes always shoved others away out of fear of losing them and more importantly for fear of failing them he considers himself a hideous little freak good only for killing and mocking the flaws of others this has sadly made him resemble the high evolutionary to a small extent but unlike his creator rocket finds people that love and accept him despite everything but what changes him into a true hero is meeting the other raccoon subjects as this allows rocket to finally see himself as someone worthy of love and protection thus ending his need to see the flaws in others after all of this rocket begins to love himself and becomes the leader he always could have been while happily calling himself a raccoon

after learning her other selfs fate gamora probably cant become the character we once knew and quill essentially demanding that she do so only makes her deliberately veer further away from that image quill has always regretted abandoning his mother and indulging in the image of the legendary star lord has been his main method of coping making the guardians has helped him grow some but that core shame of running away from his earth family still drives him he just uses the more benevolent guardians instead of exclusively his own image to stay distracted his continued pining for gamora reflects that he depends on the guardians to continue avoiding his grief both for his original gamora and for his mother in the end he lets go of the new gamora and leaves the guardians to finally reunite with his grandfather facing his original flaws at last

gamora and nebula have been forced to define themselves by violence since they were children with thanos abuse turning them against each other until they turned on him and forgave each other while theyve begun growing past their traumas their reliances on physical competence for selfworth still forces both to hurt others gamora lashes out at everyone but is always painfully aware that doing so leaves her more alone quills comparing her to his gamora only further drives home her isolation and oddly recreates the competition between her and nebula just with her and her future self she seems to decide that if she is alone unlike her other self then she needs to be more violent forceful and competent to make up for that but after seeing the love between the guardians so many times she eventually begins to see why the other gamora was happy that way as she lets herself see the good in the current guardians she finally sees the potential good in herself and begins to reach out to others in her own path

mantis defending drax and herself is the ultimate counter to selfhatred nebula defining herself by violence and physical competence causes her to lash out at the other two for their apparent lack of these values and she seems perplexed when mantis screams that nobody should need these values mantis was forced to define herself by her usefulness to ego and leaving him has not freed her from the need to have use to others despite that her bond with drax has strangely been helpful in ways that the others could never provide his bluntness means that he freely declares both her lack of physical worth and her inherent value despite that as a result she isnt as bound to her old flaw as the other characters and nebulas outburst causes mantis to stick up for herself and drax in much the same way that he has doing so causes nebula to see the true value that they have with mantis calming the aliens to avoid an unwinnable fight and drax getting the children way from danger by entertaining them nebula now considers everyone herself included as having inherent worth to the point of admirably declaring that drax is meant to be a dad rather than a destroyer

anyway i liked the movie a lot its got flaws like i wish that rocket was more active in the plot and that he could have beaten the high evolutionary in a more character driven way but the ending scene of all the guardians happy and loving themselves and each other was just beautiful",2023-05-05

"everyone’s rightfully talking about rockets rage scene but honestly the scene that got to me the most was when he sees the baby raccoons and all the other caged up animals

just the way he started tearing up as he took it all in being reminded of his own past just hit me right in the feels",2023-05-05
wondering if they shot the scene with nebula carrying a drunken quill in her arms solely so they could show it in the trailer and other promotional material and start speculation that at least one of the guardians would die in the movie if so well played i bought into almost every scene a guardian was in jeopardy because i was sure at least one character would be killed off,2023-05-05

loved the “alien abduction of kevin bacon” on the newspaper quill’s grandfather was reading in the second credit scene,2023-05-05

 does not exist so i stepped in great line,2023-05-05
james gunn knows how to write amazing characters it helps that this is one of the best all around acted mcu films the whole cast is great but wow pom klementieff surprised me,2023-05-05
nebula acknowledging that rocket’s torture was worse than what thanos put her through just made everything rocket and those poor animals go through feel even worse,2023-05-05
that hallway scene with each guardian fighting was incredible best marvel action scene in ages,2023-05-05
great use of the word ,2023-05-05
not quite sure where id rank it among the trilogy but this is easily the most consistently good mcu trilogy that beastie boys action sequence was the highlight for me,2023-05-05

ok that florence needle drop hit perfectly for me,2023-05-05
"what a ride gunn is easily one of the best filmmakers of this era a few highlights

high evolutionary looking like mason verger hannibal and somehow being comically evil while still being believably terrifying 

adam warlock reminding me of rocky rocky horror picture show his first fight was brutal mantis’ arm was an early indication of the kind of violence we were in for 

poor rocket’s backstory being worse than we could have imagined even nebula saying it was worse than what thanos did to her discovering that he really is a raccoon 

cosmo is a good dog damnit i liked that she wasn’t just a standard character in a dog body she was still a dog at her core 

drax being a dad again 

mantis with arguably the most character development of anyone in the film 

there is so much more to talk about i loved it but it will be tough to rewatch",2023-05-05
pom klementieff is so good in this movie that character could be unbearable in the wrong hands but she brings the perfect energy to every beat she has in this movie shoutout to mant,2023-05-05
"i wish rocket had smoked that guy in the final scene 

i think it would have been good closure what happened to the villain anyway not dead in the mcu unless you are explicitly killed onscreen",2023-05-05

drax stopping the children from crying made me cry

kraglin using his heart made me cry

dont get me started on all of rockets past that was brutal",2023-05-05
"with all due respect to albums like “thrak” and “discipline”  i am gonna have to disagree with adam here


wetton era king crimson  belew era",2023-05-05
it just dawn on me that the reason why high evolutionary was so obsessed and mad at rocket was because as someone who strives for perfection and wanting to create the perfect being his creation of a raccoon that in his mind is so small and vile can somehow be smarter than him probably drove him crazy and mad,2023-05-05
i’m glad mateo finally got his comeuppance,2023-05-05
the beastie boys hallway fight was one of the best shot sequences in a marvel movie in a long time my mouth was catching flies the whole scene,2023-05-05
"this is what made the mcu great awesome villain action scenes on point and character depth that makes you give a  what happens to them

i was suprizingly happy with will poulters adam warlock i was iffy when they announced the casting but he really turned in a good perfomance my only critique is that this character is too important to be shoehorned into the 3rd film of a trilogy he needs his own film series",2023-05-05
"i‘m not exaggerating when i say that every single scene involving lylla made me cry 


starting with rocket‘s first word being „hurts“ to her and then them choosing their names her death and then her in the „afterlife“ with rocket apologizing for her death 


 that was so extremely and beautiful",2023-05-05
i’ve been telling people about the healing power of florence  the machine for over a decade now and i’m very happy to see that gunn gets that,2023-05-05

i hated that villain more than thanos dont  with animals,2023-05-05
"gunn did a great job in getting me to hate the high evolutionary because whoever  with animals deserves a demise 

and rocket’s backstory is probably one of the most heartbreaking things i’ve seen in the mcu the camera panning to show teefs and flor on the floor dead after rocket kills the guards… my  my heart could not take it all i couldn’t even laugh at the scene right after that flashback which was the bike gag with drax and mantis",2023-05-05

"all this sad stuff happening i kept my composure nebula telling drax “i saw the real you i saw a dad” resulted in my feels being touched 


this movie got super deep i was truly glad they finally gave drax not only a storyline but also finally gave him something to do after wasting him in all films past the first

bradley cooper did a fantastic job 


lastly i cannot wait to see what the new guardians team has to offer groot looks insane",2023-05-05
i like how one of marvels most cruel evil villains is basically one of those teenage girls who plays animal crossing like theyre building a perfectly curated animal ethnostate,2023-05-06
i know  on chris pratt is popular these days but when rocket ‘died’ and he was desperately screaming the shot seen in the trailer that was so good that and yondu dying in vol2 the man does agonised screaming really well i think that’s the reason i’ve ended up crying in both scenes,2023-05-05
the second the showed the baby raccoons in the cage i was done when rocket was learning to talk and his friends ,2023-05-05
this movie starting with rocket listening to ‘creep’ on a zune by himself isolated and feeling detached and ending it with him playing ‘dog days are over’ and playing it over the speakers for everyone to hear finally feeling accepted with everyone knowing his faults and sharing himself with the world was  inspired guardians has never missed with its music choices even once what a  amazing send off for the guardians and i don’t think i’ve ever wanted to jump through a theatre screen and punch the day lights out of a villain more in my life that movie had me feeling every kind of emotion,2023-05-06

this is the most violent and  up pg13 comic book movie marketed to a young audience since batman returns,2023-05-06
"random thoughts i had during this movie

rockets backstory is one of the saddestcaptivating in the entire mcu
 there are multiple times in the movie when i can not wait for the story to shift back to young rocket

adam warlock felt slightly forced but if his opening scene is an indicator of things to come i am really excited for his character

the high evolutionary  not sure if the movie ever officially calls him this is the sort of villan i had hoped kang would be more chukwudi please

those ghost gang suits were amazing

the entire sequence at the orgosphere was fun the mcu needs more of that i felt the stakes were balanced really well with the humor  throughout their time there
the two times i laughed out loud in the movie were
gamora shooting the woman in the leg and gamora almost killing carrotman

gamora and quill did not need to end up together and i was happy this movie didnt force it

rocket is the heart of the film no doubt but what this story does with drax mantis and nebula is phenomenal all of the arcs end in some cool places 


in my opinion this movie lands the plane pretty well and serves as a really good end to a really great trilogy
good job gunn and crew

edit to add groots i love you",2023-05-05
"hey marvel found your jonathan majors replacements

chukwudi iwuji a badass villain performance retcon the high evolutionary into a kang variant we’ll roll with you on it

or just cast him he would be amazing",2023-05-05
probably my favorite marvel movie after infinity war the violencethe humorthe pacing really really enjoyed this movie,2023-05-05
"random thoughts on this

the mcu is at its best when it just lets a director cook james gunn is really good at this and this really feels like feige just gave him the keys and let him drive this is the first mcu movie in a long time that didn’t try to shoehorn in a young avenger or kang or anything else for the future of the franchise this is just a movie that stands on it’s own and i really appreciate that

the beastie boys scene absolutely  rocks great needle drop great cinematography great fight choreography my new favorite action scene in a superhero movie

nathan fillion stole every second he was on the screen

someone needs to make an edit of this movie that just replaces adam warlock with the kool aid man i don’t know what walls did to that guy but good lord is he out for revenge",2023-05-05
i have no idea why the most shocking thing in this movie for me is the fact that rocket is the only actual earthling in the group,2023-05-05
this movie along with all of the other guardians movies showed why feige had so much faith in gunn to led the cosmic side of the mcu its a shame that horn fired him instead of letting him do his thing to help the mcu past the infinity saga,2023-05-05

"this was phenomenal i loved it don’t really have any critiques i feel this may be one of the best marvel movies if not the best time will tell loved the kevin bacon article on the newspaper in the post credits scene

only critique is that i wish we got a little more adam warlock but i understand he’s saved for later also who was the little girl at the end during the mid credits scene like what’s her comic book character where do we think the series is going next or is it completely done  only star lord returning is an interesting idea",2023-05-05
"i’m slightly kicking myself over this 

my cat died after a very long battle with cancer a couple months ago and if i had known about all the animal scenes i would not have seen it but then i wouldn’t have seen this film and i’d probably regret that too

sooo yes that was a tragic backstory and honestly  whatever that villains name was 


on another note i really enjoyed the fact that the tune they were listening to in the animal house was based on chopin and the tune played immediately afterwards “i’m always chasing rainbows” is also based on chopin interesting way to show they’re similar but not quite the same",2023-05-05

" first movie had the best overall soundtrack but this movie had some amazing song choices 

 rocket is the mvp of this trilogy hands down him putting on his guardian uniform in the third act was applause worthy 

 those flashback sequences were so unsettling especially the last one with the deaths of lylla and the others rockets escape despite knowing he does make it away was terrifying 

 i’m so glad they didn’t have gamora fall in love with quill again instead just leaving their relationship at gamora saying “i bet we were fun”

 quill reuniting with his grandfather…that’s where i full on bawled 

 chukwudi iwuji…… he’s a good actor i loved him in peacemaker and now this but  the high evolutionary i truly didn’t think he could be worse than ego the guy who literally put a tumor in someone……but yep he was way worse he makes ego look like a disney channel villain what a capital m monster 

 nebula went from an underused character in the first movie to being yet again underused but slightly more developed in v2 to gaining a bit more development in iw and endgame…and this is where i finally fell in love with her such a great character and her rapport with the whole team was great and her breaking down when she heard rockets voice… that was so sweet",2023-05-05

"ladies and gentlemen if james gunn can bring even half the heart and love of this to superman we are in for a  treat 

some other thoughts

 the high evolutionary is straight up one of the most vile villains to ever grace the mcu yes thanos killed half the universe and red skull was a   but the unethical torturous horror of the evolutionarys experimentation and the implications of his many implied genocides makes him individually more horrible thanos by his own admission was random and dispassionate the he is petty personal and petulant the only arguably mcu character who i loath more is killgrave from jessica jones 

 i am shocked that gunn didnt  any of the major characters i thought for sure that drax or rocket was going to buy it for a second i thought that nebula was going to buy it 

 also good on gunn for not contriving to have gamora back with peter

 cosmo is good dog 

 missed opportunity not to have howard the duck as a member of the new guardians team tbh

 the legendary starlord will return solo film solo tv series i want answers marvel

 i would like to note that we see the high evolutionary try to create a ninja turtle and fail miserably

 wait was that phylafreakingvell at the end",2023-05-05
"james gunn’s writing is what the mcu has been missing this was phenomenal it reminded me why i cared in the first place the ending was sooo good and cathartic 

 seeing rocket dance and become the leader of the team  
 drax finding a way to be a dad again and dancing 
 understanding groot for the first time because we are as the audience the guardians of the galaxy 
 seeing nebula become someone devoted to caring for others 

the emotion was absolutely unreal throughout the film especially at the end when florence hit i was just dead that feeling that emotional that’s why i  care 

i’m going to miss these characters and stories i don’t know if the mcu will have emotional payoff like this again this was an endgame moment for me yes i know “the legendary starlord will return” but without gunn will it be the same 

beautiful movie and a special trilogy in my heart probably my favorite credit scene ever too rocket music theory class when 

guardians  all of mcu combined i said what i said",2023-05-05
i was destroyed when lila the otter died but then i remembered she gets reincarnated as hawkeye’s wife so it was all good,2023-05-05
"i dont like it when marvel cuts emotional scenes with a joke but the limbo scene with lyla and rocket and lyla calls rocket a raccoon and rocket responds with im not a raccoon before being brought back to life absolutely killed me it was such an incharacter move because rocket has been shown to constantly tell people that he isnt a raccoon 

and it was the perfect way of transitioning from an emotional tone to a alright im back lets get down to  business tone for the final act beautiful",2023-05-06
marvel just lost its best director,2023-05-05
"probably the biggest takeaway for most of the audience was that none of the original guardian members died and officially that star lord will return if not more as we saw in the first post credits scene 

my favorite takeaway that the audience will probably not realize is when groot says his first new dialogue “i love you guys” he is still saying “i am groot” we as the audience those that have heard the line through multiple films have heard the line long enough to finally understand groot 

clever writing by james gunn if that was intended because in the first act of the film new gamora frustratingly asks why groot only says “i am groot” it was not until the last act of the film gamora said she finally understood what groot was saying because she heard him say that same line long enough",2023-05-05
did anyone else get a new trailer for oppenheimer attached to their showing it wasnt one of the two previously released online or the imax one that was attached to avatar 2 theyve been showing before some movies,2023-05-05
best payoff in the movie was i am rocket raccoon,2023-05-05
"odd pull i know but did anyone else get franknfurter vibes from the high evolutionary yeah they have shared inspiration in frankenstein but there’s some specific beats golden himbo creation the crew believe he’s gone too far and mutiny as well as a shared 70s aesthetic that made me think frank specifically 

on a related note there’s a bit where adam warlock calls the high evolutionary a name and it gets censored by an energy blast now my hearing may not be the best and as i saw it at a screening it’s been a week or so since i saw it but did he go “you pompous fa“ before getting cut off if so wild line for a mcu movie ",2023-05-05
"there is no  thats why i stepped in

"endgame felt like the end of the mcu for me personally and this felt like the perfect epilogue everyone including the audience got closure

solid  movie my only complaint is that quill just mysteriously stopped using his mask inbetween movies which lead to a kind of underwhelming death fakeout at the end,2023-05-05
"i don’t normally write serious reviews and i was very tempted just to say “how is vin diesel’s best role just him playing a talking tree” but this film made me cry twice so here we go

this film shifted its tone about 30 thousand times and it didn’t lose me once it had the best chemistry i’ve probably ever seen in a marvel film we all know guardians is one of mcu’s best projects but my  every character in this has a unique backstory unique motivation unique relationships and we know them all inside out and we understand everything they are feeling

even the new characters feel so well established which is also down to the incredible performances by will poulter and chukwudi iwuji it made me laugh it made me cry and it made me think that there is still hope for marvel it is on par with infinity war which only slightly edges it on my all time mcu rankings 

so go watch it in the biggest loudest theatre you can find and make sure you are ready to cry",2023-05-05
"from beginning to end i feel like this movie rewarded you for being a mcu fan because of the emotional payoffs to each guardians character arc and journey since the first gotg movie not forgetting their involvement in the nonguardians movies notably and imo most understatedly are the characters of drax and mantis

we see drax coming full circle from seeking vengeance against those who killed his daughter taking on the moniker of the destroyer to having a second stab heh at being a dad having been the comic relief for gotg2 and parts of this movie as well you were born to be a father is a clear reminder of the trauma this character has faced and also the new surrogate role that he will take on post gotg3 

for draxs usual comic sidekick mantis it is as though gunn speaks directly through klementieff when she says i served what ego wanted and then i served what the guardians wanted and now it is time for me to figure out what i want its easy to forget that she never had any agency and the amicable parting of ways is the first truly independent decision that she has made for herself 

sorry for any misquotes",2023-05-06
"this series stands out to me as one of the most consistent film series that doesnt get stale every characters arc ended perfectly for me james gunn knows how to make entertaining action and drama scenes the soundtrack throughout the trilogy has been the best ever heard of in film and a lot of the visuals looked great

thought warlock was underutilized or my expectations were too high i guess they need to build him up for future films chukwudi iwuji was killer and definitely toptier in any comic villain on screen every other actor was stellar james knows how to pick his people

what a perfect way to end this group of characters its been a great journey bravo james gunn",2023-05-05
so they kinda retconned lylla didnt they in the first movie she was listed as a known associate of rockets implying she was a free being who likely participated in some dubious activities but in vol 3 she never made it out of the lab,2023-05-05
fair warning for those of you who like me have to change the channel when those sarah mclachlan aspca commercials come on theres a fair bit of animal torture and animals in cages in this movie i was a mess,2023-05-05
since endgame i’ve found every mcu movie to be pretty stale besides no way home but this one struck a different chord with me… great movie,2023-05-05
"rocket formed a new team of guardians but they didnt announce that that team will be returning only quill my guess is something will happen on earth and quill will end up being involved 

i guess mcu is done with the guardians now",2023-05-05
i love how james gunn gives every one of his films this weird and unique gross texture to it and he really pulled it all out here considering it’s an mcu film,2023-05-05
people who called a rocket death scene from the trailer were technically correct,2023-05-05
i only have one complaint about this movie they shouldve killed off high evolutionary hes probably the best mcu villain and definitely in my top 5 but  he shouldve just been killed what do you mean im a guardian of the galaxy rocket guard the galaxy by killing him,2023-05-05
"one of my favorite scene was jennifer holland trying to talk it out only to get shot mid sentence and just screaming 

reminds of the dave chappelle skit where he acted like a tough guy telling a robber that  have to shoot him to get his money robber just says ok shoots his leg and takes his money",2023-05-05
who else thought they were going to ninja turtle the  out of those turtles,2023-05-05
i love when rocket decides to save the animals the entire team turned around and followed no questions asked,2023-05-06
the constant its not a trap its a face off joke leading into them actually taking his face off was gold,2023-05-06
"wow i don’t know what i really expected from this movie but james gunn made a perfect ending to the guardians story i laughed a lot and i cried a lot and by  it had the best use of “” i have ever heard in a movie before

the gotg movies mean a lot to me  just look at my username in a lot of ways i feel like i have grown up and matured just as the characters in the movies did while it’s sad to see the guardians as i knew and loved them end sometimes that’s life and it’s the end of one thing but the start of something new for them and that’s exactly where i am right now too but that’s life and you never forget who you used to be or who you used to be with 

 i couldn’t be happier with gotg 3 and how it wrapped up everyone’s stories the guardians trilogy has always been special for me and i’ve had a deeper connection to them and their story i’m sad to see it go but i’m happy with where things ended

the mcu as a whole is going to feel so empty now without the gotg or gunn in them they both in a way were the heart of the mcu and i feel like a lot of that is going to be gone now we’ve already felt and seen a drastic quality difference in these post endgame films and with gunn and the guardians gone i fear the soul of the mcu leaves with it me personally this is where i throw in the towel the guardians were the last characters who’s stories i still cared about post endgame so now that their story ends i really have no attachment to the mcu anymore",2023-05-05
very surprising that james gunn didn’t  anyone off in this movie yes there’s a fragile closure that’s been given to everyone’s arc but there’s really nothing stopping a different director from coming in and disturbing the peace in the future maybe the mcu has more respect for gunn then that maybe the actors won’t go for it but money talks and it gets real persuasive when it does,2023-05-05
just got home and hugged my dog,2023-05-05
"“get in the  car” got the loudest mixture of gasps and laughs from my audience

“i love you guys” had my audience gasping and even had a few screaming “what he talks now” collectively

this movie was more brutal that i expected rocket’s past was rough to sit through 

the high evolutionary’s true face was scary as  i expected he’d look messed up i just didn’t expect them to show it for one and for two i didn’t expect it to look as bloody as it was really nice

this felt like a step in a more mature direction for marvel i really do hope that continues after the last few films being a bit of a misfiremiss step in my opinion this was a nice breath of fresh air

anyone else just completely love both the character and villain designs some of them reminded me of doomduke nukem i thought they all looked pretty solid even nonvillain characters like the people on counterearth you could tell there was lots of thought put into their designs

i cannot wait to watch this again",2023-05-05

"a walk off home run for gunn and the guardians high evolutionary was a great villain and chukwudi iwuji ate every second of screen time he had probably a top 3 villain of all of marvel tbh

loved it when mantis drax and nebula are on the outside of the ship struggling for air and you can see pete and the other guy falling in the background for like a split second,2023-05-05
no one is really bringing up that first adam warlock fight it was intense the hectic rush after rocket got hit mantiss arm snapping nebula and drax both getting tossed and decked into the ground groot getting slammed into just being a head i thought for a second that kraglin couldve bit the dust in the beginning when his arrow bounced,2023-05-05
"i would’ve accepted gamora and peter not getting back together if they hadn’t smiled liked that when peter blew up the ship 

the chemistry was off the charts",2023-05-05
"its just a few seconds but i think my new favorite mcu moment is when nebula cries after hearing rockets voice for the first time after he comes to

we have this character who since day one has been a programmed killing machine and nothing more for the most part sure we have her team up scenes with others some sisterly connection with gamora those brief moments with tony on the ship and rocket on the ground in endgame but mostly its all about her and her objective and how she can get from point a to point b with or without those near her

in volume 3 she has those moments of intensity with mantis and drax she seems just done with quills  and she just wants to help her friend but its not until she hears rockets voice for that first time that we see that crack in that tough facade she shows an emotional response of love and gunn makes sure we see it its beautiful even if she didnt mean to display that emotion perfect moment for a wonderful character",2023-05-06
"rockets back story was so heart breaking made w remember his quote in gotgv1 when he said i turned my back on the world because the world turned its back on me or close to that didnt look it up but really put it into perspective

i love how apparent it is that rocket means so much to nebula especially since they were the only two of the group that weren’t blipped,2023-05-05
so i freaking love mantis and i think this film finally did her place in gotg justice her brutal honesty with nebula and drax before they were captured was perfect for how her character naturally evolved very pleased to see her go out that way and to be the one who recognised it would be unfair to try to make quill stay but to go out to “find herself” i’ve got big hopes we’ll see her again,2023-05-05
"its a small thing but i loved the runninggag of mantis falling down in a neckbreaking manner i wish she was more prominent in the movie but she still had a couple of scenes to shine and was a big part of the christmas special so i cant complain

"loved that quills grandpa is named jason such a great reference to the comics same with the reveal of rockets full name what a great twist that was most likely planned from the beginning when watching the first movie i questioned why they chose not to call him rocket raccoon it all makes sense now the wait was absolutely worth it 

also was not expecting quills shirt at the end stinger of all the retro cereals they could have picked to reference they went with a super short lived and obscure one love it",2023-05-08

at first i was a little put off by groot speaking english by saying i love you guys but then i realized that wasnt what was going on at all its established just a bit before that gamora now understands groot but its not like she learned his language all of a sudden but instead that she has spent enough time with him and gotten to know him that she understands him now she grocks groot so when we hear groot say i love you guys at the end hes still saying i am groot its just that we the audience have spent enough time with groot that we too finally understand him such a beautiful way for james gunn to express his love and gratitude for all us fans,2023-05-05

"havent seen it mentioned here yet but groots final words being i love you guys was fantastic it was a masterclass in show dont tell as weve seen every character that meets him except thor utterly confused at his language yet over the films theyve clearly come to learn it

us hearing that was a beautiful way to basically include the audience as part of the family showing us that weve spent enough time with him to understand him beautiful",2023-05-12
"so that’s what happens when a movie director genuinely loves the characters he gave life to on the screen

the guardians are the ones that got me into the mcu volume 2 was my very first imax experience volume 3 my first hollywood premiere experience i watched the movie again today in my hometown i was an emotional wreck at the end hit me right in the feels

i never knew a raccoon would make me cry over and over again but the entire rocket storyline is the most beautiful and tragic ones on the mcu 

it also hit me on a very personal level as i had a postdeath experience after a heart attack twelve years ago and what rocket experienced… well that reminded me twelve years ago when i rewatched “that” scene i just lost it

on top of that i know the soundtrack is amazing but the score itself is absolutely phenomenal especially the score revolving around rocket and the high evolutionary

needless to say this became my favorite mcu movie ever and i know it will remain my favorite mcu movie ever

if you dont at least enjoy this then head to the hospital because youre dead inside this rocked,2023-05-05
nobody talking about how we just saw a literal mirror planet of earth explode onscreen in an mcu movie as a real consequence to the story instead of some flashback or offscreen like xandar like civilians literally exploding and dying in front of the main characters i enjoyed watching how dark it got,2023-05-05
lets also acknowledge that one of the reasons guardians v3 works so well is because its really not an mcu movie its a guardians movie it has zero connective tissue or threads to other storylines plots or characters gunn was allowed to focus on the closing chapter of his trilogy and didnt have to worry about servicing a bigger overarching plot marvel needs more of this to right the ship give us good movies about contained character stories  then do crossover movies,2023-05-06

this will go down as one of my absolute favorite marvel movies the guardians trilogy is a gift and i would easily watch this again  definitely a fantastic film that i think will will be praised and remembered fondly in the future,2023-05-05
"i had really high expectations for this movie not only because of how much i enjoyed the previous two guardians movies but also due to how good the suicide squad and peacemaker were and somehow not only were those expectations met but in a lot of ways they were surprassed the acting from everyone was amazing the visuals were on point and the action was brutal and really showcases how a pg13 rating doesnt matter when the people behind the movies are creative the plot on the other hand was exactly what i hoped for completely focused on the characters weve come to love and lengthy enough to showcase everyone and give every single guardian a satisfying ending speaking of expectations i along with i assume many others came into the movie expecting at least one guardian to pass away and yet despite loving a good emotional character death i was very happy to see that not a single one died and i didnt feel cheated i think its a lot harder to not rely on death as a way to close out a character story compared to what the movie did 

the high evolutionary however was what surprised me the most in a really positive way james gunn had talked up chukwudi iwuji a lot during the wait for the movie and yet i was still shocked at how good he was at playing such a brutal and cruel villain every time he showed up i not only wanted him gone but feared what he might do for a franchise like marvel to not normally have the best villains hes a huge breath of fresh air 

as you can probably guess i really recommend this movie it doesnt feel rushed and the jokes range from alright to hilarious and never undercut the emotional beats the movie is going for its by far the best movie marvel has put out since infinity war and really shows the difference between a movie made by someone who loves what hes doing vs someone who was paid to do so i dont want even want to think how this movie would have turned out without james gunn but at the same time i cant wait to see what he does at dc if this movie is any indication superman legacy is going to be amazing",2023-05-05

as much as high evolutionary is arguably not very deep as a character i really applaud the performance in the flashback scenes with rocket it’s literally an abuser with a victim he degrades rocket makes him feel less than and tears him down all while manipulating rocket into thinking he’s a good guy,2023-05-05

"a lot of people have said what i want to say so i’m just going to say that this was an amazing movie it’s not an untouchable piece of cinema but it’s one of the best mcu movies in years amazing character development above all else and the balance of darkness and humor was perfect this is what thor love  thunder thought it was doing

i cried like 4 times",2023-05-05
what a great movie  it made this grown man cry a few times  i had no idea this was going to tied around rockets past and it was beautifully done  this was a very dark and mature movie so maybe not geared towards kids but i appreciate the talent of james gunn  i hope marvel pays attention to this when choosing future writers directors as they understand the task and not trying to check all the boxes in terms of diversity,2023-05-05
drax imitating a “monkey” read robot for the kids got me such a sweet moment and great recognition of his character story,2023-05-06
"feige gunn and a lot of the cast crashed our showing at the chinese and talked to the audience a bit


this is one of the reasons why you go to the most famous movie theater on the planet",2023-05-06
"the thing i’ve always appreciated about these movies is that the conflict is never quite “we have to save the whole world” it’s always more micro based it’s always “we have to save this world or these people right now” 

it what still lends these movies to having stakes and make me still feel anxious to see what happens 

i think james gunn stuck the landing and this will go down as a cohesive fun and memorable part of the marvel universe",2023-05-06
"started from 

“someday i’m going to make great machines that fly and me and my friends are going to go flying together into the forever and beautiful sky lylla and teefs and floor and me rocket”

went through

rocket teefs floor go now rocket teefs floor go now

and through

this story has been yous all along you just didnt knew it

finished at

names rocket rocket raccoon",2023-05-06
"man they genuinely took a risk with this one this might turn off some general audiences that just wanted to see the guardians say some funny zingers

everyone who was invested in guardians as an exploration of what it means to move past trauma will love it though

every bold choice marvels made recently felt like it had someone there to rein it back into vanilla mcu territory whether its the raimi weirdness in dr strange 2 supporting a fairly typical superhero movie origin for america or whatever her name was or ms marvels scott pilgrimesque style disappearing after only a couple episodes

this didnt feel like that it felt like a james gunn movie as much or more than any other james gunn movie",2023-05-06
loved the ravager who was a sorcerer just casually opening portals,2023-05-06
the ending shot of all the guardians sitting on the wall just perfection absolutely loved the movie and it might be my most favorite marvel movie so far,2023-05-07
"is there a general consensus that in this movie groot sounded much closer to vin diesels actual voice compared to his previous iterations  even his adult form in the first movie sounded nothing like him but this time you could almost hear his recognizable gravelly tone

i wonder if that also was an intentionally a tongue and cheek meta joke in addition to the audience finally understanding him",2023-05-08
"i have nothing to add to what everyone else has said about this movie it was great legitimately the only thing thats been great out of marvel since endgame imo 

but did anyone else have this sense of sadness that this may be the last great marvel project for some time james gunn is gone now a lot of this cast is never coming back so thats it for the guardians as we know them and marvel has had such a bad track record these last few years that i just have little hope that we are going to get anything this good for a long time add in the fact that jonathan majors as kang is probably done as well i just left the theater feeling like this might have been the official cap on the good quality mcu movies that ive grown up loving",2023-05-09
seems to be quite a strong message against animal abuse and testing which is good,2023-05-09
i love how the teased for probably a year “someone is gonna die” when really they basically all made it out and found them selves and was actually in a way a happy ending,2023-05-05
"every time it jumped to the flashback scenes i was like well here comes the waterworks didnt help that i have cats as well

i absolutely adored the movie but i dont know if ill be able to watch it again because those scenes killed me

that no sleep till brooklyn scene though was exquisite",2023-05-05
"one thing i was not expecting  i can’t remember the last time a movie has made me want the bad guy to die was much as this one did  no mcu movie ever has  the moment where gamora stabbed him and ripped his maskface off was so satisfying  

i think we’ll see him again and hope they top it for when he finally dies 

it does bode a bit ill for the mcu’s grand plan that two movies into phase five kang is already only the second best purplewearing tech based villain with a connection to one of the heroes’ pasts that we’ve seen  at this point have the end credits scene of the marvels be kamala accidentally knocking a nuke into an interdimensional portal where it kills the entire  council without anyone knowing or acknowledging it",2023-05-05
i didn’t expect to get emotional over a raccoon today i also didn’t expect to get emotional over a raccoon a second time rocket’s past was heartbreaking,2023-05-05
"i loved the movie but i do wish they got to use adam warlock more we’ve been waiting years for his reveal and in typical marvel fashion he’s used for a few minutes because ultimately they want to use him for a future movie and didn’t know how else to use him without his power level messing with the plot it’s not as atrocious as captain marvel’s usage in end game but it’s up there 

makes me really want to replay the guardians of the galaxy video game lol",2023-05-05
"i love that nobody died from the main group most everyone has been doing that thing where they write the movie in their head and just go to see if its as good as they wrote in their head for a long time now 

and for some reason people need death of major characters for something to be considered good",2023-05-05
cosmo is my favorite fictional character of all time,2023-05-05
"i’m really glad yet depressed that this movie confirmed my suspicion that i still like marvel movies the writing just has been trying way too hard while this felt so natural and full of love again


anyways this movie is so  good a lot more dark and emotional compared to the previous guardians and even a lot of marveldisney movies but the fun moments are still hilarious i really like that james gunn subverted us by not actually killing anyone but just having them grow up and go their separate ways for now peter going back to his grandpa was especially so sweet 

i have a very special connection with this particular series and i’m gonna really miss it dc fans are going to have it so good coming up in a few movies though",2023-05-05
so has rocket literally never had a single injury until this moment,2023-05-06
im still recovering from the flashback scenes they really messed me up as an animal lover,2023-05-06
"really enjoyed this film at this point i’m blindly following james gunn into any project he’s apart of gotg peacemaker suicide squad…his formula is great one passion project after another for this film especially being the trilogy finale i feel that gunn ended it as a love letter to all of the gotg fan base 2 hours of messing with my ethos and pathos didn’t expect to be emotionally connected to a animated raccoon’s journey but sure enough i was all characters given their rightful sendoffs and ending the film with some florence in a gotgfashioned dance party  brilliant 

this was a fun 9 years thanks jg",2023-05-06
"it’s criminal how little they dug into drax’s character he’s got layers man i felt terrible for him when mantis was defending him and told him he was  he was genuinely hurt there was something really cold in mind wiping him like that it seemed almost like a routine thing that she does

we got a little taste of it in pt1 i think when mantis touches him and she starts sobbing there’s something really deep there",2023-05-06
"i scrolled too far and didnt see it but the biggest reward for us is that we now understand groot
 
when he said i love you guys at the end my friend and i looked at each other like   then it dawned on me that he didnt really say that he said i am groot but we actually understand him now",2023-05-08
"i cried three times while watching this movie

one thing i like about james gunn is that hes able to make you care about characters who dont really exist like a talking raccoon isnt a real thing but we still feel for rocket learning about his past was heartbreaking 

and someone brought this up but when rocket says thats no excuse to get everyone dead along the way it was probably in reference to teefs and floor dying he probably blamed himself because he attacked the high evolutionary instead of just escaping

it sucks that this is the final gotg film but you know what it ended on the perfect note everything was wrapped up perfectly and it was nice to see these characters grow throughout the three movies",2023-05-08
theres so much to love about this movie as far as the lovable protagonists and their interactions go but i really want to highlight the villain high evolutionary was a top 5 mcu baddie for me right up there with thanos loki and kilmonger he had an easy to understand motivationgoal he was despicable the performance was delicious and it was a treat to see panic and disbelief set in every time his plans continued to crumble we were all happy to see him get his face peeled off in the end,2023-05-08
"when gunn captioned the movie once more with feeling he massively overdid it
i love how he gives you time to breathe all the emotion in like he couldve just shot the bare minimum of rocket saving a bunch of animals but noooo
lets have rocket approach a bunch of baby raccoons who are all scared have one sniff him up and pull off a how to train your dragon have all of them climb on to him show joy  relief on a cgi raccoon
and not just this
the flashbacks the hallway fight the characters the music



this movie gave me a better bitter sweet sensation than endgame",2023-05-08
adam warlocks entrance did not have to go that hard,2023-05-09
"i‘m happy with how they handled gamora i was bracing for an awkward as  kiss when she landed on top of quill

mantis leaving with the three giant monsters was a cool shot kinda hope they pop up in the future when you dont expect it

the biggest miss for me was not killing the villain especially if you portray him as utterly unredeemable and after going through his underlings like a buzzsaw i hate that trope",2023-05-18
"no one mentioning groot saying i love you guys 

the implication being that we the audience finally learned to understand him because weve been with him for long enough that was really sweet",2023-07-15
i am shocked that all the guardians made it out intact,2023-05-05
absolutely wonderful,2023-05-05
“open the  door”,2023-05-05
i really liked this movie it made me feel something again while watching it and that’s not something i’ve been able to do with other marvel movies as of late i do think that the use of the fbomb could’ve been better used maybe when gamora was yelling at quill in the ship or rocker when he’s fighting the main villain idk using the fbomb on the door handle was a bit of a waste also the gaurdians seemed to be extra rude to each other in this movie mantis seemed to be getting the most of it it felt like,2023-05-05
i loved the movie and im going to see it a second time this weekend,2023-05-05

after seeing this i have renewed hope for gunn’s superman movie,2023-05-06

"that was one of the more visually unpleasant films i’ve seen in a while animal torture mechanical animal cyborgs furryworld meatstation frozenbloated chris pratt i genuinely felt queasy during several parts of the movie it was also really heavy handed there were lots of big emotional scenes but they didn’t feel earned like there wasn’t enough build up they just cut to scene and bolted on some cliche cathartic stuff but catharsis is also as good as the tension it releases and i don’t think this movie did a good enough job also i didn’t like the quick cuts between gross and horrific scenes and funny ones it was hard to appreciate the one liners while still really from the bodyhorror in the previous scene

also the pseudokiss between rocket and the otter was awful we laughed out load in the theater because it was so out of place and offputting",2023-05-16
rockets cry at lylas death was  brutal,2023-05-21
why cant high evolutionary just heal his face he is master of genetics and modifications,2023-07-07
"can anyone explain why in the scene where the animals escape from the spaceship mantis throws a monkey at a womans face which then attacks her leaving scratches on her face

considering the emphasis on rocket scratching the high evolutionarys face disfiguring him it seems an inappropriate choice for a cheap laugh",2023-07-15
"the high evolutionary is perhaps the most hateable mcu villain to date  everything about him made me want to see him get his  kicked

beautiful emotional moments and perfect balance of humour with drama absolutely fantastic

great end to this trilogy",2023-05-05
"been a nerd long before ironman and a major mcu fanboy ever since that  


this was my favourite mcu outing in a long time it was incredible that no matter what tone the movie shifted toit landed the emotional lows had half the cinema blubbering the actionpacked highs had everyone cheeringand between drax just draxing and open the  door the cinema was in hysterics between tears and edge of the seat scenes  


by the time the gang was talking about splitting up and we realised gamorra wasnt going to just be cheaply reinserted as newbutold gamorra phew  


loved all the characters props to adam warlock for not getting overused and high evolutionary  outstanding not since tony leung in shangchi had i enjoyed a villains portrayal so damned much

props to gunn i know hes a dcite now but guardians reinstilled some hope for the mcu in me yet",2023-05-05

"loved it best marvel movie since infinity war imo felt like a real movie and not a typical mcu next adventure

great balance of humor and drama a great plot every character had a moment or three to shine and a tremendously satisfying ending

i especially love how gunn gave each of the heroes a cathartic ending with real closure without having to  a single one of them off thats an easy way to pull the heartstrings but he managed to do it with everyone surviving to the end it felt like watching the ds9 finale what you leave behind

i cant wait to see james gunn revive superman",2023-05-05

i liked the irony of purple nurple being fixated on what make rocket unique  his brain but he also wouldnt accept rocket because his outside wasnt pretty meanwhile purple nurple was trying to perfect the universe while his own outside was far from perfect this whole movie addressed people not accepting their own flaws in others i didnt like it because it was hard to watch but ive been thinking about it all day,2023-05-05
holy  what a movie the mcu has never hit me in the feels the way this one did and multiple times too but on top of that it was really funny had some great action and set pieces some amazing performances too particularly chukwudi iwuji as the high evolutionary seriously give that dude an oscar personally my favorite character in this one was nebula though shes had such a satisfying character arc and her range of emotions in this one really hit home for me best mcu film since endgame,2023-05-06
"dont be rash


he might not have done a lot but man i loved adam in this movie",2023-05-06
something i havent seen brought up is that this movie is the first one to call rocket by his full comic book name and the scene where he calls himself rocket raccoon is actually a badass well set up scene,2023-05-07
lotta great stuff and a lotta really not great stuff best performances in the trilogy but overall a disappointing final film for me really odd filmmaking choices that just didnt feel like guardians i hold the 1st 2 to such a high standard and this didnt live up at all fun  emotional but they deserved a better final film,2023-05-07
"there were a couple scenes that honestly made me surprised that this film got a pg13 rating i guess dismemberment and gore is fine when its aliens

"the no sleep till brooklyn sequence was an alltimer

i’d have liked to see more adam warlock

this movie could’ve used an rrrstyle card up front warning people about the  they were about to see

other than that this was an immensely satisfying conclusion to the trilogy i don’t think viewers need to see the new guardians in action to know that rocket found his closure and that everyone is where they ought to be",2023-05-08
i think its a little funny that the only truly great movie marvel has released in in the past few years is a movie written and directed by the guy who is now in charge of their biggest competitor,2023-05-09
probably my favorite marvel movie since endgame that was great,2023-05-09
it may if been a end credits scene but rocket really proved himself as a great leader in that short screen time  he starts off with a group activity of asking everyone’s fav music artist  one member offers to get the job done on their own and he says it’ll be easier and better to do it as a team when the youngest member ask member ask if he ever feels bad for hurting creatures he acknowledges that he does but that the people they protect need this help and it’s for the  greater good,2023-05-09
"i swear theres an onion cutting lounge next to this theatre im rewatching it like the 4th time  i still cant hold it in whenever we flashback to teen rocket 


fr though despite lacking a major character death like yondu this movie elicited more emotions than any other mcu moviei havent stopped feeling bad ever since i first watched this film damnit gunn you really went out of your way to make this film the most heartfelt ending ive ever experienced",2023-05-09
"i really enjoyed this i didnt love all of the needle drops though there are definitely some banger moments that james gunn enhanced with music

hallway onetake fight is great but how many line up the guardians of the galaxy for a hero shot moments do we need theres like 3 in every one of these movies

i love the little treat with groot at the end there when we can finally understand him a trait that only occurs in other guardians up to that point iirc

no deaths was a big surprise for me i expected drax or rocket im glad i like getting closure with everyone and it not being a horrible drama

peter going home makes sense its what weve been asking this whole time why since hes been adventuring has he not gone home we all know the short answer is that peter is afraid but i feel that hed probably be past that fear by now after all of his experiences im glad we got some form of conclusion

what a weird tension between rocket and peter at the very end when theyre freeing the animals quill is surprised and annoyed that rocket an animal wants to rescue animals

7 or 810 great capper to the gotg trilogy",2023-05-09
i don’t think i enjoyed this one as much as people are out there largely because of the messiness but it’s still an emotionally satisfying conclusion to this team i just wish that marvel will trust their filmmakers more like they did for james gunn yes he contributed to the excessive storylines and characters in this film but at least this film felt like a singular vision which was lacking in recent mcu properties,2023-05-10
"just watched the film happy to see a decent entertaining mcu movie after no way home higher evolutionary is a villain you cannot sympathize with that  deserved to die and when you hate the character that actor really portrayed it very well

loved the character arcs for all the characters for some reason loved how the team never gave up on rocket who has been my favorite since guardians 1 had its comic moments and i almost tear dropped at rockets backstory but thankfully the shift in tonal balance by the inbetween humour helped to control my emotions thats what is needed  a balance of humour and tonal shifts

only complain i have is warlock  warlock could have been used better but apart from that loved the movie favorite segment of the movie has to be the counter earth one filled with lot of intense moments",2023-05-12
the body horror in this movie was incredible truly showed how despicable the high evolutionary was,2023-05-24
meanest hardest pg13 since the ‘80s glad to see gunn allowed to bring his vision to life seemingly without compromise,2023-05-05
solid flick its like they wrote the script then filmed the movie,2023-05-05
i really enjoyed this one had a lot of heart and was surprisingly dark at times thought all the endings for the guardians were very good,2023-05-05
wonder what will happen with quill on earth like will he become famous like the avengers because hes probably the biggest hero on the planet with a lot of space and alien knowledge,2023-05-05
what the  was that emotional whiplash of a movie,2023-05-05
loved it tbh absolutely fitting end to gunns trilogy so happy he didnt have gamora just fall in love with quill at the end and for quill to realise that they were different people teared up at the end and a couple times throughout imo definitely has been marvels best additions to the cinematic library,2023-05-05
i liked when rocket and his other little friends tried to escape with his key card the writers decided that during basically the entire sequence his rabbitspider friend should yell the exact same sentence over and over even though the last two words were unintelligible,2023-05-05
that final post credits scene was such a troll,2023-05-05
“you were born to be a dad” gunn you son of a  also what i think makes the guardians work is they are just really awesome space adventures remove the mcu connections and these films still work thank you mr gunn,2023-05-05
"i guess i missed it but i don’t understand 

when rocket was revived he says something like “where’s nebula” then goes something like “because the code is right up there on the wall”

what code is he talking about it’s not his heart security code is it",2023-05-06
"with multiverse of madness being very middling as a dr strange movie and a followup to wandavision love and thunder being unbearably unfunny every time the villain wasnt on screen and quantumania feeling like it lacked guidance in everything from the visuals to the writing it was nice seeing a consistently good mcu movie james gunn was able to make a compelling conclusion to a series of movies that could have easily focused too much on the spectacle or the comedy

the biggest problem i would say was that the movie would pingpong way too quickly between a shockingly dark tone and the broad humor expected from the series the darker scenes worked surprisingly well better than the funnier scenes even but it would go right back to trying to be funny almost immediately when those scenes involved cg characters i was getting flashbacks to dobbys death scene in halfblood prince and how impossible it was to take seriously rockets backstory was definitely written well but i think it would have worked better as a 1015 minute interlude rather than being cut up like it was

the postendgame mcu as a whole is definitely still shaky at best but taking the trilogy on its own it felt a bit jarring to shift the focal point to the talking raccoon but it was pulled off pretty well good performances great visuals and solid writing so id really recommend it if youve seen and liked the first two",2023-05-07
"the one take towards the end was one of the most impressively choreographed cinematic things ive seen in years didnt expect to see something that impressive in this film of all places ive been bemoaning the lack of good action choreography for what seems like forever and this just comes out with one of the most impressive sequences in a longass time

"i think one thing its not getting enough credit for is how for the first time in a long time its a mcu with a solid act 3 mom shang chi and eternals all really missed the mark in the ending

but this worked and its nice to see the highlight being the superheros saving people over big cgi punch ups especially when the final fight wasnt the evolutionary being cool but rather just getting absolutley shanked",2023-05-07
i walked in to this movie blind and now i might turn vegan,2023-05-07
"what are your thoughts on the soundtrack 

i personally believe that vol 2 still has the best soundtrack in the trilogy with vol 1 being a close second 

i enjoyed this soundtrack maybe not as much as the previous ones but it fits really well in the movie giving the fact that theyre playing music from a zune it is only natural for there to be genre mixing i saw someone complain that the music in this movie isnt consistent as the first two yes because the first two are mix tapes and this is just someones mp3 library its the way it is for a reason 

i was really happy that they included some some of my personal fav songs i love creep badlands and do you realise yoshimi battles the pink robots is one of my fav albums so im glad that the flaming lips got some love since you been gone and in the meantime are two songs ive never heard before that are just amazing 

however there were some songs i still kinda feel iffy about them being no sleep till brooklyn and dog days are over i like the beastie boys but it felt kinda out of place and overdone dog days are over i gotta say tiktok ruined it for me and it will forever be known as a tiktok song to my ears tiktok aside im not the biggest fan of the song and i feel that it didnt work that well and that there couldve been so many better alternatives thats just me though",2023-05-08
"did anyone else laugh out loud at the jokes throughout the movie i found pretty much anything drax said to be funny  from now anything  dave bautista is in im seeing

i totally thought that nebula would be a throwaway character after infinity war and i couldnt be happier that they developed her character with the depth that they have one of the most pleasant surprises in the mcu for me,2023-05-13
guess i’m in the minority here i left the movie feeling an emotional wreck i thought it was more depressing than anything ,2023-05-16
"im glad to see that guardians 3 has already surpassed ant man 3 at the boxoffice i believe this will be marvels biggest boxoffice movie for some time i predict marvels being a huge flop 

gaurdians 3 is in many ways the end of an era it is james gunns last marvel movie and the gotg actors will no longer be a part of the franchise i think everything after this will be downhill for marvel",2023-05-18
best mcu movie in a long time,2023-05-22
"rocket’s animal friends hit me at every freakin point 

the bunny being innocent and simple 

the walrus being slow and in a wheelchair

and the otter being super cute and the most personable 

i am a wreck can’t say i’ll be watching it again but it was a great ending overall",2023-05-23
it broke me in the best way it perfectly summed up a goodbye to the childhood i was leaving behind that i entered when i saw the first movie at 14 it was dark and sad and emotional and raw and every single thing movies are allowed to be now it breaks my heart i won’t see the core five together again with gamora and drax permanently done but i am glad starlord and rocket will be able to live and countinue on in other films,2023-05-26
did anyone find it kinda weird that after all that the midcredit scene was immediately rocket about to  a bunch of animals,2023-05-26
"overall i really liked it 

things i liked

mantis probably stole the show “forget” was my hardest laugh of the film 

rocket’s backstory was well done 

the alien designs were awesome the portal sorcerer in the ravagers was especially coollooking 

the “bad dog” running gag was fun 

the hallway fight is top tier one of the best fight sequences in the mcu imo

villain was solid not amazing but definitely my favourite of the guardians’ enemies

overall pacing felt good

things i disliked 

soundtrack felt weaker this time around 

could have used a bit tighter editing we didn’t really need that many slow motion walks for instance

rocket should have gotten a bit more to do before and after he got injured i know this was his story but it didn’t quite feel like it entirely 

the children scene with drax was pretty corny 

i know that infighting is the group’s shtick but doubting each other’s capabilities at this point is pretty dumb 

assuming there’s a 4th one coming with a new rocketlead group i would have liked mantis and nebula to have stuck around for it feels disappointing that we only got them as official guardians for one volume 

overall it felt like a good sendoff if they continue from here with rocket’s guardians then i am on board if they stop it entirely then this was a solid finale to the story",2023-05-27
"i  tried at a computergenerated raccoon holding a dying computergenerated cyborg otter in his arms and then again when she returned to tell him that its all right and its not his time to die yet bastards

this was a triumph im not as negative about love  thunder or quantumania as many other folks are but what james gunn accomplished here still dwarfs those films it closes the book on this ragtag family of misfits with some of the franchises hardesthitting emotional beats without losing its own identity or getting mired too deep into misery if gunn can handle superman with half as much grace and skill as we saw here the futures gonna be so bright well all be wearing shades",2023-05-05
reminder that elon musks neuralink has killed 1500 animals including pigs sheep and monkeys in the process of trying to put computer chips in their brains something to think about for everyone who was understandably disgusted by the high evolutionary,2023-05-11
"i really wanted to love this movie as much as the other two but i thought this was the weakest of the trilogy it was still great don’t get me wrong

when the emotional beats hit they really hit rocket’s backstory was done perfectly the visuals were fantastic the characters all had great arcs and satisfying conclusions i think the balance of humor in this was a big improvement from vol 2 which i thought had way too many emotional moments undercut by lame jokes this one still had jokes but they weren’t used to sacrifice the emotional moments other than that quillgamora suit conversation but i thought that joke was worth it

my issue with the movie is that the tone just felt off compared to the other 2 guardians movies i think part of it was that the music sort of took a back seat for most of the movie in the first two the music really felt like a significant part of the story and most of the songs had notable needle drops in this one it felt like the majority of the music was thrown in just cause they had the zune i’d say there were 3 good needle drops in this one creep no sleep till brooklyn dog days are over seems like gunn tried to tie the zune to rocket more in this but it just didn’t have the same impact for me as quill’s tapes

the other factor was that i wasn’t a big fan of how the team was split up in the 2nd act nebulamantisdrax and quillgroot especially with rocket out of commission for most of the movie i think we’ve seen plenty of drax and mantis together in vol 2 and the holiday special and i really wish they would’ve been split up so we could see some different dynamics like maybe have mantis with peter since they’re siblings and groot is great and all but it doesn’t allow much conversation to be had between the characters when he’s in a duo with rocket being in a sort of coma for most of the movie all we get of him are the flashbacks which while great are a completely different character from the rocket we’ve grown to love over the years with this being the conclusion to gunn’s iteration of the team i don’t think it was the best choice to have one of them ko’d for 80 of it it just kinda threw off the dynamic in my opinion",2023-05-05
teef waving in the purgatory got me,2023-05-05
"i just came from an intimate screening at the alamo with a qa involving the editor and the exec producer i was able to tell them that this movie did a perfect job of blending heart and comedy without sacrificing the other…something marvel hasn’t been able to do in a while i didn’t tell them that part

the exec producer revealed a small detail that people might have missed that drax was carrying the high evolutionary back to the ship in the end 

also when asked half of my theater was mixed on how groot spoke a new line at the end half of my theater guessed that groot learned how to speak english and the other half the correct half answered that we finally learned how to understand groot

another fun detail is the editor  used his twoyearold to record the line for baby rocket which is the second instance i’ve heard of this as another editor i know that works on the mandolorian used his twoyearold to voice baby yoda 

which just goes to show you fellow editors if you have a baby cast them ",2023-05-05
chris pratt haters can  it killed it in this movie,2023-05-05
im not gonna lie this movie was pretty dark i thought it should have been rated r quill almost dying was messed up and when gamora literally peels a face off was horrifying this was a strange movie i liked it and disliked it at the same time if that makes any sense,2023-05-10
"in short i loved it even though its not quite as tight or tonally perfect as the previous entries i think the guardians have the strongest movies of any of the linear series in the marvel universe and i think they are the best thing to come out of the franchise so it was honestly great to see it go out on a high note this movie may be a tad over stuffed and long but you will never doubt gunns love for these characters and these characters love for each other 

i was an absolute mess for the last thirty minutes of this movie or so i think one thing that will take people by surprise is that it doesnt weave as seamlessly between comedy and emotion as the first two this one is a lot more emotional partially because a lot of these closed off characters are at a point where they are openly loving to each other and partially because this does feel like a big goodbye from gunn 

hes been with these characters and this cast for a decade now and you can really feel how much it means to all of them i think the first two movies are great at the balance but i loved this for its own reason of being unabashedly heartfelt it seems like every character gets an arc that lets their best self shine drax especially got some nice shine and i thought i was holding it together pretty well until he was waving goodbye to mantis at the end and i was devastated 

also very glad that this is very much rockets film he always did feel like the most vulnerable and interesting character to me and despite him spending half this movie in a coma hes the key to this whole movie hes the motivation for the villain and the guardians hes our connection to the importance of friends with his flashbacks and he is seemingly now the only one keeping the guardians going in some form i think it was kind of cheating to open this movie with a shot of his baby raccoon eyes but what gunn has done with that character is nothing short of amazing 

most of my complaints about this movie were also things i was happy to overlook for the overall effect it definitely feels long but that also makes it feel more final and gives some of the emotional moments time to breathe its not as zany or comical as the previous but that seems to have been replaced by some really visceral body horror and i kinda loved that and while the movie feels a bit bloated especially with warlock who seemed like a very predictable section of the movie its clearly set up for future stuff and i feel like at this point with marvel youre either on board for that stuff or not plus i will never say no to more debicki in movies 

overall i dont think its my favorite of the three vol 2 is one of my favorite marvel movies overall but its a grand cap to the trilogy and is strong enough to make this one of the best trilogies out there of any franchise gunn has really done something amazing with these characters and its wild to think that a decade ago vol 1 was marvels big swing chris actually uses his charisma in this role unlike jurassic pom is literally perfect everyone is just great and more importantly you get the feeling theyre all actually friends who love each other as far as marvel movies go its a 910 for me all three are

traumatising,2023-05-05
what a movie i don’t know that i’ll be able to rewatch it as much as i have with the first two it had an incredibly happy ending but still extremely heavy overall i usually watch gotg when i want to be cheered up wouldn’t change a thing though except i wish the “heavenly” versions of rocket’s friends were themselves as normal animals without the robotic parts i also think i’ll be able to enjoy it more on a second viewing knowing that the guardians all make it that was high stress,2023-05-05
it was good and surprisingly dark for a guardians movie however i personally thought that if they teased death rocket and peter they should at least have committed to it,2023-05-05
when nebula said to drax that he was created not to be a destroyer but to be a father… that almost made me sob in the middle of the theater 30 year old dude here incredible movie and such a good send off for the franchise hope to see more of adam warlock feels like we only scratched the surface of his storycapabilities,2023-05-05

"i really really enjoyed this movie all the stories beats hit very well it didnt feel as contrived as the other recent marvel flicks and it was actually a good blend of funny and serious

i hope this is a sign of things turning a corner cause as someone whos finally been feeling marvel fatigue after the last few releases im glad i went to see this one release night",2023-05-05

such an iconic part of the character starlord but not once in the film did he wear it

i cried at the animal abuse and how rockets first word was hurt  i liked the part where he scratched his face off and how the other abusers died for their heinous crimes ,2023-05-05
i am confusded at where mantis is suppose to go when she left with those 3 gigantic beasts while shes still in knowhere,2023-05-05
i like it as a whole  yet i felt that the song choices were odd  an awful lot of times the lyrics but not the beat were dissonant with the actions onscreen  at first i figured that it was an intentional choice  but after thinking about it more i think that is not the case  i believe that there was no irony intended,2023-05-05
this was fantastic all around amazing character moments from the heroes to the villains this is coming from someone who hated the second movie i guess the 1st was just too good but this one matched if not topped the emotional weight of the 1st still not the biggest fan of james gunns humor but he did manage to get some chuckles from me great movie to go out on gonna miss james but i can’t wait for legacy now,2023-05-05
what a terrible day to have emotions,2023-05-06
they should make the high evolutionary a kang variant and recast it like that,2023-05-06
i love this movie but never want to watch it again  did i shed man tears multiple times lol,2023-05-06
"the movie gradually broke me down emotionally with rocket’s backstory and near death but i truly didn’t expect the yondu cameo the ending of guardians 2 is my favourite scene in the entire mcu and to see him one last time delivering such a great final line to kraglin was where the waterworks started and just kept going and going the hallway fight had me beaming with joy rocket liberating the raccoons hit me in my soul and the entire ending was so perfect for every character that i felt nothing but content by the end 

james gunn is such an inspiration to me as a creative and i feel really grateful to have experienced these movies at the times in my life when i did",2023-05-06
"for a family movie with disney behind it this film had some ridiculously disturbing visuals from the cybernetic  abominations to the high evolutionary’s “face”… i was impressed

all in all i was happy rocket has been my favorite thing about marvel since i first saw him in marvel vs capcom years before guardians 1… and i’ve been dying for an origin story",2023-05-06

 rockets story was very sad and i didnt think i would be so emotional about his past
 one thing i didnt like was gamora plot i wanted more and she kinda just a side characters this time around
 the music was really good i knew most of the songs and sang along lol
 what did the end credit scene mean with pete at home",2023-05-06
"gunn pulled a return of the jedi and i couldnt be happier about it 

weird creatures eerie vibes a film that starts dark and gradually lightens up epic battles fuelled by the power of friendship and family satisfying relationship resolutions a soft retcon here and there to make everything go smooth a good redemption a villain whos pure evil and gets destroyed by the power of love a hero learning bittersweet acceptance a gnarly unmasking a clueless golden boi a spectacular space battle emotional gravitas without the need for a single hero death and an ending that leaves the audience uplifted emotionally and spiritually and feeling absolutely good about life

the perfect space opera ending 

rock on guardians its been a great ride

did quill’s face get puffy because he’s no longer celestial also is it just me or did gamora look extra hot in this movie,2023-05-07
in gotg1 quill says “ninja turtle quit poking me” in this movie the villain created and angry ninja turtle and then later on the two animal bionic guards reminded me of bebop and rocksteady i think gunn really likes ninja turtles,2023-05-07

"while i’ve enjoyed all phase 45 movies while acknowledging all their flaws this is the first one that felt like the old “infinity saga” mcu absolutely loved it

rocket’s story broke me and i have a lovehate relationship with bittersweet endings and this is as bittersweet as you can get

i’d love to see more of this group but it was such a nice circle to their story that it might be better if this is the end for these guardians

now let me go and resume crying on my bed",2023-05-07
"i felt really bad for blurp when adam killed his ravager owner and he sadly cuddled up to his leg then was scared so badly by gamora he peed all over the floor 

felt really bad for that little guy im glad he got a happy ending

the ine thing i was bummeddisappointed abotu was adam warlock i feel he was both under used and missused like if he was going to be under used maybe his intro would be better at least he came back at one point i thought he was just done i guess him being powerful and young keeps him back from dominating

the high evolutionary was a great villain amazingly done and his end was ambiguous so hopefully he returns 

loved it better than the most recent marvel movies but still kind of the same",2023-05-07

loved this movie ive been really lukewarm on marvel since endgame i was in the minority and thought no way home was all fan service and no substance the rest have been super middling but this movie was pure blockbuster in the best way it was hilarious charming clever and extremely emotional just such a fun time at the movies,2023-05-08
"rockets backstory just makes his reaction to groots death in the first movie hit so much harder he mustve felt enormous guilt

also  is with all the adam warlock hate from critics he seems to be well received but everyone reviewing the  movie seems to think hes wasted or dont fit in are we even watching the same  movie",2023-05-08
havent seen the christmas special but was the mantis x peter brother sister relationship brought up there or was that and the insistence that rocket is his best friend to tie into the idea of peter thrusting a relationship on gamora,2023-05-08
this wasn’t just a good marvel movie it was a good movie on its own goddddd it pulled at my heart strings one of the best mcu movies made and dare i say my favorite guardian movie,2023-05-08
3 days late and one thing i havent seen mentioned so far is praise for mantiss character arc she stands up for drax against nebula and finally decided she needs to stand up for herself even against other halfjokinghalfbullying guardians seeing her walk away with the 3 abilisks was awesome,2023-05-08

"watched this for the second time and it really hit the sweet spot today i can definitely appreciate it a lot more now that my expectations are out of the way had a good crowd that laughed at all the right places and i ended up sobbing a lot harder this time i feel like all the characters are at a really good place at the end of this film but i cant help but wonder what marvel inc has in store for guardians 20 and starlord

the hardest goodbye for me to watch is drax and mantis since theyre probably my two favorite characters in the mcu id give anything for a spinoff series with just those two similar to the holiday special but only if james gunn dave and pom were all involved theyre just the best i really love this  movie sadly i cant say i share the same sentiment for anything else due from the mcu this year",2023-05-09
"did anyone else notice that early in the film quill listens to the song do you realize by the flaming lips but he takes off his headphones just before the line do you realize that everyone you know someday will die

so according to the movie he only started to populate counterearth with the humanimals shortly after rocket pointed out the flaw in the evolution process yes this means that the civilization on the planet couldnt have been there for more than a few generations at most and we can also presume that he literally made the 1970sesque era on display its starting point instead of bothering to do a stone age bronze age etc rigmarole which obviously would have taken millennia,2023-05-09
man what a great but sad movie,2023-05-09
very good movie james gunn is a master of manipulating the emotions of the audience the only significant flaw has to be adam warlock its the only thing that felt like typical mcu worldbuilding bloat everything was pretty focused and then you have this halfbaked introduction to a new character who really has nothing to do after the first 10 minutes of the movie,2023-05-09
ita interesting how ratings have shifted over the years i feel like this film is in no way less violent than say terminator 2,2023-05-10
so all those scenes on counterearth sure did cater to a uh a certain demographic huh,2023-05-10
"is it emotionally manipulative yea   
is the conclusion rushed so that every character gets some sort of closure to their arc yea  
but  it it might made me feel something different than the other industrial grade slop   
helps that it looks amazing and is probably one of their top 3 best directed movies ever",2023-05-11
they claim theyre the 1 movie in the galaxy in a commerical how do they know there arent other planets in the galaxy with bigger movies,2023-05-12
"man this movie made me so happy finally another good marvel movie i might need to watch this again but i think i really rate this up there with ragnarok

so happy this was not a cameo and reference fest like the recent movies it just focused on the group i think this had like zero references to the overall mcu plot and i enjoyed that i legit had tears a few times the action was great and that hallway fight scene was glorious 

something not getting enough love is the cinematography and camerawork it had such a unique vibe did not feel like a typical marvel movie a lot of moving shots and interesting angles  lenses it really shined in a lot of places and added sooo much to the hallway fight 

on the other hand watched the marvels trailer before the movie so it looks like we’re going back to  marvel movies after this one but i really hope they pick up some ideas from this one and maybe in the next batch they get their  together",2023-05-12
did they imply the high evolutionary lost his face because of rockets scratches,2023-05-13
they had a space station that looked like a  and yet none of the characters made a joke about it being a  was this really a mcu movie,2023-05-13
i wasnt expecting nebula to be best girl but im all for it,2023-05-14
here i was expecting the standard 3rd act of them saving counterearth nope it straight up gets obliterated,2023-05-14
james gunn is clearly one of the few people left who still cares about these movies best product since no way home in my opinion,2023-05-20
just saw this today what an amazing movie im sad i missed the opportunity to watch it in theaters especially knowing this was the last guardians,2023-07-06
was that the first f bomb of the mcu,2023-07-07
loved the bebop and rocksteady cameos,2023-07-08
i might be reaching on this but i could not help but to think that last scene when drax said goodbye to mantis and then he had to  up all the pain and act cheerful and dance for the people around him was such a dad act watching someone you love leave to find there own life and us dads having to let them go and hope for the best,2023-08-02
"the 66 metacritic makes sense now after seeing it yesterday in d

funny terrifying badass heartrending and heartwarming it’s got everything plus the huge focus on overcoming trauma and found families i don’t think i’ve ever been pushed to tears so many times in a single movie and it’s probably the first movie that made me cry through its ending and half the credits pulling out dog days just absolutely wrecked me

when “dog days are over” started playing at the end…i weeped when i realized the song the title made me feel like a warm blanket was being placed over me and that the guardians were actually going to be ok because their “dog days” were truly over and behind them what an excellent usage of music i can’t call it an easter egg but it’s such a good way of subtly using a song’s title,2023-05-07
you mean the mcu could have been making great stuff this whole time and instead has been making mediocre  like antman 3,2023-05-08

im reading nothing but 1010 reviews and honestly i feel like im in the minority for thinking this movie was average i give it like 6510 adam warlock was completely wasted a lot of the humor didnt work for me and would undercut the dramatic moments at times i wish they would have explored rockets background even more i honestly felt nothing when his cell mates died i was so excited for this movie but through the duration of it i felt bored at times definitely the weakest guardians movie for me it wasnt as bad as quantamania but i still dont understand all the love its getting,2023-05-05
"cheap low effort story telling

if the only way you can arouse emotion in a film is to hurt cute animals and have children in peril youre a bad storyteller

the plot our friend got hurt we need mcguffin a oh no that didnt work we need mcguffin b but were also being chased while we try to find it thrilling stuff

and between this and ant man is phase 
5 promising to be the angry black man villain with magic throw people around somehow powers whos been there the whole time with a shadowy connection to a main character that they never talk about and who has had a key to their ultimate power removed from their grasp and use the protagonists to deliver it by holding their companions hostage only to be turned on by those in their employ and have the world they created collapse at their feet as they attempt an unsuccessful escape in a massive palatial building that just happens to actually be a ship but is thwarted by our heroes just in time as background character battle against faceless hordes outside for some reason

do marvel have to do literally everything to an obnoxiously formulaic template

tedious pacing it feels like james gunn wants to be tarantino with mundane pop culture filled banter interespersed between heavy and brutal action but the former just drags because instead of being quirky and witty character insights its just an avenue to deliver reminders about  personal dramas from the past x films hows your grandfather im not the same person

multiple times they literally just went into conversations summarizing the plots of previous films i get that there are an infinity of details to remember qcross all these films but if the solution is to have characters recap hamfistedly for minutes at a time midfilm maybe it points to greater design problems with this style of franchise

and so much random nonsense we have to break into a place to get mcguffin a but its actually a living building how kooky and theres an earth where all the people are half animal wackadoo also a talking psychic dog zany

honestly i think one of the biggest issues with gotg is that the quirkiness that made the first one fell new and charming now feels stale laboured and forced in the first movie it  you in and gave the characters real personality now it feels like a template that pulls you out because it all but winks at you onscreen with a smirk while saying dont you just love how quirky this all is",2023-05-05

i also felt they did a great job making high evolutionary despicable to the point that i was  near ready to cheer when they kicked his  at the end

also with groot talking which i was not prepared for lol but i interpreted that as he still said “i am groot” like normal but it was the first time that we were actually able to hear what they hear in that moment

high evolutionary was better than kang brilliant movie through and through,2023-05-05
"i really enjoyed this film rockets backstory was so rough i cried man

"great moviewhat will annoy me though is starlord is now on earth if he doesnt get involved with avenger stuff or doesnt appear in something even as a cameo that would be annoyinghell disney could do a mini series of him adapting to living back on earth like where did he park his ship

i honestly thought with all the talk early reviews that some characters were 100 gonna be killed off but they left it open for more to come i wonder who will take over from gunn when they eventually do another movie whether they will reunite everyone or just got with a mix of old and new members",2023-05-05
marvel really messed up losing james gunn and i’m more excited than ever for him to be taking over dc he absolutely slayed this one,2023-05-05

star lord is just like me chronically addicted to music and having to have it play while i do anything,2023-05-05
really loved drax’s ending in this with everyone saying he had a great arc i figured he would most likely die but to have him be deemed more fit to be a father than a destroyer was really sweet and it makes the silly aspects of the character work better,2023-05-05
first time in a while we get humor that wasnt dumb really enjoyed the movie great villain and excellent writing,2023-05-05
honestly i didnt like it and i didnt hate it overall im just kind eh about it but it was better than 2,2023-05-05
"i love the darker tone the mcu is going in especially considering that i grew up with these movies  it feels like in a way they’re growing with me 

was fortunate enough to go to a screening with a qna by kevin feige and he said they have two rrated films in the works deadpool and what else so im hoping they keep going in this slightly more dark direction",2023-05-05
saw the movie 3 hours ago outstanding,2023-05-06
i got so emotional when creep played as we followed rocket around knowhere in the beginning  its crazy to me that one of the best depictions of depression ive seen lately is a cgi talking raccoon superhero in space,2023-05-06
just needed to get this off my chest i let out a few tears at the hurts scene and in the time since i saw this last night its been stuck in my head and only gotten sadder i couldnt even get through typing this without tearing up though i havent seen many of the mcu films in years this might rank as the saddest scene in the whole franchise,2023-05-06

this movie really makes me wanna know the dynamics during those 5 years of the snap on earth for rocket and gamora  she had to love working with rhodey that man was straight plan  execution no  their had to be strange dynamicsbonds made i wanna see more off tbh,2023-05-06
"okay james im upset you relegated bruce to the credits but ill forgive you for making florence the linchpin of the movie

apparently after 7 years of real life time and like 10 years of movie time adam still wasnt fully ready to come out of that postcredits egg

they killed lylla and it was obviously very sad but i was much more focused on the fact that they were probably about to  floor and then they did and i was even more sad floor was the best rip floor

dont know what it is about ostensible franchise finales the past few months and long take action sequences that make me grin like an idiot in the middle of the theater but id like the trend to continue

in different hands the high evolutionary could have been forgettable but chukwudi really elevated him i dont know what multiverse shenanigans wed have to pull to get this to happen but if they need to recast kang i know the first place they should look

actually pretty happy that they didnt have gamora and peter get back into a relationship at the end because the more i think about it the more it becomes clear that there was no real way to do it that didnt feel forced the mcu already kind of did a similar thing a bit awkwardly with another alternate self when they speedran lokis character development but this felt like she went through the same rate of growth that she went through in the first guardians also very pleased that the side guardians got their time to shine and that you could really feel rocket and nebula were close after those five years my grievances with vol 2 kind of losing sight of some of these characters and making them too overthetop have been resolved felt very good walking out of the theater after this one",2023-05-06
so there was a lot of people busting through the spaceship windows with no one hardly batting an eye much less dying that seems a bit odd to me i know its marvel or whatever and i should just go with it but it felt weird to me  still kinda bothers me,2023-05-06

while watching this i couldnt help but think that james gunn would make a great adaptation of the saga comics  with all of those weird anthropomorphic animalaliens hed be perfect,2023-05-06
the ending of this movie put one of the biggest smiles on the face a movie has ever done in recent memory seeing everyone just enjoying life doing what they want was so satisfying and seeing drax dancing with everyone was  good feeling 1010 perfect song to start with for the 2000s playlist,2023-05-06
i feel like this is what we wanted thor love and thunder to be in that being a super dark film,2023-05-06
when mantis asked drax to tell peter what she want to saymantis said something like this no one ever listen to me  ironically her power is to make peoples listen to her,2023-05-06
"a great movie from the mcu after a long time perfect mixture of funny and serious

looking forward to revisiting the previous 2 guardians movies and even endgame because this is one of those movies that makes the ones that came before better,2023-05-06
imagine being in a coma for mostly all of your movie and being brought back just in time to face your worst enemy with a chance to  him and being like “nah…it’s not who i am anymore” and then getting a promotion lol,2023-05-06
its so weird that one of the best mcu movies in recent years is made by the head of dc films,2023-05-06
i wish we had gotten more nebula and rocket interactions since they were alone together for 5 years but the little bit we did get was nice,2023-05-06
chukwudi iwuji in this film felt more like a conqueror than johnathan majors did in quantumania,2023-05-06
"this is the first mcu movie in a while  after thor lt wakanda forever quantumania  that i didnt walk out of the theater not enjoying the movie lt was awful wakanda forever was bloated and just not very enjoyable overall quantumania was boring and bland this movie had definite flaws but overall i had a good time

quick thoughts and i may fill in some more 

 gunn does heart really well when he wants you to feel something he usually nails it 

 everything with rocket was great again gunn does heart well rockets first word being hurt was heavy everyone worrying about rocket felt real and wow the body horror in this rough i wish there wouldve been more sympathy at points by the guardians and others when coming into contact with the hes creations these are  tragic beings who have been tortured at every turn but for some reason we need mantis to scream in horror when she sees one and this is after seeing how she treated those giant  whatever those things are  which doesnt have a lot of logic 

 the hallway fight was  great it felt like a send off even though the movie still had plenty of time left 

 im glad they didnt  anyone off and allowed them all to have happy endings drax finding something hes good at and becoming a dad again especially was great 

 not having quill and gamora fall back in love was a great choice  

 warlock was a waste of a character i know some people are gonna say hes an analogy to rocket and fine but he didnt really do anything in this movie other than save quill at the very end why didnt he play some role in taking down the high evolutionary i know hes just in this to introduce a new character  america chavez ririironheart etc  but couldnt gunn give him something

 anyone else just kind of laugh in these movies how easily characters just crash into each other then crash through buildings or structures and then smash into the ground or get thrown into a wall felt like it happened 3 or 4 times in this movie warlock to rocket gamora to quill he to warlock warlock to gamora war pig to gamora its like the director  of whatever superhero movie  doesnt actually want to think of how to have two characters fight 

 the music in this one felt way overdone i love gunns music choices but none of them felt right because they were just constant 

 the excess of silliness cosmos good dog didnt need two additional scenes to payoff at the knowhere battle draxs allegory jokes were funny enoughfor the first two then he starts talking about  which was eyerolling gunn always has one or two really  jokes in his movies  like suicide squad with the beach of dicks or gods splooge its justwhy

 gunn made you care more about the populace of counter earth in 5 minutes of runtime than the entirety of quantumania made you care about cassie or the populace of the quantum realm

 it felt like 80 of this movie was characters yelling or talking as loudly as possible at each other 

 didnt like high evolutionary at all him mocking rocket was just dumb i never took him seriously or found him captivating at any point im kind of shocked seeing the praise heaped on him here

ill be interested to see the consensus on this one when some time passes i dont see much of any criticism in this thread which is interesting again a very enjoyable movie but there are some significant flaws",2023-05-06
kinda wanted more from peter and his grandfather,2023-05-07

i didn’t expect the face off to be a literal one,2023-05-07
ive always disliked seeing copy  pasted soldiers that are cannon fodder just to fill screen space that said i thought this movie excelled in providing a unique variety of humanalienanimal baddies and background characters,2023-05-07
i didnt cry during rocket past scenes even though it was very very dark and sad but the end left me extremely melancholic  as a lot of people said this is not a typical superhero movie it is a scifi movie about friendship and i did fell in love with that and in the end seeing them going their separate ways was very heartbreaking i had many times in my life where a tight group of friends was being broken by lyfes circumstances and i feel this one too i didnt want the movie a cheesy ending with everyone being happy but the finality of it made me feel old and very very sad,2023-05-07
high evolutionary read up on noahs arc and suddenly decided to say anything you can do i can do better and suddenly cleaned house on a zoo,2023-05-07
liked it didnt love it plot is a bit of a mess and the pacing is off otherwise still very enjoyable im glad i saw it honestly though i think im done with the mcu for quite some time i have no interest in the marvels at all gonna sit it out for a bit,2023-05-07

how did the high evolutionary lose his gravity powers when fighting rocket racoon one moment hes got rocket helplessly pushed against the ceiling and then the next hes being shot at by rr and never uses his magic again,2023-05-07
"went with a group of 10 ages 6 to 70 

everyone loved it 

after the last couple of mcu films stumbled and didnt really deliver fully it was great having james gunn pull off the cinematic equivalent of babe ruth causally walking to the plate pointing to the outfield and knocking it out of the park he knew this was his mcu swan song and you can see that he poured his heart  soul into that script

i dont think ive ever cried so much in a popcorn film there were 4 adult men in the group and we compared notes to what made us lose it the most macho of us admitted he held it together until the grandfather scene he lost both of his  my tears started about 30 minutes in and returned over  over until the end 

as others have commented on every guardians arc is handled beautifully each gets either an end or new beginning the peter  gamora arc is particularly well done with the door left open to perhaps a new beginning for them as they have learned who the other truly is now 

the groups consensus is the best guardians movie since the first although i like vol 2 more than most",2023-05-07
wondered if gunn was going to appear on the screen so he could nearly die too jokes aside decent movie with really good theming so  glad they didnt joke with the rocket past scenes but idk i just didnt connect to the movie as much as i did the others i dont really have much to critique apart from the fact that everyone had to have a nearly die scene adam being a bit meh atleast he was funny and kinda poor pacing felt like nothing had time to set in bc it was oop off to the next place still wanna say it was a decent movie but just didnt hit that spot the others did 6710,2023-05-08

"saw the promo trailerposters saying how it was the best marvel movie since endgame 

initially i thought that it was nothing more than a cheep cash in on the antimcu speak going on but i honestly agree after watching it

all arcs feel complete the gags were appropriate and the villain actually felt like a menace much more than kang the supposed main bad guy that also got his  kicked by antman",2023-05-08
the action in this movie and the scenes where they were trying to move to the next plot point held a lot of weight i like how difficult a lot of the scenes felt and i felt really tense for the main characters throughout the movie the stakes felt real the whole movie which can be hard to do,2023-05-08
"i liked it sold film though it did feel a bit awkward as a lot of the post thanos films have felt 

one thing that stood out to me thinking back to the thing and a dozen other movies in the past that are rated r this movie gets away with a lot mutlated animals scary creatures ripped off faces vaporized bodies have we given up on these ratings or what 

i know its pg13 but kids wont be able to handle some of this unlike other mcu movies",2023-05-08

what was cosmos choice of music in the first postcredits scene  every  song is great etc  the loud people next to me waited for the stingers and then immediately started talking over all the dialogue,2023-05-08
you know a movie is good when not even an hour into it you’re crying so hard baby rocket saying he was hurt  broke me the rest of the movie i was in tears and laughter such a beautiful movie i haven’t cried this hard since mother 3 tbh,2023-05-08
since the gotg movies are done i still have one lingering question knowing rockets backstory why does he find it funny when he takes peoples augmented body parts like in the first movie with the guys leg and in the second the eye is this like some sort of trauma response since he was in the same situation before,2023-05-08
it was such a perfect ending to a trilogy and exactly the type of content marvel has been lacking i honestly loved it so much and i don’t even know if i can bring myself to ever watch it again it was so emotionally draining with rocket’s flashbacks the animals just everything about it it had heart and made me extremely emotional the entire movie,2023-05-08
fantastic movie the scene where rocket came to terms with his past and saved all of the baby raccoons in the cage broke me the tears were flowing,2023-05-08
"great movie i like that it put story first and went dark when it needed to go dark not just for darks sake each character got the right ending but i dont think ending is the right word theres plenty of room left for storytelling

i dont think i consider this a trilogy though technically it qualifies but my reasoning is that it didnt feel like the completion of one story

for example if the story had been different and focused on star lord and gamora with rocket just part of the gang i wouldnt have felt anything was missing when the credits rolled

but if return of the jedi had been about han solo i wouldve been pretty annoyed that the lukevader stuff wasnt wrapped up",2023-05-08
well  dc is in very safe hands with gunn at the helm,2023-05-08

"why only now did he decide to go back to earth why didnt he want to show the other guardians his home planet

was it that he felt he had no family to go back to and thats why he never went back",2023-05-09
so the main theme of the movie is found family the running joke of gamora not understanding groot the whole movie and then finally understanding him in the end was basically because she became one of them family so in the end where everyone is hugging and groot says i love you guys we the viewers can now understand groot because we also became family so beautiful im still crying,2023-05-09
i just realized the “i thought you said something else” guy was tim robinson it’s so on brand for him lol,2023-05-09
"lot of great stuff in here the organism planet and the high evolutionary office were just such mind bendingly beautiful set designs and concepts the fight scene was insane and awesome the rocket stuff was a little extreme when it came to tragedy but it was handled well 


the whole movie seemed to be juggling a lot it definitely felt like a movie before the big finale and not the end of the story yet…at the end it sorta…became that it almost felt like this should have been volume 2 and quill being the hero and dealing with his dad would have been a more fitting way to go out gunn also seemed to be stuck with his previous choice to end the 2nd movie with setups for the third warlock was fine but it definitely feels like his plot was shortened or diminished or unneeded 


was really surprised at how flat a lot of the jokes went over in my theater i wasn’t the biggest fan but usually in marvel movies people are pretty  on board was juggling a lot of tones and i think people were pretty put off to laugh after they watched an otter die…that was pretty hardcore


definitely a “best of the rest” post endgame after spiderman but i can’t say that bar is too high",2023-05-09
this is the second movie ive seen this month to use no sleep till brooklyn,2023-05-09
best marvel movie in ages,2023-05-09
definitely satisfying when he mentioned robocop because i could not stop thinking about it when he was on screen hah,2023-05-09
am i reading too much into peters insistence that its not a trap but a faceoff followed by gamora pulling the high evolutionarys face off a la the 90s movie faceoff,2023-05-10
since no one on screen points out the irony of this guy considering the ideal species one that doesnt fall into rage even though he himself does it all the time ill never know if it was a deliberate literary choice or not,2023-05-10
maybe its just me but when groot said i love you guys i had a feeling that he included us as the audience as well,2023-05-10
"this movie had a strong christian overtone no theres the obvious creation of adam shot which i dont think was earned especially considering the meh editing like theres creation of adam oh the next shot is just warlock grabbing quill by the arm honestly adam warlock was a little under utilized his mom says that he was awoken too soon and is just a kid despite his looks and powers this kid loses his mother and he flies straight to the only person he knows on an exploding planet i think adam warlock is strong enough to take a bomb so i think he shouldve collapsed from grief rather than that weird exhaustion we got the moment he saw his mom die shoulda been the moment he turned his attention to he if that happened then we wouldnt get the weird part where adam bursts thru sl and gamoras ship and theyre just fine with it did i miss something there why werent they  into the vacuum of space honestly that moment where the three ships are just trying to get to point b and theres a bajillion space grunts to  was bloated couldve used those 5 mins on something else honestly 1 more minute for each guardian would have workee to plant seeds throughout the film so the breakup conversation at the end resonates more because honestly as of now it seems a little forced like they only did it because the writerdirector is going to their direct competitor to launch a cinematic universe because they fired him over a tweet he made forever ago yknow 
because they do fight a lot theyre a dysfunctional family the love is there but maybe its better that they tried different things gamora looked happier with the ravagers than she ever did with the guardians it also seemed especially  mantis so they easily coulda added some dialogue between drax and mantis in the same scene where shes getting drax to give peter her advice verbatim 

that being said i do love the movie i cried a lot for all of its faults it has soooo much heart which i think is part of the point love things as they are not as they should be this is something he didnt understand he hated everything because hes too narcissistic to turn that energy on himself and theres a lot to hate he cant fathom his flaws and limits its someone elses fault and whats worse is that even though hes a genius he couldnt create with joy its apparent in everything he does i kept thinking this design is very human i think its most apparent with the juxtaposition between his hightec boring space cube and guardians backup pulling up with the tricked out skull of a long dead  everyone is unique and has something to offer its good to have friends dance and be silly  

oh yeah but it is sorta christian they brought the animals on to the ark and whats more 3 guardians mantis gamora peter go their separate ways like noahs children shem ham and japheth and then i already mentioned creation of adam rocket has a near death experience and sees his friends waiting on the shores of the other side where lylla says theres the hand that creates and the hand that leads the hand the story has always been about you you just werent paying attention i think thats pretty much means  has a plan for you hes employees all go against him when he proclaims himself as  thats all that i caught

but yeah excellent movie",2023-05-10
can there just only be superhero movies when james gunn decides to make them this ruled and the madmans probably gonna make me give a  about superman,2023-05-10
i absolutely love the fact that rocket did not die so many people predicted that he would and the way the trailers were going i really did think it was going to happen i am definitely going to rewatch it in the theatres again with that out of my system one of the best mcu films to date imo,2023-05-10
baby rockets voice was so cute,2023-05-10
the dark undertone makes me doubt ill watch it a second time but that onetake hallway fight was well worth the price of admission,2023-05-10
what no joke about face offs at the end,2023-05-11
nebula was completely justified in calling out drax and it was annoying to see mantis take offense to that,2023-05-11
hallway fight was  amazing,2023-05-11
loved the movie i can also report that its being review bombed mildly with word for word reviews with generic named accounts rating it 0310 i dunno why all i can think is that some word snyderverse fans are mad that dc is doing a reboot so they sre  on the james gunn movie,2023-05-11
"this movie made me so thankful for james gunn cant believe its the same dude who gave us pg 

i had high expectations for this movie and i do not feel let down it was just so refreshing for a marvel movie to finally not just feel like a stepping stone to the next movie it focused on itself the way the the first run of the mcu movies were doing but easily this is my favorite trilogy of all the mcu movies and id argue that this one is in the top 10

the opening sequence to vol 2 was great but there was just something beautiful about the long shot sequence for this one in vol 3 as we followed rocket through the streets of knowhere with the shot cutting around the time we get to quill

also once baby rocket uttered his first words it hurts i was done idk how many times i had to pretend i was scratching my cheek in order to wipe a tear away",2023-05-13
all the guardians finding their places and being joyful especially after the hard lives a lot of them have lived was such a good ending incredibly tortured characters like rocket and nebula gleefully dancing and laughing having found their home… way better than if some of them died just for the sake for it i’m sure gunn could have done a good job with one or more of them dying too of course but i much prefer what we got,2023-05-15
"rockets bradley cooper scream of agony after lyllas death killed me the voice acting was sublime and as the audience i really felt the pain rocket was going through after having his hope taken away from him and witnessing of his best friends die in front of him whilst being mocked 

rockets backstory was so well done probably one of the best things marvel have done in a long while our boy rocket really went through it

we do not need terrible enemies but a film about protecting a dead friend really pulls at our heart strings",2023-05-15
"what a movie guardians of the galaxy is one of the best space scifi ever and this movie is awesome rollercoaster of emotions i cried during rockets escape i smilled during hallway scene and i was afraid they really will  rocket and they listened to complaints about drax and critiqued his character but at the same time managed to reintroduce him  he isnt comic relief for movie he is comic relief for people around him   

and desings of everything is so cool animalcyborgsoldiers look metal af and wouldve been coolest toys in 8090s enviroments of space stations and ships are interesting to look at even thing which gives info balls from arhcive looks interesting   

im not sure i like new rockets backstory compared to one from comics i wish it was better ending for his friends but oh well not everything works out in the end  

they learned to give serious moments to sink in without joke interupting them  

and how the  they managed to make this movie so brutal with pg rating ok gamora shot some people ok nebula is cyborg so everything happening to her doesnt count butface without skin directly in camera without cutting away and its pg how of course im not complaining just suprised",2023-05-15
the dog days are overthat ending really got me,2023-05-19
"the first time a marvel movie made me cry during rockets near death experience and laughed so often like the first two gotgs movies did 

definitely the best mcu movie in this decade would have to think about it but definitely in my top 5 of mcu movies ever",2023-05-20
just got out of my 2nd viewing still hits hard still looks great still as effective super funny fact that music played in the counterearth home is a real song lol koinu no carnival from “minute waltz” by ehamic absolutely insane and hilarious that it really feels like counterearth music lol,2023-05-21
not having groot say family at the end was a huge missed opportunity ,2023-05-21
"much better than gotg2 but i was personally disappointed by what couldve been a true return to form for the mcu i really like guardians but these sequels arent it

too many moments where film stops to become a mini music video and other times too many characters screamingcursing  at each other like children felt like too much time was given to those moments along with rockets dead friends high evolutionary felt wasted despite being very intimidating and compelling 

counterearth felt pointless and frankly cheap looking was i supposed to feel something towards the animalpeople they barely got screentime before being blown up and not even dramatically just boom


this movie was plague dogs meets star trek insurrection literally",2023-05-24
ive scrolled a bunch and havent seen any comments mentioning phyla ive only recently started reading some gotg comics im going through this secret invasion reading list  because i wanna read it before the mcu event and so i knew adam was gonna make it but then when rocket mentioned phyla by name i got so excited,2023-05-26
super late to the party but  i bubbled like a baby when peters grandpa saw for the first time in 30 years best mcu movie in a good while,2023-05-26

the director was very bold to run the scene with no translation and spend so many seconds on it which producers probably whined about i feel it made suburban mom more lovable since she worked so hard to do the right thing

now when they are getting blown up the shooting was interrupted by fighting on board so i’m sure they weren’t all killed i go further lying to myself that the imported 1950 us culture means they have some bomb shelters and decide to use them after the motorcycle stealing",2023-06-15

"loved this movie finally caved and bought it money well spent congratulations all involved

nebula and mantis got some well deserved development and it was great to see i liked adam warlock some people i know weren’t happy about him i assume this isn’t his ‘final form’ and thought he was endearing knowing the mcu probably see him again in 2040 i’m not such a huge follower post endgame wish they were all as good as this one 

i’ll be back for legendary star lord",2023-07-10
favorite of the three wish i had seen it in theaters now hit the emotional notes for me all the characters had development even the side ones kind of baffled they pulled it off,2023-07-11
just saw this holy  cried three or four times and i’m still  devastated over that floor teeth lally scene,2023-07-17
adam was so badly written for me the worst character in the movie was expecting a little bit more of him after the furious beginning,2023-07-21
"really great easily the best mcu film since no way home and possibly the best guardians film my only issue is that how much the audience loved rocket and how cute the other members of batch 89 were carried the film and allowed james gunn who i have never believed is really that talented to get away with a significant amount of lazy writing most egregiously that we are supposed to feel our heart strings tugged by the deaths of certain characters but other characters  that have basically the exact same backstory  are ok to be brutally murdered

one other note i would make is that i thought it was pretty clear that if it was not for the pandemic we probably would have got a different gotg3 where the guardians plus thor looked for gamora and the high evolutionary was hinted at and then what we know as gotg3 would probably be gotg4",2023-07-23
the worst of the three by some distance relied to heavily on the sappy moments,2023-07-31
literally crying at rocket talking to his dead friends this movie did not have to go this hard,2023-08-03
this movie was fantastic you actually gave a  and you are actually invested in each characters story rockets story is pretty  up and dark glad to see the high evolutionary get absolutely demolished at the end although we didn’t see much of adam warlock he’s a pretty integral part of the marvel franchise as he is basically equivalent to power as superman,2023-08-07

what a terrible movie i wouldn’t watch it again for free,2023-05-06
"the plot was garbage tho

1 i mean all of these years the villain thought that rocket was dead why he was well known in the galaxy not only because he was a famous thief and had bounties on him but later he became guardian of the galaxy so there is no way that the villain didnt look for him
2 you wanna tell me that this is the first time that rocket was injured he thought thanos and hungreds of other battles there is no way he discovered this killswitch just now
3 and finally  disney shoving us those  kids again

i’ll forever love lylla floor and teefs i haven’t cried like that from a movie in a looooooooong time,2023-05-05
i liked it but its still unfortunately the weakest in the trilogy it was good but im still a little underwhelmed,2023-05-05
that was really disappointing im a fool to keep giving this company my money,2023-05-05
i will not watch this movie again wasn’t bad just too much animal violence for me to stomach i was in tears nearly the whole movie,2023-05-05
"this movie had too many good ideas and it fell flat because of it 

the best was the rocket back story that was executed really well 

everything else was executed poorly 

the whole thing is three fetch quests fetch the passcode from location a fetch the password from location b fetch the people from location b 

even with 25 hours which is long it felt rushed 

the entire part with counter earth served no purpose it was odd that he would make an ideal society be a 1980s american suburb with animal people 

like this is guardians of the galaxy it should feel bigger and not so earth focused the comedy of a lot of the previous movies has been from peter quill being a fish out of water overgrown american child in a strange and diverse universe 

but in this movie they use random earth animals for all their experimentation everyone is very human the odd bio space station had great set design but the plot inside was super basic and could have been happening at a dmv 

fun side plots got lost in there being so many of them 

cosmo nathan fillion the other ravagers the little kids the sovereign none of them had time to breathe 

the other issue was that the guardians were too incompetent and bumbling and too blasé about it it made the stakes feel super low there is a nice balance to be had between the conversation and the action but we were way too far over on the conversationfrenetic action 

finally the villain was poorly done the cold scientist was a much better demeanour than the random screaming emotional guy the guardians are the people who have trouble with their emotional control having everyone do it just reduced the threat level of the villain",2023-05-05
"i think it was nice that gunn didn’t  anyone from the cast and ended it where they have healthier lives without the guardians as a crutch for their trauma they’re in much fulfilling places now and it was very sweet for the darkest movie of the trilogy i do call  on the pg13 rating with the face scene that was graphic as  for a he rating 


overall a great send off and it felt like these characters are done even when marvel drags a few back for avengers movies

i am now curious to see how gunn does superman with basic total freedom after seeing this and loving it",2023-05-05
when adam warlocks mum died it was a perfect chance for him to have a change in perspective but then the movie just forgot about him for a whole act only to then come back and have no development after his mothers death he was still trying to  the guardians why he should be after the high evolutionary after that,2023-05-05
"bradley cooper has probably done the least press almost none for this trilogy than any of the main cast when hes arguably the main character 

just an observation",2023-05-05
i think groot saying i love you guys wasn’t him learning new words but gunn letting us understand groot finally because we’ve spent so much time with him,2023-05-05
watching peter quill almost die and seeing how groot was willing to go through agonizing pain to save him almost broke me,2023-05-05
anyone else thought it was a little dark for a guardians film,2023-05-06
"why so many fakeout deaths   


in the opening scene i get it thats fine then in orgocorp drax gets blasted by nathan fillion who was amazing in this and then theres sad music playing and then hes fine like why bother that scene adds nothing to the movie   


then again near the end quill gets saved by adam and they recreate the  touching adam painting which was brilliant shot composition but it didnt feel earned at all the latter half of the movie is really  good but i didnt really enjoy the rest of it oh also dont appreciate the deadpool 2 ripoff scene its just played out by now and it didnt hit as hard for me also the mutiny near the end of the movie you know hes super powerful just shoot or at least try to subdue him what use is standing around going to be also the high evolutionarys idea of a perfect world being 1990s earth was just  hilarious but    


a lot of this movie felt like it was riffing on the big spectacles from other movies if you told me the scene where kraglin looks up at his city being invaded was from avengers or age of ultron id believe you the space battle with the hellspawn didnt really hit felt like a worse version of star wars fights also the rancor pitthat he just keeps onboard because why not and then she does the jurassic world thing to get them to her side i feel like a lot of these scenes could be cut out and were mostly just empty spectacle  


the latter half of this movie hits like a dumptruck emotionally every single scene with rocket was excellent the beastie boys fight was perfection groot and quill fighting onboard the pyramid was fantastic adam was a bit of a joke but he was fine overall and most importantly cosmo is a very good dog it was very hit or miss for me it hits its more important emotional beats very well but the rest of it just was not particularly memorable for me",2023-05-06
that cut after the hallway fight scene to them running was so jarring,2023-05-08
"what a great movie

seeing nebula break down knowing that the one guardian who was with her during the snapped years is gonna be ok 

rockets back story is so harrowing its crazy just how emotional it made me",2023-05-09
"im sort of struggling to know how i felt about it to be honest 

im not really critical of the film i liked a lot of it and i understood its choices but i cant really get away from the fact that i found it a really hard watch to the point that it was upsetting and that has stayed with me more than the uplifting ending or the jokes or the excitement 

that rabbit desperately shouting for his friends to leave has stuck with me i think about it a lot and i feel uncomfortable 

and im finding it frustrating that the conversation around this has been really dismissive ive seen a couple of threads here and on the marvel subs about how sure its a bit violent here and there but its rated appropriately and people shouldnt expect a movie is kid safe just because its marvel but i dont think its unfair really to make the point that the character of the violence of the pain and distress in this film is very different to anything weve seen in a marvel movie up to this point and i just didnt have my guards up for it 

ive seen harder more violent films more horrible films more upsetting films but i usually wouldnt see them in the theatre where i find the volume and the scale a little bit overstimulating at the best of times i went to see this with my partner and we both just kind of sat for a bit after we both found the film stressful in a way we hadnt expected 

i said after that id have rather waited and watched it at home but id never really have known that would have been the right way to go without seeing it",2023-05-10
idk it kinda rubbed me the wrong way that the same movie that respectfully shows how terrible rockets life was also joked about thanos replacing nebulas eyes she even says that rocket had it worse than her even though they were in a nearly identical situation,2023-05-12
"it was good but after 6 years of waiting it could’ve been better the story was rather sloppy and reminded me of rise of skywalker we gotta go here and get this thing oh wait that didn’t work now we gotta go over there and get that thing honestly i think the story could’ve been improved by having adam take rocket in the beginning then have the main plot be rescuing him instead of meandering around 

also felt some scenes were really dragged out particularly some comedic beats in cases like the team talking to the animals in the house on counter earth followed up by the car fiasco i felt like one or the other could’ve been cut i don’t think this movie needed to be 25 hours

however i loved the villain and rocket’s backstory was so tragic loved the cool animal army their designs were great also loved how they ended things for the guardians team in general there was a lot of tension with them as any of them could’ve died at any moment and all the ones who didn’t already die each got a scene were we were worried about them however i thought it was a nice subversion to have them all live i love quill’s ending in particular

adam warlock was funny but out of place definitely feels like he is only here because of the vol 2 post credits thought it was weird he had pretty much no reaction to ayesha dying he was shoehorned in imo and i think his arc could’ve been better

gamora surprisingly worked well i kinda think they should’ve retired the character after her death in infinity war but the new version was still really good glad she went off on her own at the end 

overall i did like this movie and it’s easily the 3rd best of the most recent mcu shows and movies however it wasn’t as good as i was expecting and hoping id give it a 6 or a 7 but i always have recency bias with these movies",2023-05-05
walked out halfway through utter tripe,2023-05-05
another disappointment to the pile of recent marvel flicks,2023-05-05
"vol 3 definitely tops the sequel

what a villain legit hated this dude more than kang

rockets story  me up but i held it together in the theater when i buy it later on down the road i can cry in my home in peace

i thought quill would bite it but he wasnt as annoying like he was in iw and in part 2

glad rocket survived

overall 45 stars",2023-05-05
thought it was okay,2023-05-05
it was oddly dark and weird i mean guardians was always weird but in a good way but i felt uncomfortable especially parts of rockets backstory the cyborg animals at the end creeped me the  out too also what sick  does that to a rabbit you know what im talking about,2023-05-07
was it just me but when groot said i love you guys he was just saying i am groot but as the audience we understood what he meant,2023-05-07
im just going to say it i dont think i liked the choices they made in sending off some of these characters left quite a bitter and sad taste in my mouth and overall makes it hard to want to watch this one again ,2023-05-07
"high evolutionary destroys entire planet committing mass genocide

guardiansoh no anyway raccoon is safe",2023-05-07
"
like most have said definitely best mcu film since no way home cant believe how much better this was than antman  you can tell how much the cast really put their agame into it loved how much mantis we got in this lots of emotional scenes some got me pretty good some felt a little too tearjerker some of the animal stuff and gore at the end is gonna turn some people off gunn definitely pushed pg13 as hard as he could

only real gripe is that the movie feels like it ends 2 or 3 times with them having to save drax nebula and mantis and then the kids and 
then the animals then starlord it made the movie feel too long


curious to see where the roster goes from here a warlock show with the cast sounds too expensive but what director wants to fill gunns shoes",2023-05-08
"the guardians individually probably have the best character arcs in the entirety of the mcu this was easily the best movie since no way home and what the studio has needed for a while 

not really sure how things are gonna play out now with the whole kang  but at least there’s some hope again",2023-05-08
i cried so hard im still getting tearyeyed,2023-05-08

"chukwudi iwuji was so perfect in his role as the great evolutionary he literally made me shudder with his evil when hed come onscreen

just after the film was over i literally turned to my friend and said  ill bet you hes a shakesperean actor whos main background is theater  no way this guy started in la hes too good

went home and did my google search on the guy and sure enough",2023-05-14
"the opening creep scene evoked more pathos than the last 5 marvel movies ive seen combined 

gunn just gets it he was far and away marvels most valuable asset and they just let him walk",2023-05-14
"is it me or did adam warlock seemed under used in the movie and high evolutionary seemed awfully weak compared to his comic book source material he took a beating from them just like kang having a fist fight with ant man

i wish the mcu came up with better ways to beat these powerful antagonists that end up becoming runofthemill bad guys by the end of the film

i would have preferred if quill died in space the emotion in the scene felt undermined with adam coming to his rescue

im seeing a lot of praise for the movie but i thought it was ok none of the action was outstanding or memorable in any way certainly better than the last few mcu films but nothing amazing either it felt a bit long as well but i dont know what theyve could have trimmed to save time

favorite scene was definitely the fbomb totally unexpected and delivered perfectly",2023-05-15
it was good but i wasnt as in love with it as most people seem to be all the rocket stuff is top notch but the rest is just decent by the current marvel standards its miles better than anything else theyre doing but if it was part of the infinity saga i dont think it would be as praised as it is because it wouldnt really rise head and shoulders above many of those films its just my opinion though but for me most of the jokes didnt land and i was dissapointed that no characters died as that would make it feel more like a finale i didnt really feel like this is the end because the way the movie sets it up all of these characters seem to be poised to return in future movies and i bet they will team up again even if briefly in avengers or something else also i much prefer the soundtracks of the first two installments i dd really appreciate the darker elements and how it pushed the boundaries of pg13 though,2023-05-05
the drinking problem plotline was such a joke quill was completely wasted then a random villain shows up and hurts rocket after which quill is alert has a epiphany and the issue is never brought up again why even introduce it in the first place,2023-05-06
i really wasn’t able to connect with this film emotionally the movie started off on a much more violent note than the first two and it became clear early that disney gave gunn a lot of creative freedom as soon as they started playing up the cuteness factor for rocket’s friends it was just obvious they were going to meet a bleak fate the movie was manipulatively sad rather than organically sad if that makes sense,2023-05-09
maybe this was not the movie for me but as fan of the guardians i did not like this movie at all the guardians are known for their lighthearted silly banter for their duffus approach to everything and while there were some tragic events happening it was never the focus  the team was the focus who did not straight up hated each other even in the guardians game where they were dealing with brainwashing cults tragedies and the end of the universe i never felt sick and the story made me tear up without the need of seeing animals getting mangled and killed i do not believe that james gunn was the right director here  he likes meanspirited and cynical humour his heroes are flawed to the point where i do not like rooting for them he likes dissecting scifi and superhero characters and tropes just like the high evolutionary liked to experiment on creatures the overall tone in this movie was either predominantly sappy or extremely bitter  mean and the guardians are just not that i know a lot of people will disagree because they love his work but i hope people will realise that quality filmmaking does not equal excellent movie when comes to certain franchises i am happy that his fans will get their twisted version of batman which everybody expected from snyder but for me the hateful bickering between characters the disbalance between comedy and drama and the excessive reliance on shocking deaths and scenes are not going to get me to like dc more than i liked the snyders dc which i did not i loved the suicide squad and peacemaker because it made sense for them to be cynical meanspirited and shocking at times i did not expect nor i wanted for the most lighthearted of the marvel teams to have the most bleak movie so far,2023-05-05
"my favorite part was the mission impossible trailer at the beginning  man i did not like this movie at all 

i really enjoyed the first one thought the sequel was average at best and really disliked this one

20 minutes too long pacing was disjointed and all over the place weak soundtrack

and i thought these movies were supposed to be funny  there wasn’t one moment where my packed theatre laughed out loud together prior movies had several  a few random chuckles here and there but almost all the jokes and comedic moments fell flat",2023-05-06
this might be the worst guardians movie it wasn’t bad but the guardians 2 was s tier and 1 was in my opinion little better i think the villain had so much more potential i think james gunn said that this was the cruelest mcu villain and i’d like to say  i honestly think ronan the accuser was worst than this guy and i think we needed at least one character death to prove this guy was a monster and needed to be stopped i feel like the rocket backstory was carried by the fact that they were cute little animals and that contributed to the audience caring about them it’s a little lazy but it does work probably the best action sequence in the entire mcu that one shot was amazing the chemistry was all there everyone was perfect even mantis who i didn’t really like before was drax dancing supposed to be a sign of change i knew that his wife hated dancing and this was his way of being like hey i can dance too now idk i thought it was nice action was great comedy was hilarious villain could have been better he had a good performance adam warlock was pointless you could have taken him out with little effect to the story i would say this movie is high b tier i don’t really want to put it into a tier just because i don’t think it stacks up to guardians 1 which is a tier,2023-05-05
"part of me wishes this movie would leave my brain and the other part of me wishes i could live in this moment forever what a beautiful  experience 

never did i imagine this movie featuring brutal and horrific moments of animal cruelty and literal defacing would end up as a story about being so happy and full of love that you have no other option than to simply dance about it",2023-05-05
"random thought dump

 all the close up shots of rocket’s face and other raccoons were sooo impressive i love the leaps and bounds we get to see in cgi in our lifetime 
 loved the story focusing on rocket too especially having it revolve around his backstory in hindsight it feels obvious from the other movies this movie need med more rocket exposition but going into it i still had a feeling it was gonna be classic disney focusing on star lord again 
 character resolutions felt great rocket raccoon accepting his species nebula got in touch with her feelings drax got to be a dad groot got to be the protector again mantis realized she wasn’t weak gamora found a family and star lord stopped running from home 
 held it together when star lord was resuscitating rocket and when rocket saw his friends but i could not hold it together after nebula’s reaction to hearing rocket was okay very touching 
 a lot of the jokes felt a bit ‘memey’ for lack of better word but there was enough humorous dialogslapstick to hold on to its james gunn gotg roots 
 also remember how james gunn almost didn’t direct this thank …
 also also didn’t janes gunn and taika waititi talk about the resolutions of their films at all when they were collaborating we can’t save a spaceship full of children ever movie guys…
 chuk iwuji was faaantastic he was great in peacemaker too and i even remembered him from the tiny role he had on doctor who 
 felt a bit crammed with action scenes probably didn’t need all the explosions and what have you but it is a marvel movie so what can you expect at least the hallway scene worked imo 
 star lord almost dying felt a bit too much especially after the emotional rollercoaster we just got off creation of adam joke was funny at least 
 speaking of adam will poulter was good it always seems like he just shows up in movies but always does a great job 
 i forget the name of it but the replica earth felt a bit wasted like it was all bojack horseman and interesting and all it turned out to be for was a planet to blow up could have been cut but also could have been expanded way more on
 groot and rocket dancing at the end remind me of jojo rabbit’s ending
 knew ahead of time mowgli’s ‘san francisco’ was on the soundtrack and was excited sad it was only like two seconds that song has a good vibe and was expecting it to fit into the plot better like many of the other songs do 

anyways it was my favorite mcu movie in a while not as good as the first two but still exceptionally good for ‘the third installment in a superhero trilogy’",2023-05-05
i liked the movie a lot but the ending felt rushed like the set up a bunch but not enough to explain the ending rocket pulled a batman from batman begins i aint gonna  you but i am gonna let you die on this exploding space pyramid quill going from im cool with not seeing my grandpa again to yeah i gotta leave and see my grandpa why because he saw a picture mantis was more understandable if it was like after guardians 2 but her leaving also felt out of nowhere but i understand the working for her dad to working with her brother and wanting to do her own stuff for a while but again it would make sense if it was after 2 i think the soundtrack was not as good as the first two either but the use of no sleep and alice coopers chasing rainbows was excellent all of rockets backstory was the highlight aside from the scenes mentioned those felt the most well written and acted out,2023-05-05
 the high evolutionary,2023-05-05
this movie made me cry so  much  i really really loved it however this isn’t one i’ll revisit often,2023-05-05
i thought the movie was pretty decent but i’m not really in a rush to see it again,2023-05-05
definitely the strongest mcu offering since no way home at least the emotional beats were seriously strong i also really liked the darker tone amazing villain and acting… yeah strong movie for sure it’s not without some faults editing in the third act was uncharacteristically bad at times but i think it’s strengths largely outweigh its failures,2023-05-05
cant wait to see starlord total landscaping in the solo movie,2023-05-05
i thought the movie was great but my one main complaint is that i felt like adam warlock was misused honestly aside from the opening scene you could take him out of the movie and not much changes which seems like a waste of the character to me they should have held him for some future project instead,2023-05-05
props to the guardians for doing a super metroid complete run,2023-05-05
"i didn’t love gotg2 but man i thought this one was a breath of fresh air to what we’ve been getting lately from the mcu

just a really fun movie with a deep emotional core loved how it all ended and think it really felt like a culmination of each of these characters story arcs the hallway fight to beastie boys may have been one of my favorite mcu fights period",2023-05-05
i think it kinda dragged a bit between rocket coming back and the final assault but dammed if i didn’t love this movie teared up like 4 different times i recently lost my dog so the scene of rocket being greeted by his friend lila as he’s dying just hit me like a brick wall probably didn’t help that it was a cute little animal too lol that onetake hallway fight was awesome too i usually kinda tune out during marvel fight scenes but that one was great i’m glad no one died mainly because it would have cheapened the whole plot being to save rocket imo sacrifices are overdone and their send off felt fitting,2023-05-05

rockets backstory got my whole cinema shed in tears action was superb and the interactions between drax and mantis was always ridiculously good that movie was a 1010 for me,2023-05-05
"yesterday i watched star wars a new hope and the empire strikes back at home then went to the theater to watch the 40th anniversary screening of return of the jedi today i watched guardians of the galaxy 1  2 then went to the theater for the premiere of vol 3 both really fun days and never before have i been more aware of the parallels

anyway i really enjoyed this film even though it wasnt exactly what i expected i guess i fell for the rumors that their final outing would be a lot darker and we would lose a bunch of characters as far as i know we lost no characters and the guardians live on in a different form i guess i expected more finality given with how this had been hyped for years not that im unhappy with the end result im just not quite sure how to feel

james gunn has said for sure this is the end of his trilogy and people like dave bautista have pretty much retired from the character however the ending tells us that starlord will return which means the guardians can still be featured players in other movies but im not sure whether thats something im looking forward to without gunns involvement

anyway ill take a step back and concentrate on what i liked about the film the focus on rockets backstory was a highlight along with lylla floor and teeths and formed the emotional core of the story the way the movie opens with rocket listening to the acoustic version of creep had me crying for the first of many times adam warlocks involvement seemed almost negligible and the high evolutionary was definitely one evil  i found the whole counter earth thing both creepy and depressing like a twilight zone episode though it eventually lent to the first mcu fbomb which was surprisingly understated

i found peter and gamoras relationship here quite interesting since it never developed into what they once had in the first two movies so that felt quite sad to me that it ended on those separate terms my favorite characters since vol 2 and the holiday special are of course the inimitable chemistry of drax and mantis i could watch a whole series surrounding those two characters so of course it makes me extra sad that they too are separated by the end i think thats mostly what im left with at the end of this movie bittersweet feelings im not really a fan of the latest direction of the mcu and i feel like this might be the last time i truly find myself invested in this world and that really bums me out",2023-05-05
going to be really hard rewatching this one the emotional scenes are made so well you can just tell the people behind this movie give a  nothing cheap at all i really respect how they allow us to actually mull over certain scenes with no typical mcu tension breaking loved it,2023-05-05

man what an emotional rollercoaster,2023-05-06
run fast for your mother run fast for your father,2023-05-06
"i thought rocket would also go to earth since he too is from earth just like quill 

also in a way im glad they didnt do the hollywood ending everyones fine and theyre back together its bittersweet but sometimes a story ends with people going their separate ways",2023-05-06
if i was chris pratt i would be knocking on james gunn’s door and asking him to cast me as a character in the dc universe he’s building to date gunn is the only director to get consistently great performances out of pratt where in almost every role outside of guardians he just feels like a bland generic action hero,2023-05-06
"hurts

i dont know if my heart can take ever seeing that scene again",2023-05-06
are helmets no longer a thing,2023-05-06
felt good to have a villain to hate on and doesn’t have to be sympathetic like everyone else,2023-05-06
"what a great sendoff for this group of guardians 

it was an emotional movie from the jump i felt everybody got to shine in their own way and show growth im a bit sad gamora isnt with the guardians but it makes sense not the same person 

ill always love watching karen gillan act she just is great at what she does 

rocket was the heart of this movie and it was so sweet to see hes had such a heartbreaking life 

as cute as floor was i was continually creeped out 

drax meant to be a dad is so right he really gets emotions him not telling nebula about speaking the same language as the kids was funny 

groot saying i love you was beautiful 

good way to end it",2023-05-06
did anyone else notice the quillgroot faceoff in the ship was a remake of the iron man 2 scene with iron man and war machine fighting the drones,2023-05-06
"im so confused why quill decided to leave the guardians hes morning gamora but i dont think going off on his own is less healthy than staying with his found family especially after pushing them away it would more make sense for him to open up to and protect the family he has left

holy smokes the high evolutionary is a terrifying villain no justifiable motives but realistic motives sometimes its great seeing someone whos truly evil get killed this is the worst guardians film with the best villain of the trilogy i still really liked it overall though",2023-05-06
it feels like every aspect of adam warlock got nerfed from the books,2023-05-06
"after all the fab speculation of big main character deaths im glad gunn decided to let pretty much everyone retire in a way that made sense for each of them particularly starlord quill even calls it out himself that hes been running from all his problems ever since the worst day of his life as a kid now he can spend some time on earth and when hes ready he can return to space adventures hopefully much more mature like his early comic counterparts charactization 

throughout the trilogy i liked seeing gamora win over nebula and nebula learn to trust the guardians and avengers it would have been nice to see their roles reversed with a more human nebula redeeming the gamora that just escaped thanos",2023-05-06
a lot of the scenes from counterearth felt like it could be from a liveaction episode of rick and morty it was great,2023-05-06
kaiju groot also big boy groot nuff said,2023-05-06
all the animal abuse scenes were sad as  but what got me to tear up instantly was when peters grandpa recognized him and started crying,2023-05-06
cried a lot went home and hugged the cat while crying for a long time great movie,2023-05-06
"i’m really glad they didn’t have gamora fall back in love with peter it just would’ve felt cheap and not genuine 

everyone’s arc ended truly so beautifully in the end they all gained family and love",2023-05-06
"i just came back from seeing it i was worried i wasnt going to like it but i can honestly say i loved it i give it 910 i wouldnt say its on the same level as end game which is a 1010

for me it has the perfect mox of drama and comedy im really glad the arcs of drax rocket and peter quill were resolved peter went back to earth to reunite with his gradfather honestly i would love a tv series or movie about him being back on earth

rocket found a reason to keep on living and become captain of the gaurdians and drax ended up becoming the father he was always meant to be

the only downside was i was bewildered by the characters of adam warlock and his mother they are such powerful beings  why on earth would they be subservant to anyone also in the comics is adam warlock a superhero or a villian and why was he not more utilized throughout the guardians and avengers movies

also can anyone please explain at the end when peter almost dies why doesnt he put on his starlord mask from previous movies and fly to safety",2023-05-06
groot is such a big boy now,2023-05-06
i was expecting a 610 but i honestly would give this a 1010 for a blockbuster movie easily one of marvels best offerings i know it was a little disjointed but it’s the most emotional i’ve ever been over a comic book movie,2023-05-06
loved the film 1010 for me but the first credit scene when they are sat down waiting to fight was ,2023-05-06
why doesnt quill have his mask and rocket boots,2023-05-06
this is the first time ive ever cried in a movie theater i cried quite a bit,2023-05-06
i love you guys,2023-05-06
good movie however every cast and reviewer implied major deaths in this film the movie teased those deaths so much but nobody died wish i went in not hearing anything from the reviewers directors and cast and i’d probably like it even more,2023-05-06
how did drax survive the gunshot from the security guards did anyone else think he died i could have sworn the shot hit him in the chest,2023-05-06
i don’t give a  about the children save the poor animals,2023-05-06
"why did the vilian want rocket killed

even at a young age rocket was super advanced could speak as well as solve complex math puzzles why on earth would he want to  him

if you wanted to start a civiliziation rocket and his three friends would be perfect in helping to start it up 

by the way he wants to destroy rocket but he had no problem with the multitude of creatures that would go on to live in counter earth",2023-05-06
"only thing that felt force and cheap was glamora i give her credit for being skinny and method acting to drugged out crimanal 

but timeline she is from was when her and peter meet in hours i call  she never thought of betraying thanos that was the exact time she committed to leaving thanos the whole time when peter was stealing the power stone

it was cheap writing to get a star lord continuation movie or to write her out if she wanted out of the contract for next movie she could have been the one to sacrifice herself maybe grow a little she really had no arc and no reason to be there  

nebula really has been the break out character over the sagas 

rest of the movie was great",2023-05-06
"recall from the first movie  rockets line aint nothing in the universe like me cept me  

2 movies later you got rocket looking at a bunch of baby raccoons and realize that wasnt a throw away line about no one understanding quils earth references  having character development across 3 films like that its just incredible",2023-05-06
i was convinced that they were going to put the he into an evolution chamber and turn him into a chaos spawn,2023-05-07
"do you realize is such a perfect song for these guardians films it was unexpectedly moving 
 
i prayed it wasnt foreshadowing the fate of some characters with lyrics like do you realizethat everyone you know someday will die
 
also i will never hear creep do you realize and dog days are over the same ever again",2023-05-07
"i really liked this film marvel finally puts out a great movie since shangchi its more of a standalone and usually they connect to the rest of the marvel movies but this one doesnt no eternals except knowhere no multiverse no kang 

despite having great action the movie doesnt give the audience time to breathe especially when they revive rocket its immediately back to action i wouldve liked them to milk the dramatic parts a lot more warlock was a bit of a letdown he was fine as a character in the movie but not compared to his comic counterpart 

gotg 3 was very emotional and i felt like the movie did our main characters justice even our returning gamora im actually curious to see what happens to gotg afterward and marvel can expand this title like star wars 

they can get into the universal church of truth magus darkhawk wraith cosmic ghost rider moondragon blackjack ohare nohvarr quasar jack flag etc

i would love to see a disney plus series of the guardians of the galaxy

fyi if you guys want a book similar to rocket and his storyline i would suggest reading the pride of baghdad and we3",2023-05-07
why didnt peter have his helmet in this movie would have come awfully handy at the end,2023-05-07
chris pratt and no sleep till brooklyn so hot right now,2023-05-07
im sure im overthinking this but was groot saying he loved them him learning english or their way of playfully making the viewer finally understand his language,2023-05-07
i was full sobbing for like half that movie,2023-05-07
i love this movie but i cant help but think that the mid credits scene has the same ps3 era commercial vibe as the love and thunder ending,2023-05-07
"honestly chris pratt won me over with this performance 

he’s funny but can also deliver emotional scenes like rocket’s “death”",2023-05-07
groot after adam warlock decapitated him reminded me of the spiderhead from the thing,2023-05-07
"my two favorite animals are raccoons and otters and i own a rabbit



what the actual  did i do to james gunn to deserve this


 that was a good movie but also fucccccccckkkkkk",2023-05-07
best trilogy in the mcu without a doubt,2023-05-07
"honestly pretty satisfying way to conclude the guardians guardians was one of my favourites with the mcu and james gunn nailed it with this third film pretty happy with how each members story decided to end

on a different note loving that groot just ended up growing even bigger by the end give hulk a run for his money in the size department lol",2023-05-07
the one thing i didn’t get was how the high evolutionary said rocket was his only creation that itself could create but what about the gold people didn’t they create adam warlock,2023-05-07
"thought for a sec that we were gonna get a sia music video with all those white haired children lol 

was also shocked to hear an fbomb in an mcu movie",2023-05-07
"jist back from cinema and yes it is good

everyone get a good moment of awesomeness everyone grows into a better version of themselves love that we are not dealing with world breaking wvent but a personal one 

high evolution is not the strongest the guardian face but definitely a good villain to close their arc",2023-05-07
im not seeing enough love for how awesome nebula and how karen portrayed her was loved her character so much seemed like she gained a big heart but was still super badass and tough,2023-05-07
there is no  thats why i stepped up was a  tier villain line,2023-05-07
adam warlock flying in counterearth reminded me of superman now i’m very optimistic about legacy,2023-05-07
i was so worried rocket was going to die at the end when he was saving the animals,2023-05-07
did anyone else find a bit of a weird disjointed moment when mantis nebula and drax go up against those octopus things then it switched to thee command showing the ship being blown up and then back to mantis and co running from to octopus things they were just confronted with,2023-05-07
man i just saw it last night and this movie hit me hard but one thing among others that sticks out is how good chris pratt acted emotionally during the rocket heaven scene man i want to see the movie again but at the same time i don’t want to cry twice in one week lol,2023-05-07
 marvel fumbled the bag so hard losing james gunn what a great bookend for his tenure for the mcu excited for dc’s future,2023-05-07
the scene where drax cheers the kids up and helps rescue them is way too heartwarming,2023-05-07
perfect closing song,2023-05-07
i always love when comic book movies show superheroes actually being heroes it was so refreshing to see the third act turn into more of a rescue mission rather than a overlong cgi minion fight,2023-05-07
dude all i can say was this movie was peak,2023-05-07
why does drax know the language of children,2023-05-07
major flashbacks to sid’s room in the original toy story those scenes were intense,2023-05-07
i got rick  morty meets hitchhikers guide to the galaxy vibes from the the squishy planet really weird and fun and squishy,2023-05-07
i dont really cry over movies but that scream from rocket   man ,2023-05-07
four days sitting on this movie now and my only critique is not seeing more of the sovereign would have been more menacing seeing high evolutionaryadam with an army those little star wars sabotage droid things didn’t do much for me aside from that it was perfect drax felt like a character again mantis was more than comedic relief too only character that was sidelined a bit was gamora but i understand why she’s not the same character i’m gonna miss them 910 movie,2023-05-07
is nebula not gonna come back feel like i can’t find anything about her online,2023-05-07
well that feels like  near the perfect way to wrap up a trilogy satisfying conclusions to everyones arcs some extremely emotional moments im not one to usually tear up or cry at movies but there was a serious gut punch in there but also how is it taking me 3 movies to come to the conclusion that the guardians are just a dd party but in space,2023-05-07
what a film i enjoyed so many aspects of this movie definitely the best marvel showing in a good while thank you james gunn,2023-05-07
"ending gotg with the first “modern” song in the trilogy is such a wonderfully apt moment 

also of course adam is a prog rock fan",2023-05-08
"i got nothing much to add

all of these conclusions were pretty much a perfect closecontinue all their arcs

i’m so glad this movie wasn’t a bloodbath like we all thought it would be",2023-05-08
the creep opening already had set the mood for me knew we were in for something epic and that’s exactly what i got had so many emotions during this movie and that’s always what makes a good film good to me,2023-05-08
are we being angry again gamora you  was probably my favorite comedic line lol,2023-05-08
this movie was an absolute banger james gunn and crew cooked again,2023-05-08
why doesnt the high evolutionary go to the ship to get rocket himself or go to the guardians hq in the begininning,2023-05-08
"did you guys get the feeling that gunn was showing offgiving us a taste during the adam warlock fight scenesthe effecs were fcking viciousgoddamn im optimistic about superman legacy and dc as a whole  


great moviei liked it alot more than i thought i wouldloved the ending",2023-05-08
i went and saw this one with my bf first typically i take at least one of my kids on first viewing this movie was incredible  however the second i heard hurts from little rocket and was introduced to his new friends idk it all just went so dark for me i had this awful gut wrenching feeling through the entire first half of the film that was unlike pretty much anything i have ever seen i cant honestly describe it and when the scene happened i couldnt stop crying and almost had to leave the theater im very glad i watched it first before bringing my little one to see it ,2023-05-08
id love to see rocket again down the line with the new guardians heres to hoping lol,2023-05-08
"the approaching hand in the darkness set up the eventual dark nature of how this film was going to be

personally my favorite of the trilogy and top 5 marvel film for sure gunn absolutely nailed the body horror mixed with pure wholesomeness dcu is in good hands",2023-05-08
excellent movie with a lot of heart and some surprising risks it feels like the natural continuation of the last two and is probably marvel’s best film narrativewise since no way home or infinity war infinitely better than thor 4 nudge nudge i still think john wick chapter 4 is the movie of the year for me but this is a strong contender hopefully dune part 2 knocks it out of the park,2023-05-08
the pig cyborg lady and murderhawk robot should join the guardians forever they were magnificant,2023-05-09
"i enjoyed this movie so much and thought it wrapped up the trilogy beautifully


was a bit surprised that no one died given all the chatter and speculation before the movies release but im glad that every characters arc came to a close without the copout of having them die",2023-05-09
"my biggest gripe with the movie none of the guardians have no issue with adam warlock towards the end of the movie  
did they forget that he tried to  them all at the start of the movie and if not for a lot of luck rocket would have died  
so because rocket doesnt die and he saves peter they are all cool with him",2023-05-09
"there are hands that made us and there are hands that guide ours  
somthing close to that said by llyla im not crying",2023-05-09
my only gripe was that adam warlock was a shoddy and shallow character who didnt have one ounce of the real adam warlock in him could have easily been cut out the movie  only seemed to be in it to save quill,2023-05-09
havent seen anyone say it but when yondu showed up for a second i almost  cried out loud james gunn is such a  good character writer,2023-05-09
this was definitely one of the best mcu films imo and the soundtrack was so good,2023-05-09
"what was the first analogy that drax delivered
somthing pond something swim",2023-05-09
my one nerd criticism is there is no way this is the first time rocket has been seriously injured he has been running and gunning his whole life and is super self destructive and is constantly surrounded by huge weaponry and explosives how has he never needed major medical attention til now otherwise great marvel movie 85 out of 10 movies that show animal suffering have a shortcut to making me cry,2023-05-10
man the implications this movie had were really messed up i felt like we were created in a lab as well this is it for me they are never gonna make a movie as good as this this was the last marvel movie for me but im hella excited for the future of dcu,2023-05-10
ok the lady getting shot in the leg and then screaming was  amazing a lot of actual violence,2023-05-11
what happened to the goats from thor 4,2023-05-11
can we talk about the amount of pellets that were in their cages no one was taking care of them ,2023-05-11
james gunn you have no right making me bawl in the movie theater like that ,2023-05-12
that first fight against adam warlock was really good and pretty brutal i liked that drax got a chance to have a oneonone fight with him,2023-05-15
that no sleep till brooklyn hallway fight scene really felt like they were trying to outcirclefight the avengers,2023-05-15
"just saw the film yesterday and i dont know i didnt really like it i give it a 5050 

i feel that the movie was trying to tell a message i just dont know what that message was 

take for instance in the first movie drax was hellbent on revenge to the point he was a lonewolf out to get thanos so he sends a message and ronan shows up and wipes the floor with drax 

everyone gives drax grief drax realize he was wrong for going along to the point he shoots nebula with a bazooka and says something on the lines of messing with my friends 

but with this one they focus mainly on rocket and the only thing i could tell you was um i really dont know his orginal friends got killed and his new ones leave him

i understood mantis leaving quill leaving drax staying nebula staying  adam warlock

but far as rocket i dont feel like for a story too focus so much on him so much i didnt understand his actions 

like high evolutionary killed a whole planet of people plus rockets old friends rocket im gonna let you go um why

i just didnt understand that drax made a comment about everyone deserves a second chance 

i understood that with drax if anything he would know thatbut far as rocker i just dont know 

why  did he do that and plus i think he would be a terrible leader he was a notorious hothead 

if anything nebula would have been a better leader or mantis anybody but rocket

i just dont feel for a movie that focused so much on one charector nothing was really set up 

star lords and gamora story and how they dealt with it and mantis talking to peter about ponds made more sense 

mantis saying hey i been following others i need to do my own thing made sense

drax being a dad made sense

nebula staying  made sense 

rocket i just dont understand",2023-05-15
"good fun

though i cant help but recall josef mengele and feel desperately sad 

also they were all quite happy to  destroy everyone they came against including other robot animals who had been tortured by the high evolutionary but they wouldnt take out the top guy himself",2023-05-15
anyone else felt a little sad when ayesha died she really grew on me especially the motherson relationship between her and adamz,2023-05-16
i was over here fighting off tears for dear life at the but not yet scene ,2023-05-20
i feel rocket should of threw the high evolutionary in the pod and torched him like did so many others,2023-05-20
are we ever going to find out how rocket met groot,2023-05-21
"can someone please remind me the context of the first fbomb in gotg  i remember hearing it but i dont remember whenwhy


also anyone else very disappointed groot said i love you guys at the end  like why can he just say we are groot and have someone else say love you guys too",2023-05-21
rocket still having the key all that time later was such a touching moment he literally held the key to freeing himself the whole time he just never took the journey to make it happen,2023-05-21
was a bit confused about them destroying an entire planet identical to earth and barely anyone mentioning even trying to save anyone of them loved the movie tho,2023-05-24
i went in with as little information as possible and then because i had to run to get my subtitle machine fixed i missed the opening credits so nathan fillion was a complete surprise and i was over the moon ,2023-05-26
evil man creates furries,2023-05-26
was anyone else waiting for groot to say we are family,2023-06-03
lets all fight really hard to save rocket and then when hes rescued lets all leave him yeah thats pretty  mantis yelling at everyone constantly and the weak attempt to introduce adam warlock also lets have groot finally talk yet have the characters show zero reaction what was up with the high evolutionarys powers they were never explained he just had  like powers but was relatively unknown throughout the galaxy if hes destroyed civilizations hundreds of times in the past youd think someone wouldve heard about him i loved the first two guardians movies but this one just seemed lazy,2023-06-05
"i had a few gripes with the movie… 

a few moments felt tone deaf mantiss forget part felt manipulative then counter earth appearing and being made a mess of and then exploded with little emotional impact

and i really hated that cheesy bad dog running gag —generally cant stand what mainstream movies do to dogs

i also found many of the fight scenes a bit too overloaded to follow

… but overall it had a strong emotional core and was wellstructured definitely a standout among all marvel films",2023-06-07
im not sure how i feel about the gaurdians spilting up,2023-06-08
"i think it was slightly above average but it has been getting tons of praise because the mcu movies since endgame have all been mid to poor yes even shang chi  no way home this is definitely the strongest mcu film since endgame

positives

 the emotional beats were mostly well struck the movie does hit you in the feels

 character work was strong as always with james gunn gunn knows how to develop characters

 the villain was properly creepy although still as generic as ever

  great humor as is also the case with guardians definitely had me laughing in multiple places although not having rocket in it did steal some of the funny from before

 they did almost nail the ending left it on a great note while there is a possibility of a return of the guardians with this ending they can also be done forever without any dangling story left

negatives

 the guardians movies always had great visuals this time around i felt that gunn didnt experiment enough with developing cgi and bigger budgets i expected a visual feast but ala thor ragnarok but sadly this was not the case here

 the action was mid too the one take action scene in the end was a standout but otherwise i cannot recall a single action scene which was memorable

 wasnt really a fan of nebula here she just doesnt seem to fit in with the rest and her concerns for rocket felt forced

 i feel the pacing was a bit off could have trimmed some scenes here and there and the movie could have closed closer to 2 hours rather than 25 hours

x200b

overall gotg 3 is a solid entry to the mcu and a fitting finale definitely better than gotg 2 but i feel it missed the height of gotg 1 which is a comic book movie classic

rating 710",2023-06-09
so whose the white haired girl at the end why does she have powers,2023-07-07
ay that war pig was  awesome the sorceress alien was awesome and some of the camera angles were interesting,2023-07-08
imma be honest i really loved the movie,2023-07-09
"i absolutely loved the movie and not only that but after the credits we see the new gotg team appear with rocket as their captain tbh i’m hoping they get their own film series which they most likely will get one before or after avengers secret wars i’m just hoping that marvel doesn’t  off rocket anytime soon due to the fact that he isn’t completely done in the mcu yes he went through a lot of character development and his arc was very fulfilling however at the end of gotg vol 3 we can see that rocket is given a new purpose and that he is now supposed to leadguide this new team of guardians and seeing as to how secret wars will be releasing soon in the next couple of years i am really hoping marvel won’t  off rocket yet we haven’t even gotten to see how rocket develops new relationships with this new team which will eventually make them a family just like how the og guardians were imo it’s gonna be so wasteful and dumb of marvel if they decide to  any of the new gotg members off including rocket very wasteful and we still have the opportunitypossibility of a new gotg film series before andor after avengers secret wars like i can only hope marvel can understand this and not  off rocket raccoon especially not in secret wars also after gotg vol 3 rocket is most definitely one of the biggest and most popular fanfavorite characters to exist in the mcu so far so hopefully marvel won’t  off a fanfavorite character like rocket yetespecially not anytime soon since he’s finally getting a break after all the  and trauma he went through in vol 3 like please after seeing rocket so tired and sorrowful for the entire movie i need to see more happy rocket with his new family in future marvel films to come 

and to add on to that i’ve recently noticed that marvel has been killing a lot of og marvel characters recently so i’m hoping rocket is an exception to marvels’ mass genocide in the mcu… 

but yeah this movie was a good send off for the og guardians team but i can’t wait to see more from the new team in future marvel films tho especially rocket since he’s the only og guardian left in the new team",2023-07-09
"wow its 6 am and i finished the last 30 minutes on the treadmill and im in tears

drax the dad",2023-08-04
"i wanted to enjoy this movie but i found myself just so disappointed by the end
the stand outs of the movie are rockets story and nebula
but the rest of it felt like a bad session at a game table the team didnt ever really feel like a team mostly felt like they hated one another most the movie star lord became cringe lord for 95 of the movie the humor was mistoned for most of the movie struggling to decide if the characters were idiots or trying to be funny at the wrong times these didnt really feel like the characters from the last movies this felt like a jammed in and forced goodbye",2023-08-05
no one else is sad the series is over  ugh i have a sunken heart watching this like when i finished the harry potter series sad that its over sigh back to regular life i guess,2023-08-06
"just watched this rn and only wanted to say that rocket is one of my favourite characters in the mcu didnt think it was possible to love him more but this movie proved me wrong

and also drax the dad is so much more cooler than drax the destroyer",2023-08-14
aw man just watched this for the first time as it is now out on disney plus and i gotta say the animal abuse was extremely hard for me to watch some parts i felt like i was going to cry good movie overall and some funny parts which i love about this franchise but  yeah…some parts were really really sad and hard to watch,2023-08-17
very late to the party i avoided this movie all this time because the trailers and all the comments here prerelease made it seem like one of them died my heart could not take it but finally i said  it and watched it last night man what a relief it still hits your emotions like a truck but it ends in such a high note as always gotg does not disappoint,2023-08-19
"finally got to watch it man what a great sendoff to the old members of guardians and the new one is looking like they are gonna be op as well

adam scenes are fun but i wish he had more with ayesha just get killed like that is just tragic

also the scene where the tease out peter going to die freezing like yondu just for zune and making creation of adam gag feels cheap even if its kinda funny since peter is now home at earth he could easily obtain new one and even send racoon new one",2023-08-19
rockets backstory scenes were the only good parts of the movie only parts of the movie that had crazy emotional buildup every other aspect of the movie made me feel i was watch some spy kids movie ,2023-08-26
everyone talking about rocket meanwhile here i sit happy and tearing up over nebula screaming with joy into the sky while dancing with children,2023-09-12
"a very difficult film to review because it does seem to be at general mediocre level of marvel films but the rocket part even if being the most typical story of revenge ever told again and again and again did hit me quite hard

however not having rocket in the majority of the guardians shenanigans is a huge downside 

the villain is terrible especially how underpowered he seems to be even when early in the film they said he is too powerful gamora could not have been in it and it would have been a better film because there is a loooooooot of screetime with gamora you barely get to see adam warlock

the only parts that i did like are of course most of the guardians and their interactions but taking gamora and rocket out leaves the group very weak there are some action scenes that are really cool and rockets story

the ending feels very forced its probably the only ending in the 3 guardians films where it doesnt make any sense that they suddenly want to go each their own way i understand it has to happen because it the end of the era of the guardians for now but nothing in the film really compels me to believe it 

in the first one they barely kmow each other so it would have make more sense in the second one the have to face extremely low odds of survival against a godplanet and even yondu dies so it would have make sense for them to leave it at that in the third they expend the film trying to rescue the guardians members and no situation they go through is worse than anything they had experienced before even tho the film wants you to think that oh look they might die actually",2023-05-05
"good

 the high evolutionary deliciously and horrifically evil  really hope he comes back because theres a lot you could do with a villain this twisted  someone check sam raimis schedule and see if he has time for another marvel movie because he is a villain tailormade for sam’s deft hand

 rockets backstory very effective and really makes you feel for him as he tries to terms with his existence  when rocket reminds everyone that there are more than just humans to saved that moment hit hard and i loved it

bad

 the plot outside of rockets backstory this plot is just a convoluted fetch quest a la rise of skywalker  i also had problems with hes reasoning behind wanting to recreate earth like huh of all the races creatures worlds civilizations you specifically chose earth that decision just felt incredibly contrived considering the diversity of the marvel cosmic universe  its even more frustrating when gunn has leaned into this colorful diversity through out all three films 

 gamora she just existed to give peter feels  she didnt really exist as an actual character but as a checkbox to make it look like the team was back together for one final ride it would have been more poignant to just leave her out of the story and have peter deal with his grief with the help of his friends

 adam warlock criminally underused but i dont know how exactly one would have made it work within this particular script  he just didnt need to be there and for us fans of the character its disrespectful to just leave him in and give him absolute nothing coolinteresting to do



 the soundtrack granted it wasnt as bad as the first two films but man these tracks just do not work and reinforce the human centered universe trope  it should be a cardinal sin to put beastie boys in any film soundtrack

final word  i love guardians of the galaxy in the comics and i initially really liked the first movie  but as i’ve rewatched them and now having watched the final film i can’t help but feel like this experiment was a big disappointment  nothing that made the comics great made the transition into the movies i guess what breaks my heart the most is that we’ll never get a proper treatment of the da material and instead we’re left with this bendisian piece of throwaway entertainment",2023-05-05
"i dont understand why the guardians of the galaxy movies are so silly i dont mean silly like funny its not funny its just dumb drax mantis and peter talk like they are doing baby talk and its probably not a coincidence its probably how james gunn directs them most of the movie feels like sketch parody like they stop in the middle of the action and gamora says just admit youre making up what he says like we get it that was the joke no need to spell it

and why was peter quill talking to the aliens like a clueless american tourist in a foreign country hes been in space for 30 years hasnt he encountered a language barrier before saying words louder isnt going to help he needed to do more miming and drawing and keep his voice down

and the music is so annoying james gunns music tastes are completely different than mine so the songs never give me that intended joy of recognizing a song you like its always just  gen x music to me i think theres only one song i can recognize and enjoy in each movie aint no mountain high enough in vol 1 father and son in vol 2 and creep in vol 3",2023-05-07
"im baffled people thought this was a good movie completely ignoring the comics and viewing it entirely on its own this was an absolutely lazy script i dont even know why it was 2 and half hours it definitely didnt need to be if this is supposed to be the big send off for this cast why play it so safe  


i dont even know why adam warlock was even in it absolutely wasted that character if this is one of the best as people are saying i definitely dont want to see anything else",2023-05-08
the whole build up was familyfriends but it ended with them being like “aight y’all…imma do me” i expected more of a payoff,2023-05-05
why is it so hard for quill to understand that this new gamora is a completely different person it’s not like she lost her memory and everyone knows what happened,2023-05-05
theres no way you people are real this has to be a  psyop by marvel to increase movie sales i do not believe for a second that actual humas are behind these words and ratings,2023-05-07
"i admit i was pretty disappointed with this movie it wasnt bad but it wasnt nearly as good as the previous two

the plot desperately needed downtime but the structure of the plot didnt allow for any downtime 5 minutes into the movie rocket is critically injured and they are in a rush to save his life for most of the rest of the movie and when they finally do now mantis drax and nebula meaning we immediately have to rush to fix that basically 2 and a half hours of nearly constant threat

and overall the jokes just didnt land as much there were small laughs throughout but nothing was quite as funny as jokes from the first two movies the cosmo bits were the funniest parts imo

and rocket felt horribly underused considering hes everyones favorite and hes the entire crux of the plot this time but he spends 90 of the movie in a coma and his backstory basically did not work for me much beyond the villain who was great the stuff in his cell felt like it would be straight out of a childrens movie if you removed all the horrible cybernetics i only really felt sad about them dying because rocket felt sad and then towards the end it did the super cliched character sees the light while dying and sees their loved one who says its not their time yet bit i couldnt believe they did it completely straight it was nuts overall i just really wanted more rocket interacting with the others  


speaking of interaction it would have been nice if the characters didnt spend like 75 of their time interacting by yelling at each other just constant screaming it got old and i need to rewatch the first two to see how they used the licensed music but it felt poorly used this time i dont think the use of music stuck out to me in a bad way the first two movies but here it kinda did and none of the musical moments really improved their scenes like they did in the first movie certainly no fathers and sons moment like in 2 and final complaint the cinematography just didnt feel nearly as inspired this time 1 and 2 had some genuinely beautiful shots and moments that just made me go wow the only static shot that really stood out to me this time was at the end when quill was floating towards knowhere 

for positives chukwudi iwuji really sold his character he was easily the best part of the movie for me and i will say the big hallway fight once everyone finally got together was pretty  cool ill say if you took the time to read this entire whiny essay know that i only wrote it out because i was genuinely excited for this movie gotg1 and 2 are easily my favorite marvel movies and just great movies in general i dont hate this movie but for me it was just fine and given that its basically the sendoff for the director and the franchise thats a big shame to me",2023-05-07
"feels surreal to read all the praise this was some of the worst  ive ever seen tweecore reaching its final form

the contrast between overly cutesy animal tearjerker  and absolutely wasted gore and profanity idek which tone they were aiming for but i guess its just the same old power of friendshipfamily nonsense",2023-05-08
adam warlock definitely felt shoehorned in,2023-05-05
man i dont know if i can watch this movie with all the animal abuse scenes,2023-05-05
loved the movie but a very odd choice for rockets first mission was to… animals…,2023-05-06
"i’m gonna be honest…i really didn’t love love this one i think i’m fairly alone in that it wasn’t “bad” i just don’t think i’ll ever feel the need to watch it again definitely a strong villain though and good performances allaround 

i didn’t cry at all which surprised me i think because the plot points just weren’t that shocking so you could definitely anticipate the blows either that or i’m dead inside but honestly the most shocking thing to me was that random endcredits scene with the cereal lol",2023-05-07
"it was ok not the best written a lot of it felt crowbarred in the jokes didn’t often work and the music felt like they went  we’re a guardians film better have some rather than it flowing well like the first film
bit too on the nose in attempts to get you to care",2023-05-10
"best marvel movie in a long while but that’s really not saying much imo

i liked it but it still falls victim to the same storytelling and pacing traps that are common to many other marvel films  

	 spend the first third of the film setting up the story with painfully obvious foreshadowing 

 follow the hero’s journey template as closely as is humanly possible but this time with flashbacks

 cheap one liners that call back to the obvious setups from earlier “good dog” “i’m a raccoon”

 bittersweet ending

people have compared the villain to thanos but i think that’s a disservice to thanos  he’s certainly more hateable than thanos was but i don’t think that’s necessarily the mark of a great villain  i much prefer a sympathetic relatable villain to this sort of unbridledcrueltyforthesakeofit stuff

i was surprised with how dark it was thematically  but i found quite a few scenes to be needlessly uncomfortable for what is ultimately a film in a franchise that’s supposed to be relatively allages

i also wish the jokes they told were just an ounce more original  most of the humour felt like recycled material from the previous two installations  

	haha drax is so dense haha mantis is so naïve haha quill is from earth and get this  rocket  he’s a raccoon 

“open the  door” was a great way to use a pg13 rating’s one swear word though  

overall it was good for a marvel film but it wasn’t a great movie  definitely exceeded my expectations but not by a huge amount",2023-05-13
"the movie is… good and i appreciate that it took risks but this was just too somber and depressing for a guardians movie the musical moments never hit the action was mediocre outside of one scene the soundtrack was awful  it’s only memorable moments were reused tracks from the first film and lots of characters did nothing the whole movie

the ending was nice but i felt wasn’t 100 earned felt like they had to end it just because not because the story had naturally come to that conclusion",2023-05-05
i feel like gunn went fully unhinged with the violence and dark scenes because he knew it was his last marvel movie and i kinda wish he dialed it back a little the guardians movies have always been more of an upbeat vibe for the most part,2023-05-05
nathan fillion constantly bringing up that he has “one of those” on his team had me in tears every time,2023-05-05
this was insane i was so genuinely satisfied with this ending of a great trilogy can we just talk about the high evolutionary he’s 1000x better than kang and was actually terrifying what a great villain we really went back to the basics here but in the best way possible,2023-05-05
"so whats the deal with starlord not using his helmet anymore especially in battle  did i forget about something in a previous film

also i cant be the only one who thought the high evolutionary was red skull when his face got ripped off  

lastly this film sure does gloss over an entire planet being destroyed",2023-05-05
"i like the guardians disbanding but i feel like it was done in such a weird way that it’s literally my only complaint lol they went through all that  for rocket and were so focused on being a family

peter saying ima head out was kinda jarring idk if anyone else felt like that",2023-05-05
"this is the first marvel film in over a decade to actually feel like a  movie instead of “episode yadayada of the cinematic universe” there was a plot that went abc complete with emotion gravitas and reasonably inserted humor but it did not feel any bit as ‘manufactured’ as the grand majority of the mcu’s catalogue as far as i’m concerned the guardians of the galaxy are the guardians of “mcu humor” i’m reluctant to suggest that this was james gunn’s “swan song” for his mcu contributions but his touch was unmistakable dc films might actually get it together 

that being said this wasn’t a perfect film truth be told my enjoyment of the film began to sap once the ‘children’ were introduced i kept thinking “here we go again” as i looked back to thor love and thunder and how they decided to end that film thankfully the children didn’t band together to defeat the villain like with the aforementioned film but man you can’t help but feel disney’s grubby insincerely polite hands all over that children’s sequence the dance scene at the end was filmed  near like a disney world commercial 

also the cop outs i blame disney once again but i do have to ask is it really that traumatizing to children to have to  off a major character in a film that has gore all over the place think of the high evolutionary’s dismembered face does disney somehow stand to lose money in merchandising simply because a major character won’t be in the films even though the likeness of the character can be made into toys for perpetuity had one of starlord or rocket died this would’ve turned into a genuinely great film quit treating us like morons disney we’re ready for something serious 

frankly i needed more adam warlock his “sixth ranger” arc felt a little incomplete and i enjoyed many of his scenes as his flying scenes and dialogue had a very “oldschool” comic book feel to them a part of me thought that this was a primer for what james gunn wants to bring to the table for the dc universe i just wish it wasn’t at the expense of an enjoyable performance from will poulter 

overall i felt relief as much as i did enjoyment from this film relief that marvel studios is capable of making a normal  movie that doesn’t require hours of homework and doesn’t totally infantilize its audience walking out of the theatre felt like i was transported back to 2008 after having watched iron man for the first time 

at the same time marvel studios will not learn the right lessons from this film and without james gunn around to challenge the mouse to a degree i think that marvel studios will regress and we’re gonna end up with more of the same stuff at least it was refreshing to see this stand out from the ‘typical’ mcu fare even if you’re a superhero film hater this will be a pleasant surprise",2023-05-06
"i enjoyed it especially how they approached quill and gamora was worth the time seeing it i didnt like how sad a good chunk of the movie was just because itll be hard to rewatch compared to 12 ending sequence was the best out of the marvel movies

dont like how quill left the guardians just to visit his grandpa seemed unnecessary",2023-05-06
"this is a top tier superhero movie balanced all the elements correctly with heavy saddramatic themes on animal cruelty godintellectual complex ending relationships and moving on communication and caring for loved ones as well as comedy and amazing action sequences were all paced im a very effective way to maintain interest and invest in the characters and what happens to them 

the high evolutionary was pretty intense and despicable i really liked kang and its easy to  on him now with the whole rl drama but the high evolutionary was far more intimidating and felt more consequential in the counterearth than kang did in the quatam realm i also liked that he was emotionally fueled out of pure jealousy of rocket than anything which caused him to act irrationally vs kang doing things to drive the story and plot 

the guardians also didnt feel op and barley survived every encounter because they were not following quills plans as usual and were not moving as a until they were at their strongest point when they came together at the end to set all the people and animals free this was rockets story but strong performances from everyone nebula i think had the most growth and impact in this movie 

a couple things i didnt care for

 quill fakeout death and save by warlock felt kinda cheesy and unnecessary if it didnt happen nothing would have changed could have had warlock saving the animals to change your perception of him 

 gamora was far too aggro and she didnt even really come around she didnt have to end up with quill but it was a mistake to not have her realize she had a place with the guardians 

 there wasnt enough rocket and groot as their relation was important but i guess we got that in all the other showings 

 ravagers just dropped gamora off and disappeared they had a dude with dr strange powers why didnt he just portal them into the place instead of all the  they did to get in
 
 gamora was disturbed by the high evolutionary destroying counterearth and asked who would genocide and entire race or something like that but at the same time was working with thanos and didnt turn good like the gamora from their universe just a weird line and context kinda took me out

overall a great movie 910 for me and i look forward to gunn building the dc universe",2023-05-06
maybe a little too long but this is easily the best mcu film in years finally a good balance of jokes and heart and a standout villain as well amazing end to the trilogy,2023-05-06
the best thing about this movie is that this proves james gunns right about how theres only superhero fatigue depending on the type of story being told and thats what movies like black adam and quantumania are missing,2023-05-07
high evolutionary was done so much better than kang was,2023-05-07
my group felt the movie was not great scenes dragged on overly brutal destroy an entire planet and barely mention it frantic pace and dragged out and too long at the same time glad others enjoy it,2023-05-07
after 3 movies we all are able to understand groot now was a lovely touch,2023-05-08
"i loved it

chukwudi iwuji is easily one of the best villains in the mcu as the high evolutionary i looked into his filmography because i was curious about other work hes done and noticed he is classically trained that really came across in his characterization of the high evolutionary as a megalomaniac genius hellbent on capturing rocket not simply due to some technological advantage rockets brain has but also because he surpassed him in intelligence despite being his creation 

reminded me a bit of the contempt peter weyland feels for david in the new alien films although obviously the high evolutionary has completely descended into madness 

rockets flashbacks were devastating probably the most emotional of any mcu film 

allinall i thought this was a good ending to the franchise in its current form",2023-05-08
pretty wild that they  a dude and rip a computer out of his skull,2023-05-10
its been days since ive seen it and i will randomly remember the sound of floors panicked voice and baby rocket saying hurts and start crying im going to have to talk about this in therapy,2023-05-10
"it’s been days and this delivery from bautista is still making me laugh 

drax are we pretending to be angry again mantis you ",2023-05-11
"so things i liked in this film

 everything with rocket including other characters interactions with him like peters reaction when he comes back on the table
 draxs arc and how they pay homage to the previous films and christmas special his almost sibling like relationship with mantis it was truly beautiful 
 nebulas arc in the film
 how the jokes for the most part dont undercut the tone when its truly serious and how they mostly land well
 how it is very much standalone from the rest of the current mcu

things i didnt like in this film in no particular order

 the runtime is pretty lengthy you could easily shave about 20 minutes off of this film and lose nothing i wont detail everything but two examples are 

a the house sequence on counterearth could be completely cut and replaced with them just stealing a car  it is completely within character for them to do this 

b the time spent on that fleshy planet could be reduced keep the jokes thay work ditch the ones that dont

 mantis did mantis ending seem a little weird to you like they didnt know what to do with her thats how it felt for me and i think you can  two birds with one stone here for me or rather two issues that i have with this film 

a they fake out deaths so much but never follow through with it

b mantis should die in this film she can have a  heros death as she  well deserves but she should die her death would add so much to the film especially if they keep a few fake outs first so we start to think they dont have the balls to actually do it then bam mantis is dead

 gamora obviously this is not the gamora from vol 1 vol 2 or infinity war but she is from the same time period as when peter steals the power stone and so she would be in the same head space as our vol 1 gamora and she just wasnt she was far far too savage and angry i get she has been dumped in another universe but

a she would 100 stick with nebula as vol 1 gamora loved nebula at least initially and it is clear she didnt after endgame 

b she was the moral heart of vol 1 making them do the right thing whenever possible she was not an angry needlessly violent 

c i believe she would at least hear peter out if both he and nebula told her about the life he and his gamora shared rather than just  off without giving him the chance to explain himself honestly this is my biggest issue with this film her character was completely off and its ruined her character arc in a sense

 leading on from gamora is peter now i actually love how they both end separated but how they got there was all wrong peter held his own most of the time but when gamora was about to beat the  into him he shouldve fought back at least with words telling her how they are going to save their friend and she will have to just stomach that until its done 
i also believe they shouldve made more about the photo of him and his mum and grandpa his whole arc of this film shouldve been tossing up whether to chase gamora or go back and see his grandpa or at least pay his respects to his and his mothers grave obviously he will play his part in this film for the main plot but i wouldve preferred gamora and peter slowly coming closer over the course of the film culminating in a scene after he almost dies  where she should totally join in the hug of just the two of them where they kiss this can either be romantically or simply as an experiment for both of them
after it he can realise that while she is gamora she isnt his gamora and so he gets closure on his gamora being dead gamora can then go do whatever she wants it seems like zoe saldana wants out of the mcu so she can stay and help nebula and drax perhaps as neither of them seem eager to return either while he can go back home as both the woman he loved and his sister mantis are now gone so it makes sense for him to head back to earth and leave the other guardians  especially if gamora stays



 finally while rockets arc was superb the rest of the main characters especially peter and gamora did suffer due to this but this is more of a minor quibble

all the above being said i did enjoy this film it is my least favourite of the three but i will still watch it again on future i dont hate it by any means it was good i was just disappointed that it didnt wrap up as nicely as i expected it to",2023-05-11
"i know that the marvels is coming out and they will probably keep making space adventures but gotg 3 is the last mcu movie for me they are never gonna make a movie as good as this   


quantum mania and thor lt both had space adventures but what they were lacking was the heart this movie had so much heart it had so much humanity and empathy the characters were taking the situation seriously it was like an antimarvel movie   
here is the part that is the most ironic gotg comes out surprises everyone and marvel starts making every movie like guardians of the galaxy 1 and they take everything from that movie but only on the surface level this keeps going on they keep making movies with the same humor same tone and they cant make up their mind about anything and make so many changes that the end result looks like a cheaply made b movie theres no creativity anymore you can edit together and interchange scenes between thor lt and antman q and it would look like the same movie they were both really badly made guardians of the galaxy movies and without the heart   
in gotg 3 when we cut to baby rockets eyes close up a full cgi shot looking as realistic as possible and me getting a gut wrenching feeling in the heart seeing this poor defenseless baby in pain i knew i was in for something special the camera movement is dynamic the movie has so much creativity but the heart and what it says about empathy and humanity hits so deep for me   
i will give you a small example in both avengers iw and endgame they both have scenes where they joke about rocket being a talking raccoon its like the mcu self referential humor wink wink we know this is a talking raccoon but these jokes always come at the expense of the character theres not even one joke that winks to the camera like that rockets story is taken 100 percent seriously and touches on some extremely dark and disturbing imagery my point here is the characters take the story seriously theres a tone the camera is dynamic and a lot of it is practical   
another example is the disappearing helmets gotg 1 was the first movie to do it but in that movie it was done with care and it made sense for the character to wear it and then they started doing with everyone even spiderman and bruce overtime it just became a lazy way to have the helmet off for actors screen time they took something good overused it and ruined it this movie look has no shot where a helmet cheaply appears out of nowhere its a solid vision from the first frame to the last it has a message about animal cruelty humanity  
it is the new benchmark theres so much heart in the movie its contagious after so many years ive seen a marvel movie which brought something new to the genre this is why its my last mcu movie ending this journey on a high note considering the amount of slog i sat through i dont think they are capable of making another movie like this",2023-05-14
they couldve used any aaa actor to play another forgettable mcu villain but chukwudi just straight up killed it,2023-05-14
man i honestly really dislike this movie it wasn’t bad but it definitely was not as good as the first two it’s a shame because i was really looking forward to this film ,2023-05-16
am i the only one that found that the movie was full of screaming like at all scenes if an actor wants to show emotion they just scream maybe it bothered me more than it should but it just broke the immersion for me ,2023-07-09
"i want my 2 hours back but unfortunately i cannot get them back i am bit sad i really enjoy chris pratt in several movies like in jurassic world series bradley cooper did amazing as rockets voice one of the best voice acting ive heard in a while

was there anything good about the movie visuals i guess beautiful cgi as always crumbling buildings havent seen that before i did somewhat enjoy rockets backstory but it tried too much to be a tearjerker but other than that i was bored after 1 hour of watching it felt like ive been watching it forever mindless boring action without tension jokes jokes and some more jokes dont get me wrong action movies can have jokes look at lethal weapon or even die hard or nolan batmantrilogy they have jokes in them but not all the time everybody is a comedian that is a problem in modern superhero movies it takes all the seriousness and tensioun out of a movie sam raimi spiderman are fun movies they still take themselves seriously

anyway didnt enjoy the movie i did like the vol 1 while vol 2 was little worse i still enjoyed it more than this one i did like antman quantumania much more",2023-07-11
humor was excellent throughout laughed out loud probably a dozen times or more song choice was noticeabley worse and more general use songs were in the movie this time only real big stand out musically was the flaming lips  do you realize but they cut that out at the best part of the song the plot was all over the place without spoiling anything i will say adam warlocks introduction action scene makes zero sense when you discover what he was sent to do a lot of it felt lazy like everything on counterearth was just cheap animal costumes and zero creativity or logic for the world space also has zero logic applied with multiple suits being opened cockpits in space being breached and even knowhere getting opened up to zero issue until the last scene in space where space does actually behave like space all of a sudden the characters have mostly become flanderized too which is pretty disappointing and i have a strong feeling disney is pushing for more children in all their comic movies now as this and thor were jam packed full of children still better than most mcu stuff since endgame id give it a 510,2023-05-05
"this movie felt like a successor to vol 3 in the worst possible way the characters were reduced to the barest caricatures of themselves the storylines werent cohesive and in some cases were outright illogical and with the exception of rockets the character endings didnt feel earned 

to me this whole movie felt like james gunn checking boxes so he could be done with marvel and focus on dc ",2023-05-07
everyone saying they were sad in the “rocket teefs floor go now” but when the camera pans and there is a dead walrus in a wheelchair how do u not laugh ,2023-05-07
only thing i wasn’t a fan of was rocket not blasting the high evolutionary at the end  “we’re the guardians of the galaxy” didn’t really hit with me,2023-05-05
"i didn’t like it at all and i loved the first two

i’m not going to bother with the general criticisms but i will say that making sad torture  in flashbacks is incredibly cheap and made me feel like if i was watching a crappy anime yeah crappy because it wasn’t even good it wasn’t mitty",2023-05-05
i thought is was really  dumb,2023-05-05
"i was disappointed with this movie its not bad but it has a lot of problems it reminded me of rise of skywalker at times everything goes superfast with barely any room to breath get the thing oh no this doesnt work lets get the other thing oh no this doesnt work either lets get the other thingyou can cut out that entire 20 minute meatplanet section and it would not change anything
also so many convenient things that make no sense theres a scene where the villain has captured drax nebulla and mantis and he tells quill that he will give the coordinates to his ship so quill can bring him rocket in exhange for the others quill tells him to go  himself and then the connection is broken without telling the coordinates how the  are they supposed to find them doesnt matter next scene they arrive at the enemy ship and even craiglin shows up with the spacestation to save day how convenient it took me out of the movie it is easily the weakest of the guardians movies for me",2023-05-05
"i was excited for this because i heard good reviews but man i did not like it at all  

20 minutes too long pacing was disjointed and all over the place weak soundtrack except for one or two songs 

and i thought these movies were supposed to be funny  there wasn’t one moment where my packed theatre laughed out loud together prior movies had several  a few random chuckles here and there but almost all the jokes and comedic moments fell flat

vol 1  45   
vol 2  255  
vol 3  155",2023-05-06
"this one mostly disappointed me

 there was some weird plot devices and it dragged on way too long near the middle and towards the end of the movie 

i dont wanna sound like a fedora tipper but the scene where the villain says theres no  and then the entire crew decides to mutiny him for saying that made me cringe hard atheism doesnt deserve that sort of unnecessary prejudice especially in a marvel movie

i gave it a generous 610 and hopefully whoever wrote the cringe mutiny scene never writes again",2023-05-07
"classic marvel is back bb nothing but fake deaths and weak and weird villains and the heroes are all standup comedians 

 marvel movies man always leaving you blue balled and wanting more 

610",2023-05-07
"there were some intensely cringe moments in this that made me physically recoil in gastrointestinal pain why marvel why perfectly good setup good potential and they just need to inject heavy cliche campy cringeass moments like the kids what is this obsession with marvel needing to have a gaggle of random  kids that we have zero connection to needing to be saved just like love and thunder probably the same  at marvel coming up with this idea i dont care about random kids that we as an audience have no connection to giant crowd of animals needing to be saved  yeah now that makes sense because its directly related to the plot just do that instead

predictable mohawk guy with the predictable needle  at the end  holy  many flying enemies are pouring in at once and this guy  up his needle attack previously what could possibly happen is he going to redeem himself  dora the explorer choices  going on

bad dog running gag leading to good dog all along at the end  no way prank gone wrong

loud as  screamingjokes between the gang  funny 

no youre  nuh uh no you did you just call me stoopid

 people that somehow participated in saving the universe and who are professional adult space faring thieves who know how to handle advanced alien technology

alien tentacle monsters giant ferocious and deadly that choose to inch slowly towards their prey than pounce on the  and  them as they should because plot 

sylvester stallone popping in for a quick paycheck 

groot saying i love you gave me end stage renal cancer vin listen here vin just stick to i am groot ok dontlisten to me just just dont he could have said family and itd have been better because thats a big meme

villain was fantastic in his acting but i wanted to see some sort of motivation behind his crazed experimentation apart from evil looking bad guy with evil looking henchmen show us his past so we can understand his motivation the handsome jackesque design was great though

it could have been a really solid movie but these weird offkilter choices just sours it all somewhat the ending dance nearly shortened my lifespan by a few years ah yes the city is in ruins and everyones badly hurt lets bust out the  moves and another 50 soundracks because  yeah we paid for the rights 

6510",2023-05-10
anyone else feel that the film tried to have its cake and eat it too by making us feel sorry for the animals being experimented on but then all too happy to have them be henchmen fodder to look cool being murdered during the action scenes otherwise it was probably my favourite mcu film since endgame great conclusion for the characters hearing in the meantime on the big screen was awesome for this 90s kid,2023-05-05
"man seeing rockets past had me choked up because young rocket looks exactly like my puppy krypto there were so many moments where i cried that when i saw him revived i just lost it had to go back home and give my dog the tightest hug

but what a good  film man gunn shows that he loves these characters immensely and gives a deserving send off to all them easily my favourite trilogy in the mcu",2023-05-05
hot take i might’ve actually enjoyed this more than endgame ,2023-05-07
"did you guys notice no one reacted when groot spoke

groot in universe actually said i am groot but we as the audience at the end finally got to understand what he actually means

i love you guys",2023-05-07
"i just got out of seeing it and i am probably going to get downvoted but i did not think it was nearly as good as everyone is saying it felt very uneven some of the acting was really bad throughout and this one probably had the worst writing out of all three movies the only thing that was superior about this one was the flashback scenes the flashbacks to rocket and his friends was beautiful and sad and tragic some of the action scenes were fun but long the film felt over long also they made mantis way too over the top camp and cartoonish in both the christmas special and this 

i see people putting this one in their top 5 or 10 and while i respect your opinions i disagree i actually think it’s weird people hate on eternals so much but are loving this eternals was a much better made film than this

i loved cosmic the dog and found it cool when it could have been  and cheesy",2023-05-05
"kind of a hot mess i thought

you know how we keep saying that the mcu makes tv shows that should have been movies this is a movie that feels like it should have been a streaming series  there is enough material here for 68 episodes of television and nothing has a chance to cook before were on to the next go here to get the thing and do the stuff

gamora and quills farscape relationship felt like it should have been front and center and instead it was an afterthought i waited six years for a few shoehorned in scenes between them we had a better payoff to gunns brother learning how to use his fin than we did to a five movie long romance arc

the high evolutionary was like 50 thanos 50 kang 50 the bad guy from serenity played by chewiebeetle and 50 the boss from peacemaker a very big villain

i cant be the only one who expected a just deserts style comeuppance where the bad guy gets jammed into his evolution chamber and turns into a brundlefly monstrosity right cause what we got felt super anticlimactic

warlock losing that gold chick should have been the moment he was recruited by the bad guy and turned into his vader henchman this felt like an obvious missed opportunity to integrate two wildly disconnected narrative strands

too much cgi pixel  but it looked a lot better in parts than other recent mcu efforts",2023-05-07
"of all the screaming marvel villains he was one of them 

610",2023-05-07
"havent felt disappointed by a movie like this in so long

i felt like vol 2 had such a strong thematic hook with the whole message of chosen family quill has to accept that his one blood relative wasnt as important to him as the friends he made yondu gamora nebula groot all have to grapple with their dysfunctional families it felt tight fun and potent a story about people learning to appreciate what they had

this movies just a mess the first half or so is insanely good that intro sequence is amazing the rocket backstory is emotionally charged but wow theres no subversion at all to the point where it just feels insulting his friends get shot because of course they do the villain is just this loud irritating nerd and how do you have all of this amazing licensed music and go for the generic hamfisted orchestral  for the scene in which you bring rocket back 

theres no subtlety no clever twist the rocket backstory couldve been explained in less flashbacks but drags itself out even though we know how it ends it feels like there are endless death fakeouts that  are impossible to take seriously given the overall goofy tone and of course it ends with a huge explosionfest in space that goes on for  ever

i understand a lot of people just want to spend a little more time with these characters and thats fine there are some funny bits and that hallway scene is dope as  but i felt like vol 3 squandered the opportunity to do something new and interesting with these characters it just comes off as trying way too hard to force some tears out of me by cashing in on my attachment to the characters developed in the first two",2023-05-08
kinda weak and unsatisfactory and the tone was all over the place plus it came out way too late the ideal release wouldve been right after endgame,2023-05-08

his character is so  and does things no normal person would do why does he shoot and  a prisoner why does this character get to be the hero at the end by saving peter",2023-05-10
what a boring movie this movie can only be deemed good if you are madly in love with these characters,2023-05-13
"my favourite film in phase 4 by far

an excellent conclusion to the trilogy

each of the main characters had their time to shine

james gunn knocked it out of the park 

910",2023-05-05
"no one reacting on the among us reference i mean not because of the different colored space suits since many movies has those but

they also included at scene with their discarded suits being ejected in airlock and from the window it looks like its from amogus they couldve left that part out and the movie would literally be the same",2023-05-05
"pros action and cgi were good  the one take hallway fight scene was a standout in particular its marvel so the production values will obviously be toptier some of the humor was funny  that f bomb joke got me laughing out loud

cons this film was quite disturbing in a couple of ways namely the the first third of the film taking place in a planet made up of actual flesh and body parts which was and just plain weird also all of flashbacks and references to surgery and torture done on animals ie a bunny with spider legs otter with its arms cut off really grossed me out and was very unpleasant to sit through

overall guardians of the galaxy 3 2023 rating 410 i personally wasnt a fan of the grotesque imagery to be honest",2023-05-07
"random assorted thoughts on this movie

 i think its kind of fascinating the saga of james gunn getting fired then rehired after guardians 2 i feel like he was given the proverbial keys to the disney castle for this film which may have hurt the movie

 the main thing that stuck out to me was how grotesque it was at times from the decapitated groot to the decapitated war pig to the sovereign high evolutionarys mangled face i loved it but i wonder if that wasnt too much for general audiences there was also a scene in that hallway fight where gamora or nebula knifed someone in the knee then they swung off it that was  brutal

 i feel like the editing of the rocket flashback scenes hurt the flow of the first half of the movie maybe that could have been a single 5 to 10 minute scene at the start instead of interrupting the action throughout 

 i get that this franchise has been centered around talking animals from the start but hanging so much of the emotional core of the story around the robot bunny walrus and otter felt like a mistake to me maybe just make them all raccoons for simplicitys sake

 between rockets family the furry planet genocide and the evil furry robots i felt like the movie leaned too much into weird  for my liking

 the extended sequences of children in cages was some very charged imagery in the current political climate that i dont feel like the movie had enough to say about to justify its inclusion

 chukwudi iwuji was so over the top and intense as the high evolutionary i loved it  it cast him to replace jonathan majors as kang

 i wonder if dave bautista had a clause in his contract stipulating that he didnt want to get ripped again for this movie because i dont think drax ever took his shirt off throughout the film

 the bstory arc of kraglin learning how to use the arrow and calling cosmo a good dog was fantastic the arc of adam warlock was still ok but a little less effective 

 i get from a realism standpoint insofar as you can strive for realism in plots about time travel why they wouldnt have gamora fall in love with quill again it still felt narratively unfulfilling though to have her end up with the ravagers again in the end

 also it seemed weird how gamora called to be picked up by the ravagers they never came and she never questioned that in general they seemed to kind of hand wave over gamora just being part of the team again

 some of the cgi felt very grounded to me like the hallway fight while some of it like the planet destruction fell into the ant man 3 pitfall of not setting up sufficient spatial geophagy or stakes

 while i loved the song choices in the movie some of the attempts to make the music diegetic didnt work for me like you understand that quill is playing tracks off his zune in nowhere or when going into battle but why is there music playing in that fight in the organic space station

 overall i loved the movie gunns humor and sensibilities didnt wear on me like taikas did in love and thunder it was a little long with the rocket flashbacks but overall it was an excellent picture and a stratifying end to this trilogy",2023-05-05
i really enjoyed it  it just needed a good trimming some scenes went on way longer than necessary,2023-05-05
i was rolling when cosmo said even the soviets never called her a bad dog despite sending her into space with no planned return,2023-05-05

i enjoyed it escpecially the first half and warlock was the best part and totally underused buti feel like mcu content just doesnt hit like it used to and this movie wasnt what i expected from the finale of a nearly decadelong journey i wanted more boldness more flair more callbackscameos more emotion and more finality,2023-05-05
"i hadn’t realized how badly i needed rocket to say his full title until now absolutely perfect moment i loved that the villain had a personal connection that really drove his hatred i will admit i had doubts rocket would die because he didn’t really get much to do in the movie other than be attacked and be in critical condition up until that point so i figured she would say it isn’t his time yet but i still loved getting his backstory and meeting his old friends 
the first end credit scene reminded me of the original concept art i saw for the guardians of the galaxy when it was announced with the location suits and groot’s design a bit as well really loved groot i feel like it was definitely an improvement from the christmas special where he just looked like a guy in a suit but here especially when he came apart it felt very alien glad to see groot is still a hoot crazy goofball who can  a bunch of aliens when you need it kraglin’s fin also improved since the special where the skin was looking a bit weird speaking of skin and looking weird i can’t believe they were able to show that guy without his face my nephew and i both thought he looked like red skull lol",2023-05-05
got half way through the movie and had to leave right after the rocket reaper flashback wife got sick and i had to jet i just feel so unresolved after such a tragic scene  it i know we can go back and see it again tho wife is comfy in bed now and i’m just sitting here,2023-05-06
there have been very few movies i’ve seen in my life where i walked out of the theater and felt a movie was everything i could have hoped for with no nitpicks this was one of them theater experiences like this are why i love movies i loved every second of it,2023-05-06
this movie was alright i felt like they went way over board with the emotional side of the movie to compensate for the lack luster plotclosure for the guardians of the galaxy series since some of the main cast wouldn’t be returning however the acting from the villain…my …his performance was impeccable,2023-05-06
peter’s  face blowing up stopped my heart,2023-05-06
"maybe i was supposed to feel feelings or maybe im dead inside but i felt through the movie that the writing was trying to do some kind of emotional blackmail on me with the little critter scenes but nah

also there was no meaninful deaths or actual real emotional moments and at no time i believed any main character were in any actual danger

also the movie started out great but at the middle it became somewhat of a mess and i didnt know what we were doing or where we were going until the third act

but overall it was a fun comedic rightpace movie and i supposed it was not to be taken seriously there were scenes were the guardians were acting like morons and honestly it was too much also gamora was too much of a  at times

yet i give it a 7 out of 10 i guess it was the correct right amount of cocaine for james gunn to writedirect and drag me to the movie theater and entertain me

honestly this movie is not gonna save the mcu but it was ok",2023-05-06
peta is definitely going to love this one,2023-05-06
"the legendary starlord will return was such a long journey from someone whose name no one recognized at the start of the first film
  

  
i also like how it came back full circle the first characters to start the trilogy were little quill and his grandpa with peter being kidnapped from earth gathering all the trauma and unresolved issues now peter finally returns home and the second postcredit scene closes the trilogy with two characters who opened it peter with his grandpa finally at peace i think its something worth mentioning",2023-05-06

"the music in this absolutely slapped  and i’m not even talking about the songs john murphy knocked it out of the park with this one like always  great to see him scoring films again after a 10 year hiatus after kick

" after thinking about the movie for a little while after seeing it i liked it but i feel like it was too upsetting for a marvel movie 

i enjoy when these movies are emotional but i’m kind of thinking it was too much here i spent half the movie crying which i wasn’t expecting or necessarily wanting",2023-05-06
i liked this enough while people seem to be loving it these past few years for me marvel movies have been feeling weightless and tired maybe its me the one whos tired but even this one fell quite flat for me,2023-05-06
what a spectacular return to form for the mcu while watching this i never once felt like it was dragging on or that there were a bunch of unnecessary scenes i could tell just how much effort everyone put into making this a successful sendoff to thie guardians im so glad this one turned out as good as it did,2023-05-07
a strong movie that was reminiscent of the phase 13 films  not as good as the russo movies but much better than anything in phase 4  not as good as gog1 but maybe better than gog2  i think the movie has a certain heart that has been lacking in the mcu lately  alot of it is how invested we are in these characters after all these years in terms of critique the humor was off  they tried but alot of the humor felt forced and flat  it was not incredibly gripping and meandered at times  i actually fell asleep for about 15 minutes in the middle of the film  i would say its a 7 out of 10,2023-05-07
"i feel as if the scene where groot says that everyone deserves a second chance when he saves adam is sort of a nod to when marvel studios gave james gunn a second chance

the animal people will forever haunt my dreams forever

gamora ended in a good spot she acknowledged that quill is lovable and she accept some version of her would love him she is still not that version

i gotta say i dont really see the hype for this movie i think metacritic actually got it right for once the adam warlock storyline felt forced since they had to add him since he was in 2 the gamora and peter storyline felt retread they already did that in the first having it end slightly different doesnt really change it the kragglin storyline was just peters talk from the second the only thing that felt new was rockets storyline and drax with mantis,2023-05-10
"1 they made nebula the most competent guardian plus shes a almost a t1000

5 im an animal lover and the abuse there was pretty intense

this movie is basically about right to repair

"l o l is the message all life is sacred animals humans bounty hunters and even the high evolutionary need to be saved 

because they sure did  a lot of victims 

i laughed when adam warlock asked why he was spared because he has every right to ask no one at any other point ever spared anyone prior and even the guy that thought he was being spared got brutally murdered i wanted to shout at the screen because you need to sell more toys 

if youre going to spend the whole movie making me feel bad for high evos experiments why are you going to show them being mindlessly and senselessly slaughtered not even triumphantly you slaughtered them with murderous glee i cant really root for the guardians when their only motive is self preservation

also peter telling gamora her ravager family isnt a real family because theyre just a bunch of criminals peter you imbecile you spent the entire last movie discovering that they were more of a family to you and yondu was your dad also you are a criminal you met in prison like i get peters a  but he also isnt because he understood the pond metaphor 

mantis is also horrifically underused yet again but you cant make a marvel movie with consistent superpowers 

 i also have to be honest i know we give james a pass on the using insert songs but imo it was a little overdone just because you can do it well doesnt mean you have to force it in every 10 minutes 

overall 57 perfect movie",2023-05-05
it was terrible tbh,2023-05-06
"i wanted this movie to be great i really did the first gotg movie was my first mcu movie i saw on the cinema and i became obsessed with the francise since

there isnt anything that makes it stand out from the other mcu movies that was another one directed by mcu accountants this should be a definitive and satisfying end to the guardians story they should all fly away together one last time yet none character get killed giving the opportunity to produce 5 more of average movies

i dont feel characters fates were resolved peter spends the whole duration of the movie trying to impress someone who only resammbles his loved one and they both end up alone in the end they should address that the one he loves died on voromir and he moves on or do falling in love once again drax and mantis had chemistry so it would be nice for them to be together

i wanted rocket to die in a heartbreaking way kind not everyone can be saved but gunn did not have the balls to do it his backstory was touching but also very predictable the movie feels very low stake once you realize no one can die in this

on the positive note i saw the movie in 4dx and some action scenes were intense also the jokes were funny

if you like it than good for you apparently have grown since the first one and expect a well crafted movie  i wont give them the studio more of my money ever again",2023-05-06

this movie is the closest i’ve ever gone to wanting to be a vegetarian lol 

it’s interesting that the latest thor and this movie had children as a central focus of the last act kind of a random thing to be in both films

1 hated that starlord and gamora didnt get back together i was hoping mantis or nebula would somehow give her her future versions memories

2 i get starlord became an alcoholic but he was always cautious heading into battle using his helmet couldve avoided his neardeath experience



from ronan to ego to thanos to the high evolutionary the guardians of the galaxy went out with a bang",2023-05-05
it was rough around the edges but mostly satisfying thought it was too long had tonal issues and the rocket flashbacks were weirdly placed but when it worked it worked,2023-05-05
saw it yesterday afternoon  loved it  didn’t cry as much as i thought i might—did get a little teary at a couple of different scenes though  the soundtrack was killer—ending on dog days  this was really fun  kinda dark  very funny  emotional wellworth the wait i’d say  gonna miss james gunn  company  some things even felt like very nice subversions of expectation  everything felt very wellfitted at the end  i’ve legitimately had a feeling of joy ever since my viewing and i’ve found that rare for anything postendgame  gotg vol 3 feels very classic mcu,2023-05-05
its amazing how gotg went there by showing that face off in all its glorious detail compared to faceoff which was r rated which only showed a few glimpses of the face,2023-05-05
"i adored this movie

the themes of found family resonated so strongly throughout the franchise and this was the perfect conclusion i know there will be more movies but this was endgame for the gotg as we know them

no complaints",2023-05-05
kaiju groot was so funny and i loved that he was real by the mid credits,2023-05-05
the trick aspect ratio was a new thing for me the movie changed several times and i only noticed when a character popped in front of the black bars,2023-05-05
high evolutionary’s aim was to create the ultimate utopia even though he kept failing proving that perfection is an unachievable goal a fitting antithesis to the guardians who are a family of misfits and rejects and all about accepting your own quirks and foibles and weirdness also heartwarming for them to rescue all the rejects at the end and give them a new life in their own new society,2023-05-05
loved it so much also surprised that this passed as a pg13 rating with how gory it was if the bloods were red this film couldve been an easy rrating,2023-05-05
gotg 13 is the best marvel trilogy fight me,2023-05-05
was it good i wasnt too keen of the last two films was this one better or worse than those,2023-05-05
looking fwd to some proper cosmo action in vol4…,2023-05-05
did anyone notice when the photos were rolling during the credits there were two people in a photo and one standing behind them with his face covered with tape,2023-05-05
for me personally this was the best marvel movie since endgame rockets story was very well done the comedy was actually good and the action was great i hope that adam warlock will show up again as he was underutilized in this movie,2023-05-05
loved peter quills trashtalk to high evolutionary,2023-05-05
i cant get the image of floors real dead limbs dangling from her body as her metal arms are in control,2023-05-05
i didnt expect this when i went into it but this ended up being my favorite marvel movie,2023-05-05
that fleshy planet was so unsettling the slime controls goo everywhere blech,2023-05-05
"one of the finest movies in the mcu and shows the growth gunn has had as a director since gotg vol 1

 beautiful and emotionally driven with an amazing dreamlike fantasy atmosphere it honestly breaks my heart well never see him do anything for marvel again because what he showed here makes me feel hed have made the cosmic mcu something really special

very great film and i cant wait to see it again",2023-05-05
there is a quick shot of pacman and the 4 ghosts and im pretty sure those same 5 colours are the space suits,2023-05-05
"this movie had me laughing crying and 100 full filled maby the best trilogy on the mcu 

 i’m really going to miss this group",2023-05-05
this by the best marvel movie ever made no marvel movie h a dark story time to it like this  its always stop the badsave the galaxyplanet from destruction but this was something new since the evolutionary wasnt bent on destroying all life or genocide like thanosegoronan etc but he was still a villain because of all the torture and pain and genocide he committed just because things werent the way he wanted,2023-05-05
gunn just loves to use animals at my emotional expense ,2023-05-05
"easily the best mcu since spiderman and it might be even better than that imo 

sucks it came out during the superhero fatigue that everyone including myself is experiencing right now because this was a wonderful conclusion to a great trilogy",2023-05-05
"i loved it one of the better mcu films post endgame rocket racoon’s backstory had me teary eyed 

this trilogy consistently delivered good films

it sucks this will be probably the last time we see them together",2023-05-05
"best marvel movie in years really did a stellar job balancing the comedy and stakes all the serious moments had time to breathe and most of the jokes landed pretty well none of the guardians dying was an actually clever way of subverting expectations and leaning into draxs past as a father was a good direction to take his character postthanos 

high evolutionary rocked and definitely added a ton to a movie even with his limited screen time loved using a 2000s song at the end hope this ends up making money and marvel is encouraged to keep making stuff like this going forward",2023-05-06
can we talk about nico santos just getting plowed into the earth and then left in water  was a very brutal ,2023-05-06
i preferred rockets background story vs the main storyline  this was the best marvel movie since infinity warendgame,2023-05-06
"1010 cried in the cinema marvel’s best product since endgame had low expectations and they were completely blown away by this james gunn masterclass emotional great action scenes and a banger soundtrack perfect way to end this story

the final act was just perfection was worried someone would die but they didn’t even have to  anyone off to make it a poignant sendoff",2023-05-06
"i really liked that it seemed like high evolutionary inadvertently caused rockets advance development through love it felt like through the first scenes we see of him and rocket he is putting on a  of a façade of actually caring about rocket and genuinely inspiring him to think of greater things that with his friends is what makes him special 

and i think adam is kind of similar in that hes very childlike and needs to be steered from his destructive destiny towards something great drax too literally gets to move on from being the destroyer to being a dad to all the space kids

the arcs of the characters just left me in a very hopeful mood it was very pleasant",2023-05-06
i nearly lost it at “ open the  door “ lmaooo,2023-05-06
amazing but holy  has adopting a toddler ruined me for dad  in movies when nebula told drax he wasnt born to be a destroyer but a dad with all those little toddlers around i lost it  there was way more emotions in this movie than i was ready for,2023-05-06
does anyone know who voiced that beaked chatterer bird creature he only had a few lines but i swear it’s a voice from transformers,2023-05-06
high evolutionary incinerator yule log coming soon on disney,2023-05-06
if taken together as its own entity the guardians of the galaxy is one of the best film trilogies,2023-05-06
yeah idk about this one was it the best marvel movie in a long time yes glad it ditched all the multiverse stuff not what i was looking for though guardians of the galaxy has always been a feelgood pleasure for me this movie was far too sadheavy vs the rest of them was not prepared for that,2023-05-06
i cried like 4 or 5 times during this,2023-05-06
james gunn is the man had the whole theater bawling their eyes out with both sadness and joy,2023-05-06
what a  depressing movie,2023-05-06
chukwudi iwuji would’ve been a great khan,2023-05-06
"felt like i was watching a phase 3 movie and trust me thats a huge compliment the mcu may not be as good as it once was but this movie reminded me so much why i fell in love with it in the first place


just wish it had a little less animal abuseit hurts",2023-05-06
"this was probably the best mcu movie post endgame i’m usually a hater but this left me very content 

the humor was at a minimum and worked well unlike thor and spider man was just a nostalgia fest with a  story",2023-05-06
"that was really good 

such a breath of refreshing air in the marvel world hallway scene might be one of my favorite things of all time in all the films",2023-05-06
that was a good sendoff for the team high evolutionary was a great villain too he wasnt like a galactic scale threat nor was he even planning on like taking over the universe or some  he was just a really really really messed up  who did sick experiments on innocent lifeforms,2023-05-06
i saw it yesterday i loved it it was very emotional and the first movie to make me tear up at all it might be my favorite out of all 3 right now,2023-05-06
just got home from movie super teary eyed favorite marvel movie since shang chi,2023-05-06
they really pushed this as close to an r rating as possible i’m was surprised at how violent it was at times,2023-05-06
"did anyone else’s theater have 40 minutes of trailers

anyway great movie best mcu project we’ve had in a long time this gets me excited for the work james is doing in dc",2023-05-06
" all logic plot all that filmy stuff im just happy rocket is alive and well lots of love to cosmo the goodest dog
much needed happiness at the end after some very dark moments in the movie

i was truly disturbed by animal mutilation and experimentation its even more disturbing that this happened and still happens in the real world albeit in a slightly different form i just hope more people learn to empathize with animals and their sufferings",2023-05-06
 it this movie was made for sentimental saps like me why am i feeling so emotional over a film from marvel studios the best thing theyve put out in a long time,2023-05-06
"im so glad that i was able to avoid watching trailers or read anything related to this movie prior to watching this movie last night i was really not expecting to go through a rollercoaster of emotions 

i loved the soundtrack too i feel the songs that were picked for the movie were some very good choices

also you cant tell me after all of that cosmos is a bad dog cosmos is a good dog that deserves all the treats and belly rubs",2023-05-06
bondrewd couldn’t make it to the 7th layer so he went to space,2023-05-06
"that villain could be among the best of mcu if he was like gus  just calm and collected
  

  
all things he did could be all the same just he looked like a  yelling all the time",2023-05-06
in 10 years gunn will return for another guardians film there is too much money to be made,2023-05-06
"the only franchise that can make a happy space adventure trilogy make me get the feels about a cgi racoon 

what james gunn does best is characters anyone showing up for mere five minutes seamlessly integrates into the rest mantis is the best example she could have been a throwaway side character but after one and a half movies feels like she always was part of this 

everyone has a bit of an arc everyone gets a bit of a resolution and that in a space adventure setting that could feel goofy and without stakes pretty great character writing

though i would say in comparison to the other two because of the pretty dark back story it was a tad more unsteady tonally than either of the two previous ones",2023-05-06
i want lylla teefs and floor back please,2023-05-06
can we talk about how they didn’t even try rescuing anyone from the blowing up animal planet,2023-05-06
loved this movie from start to finish i was crying like a baby and dying of laughter and at the end i had a happy smile on my face as a tear was coming down my cheek it was a amazing film i loved it so many characters getting to come full circle and  more subtle references and finally we the audience understanding groot was just simply why i love these filmsi cant wait to see what happens and thank you so much james and everyone who made this franchise possible,2023-05-06
"‘this was your story all along’

the sheer gross aspect of this movie was insanely interesting coupled with the heart wrenching moments was something i didn’t expect from any movie let alone within the mcu the skin planet and then hearing a young rocket say ‘hurts’ the range there…wow 

props to james gunn and completing a great trilogy even amidst the struggles of the mcu lately i really enjoyed how this movie stood on its own and completed the story of rocket as well as the guardians rather than and granted sprinkled in there but not relying on other movies or characters rocket works as a perfect allegory for james gunn that it made this story all the more sad the ending with rocket taking over felt interesting considering his dc position thank you for the movies and the great trilogy 

there was something insanely heartbreaking about torturing of not only animals but then upgrading to children that made the high evolutionary so evil somehow more than a guy who butchers gods

we got a face off joke but no jokes about the guards being bebop and rock steady 

tell your dogs they are good",2023-05-06
"never cried so much in a mcu movie animals  get me man 

rocket just needs to look slightly sad and there come the waterworks

great movie i loved how every character got their time to shine and their little arc thats definitely not easy with so many loved every second of it even though i was sobbing at least 4 times",2023-05-06
im a sucker for hallway fight scenes and this one was a 1010,2023-05-06
there is no  that is why i stepped up one for the ages,2023-05-06
"i love that in the opening sequence theyre all separated and get their  handed to it all comes full circle in the superb no sleep till brooklyn fight scene in the hallway where they all work as a team so many great moments of comedy and heart also the darkest mcu film no doubt james gunn delving into his horror roots

i gave it a 910 when i saw it on monday i cant wait to see it again im waiting for my friends but really excited for round 2",2023-05-06
i love how the last 34 main villains just “died by getting crushed or blown up” and we never actually see their bodies  kang scarlett and he are all obv still alive,2023-05-06
"it was really good as is to be expected  definitely a lot more james gunn than the previous ones  not a fan of gore and body horror but glad this had some restraint there being a disney film and all  i was surprised we didnt get a john cena cameo given all the other james gunn crossovers

this was probably by far the most emotional of all mcu films  say what you will about tonys death but hes got nothing on rocket racoon  

the only thing id say comes off as a weakness and personally i dont care is adam warlock  im not a comic fan so it doesnt bother me but i feel like a lot of comic fans could be upset by his portrayal particularly because it was teased so early in the franchise and what we got was essentially a baby superman who was barely a villain at all more of an occasional nonsequitir nuisance   since i had no expectations it doesnt bother me but i could see some people hyping him up to be a big bad villain and theyd be pretty bummed by what we got

loved the humor too even though a lot of the dramatic beats probably will overshadow it  the movie had some great jokes  definitely a favorite for me was draxs monkey noises",2023-05-06
"tbh i didnt think theyd actually let chris pratt drop the fbomb in an mcu movie

but still it was hilarious",2023-05-06
when the high evolutionary had rocket pinned to the wall using his powers how did rocket break free  seems like he reached down and pushed a button or something but i totally missed exactly what happened there,2023-05-06
young rocket asking questions is exactly how my 3 years old talks gunn punched me in the gut with this one my son had cpr on him when he was born watching rocket on the table gave me ptsd,2023-05-06
yondu cameo ,2023-05-06
but is high revolutionary really dead  ,2023-05-06
canon wise is groot able to die  i know in gotg 1 he did but then he just grew back,2023-05-06
"nebula definitely had the best character development  

also at one point i thought they were gonna  her off and at another point i thought they were gonna put her and peter together",2023-05-06
did anyone else at the end think that starlords grandpa was kevin feige,2023-05-06
"one of the best marvel movies imo and the most consistent ip from them too

this got me strangely very optimistic for dc",2023-05-06
i really enjoyed this movie but i don’t think i could rewatch it anytime soon the sense of dread it gave me every time it was a flashback scene was so incredibly intense this was a real  bummer of a film but it was so good,2023-05-06
"james gunn knocked it out of the park

beautiful emotional and hilarious a perfect balance of humor and emotional moments even all of the cgi looked  great unlike other marvel productions

that scene in the sky with all of them  ",2023-05-06
this movie made me realize that i have yet to recover from my kevin smith induced fear of walruses,2023-05-06
"james gunn almost perfected toeing the line between drama and comedy a lot of marvel movies including vol 2 undercut dramatic moments with a throwaway joke

james kinda started the quippy marvel movie trend that lasted for almost a decade hopefully this one does the same and teaches future marvel directors that they can be dramatic and funny without sacrificing either",2023-05-07
"bawled at this movie a few things

one i am so glad that gamora did change post thanos and found a new family in ravagers 
     a i’m glad to see the other sorcerer supreme but would have found it hilarious if michelle yeoh’s ravager just randomly showed up

two i loved one guy getting credited as “guy gamora shot” that cracked me the 

three interesting that girl at the end in the guardians is phyla at least that’s what she was credited as i will be interested if she andor adam show up in the marvels 

four nebula has grown so much i’m such a proud momma vibe with her 

five mantis going on her own with the beasts makes me so happy for her i hope she somehow comes back but if that’s her send off i loved it

six the story of drax i know this was rocket’s trilogy something stated by both gunn and the movie but his journey made me tear up too he got his family back and didn’t have to destroy anyone well any good guys

seven groot slowly getting gamora to understand him so pivotal to her story in this and he spoke something other than “i am groot”

finally i’m starting a class action lawsuit to gunn for giving me way too many bawling moments with animals getting hurt not ok dude not ok

post script lila being mcu canon made me happy i am so glad the he got to see her one last time and she let him know that she will always be waiting ",2023-05-07
"i totally thought quill was going to die and that he and nebula might end up together
all said and done though i liked the storyline they gave him",2023-05-07
the first movie to ever make me hold my tears wow,2023-05-07
i cried so much rocket teefs floor and lila have my heart forever ,2023-05-07
"just got out of the theatre 

everything has pretty much been said 

yondu tribute was a nice touch",2023-05-07
this was more horror than doctor strange 2 i loved it,2023-05-07
also  mateo  his death was dope tho,2023-05-07
the joke about the bosses nephew was that a jab at the one actor being related to james gunn,2023-05-07
i enjoyed it,2023-05-07
"drax said he doesnt support dancingthen dances 

got some nathan fillion in therealso molly quinn as one of the hench people

the music choices are obvious there i said it that beastie boys song is in everything 

nebula has grown as a person shes the mvp of the marvel universe",2023-05-07
"“i’ll  whatever this thing is”

“don’t be rash”",2023-05-07
"who else noticed the creation of adam reference when quill was about to die in space and adam saved him

i loved it",2023-05-07
starlord really is like kevin bacon taught a whole society how to dance bravo,2023-05-07
not quite as good as the first imo but certainly one of favs this year and the best marvel film for a long while,2023-05-07
that line from dog days are over happiness hit her like a bullet in the back just hits different after the batch 89 escape attempt ,2023-05-07
one thing not mentioned here was that the he telekinetic powers could crush adam warlock into the walls but was negated by rockets gravity boots,2023-05-07
i  cried the whole movie and i’m better for it  what a beautiful and heart wrenching movie,2023-05-07
what happen to groot,2023-05-07
chukwudi iwuji is so convincing that people actually believe he behaves like the high evolutionary in real life,2023-05-07
i watched it yesterday and it entertained me greatly the whole theatre i was in laughed multiple times,2023-05-07
james gunn is good at superhero movies literally every superhero film he’s madetouched is a banger,2023-05-07
i had fears for cosmo,2023-05-07
great movie very brutal with sad moments but also a fun movie overall i would say this is my favorite guardians movie,2023-05-07
what was the second post credit scene about imm not so sure about it,2023-05-07
" the high evolutionary all my homies hate him 

i have hated very few villains as much as i hated this ",2023-05-07
i love this wow probably my favorite mcu film since endgame love the music choices too for the most part and wasnt expecting some of them,2023-05-08
a great post conclusion to some loose ends in the mcu wish there were more mcu films like these,2023-05-08
loved the movie but the flashback scenes with rocket make me never want to watch this movie again,2023-05-08
i just watched it today and i can’t even think about rocket without wanting to sob i’ve always joked that every time they make a guardians movie they’re thinking “we’re gonna make these people cry so freakin hard” but this one really got to me with all the animal abuse like when rocket saw the baby raccoons and refused to let any of the animals be left behind i just lost it,2023-05-08
such an emotional movie and it leaves me with such an uncomfortable feeling thinking about floor teef and lyla and what they were subjected to too the most glaring thing in this movie for me would be that it seems james gunn completely ignored the vacuum of space like when the hellspawn crack open knowhere or adam crashes through the cockpit of the ship peter and gamora are on,2023-05-08
pretty sure i just gave my kids the same trauma the secret of nimh gave me  the cycle continues,2023-05-08
what was the deal with those children were the a more advanced version of the animal people or were they humans that had been experimented on,2023-05-08
i really hope we get a movie with the new team they seem like they would be fun adam warlock is awesome,2023-05-08
"i knew from that first scene that rockets animal friends were going to die and i spent the rest of the movie bracing for my inevitable tears

why did it have to be an otter ",2023-05-08
first time i legit cried in an mcu movie,2023-05-08
"wow surprised how much this one rocked personally had 0 hype or expectations 

such a great time with all the characters amazing villain awesome imax shots for such a heavy and divergent tone everything came together so well and had a really satisfying ending 

now open the  door",2023-05-08
man that scene where rocket gets pulled out of the afterlife gave me some kakashi flashbacks,2023-05-08
"i really enjoyed it all of rockets flashbacks were thoroughly engrossing i got some real secret of nimh vibes 

i thought the plot became a little too unwieldy after rocket finally woke up the whole part where mantis drax and nebula get trapped on the ship just felt like a way to postpone the ending more adam warlock was underutilized and wasnt really given much to do i have to wonder how this movie might have looked without the james gunn firing  rehiringinfinity warendgame disrupting gunns writing seemed like he had a lot of loose ends to fit together but despite that he did a fine job certainly many of the best action scenes from the series can be found here 

where was the fbomb i never noticed it but ive since heard it was the first fbomb in a marvel movie",2023-05-08
i honestly thought the last two movies were good and this one was no different full of laughs emotion and action third best marvel collection of movies to date behind avengers and captain america,2023-05-08
to think we almost didn’t get this movie because of a few jokes i’m glad disney came to their senses,2023-05-08
loved the creation of adam shot and what i think was a reference to 2001 a space odyssey one of the best marvel movies in a while,2023-05-08
"this movie being a sendoff for the gotg had me going in expecting someone to die i know bautista hates all the makeup and wanted out every time drax got injured i held my breath in shock then was surprised when he stood up im glad none of the guardians died in this movie it was a great ending for each of them 

im surprised after the movie when it said that starlord would return i thought chris pratt would retire from marvel too like rdj and chris evans",2023-05-08
"loved how they tickled the whole drax is gonna die rumour thats been circling

well played marvel",2023-05-08
is it just me or is that rocket near death experience very similar to deadpool 2  i wonder if deadpool 3 is going to bring that up,2023-05-09
"i love how mantis stood up for herself and wanted to find a path for her the animal cruelty hit so hard omfg it was killing me glad that  got what he deserved i love how everyone was trying to grow and be something better nebula wanted to give others what they couldn’t have before i just enjoyed the themes of loving yourself family always and forever and not doing what is easy but what is right cried my eyes out and it was just brilliant imo 
ps i liked warlock but i feel they didn’t really give him a lot of context or backstory just that he had to capture rocket then sadly his mom died he saves peter and boom joins the team i would’ve liked a bit more from his character",2023-05-09
adam warlock was hilarious lol,2023-05-10
"pretty good movie a little long could be trimmed down a little the effects were phenomenal and theres just so much creativity in costumes and alien designs 

good to see marvel in top remember made me remember why i feel in love with them in the first place",2023-05-11
the movie was amazing mad feels all the way through,2023-05-11
loved the movie i can also report that its being review bombed mildly with word for word reviews with generic named accounts rating it 0310 i dunno why all i can think is that some weird snyderverse fans are mad that dc is doing a reboot so they sre  on the james gunn movie,2023-05-11
"i really liked that its the 2nd guardians film to dodge the typical marvel formula of the villain being just a bigger badder version of the hero

they slipped back into that with 2 but 1 and now 3 have unique villains disconnected from the heroes with their own motivations

a real rarity for marvel good to see it",2023-05-12
yall know what is the song when adam was introduced,2023-05-14
loved the nod to the christmas special in the paper granddad was reading,2023-05-14
"was that ratcatcher from the suicide squad

anyway this movie was just beautiful emotional hilarious such a strong closing to this trilogy

dc is in good hands",2023-05-14
compared to gamora and drax with all their heavy makeup definitely but that scream he laid out when lila was shot and floor was having a panic attack screeching rocket teef floor go now while rocket is screaming in a way we have never heard before and the villain mocks him as well that was an emotionally charged scene i would say he worked hard for it,2023-05-15
loved it,2023-05-15
i saw this dubbed and there were so many hard swear words basically the equivalent of saying  or  several times did not expect that plus there was so much cruelty in this movie i really see this as a 15 flick,2023-05-15
"we care a lot 

epic no pun intended faith no more song that no one remembers because its before mike patton joined the band 

thank you james gunn",2023-05-15
everything in this thread that has been shared is amazing great points and great scenes we can all share our heartbreak experiences with i would like to mention the actorsactresses screams in this movie mantis when she sees quill floating in space fearing her brother has died right in front of her quill screaming when rocket flatlinesthey were chilling screams i dont think i can rewatch this one for a whileit really tugs on the heartstrings,2023-05-16
flashbacks are like grimm fairy tales,2023-05-16
seeing rocket in the suit and finally calling himself rocket raccoon was satisfying as  holy  on par with avengers assemble,2023-05-16
"this is so good james gunn just understands the superhero movie so well and what he has done with the guardians is remarkable a great mix of comedy and heart and action and it’s incredible

i’m interested to see where it goes from here without gunn and with a new crew of guardians but i hope for the best as i genuinely love this trilogy with my whole heart",2023-05-17
anyone think the same rockets friends should have normal form before getting scarysurgery in the heaven scene like we should able to see floors real face etc thatd be much better,2023-05-18
how tiedin is this movie to the most recent marvel movies the last one i watched was no way home,2023-05-18
i made it through the whole film without crying the first one had me crying in the opening scene but playing dog days are over broke me that was the song i walked down the isle to and is such a strong expression of hope and positivity to us,2023-05-20
i loved this movie great send off to the characters and the best marvel movie i’ve seen in a while but i’m not sure if i can sit through the scenes with the animals again that  was traumatic just thinking about that poor bunny is upsetting,2023-05-20
wheres the  movies,2023-05-21
"i set myself up before even going to see this movie under the expectation that either rocket or drax were going to die given they had been through the most painful experiences as soon as the movie started with the music following rocket it set the tone unbelievably well and i totally believed rocket was going to die then when he immediately got attacked and was bleeding everywhere i was sort of put into a state of shock that he was dying so soon i can’t actually believe how many moments there were when i expected someone to die rocket at the start drax when he was shot badly in the orgoscope rocket again when he actually died mantis when she confronted the basilisk i guess this one was least likely peter at the end and  i even thought nebula might die when she decided to drive the he’s ship to help everyone off 

after reading some of these comments it’s reminded me of so much that happened in it and i think i need to see it again to fully appreciate the absolute rollercoaster this films takes us through it is actually a masterpiece with subtle tones of strong relationships between different and perhaps unexpected pairs of characters a 100 evil villain a redemption story for warlock and closure for every character which actually makes sense only thing i’m not totally convinced on is why nebula stuck with the children although i suppose throughout the mcu she has done a complete 180 in terms of how she behaves going from being full of hatred in gotg1 to wanting to take care of kids by the end of gotg3",2023-05-21
overlong and repetitive and too much of everything it still nails it’s emotional beats and worth watching probably my favorite villain from any marvel because i truly wanted him dead for what he’s done,2023-05-21

"i’ve been burnt out from the marvel films but came to this one when friends asked i did like it and i don’t really have anything like negative to really say although i wish there was just one more film left with the entire cast but i guess since gunn is focusing on other projects they also want to hang up the coat and i can’t fault them for it

either way i liked it my friends like it",2023-05-24
"im so late but i showed up high to the theater and sobered up very quickly in the beginning like peter i didnt watch any trailers but was curious why parents were so upset i more so understand the parents now it definitely is its rating but holy  that beginning had me half covering my eyes what a great movie

edit though i doubt people will see this did anyone else think gamora was going to die i did but mainly thought about it when the little furry pet got attached to her and before we knew adam wasnt dead i thought that each character the animal got attached to died and was like ahh ",2023-05-27
best marvel movie since endgame for sure,2023-05-27
best marvel movie in some time,2023-05-28
could someone give something to read on the topic of longshots namely how they plan and and maybe execute scenes like the one where the guardians fight the monsters and minions together when drax opens the doors and there is a wave of enemies coming there is a lot of choreographed movement on the screen as a starting writer i am just wondering how this is planned ahead in time what will be on the screen on every given second and what goes to the front what to the background etc,2023-05-29
"when rockets friends were all naming themselves and the spider rabbit named itself floor and they are repeated it like was the best thing they ever heard that had me dying of laughter

might be the last super entertaining marvel movie for awhile i fear mcu is going to run outta juice after this one the eternals did not really hit very well shangchi didnt seem to receive any followup though it was a good movie apart from another dr strange movie i dont know what else is going to entice the fans,2023-06-01
i did not like guardians of the galaxy vol 3  and i loved the previous 2 gunn strayed off brand interrupted the world hed created with horror elements that did not mix with the gog cannon at all it was like a  up commercial that distracts you from the main plot sure i like a good back story like anyone as far as how rocket became rocket  however the direction they took it was super messed up and ruined the movie i loved the comedic moments the bad dog jokes were hilarious and drax you think im  and many more chukwudi iwuji did an amazing job as the super villain adam warlock  0 backstory i would have hoped at least a freakin 30 sec clip explained who he was in more detail the world he came from how he has powers etc the post credits scene was pretty lame as well but above all walking out of the theater last night i just felt unsettled and annoyed by the metal arms and spider bodies of the  up experimented animals  the minions that worked for the high evolutionary it destroyed what was enjoyable about the movie and took it away from being good for kids to watch that campy good natured vibe  that is missing from so much of cinema in a sincere way not the fake disney movie way  with 80s nostalgia really set guardians to a new level and why they became a fav now the intrusive horror vibe made it distasteful copy and pasted in and made it hard to fully enjoy any of the pieces that did work well for the film i didnt go to see black mirror very disappointed hopefully in the next film gunn can recover from this misstep,2023-06-03

what an amazing film probably my favorite non avengers mcu film,2023-06-13
"idk if its mcu fatigue or the fact that the rest of the mcu has drifted towards the style of the guardians movies but this did very little for me

rockets backstory was interesting but also felt drawn out drax and mantis had some good lines but no one else did overall i was pretty bored the villains and the action felt generic actors performances were dull it felt like everyone involved in the production was just going through the motions

honestly think i had more fun laughing at antman 3 that was so incredibly bad it ended up being a pretty funny evening this was just meh",2023-06-14
"so i havent seen anyone mention the music

1 i didnt know some of the songs chosen so i dont think this soundtrack is as good as the previous efforts

2 it was too invasive i feel like peter wouldnt have music blaring while hes on a job with his friends bc he needs to be able to communicate with them it was just too obvious that they were trying to keep up the we have the best soundtracks in the mcu game psst take a listen to captain marvels 90s soundtrack sometime its fantastic",2023-06-17
"im pleasantly surprised by how much i enjoyed it i was pretty apprehensive about it after thor and antman ended up being duds which was extra disappointing since i enjoyed ragnarok and the previous 2 antman films thank goodness guardians actually turned out to be pretty good the balance between the comedy and serious moments were well handled unlike some of the other entries in the mcu i like that star lord gets to be cool again after having been relegated to less flattering showing in previous mcu appearances

i was indifferent but now im looking forward to how gunn will handle dcu",2023-06-25
best mcu film ive seen in quite awhile super hero fatigue is real but this hit the spot probably in my top tier of mcu movies,2023-07-08
"just watched and i really enjoyed it

i do feel there is a bit too much comedy but the horror in this film evened it out in the end

it was so  sad rockets backstory felt like i was watching a liveaction anime i dont think i could watch it again because it was a lot to take in personally way future

i have no idea the direction the mcu is going in its difficult to create newfresh dilemmas constantly the story and dialogue has to be a1 with repeating events

i know for a fact they knew to use we are family i dont know why they didnt the pop culture statement would have made it unforgettable",2023-07-08
great movie except a few things will poulter was a weird casting the marvel comedy isnt working anymore it needs evolve,2023-07-08
but no really draxs analogy was actually really good,2023-07-09
now thats family even without having to say it the emotions ,2023-07-17
"who else thought this movie was giving money heist vibes 

absolutely loved every second of it even when i was bawling my eyes out during the animals failed escape  it was painfully  beautifully depicted to tug at my heartstrings still kinda  up over it but overall this gotg volume was epic",2023-07-24
i did not like the new groot should have kept the old look,2023-07-30
i love guardians of the galaxy all of them are good this was i liked but idk i can’t handle animal abuse so it was hard to watch in the beginning i cried a little bit,2023-08-03
"i finally caught it last night on disney i had seen all this hype or whatever you call retroactive hype praise i guess for the high evolutionary as an all time great mcu villain and i just wasn’t feeling that he was obviously despicable to the extreme in ways that only the completely dead inside can’t emotionally engage with but beyond the animal abuse i found him very one note he just yelled and screamed and preened whatever 

having said that this is easily my favorite of the guardians flicks everything else besides the villain worked so well for me it was both the funniest and most brutal of the series and i really appreciated the finesse it took to pull that off the soundtrack was great the character growth and development were excellent and i overall just had a great time a great sendoff for the guardians i think the most affecting moment for me was seeing gamora back with the ravagers i immediately realized that she was with her chosen family who were not the guardians and i thought that was a beautiful and subversive thing to show 

good stuff more like this please marvel studios",2023-08-03
fun fact cosmo is lyka the dog search it on google,2023-08-05
the animal cruelty and animal d3aths made me really not like this movie,2023-08-05
i just watched this with my wife on disney and i loved it so much and yetthe suffering and death of the animals was so painful for me that im not sure if i want to watch it again any time soon james gunn gave us a masterful conclusion to the story of the guardians for the foreseeable future and i feel like anyone trying to use these characters in the future is going to have a lot of work cut out for them,2023-08-05
loved gotg vol 1 and 2 was enjoyable but this really didnt do it for me it felt like 2 and a half hours of animal torture bad jokes poor fight scenes and constant exposition gutted i dont think i enjoyed a single moment of it,2023-08-05

the use of didos lament was epic,2023-08-13
pretty uneven  i didnt care for the first half but the second recovered by the end  felt like the script needed another few drafts  some of the joke sequences seemed awkward and forced  really enjoyed particular scenes though,2023-08-13
this movie is great so far but whats up with nebula and gamoras makeup and whats with nebulas voice why is she screaming every line and why does she sound kinda like cookie monster karen gillan is usually a great actress bur she just seems off in this movie,2023-08-18
"guardians of the galaxy 3 hit me hard because i grew up with the trilogy i was 11 when gotg 1 vale out 2014 now i am 20 and the ending was like a closure for my childhood every time a gotg was released i was going through though stages of my life this movie not only ended a trilogy but a era of my life i think this may will be my last marvel movie i watch 

it also made me feel hope again for the future 

farewell guardians we had a good time…",2023-09-04
"i guess everyone has nothing but positives to say about this movie but i found the ending really unsatisfying the whole point of the movie felt like it was about friendship and the new family all these ragtag individuals had created peter spends the whole movie desperate to save rocket then no emotional conversation between the two of them after they save him and it’s see ya i’m heading back to earth and done with the guardians of the galaxy it just felt so sudden and for all the happy emotions they made between all these characters they didn’t do a great job with peter and rocket at the end they should have had peter saying to rocket that  always be his best friend or something at least to show that he’s not leaving to hurt his friend or they’ll always be friends or something
also gamora’s character is inconsistent with even old gamora sure she didn’t have the same events happen for her to fall in love with peter i get that but in guardians 1 before she loved him she was the one who was trying to stop the kree from killing an entire planet now she doesn’t care about anyone it just didn’t feel at all consistent with her old character even",2023-09-05
it was good but way overhyped  id say its solid middletier among the marvel movies  i enjoyed it but it doesnt approach the top tier marvel movies,2023-09-12
why does tnt never air the first guardians of galaxy movie,2023-09-23
eyes were so puffy at the end i cried so hard throughout i feel so much for animals and having rocket and his friends go through that and then lose said friends  i was bawling he’s so strong,2024-02-25

hope he gets better editors in dc studios",2023-05-05
"i dont know how to rate this movie

on one hand the rocket and petergamora storylines are great on the other hand the movie is full of lazy writing and forced conclusions to characters arcs

its like they realised everyone needed a conclusion to their arc so they just tacked on a bunch of weaker material to the main storyline eg

drax needed a reason to become a dad again oh look at that he finds a bunch of caged children in the final act to save

adam warlock needed to be good by the end of the movie oh look he randomly faints when confronting the guardians at the end and they save him just in time for him to have a change of heart and save peter when hes stuck in space

mantis needs to stand up for herself oh look heres a scene where nebula is being mena to drax now mantis can show she has a spine

none of these were bad ideas it just seemed forced like they were working their way through a checklist when filming this movie and couldnt think of a better way to weave these storyline with the a plot",2023-05-08
just watched it on d this was not a good movie it was the weakest of the 3 by a wide margin very weak script scenes were all over the place serious pacing issues went 30 mins too long forced and unfunny jokes onenote characters across the board except for rocket i was particularly offended by the sappy overwrought pretentious shallow emphasis on giving the tortured animals cliched lines like “it’s nice to have friends” or their plans for the future before obviously killing them for purely manipulative emotional effect it’s like what a 12 year old would put together to try to make other little kids cry it was childish and unearned what an immature movie and that script definitely needed another few turns all of the humor involved characters shouting at each other no differentiation in tone or delivery or personality all the lines could have been said by the same person finally the music was also forced and awkward and would just drag on and on without fitting the tone of the scene just not a good film,2023-08-06
well  that was miles better than vol 2 in about every way the darker themes and moments were handled perfectly dont understand the tonal complaints from the critics rockets backstory and performance were heartbreaking as  teared up at a lot of those scenes with him in the cage and when he screamed when lila died,2023-05-05

just been thinking about the woman who let the guardians into her house when they first landed on counterearth from her point of view a bunch of rude violent aliens came and landed demanded access to their benevolent leader and then destroyed the whole planet she was the only one who dared help the guardians and her last thought before being incinerated was probably the fact that as far as she knew she’d caused it all herself,2023-05-05
why is no one talking about the real highlight of the film that being howard the duck ofc seeing him was truly the highlight of the film and brought a tear to my eye,2023-05-05
am i the only one who hates how over the top campy mantis is now everything is over the top like a cartoon everything she wasn’t like that before the christmas special but ever since that she’s like a kids toy in motion she was cringe in many scenes to me,2023-05-06
"surprisingly i think people are underselling this a little because of recent marvel projects 

this is a really really really good movie super tight script where there isn’t really much  and it’s also hitting all of the emotional beats incredible pacing no wasted moments and the flashbacks for rocket are well spaced dialogue is very funny for my sense of humor anyway excellent use of marvels first “” not enough can be said about where all these characters end up i don’t think any of these characters have an unsatisfying or inappropriate ending i think it’s absolutely worth touching on how effective the flashbacks in this movie are the villain barely interacts with the main cast and you still feel his presence despite that 

if i had to pick one criticism  will poulter is under utilized his fight scene to start the movie was incredibly dynamic and one of the best offerings from marvel plus he was very funny looking forward to more adam warlock",2023-05-06
"yo this was good i kept thinking if thor love  thunder was made like this it wouldve been epic

i especially loved the fight scene with all the guardians they also werent afraid to be a bit more graphic than the typical marvel movie eg nebula being disfigured beheaded pig etc

i had started to have low expectations for marvel movies lately but this was a nice breathe of fresh air",2023-05-10
unpopular opinion but i didnt like it it felt like this whole thing went out on a whimper and not a bang and also it felt a bit like the whole series was just a shaggy dog story,2023-05-15

james gunn style direction  nostalgic 90s music  floating through space or dramatic nonsensical action montage rinse and repeat until the movie just sort of ends overall good film that is driven by the characters weve invested in all this time,2023-05-10
not a single thing in this movie hit for me they were clearly trying to make me care about multiple things and none of it landed they felt more disconnected as a group than they did in the first movie and even if they were trying to levy that into the idea that it was time they parted ways it didnt feel earned i just didnt care about any of the characters anymore and too many random pointless cameos that just takes away from the escapism,2023-05-08

did anyone catch the reference to “the creation of adam” when warlock reached out to save peter,2023-05-05
i think i might just not like marvel movies anymore it just wasn’t for me good fbomb placement excellent hallway action scene and felt for rocket’s story i just can’t see myself liking this better than gotg 1 the oneliners  it for me personally with the same plots overused remember when starlord froze to almost death in space and then he got rescued at the last moment again initial bad guy hurts team then realizes bigger bad guy they team up and has his redemption arc i just don’t know anymore,2023-05-05
orgoscope was absolutely disgusting,2023-05-05
big big mistake letting gunn leave this movie was desperately needed this is like the perfect time to jump off the mcu ship because the marvels is looking like more of quantumania and love and thunder ,2023-05-05
"am i imagining a plot point here or can someone back me up please

in my head i definitely remember someone in the film saying that gamora doesnt remember her time with the guardians and at the end of endgamethor 4 this pastgamora is with the guardians so somewhere between then and now theyve had a falling out and shes left then joined the ravagers

and we see mantis wipe draxs memory when hes upset about being called  can you see where im going here

did something big happen between films and gamora asked mantis to erase her memory of them",2023-05-05
"my thoughts

this is the best mcu movie since endgame

i was initially skeptical about wil poulter as adam warlock but now i can undoubtedly say he was perfectly cast for that role

this movie was so much fun not many momentsplot points i can poke holes in

james gunn is the best comic movie writerdirector at the moment and needs to be given as much money as he wants for future projects",2023-05-05
idk why no one else is talking about this but groot actually said a sentence that wasn’t his own name,2023-05-05
"im not sure how to feel about the movie yet but i could say it probably the best thing that came out of mcu ever since endgame im not sure if it the best out of the trilogy tho

rocket’s flashbacks were my favourite scenes in the movie although adam warlock’s character was probably my least favourite part which is a shame cause i kind of like his set up as this villain going toe against the guardians but became a joke for a while",2023-05-05
took baby groot that long to grow up how can spider groot just grow back to full size in like the next scene,2023-05-05

"if youre wondering whether rocket raccoons story will hurt you as it seems in the trailers 

yes",2023-05-05
"for me this was a hit and miss

i dont get why everyone is angrily yelling at each other for the first half of the movie and i felt it leaned a bit too much into the kick a dog trope to tug on our heartstrings and make us hate the villain

a lot of the jokes surprisingly did not land making the guardians seem like assholes the pacing is odd it goes from zero to 100 almost immediately 

i was impressed by all the body horror though some of it is genuinely creepy

i feel the film maybe tried too much to get away from the vibe started in the first film and then subsequently copied to all too many marvel films",2023-05-05
"i really don’t understand why nebula couldn’t open the car door she’s been on earth for 5 years surely she knows what the concept of a car is and how to use it

still  hilarious though ",2023-05-06
"i was really looking forward to this after reading some reviews and i think they got me too hyped i thought it was good but it didnt blow me away like most reviewers were claiming it would honestly i left blue balled we got all this build it up to this being the end of the guardians and then not a single one dies it really seems like the mcu is too scared to off main characters now at least it wasnt as bad as antman where theyre fighting the new big bad thats killed hundreds of avengers and yet he cant handle ants    
    
one main gripe though is at the end when groot speaks i wish he said   
   
were not guardians were family",2023-05-06
it is a beautiful movie cant believe i cried over an otter a rabbit and walrus it is an unpopular opinion i think rocket has the best origin story in the mcu phase 4 and phase 5 have been poor but i think this is the best movie come out of these 2 phases after no way home,2023-05-06
i think gunns superman movie is gonna be one for the ages,2023-05-06
"i’m so upset what they did with warlock… it was unforgivable  he should have been the main baddie  i don’t like how the golden high priestess was just thrown away… it was such a throwaway… the story wasn’t my favorite at all some of the emotion was super corny and forced but there was definitely one’s to pull your heart but even with all that the script acting pacing comic relief and resolution it was great 

i give it a solid b  it had so much more potential to be better just like dsmvm no way home and thor … but this was better than all 3",2023-05-06

"when they go to the planet when mantis and drax go up to security checkin why doesnt mantis instead of doing a joke very  considering the high stakes and have the security creature fall in love with drax instead go up to each of the security and tell them they are not a threat 

even better sneak up to the guard that shoots drax and do her mind control on him",2023-05-07
some scenes were great but no deaths and especially the starlord fakeout left a bad taste in my mouth the overuse of cgi started wearing me down after hour two as well but again some scenes were great and the animal stuff made me an emotional wreck wish the rest of the movie was as effective as the animal stuff,2023-05-07

can we talk ab how good the villain was finally,2023-05-05
"i thought it was solid i feel like the problems i have with the movie are the same problems i have with other marvel movies which i admit i’m not a fan of

one thing i’ll say is that rocket’s emotional core of the film is extremely effective and makes up for a lot it’s issues

i genuinely can’t stand nebula idk what it is i find her so annoying her lines  and karen gillen just isn’t a great actress

i don’t really see why gammorah couldn’t remember quill quill even mentioned it was “infinity stone sciency” mumbojumbo but like if that’s the case then after she died and came back the exact same “infinity stone sciency” mumbojumbo could have made it work too idk

the whole thing plotwise feels completely contrived but they honestly all are so that’s not really a huge hit on it

overall i liked it i just struggle to look past the glaring laziness of the writing and truly awful tone management and dialogue",2023-05-08
"it was pretty good

i am not a marvel person but i really enjoyed the first guardians of the galaxy as it had interesting and fun characters throughout the second one had some cool moments but overall i thought it was meh this third installment is better than the second one and definitely better than the previous marvel films

i’m not the biggest fan of james gunn’s filmography but his work on the guardians of the galaxy and the suicide squad were pretty good and fits his type of style and direction including this one the special effects were colorful and had some pretty good designs moments with action or fight scenes were wellexecuted and fun to observe with the previous films having a 70s and 80s like soundtrack the soundtrack here has some cool bangers and adds energy to the atmosphere there are also some pretty cool camerawork throughout

the performances from the cast members were all great as each cast had good chemistry and energy to work together as a team i appreciate the film approaching new elements on emotions and dark aspects which i thought were creative and worked pretty well with the narrative for characters it’s fun to see the main crew interact and continue to explore their purposes some of the new characters introduced were interesting although not as fun or interesting as the main leads there were some decent dialogue throughout and the humor aspects were good but some really didnt land well

but overall the film was still pretty good as it carries fun characters and a good sense of humor definitely one of the best films from this phase

groot saying i love you guys was honestly sweet

im a big guardians fan but i thought this was the worst one yet theyve gotten worse wjth each sequel,2023-05-22
the rocket movie wrapped inside the cliche mcu film was quite good  gonna get a 410 from me way too long everybody is just yelling the entire time and they do the same story beats since the first film  even the scene in the organic prison was almost exactly the same as the original prison scene instead of turning off gravity he makes all their suits go crazy  the stuff with rocket was fanatastic tear jerking  the rest of the movie was standard mcu cookie cutter but at least cosmo was a good dog,2023-05-22
"i went home and hugged all my pets

theres a lot to love about it — its genuinely emotional laugh out loud funny has an incredible action sequence beastie boys some truly inventive set pieces and a cathartic conclusion to much of the gotg arcs

but its so noticeably shaggy and uneven throughout the plot is overstuffed the villain isnt as interesting as the movie pretends he is and they couldnt resist the urge to add in an unfortunate amount of cgi goop in the final act

which is a shame because theres a toptier mcu movie in there that gets somewhat cannibalized by its shortcomings and ends up being finepretty good",2023-05-05
this was okay i enjoyed it more in the beginning than nearer to the end it starts to drag and it feels like there isnt as much humor late in the film i didnt feel as disappointed by this as i did by vol 2 but i think thats just because my expectations were lower 610 it has some laughs but its not as consistently fun as vol 1,2023-05-05
10 manly tears out of 10 i have a yorkie and i always call him rocket and well after seeing this film i gave him a big ol hug when he was in the sky for a momentmy heart could not take it  i cried man,2023-05-05
i thought teefs was ,2023-05-05
"i just got out of seeing it and i am probably going to get downvoted but i did not think it was nearly as good as everyone is saying it felt very uneven some of the acting was really bad throughout and this one probably had the worst writing out of all three movies the only thing that was superior about this one was the flashback scenes the flashbacks to rocket and his friends was beautiful and sad and tragic some of the action scenes were fun but long the film felt over long also they made mantis way too over the top camp and cartoonish in both the christmas special and this 

i see people putting this one in their top 5 or 10 and while i respect your opinions i disagree i actually think it’s weird people hate on eternals so much but are loving this eternals was a much better made film than this",2023-05-05
they really could have cut a good 40 minutes out of this flick most of that first planet they land on with fillion could have been cut down to 5 minutes tops,2023-05-06
id say it was about as good as volume 2 but volume 1 is still the best of the trilogy by a long shot volume 1 felt like a bit of a love letter to science fiction like it was the kind of film people were hoping or expecting that the force awakens would be but something was missing from volume 3 as if gunn was leaning a little too  the campy 1980s science fiction aesthetic some of the costume designs  especially during the orgocorp scenes  were very obviously people in silly costumes and makeup even with nathan fillion chewing the scenery the film just couldnt get out of its own way a few other parts felt a bit lazy too cosmo was able to telekinetically hold two space stations together and the hellbeasts came out of nowhere as if the film realised that it needed an actual threat,2023-05-06
…dog days are over that’s our big dance number at the end,2023-05-07

"metacritic is insanely wrong at 66 

this movie was a 90 success loved it 

makes me wish marvel never dumped gunn",2023-05-10
"it was so good kinda speechless honestly no paragraphs long rant here pffft

one detail i really liked is when rocket was walking back to rescue everyone on the ship the first one to follow his lead was groot thats true loyalty since their first introduction

and i like the way that rockets backstory kinda recontextualized why rocket and groot worked so well before gotg even got together groot probably reminded him of his first friends so its not a wonder why rocket genuinely valued his companionship",2023-05-05
how was this movie not rated r im 30 but im probably gonna have some nightmares from those animal hybrid things along with those weird flashback scenes that were supposed to be sentimental but came across as creepy also the face peeling scene  lol,2023-05-05
it’s not the best marvel has ever been but i think it’s the best they will ever be from here on out,2023-05-05
i felt annoyed by the flashbacks usually flashbacks can be used to give context behind characters actions by showing the memories theyre thinking about while doing things but rocket didnt do anything for most of the movie the flashbacks werent giving any context for any character choices until the third act so it felt like watching two different movies at once,2023-05-05
maybe it’s just me but the flashbacks with rocket seemed to drag and didn’t really land i think i understood what they were going for given the themes of  animal cruelty shown but overall it doesn’t quite nail the elevated superhero feel not enough themes and for a theme park ride you need that,2023-05-06
the f bomb was a total shock,2023-05-07
"still making up my mind about this one great visuals action sequences although the 360 degree rotation around characters standing back to back is way overdone by now and oneliners the animal lab abuse was just insanely brutal and honestly a little cheap to pull at the heartstrings reminds me a bit of avatar 2 with the calf crying out for its mother after the whalers  her if this kind of stuff helps sway people away from eating meat or laboratory tested products im all for it but man this stuff can be traumatizing for little kids

i thought the main villain high evolutionary was fantastic seemed as though he was modeled directly from adolf himself use of eugenics to create the master race delusions of grandeur and striving to replacebecome  and even tangential references to the holocaust kids in concentrationcamp like pens incinerate them i was a bit lost with warlocks plot line but ive only seen the first two guardians movies once his arc seemed a bit odd and not very organic sean gunns presence was also very distracting and every time he was on screen all i could think was how silly it is to cast your family in enormous roles when much better actors should have been used

lots of death fakeouts too which i didnt really mind since i dont want to see any of those characters die it was already an emotional rollercoaster so that would have just been a step too far toward the dark side lastly whats up with rockets animal friends still being all fd up and modified in heaven shouldnt they have been reverted to their original forms seemed like a strange choice to keep their bodies all mangled when the usual trope has people being healed from whatever their ailment was also the your time will comebut not yet cliche needs to go away best line of the film open the  door

overall i think id give it a 75 borderline 810 enjoyable but the mediocrity of phase 4 and 5 so far gives it a bump ill look forward to starlords life on earth standalone film",2023-05-07

adam warlocks character shouldve been handled a lot more carefully his comic book fans will be disappointed with his role in the movie,2023-05-05
"as someone who didn’t love either the suicide squad or the guardians holiday special i’m shocked at how much i loved this and how almost everything worked for me probably my favorite of the guardians franchise and top 3 in the mcu overall one of the things i haven’t seen discussed is there isn’t any use of the usual mcu joke structure of undercutting a serious moment with a joke there were so many times in an emotional moment where i was getting ready to roll my eyes at a joke coming at the end of it but that never happened they let the serious moments be serious and the funny moments be funny and it’s all the better for it 

and it feels like the perfect kang replacement is already in house with chukwudi iwuji he did such a good job and i would love to see more of him",2023-05-05
got emotional af during every baby rocket cut scene idk why they hit me hard excellent fight scenes,2023-05-05
this movie is just heartbreak over heartbreak over heartbreak james gunn managed to tell a story with big weight and stakes without killing a single guardian easily one of my top 10 marvel movies,2023-05-05

"too bad the high evolutionary never heard of a medpack before otherwise he couldve healed his face

a lot of the movies themes can be summed up as compassion neurodiversity and what lack of anger management will do to you",2023-05-07
as someone who doesn’t know anything about adam warlock i felt he was done dirty i kept waiting for his “he killed my mother” grieve and anger scene but there was no reaction at all i then waited for his badass moment of redemption and instead we got a ridiculously looking out of place scene of him rescuing peter i know it’s based on the painting i liked the movie but i thought will will have a heath ledger type of moment where he nailed the role as a badass and not the will poulter people expected instead he ended being the goofball,2023-05-08
as soon as the movie ended i said “never again” i thought it was a very good movie but it’s one of those movies that im never going to be in the mood to watch which is really a shame because it was the best mcu film for me since shang chi but i had bad dreams about it last night after getting back from the theater i am just not cut out for those flashbacks,2023-05-08
how often can you say that an entire trilogy doesnt miss a single time,2023-05-09
did you guys notice you all started understanding groot too,2023-05-09
guardians of the galaxy vol 3 may be a swan song for the guardians and for gunn who has jumped ship to work for dc but it proves that the mcu can function better if they simply let an artist work in peace and not force them to toss in easter eggs and tangential villains to set up other movies instead of worrying about the story youre currently working on,2023-05-09
 i didn’t think guardians of the galaxy 3 was going to make me cry more than any other film in the last ten years but here we are,2023-05-09
"at the end of the movie why does peter risk is life by going back to pick up the music player

things like that completely ruin the movie for me so if adam waolock didnt save him we are to believe he would have died trying to get the music player

what they should have done is make it like the end of indiana jones and the last crusade where indys father tells him to let go of the artifact that it isnt worth losing his  life over

they could have done the same thing here but no as if written by a 10 year old peter is willing to lose his life over a music player

also didnt his face get all frozen when  he was drifting in space how does anyone make a recovery from that",2023-05-12
movie was meh anyone else here feel so,2023-05-19
was this good,2023-05-05
almost perfect mcu movie except for shoehorning kraglin and his little story line for what feels like simply because he’s james gunns brother,2023-05-09
"on the first glance a ok movie on second thoughts i wonder about too many things
first of all the villain you have absolutely no understanding why he is the person that he is he wants to perfect the universe thats it compared to thanos he practically has no story arc and seemed wasted 
next adam warlock he isonly in the story so he is introduced to the mcu he is practically not needed fir the story why is he there whats his motivation or the motivation of his people where does  he come from nothing
drax and mantis got nothing to do they are just comic relief
in the end the whole story seemed totally rushed this should have been a 10 episode series",2023-05-11
this is the day by the the being used in the soundtrack makes me selfishly upset because the the is a relatively niche deep cut i love to share with people i know they charted in the uk i’m an american it’s a deep cut here i assure you but now anyone i share it with will think i only know the the from a marvel movie  this is the day specifically was a very important song to me i listened to soul mining a lot in high school after stumbling onto it on streaming good choice but bad choice lol,2023-05-05
"i cried about 6 times full on tears not just watery eyes some happy some sad

it should also be known that this is only the third movie i have ever cried during",2023-05-05
even knowing ahead of time how dark it was going to get i was still shocked at how far they pushed it with rocket’s backstory  it was too much for my wife and she left halfway through the movie  i think the intensity could’ve been pulled back and still worked  it’s just so  bleak and  up and it just keeps going  otherwise i  loved it  amazing and funny and emotional and sad  one of the very best marvel films,2023-05-05
i cant believe i waited to watch someone eat cereal adam was done very well,2023-05-05
maybe its just me but i didnt like this movie that much at all felt a little too goofy and sappy and they completely wasted high evolutionary and adam warlock think im officially done with the mcu,2023-05-10
man i hope some of the guys from counter earth were able to survive the place wasnt perfect but it sure as well was nicer than our earth and most folks seemed nice,2023-05-11
"i came in skeptical because i really didnt like gotg 2 and felt the suicide squad and peacemaker was just way too much gunn humor

thought vol 3 was the most enjoyable thing from gunn since the original guardians of the movie and its not as dark or sad as the reviews make it out to be

probably the best mcu film since nwh or endgame even",2023-05-05
"my biggest criticism of this film isn’t even this films fault

but the lack of peter and gamora’s romance especially after the first two films really glared and this film made me realise how much i liked the pairing and how much i missed it and as a result this film made me wish they hadn’t killed off prime gamora in infinity war because when peter and 2014 gamora go their separate ways it felt like an unsatisfying ending to their story together

i dunno call me a sucker for a happy ending but i would’ve preferred to see peter and gamora get their happy ending prime gamora didn’t get her happy ending instead she just got killed by her abusive adoptive father and as a result peter was forced to move on which didn’t really feel like a happy ending for him either yeah i know not everyone gets a happy ending but considering all those two had been through and lost i don’t think it would’ve been too much to ask for them to get a happy ending together i mean we saw peter lose his mother then we saw him find out his birth father was a  right before he loses his adoptive father and then he loses his girlfriend and with gamora we saw her lose her people we saw the results of thanos’ abuse and once she finally gets away from him and finds a family she’s killed by him so is it too much to ask for those two to get a happy ending together

in regards to 2014 gamora i understand why gunn went the direction he did but i think if done well peter and 2014 beginning a romance could’ve worked because sure this new gamora isn’t the same gamora he fell in love with in 2014 but at the same time he’s not the same peter he was in 2014 they’re both different now and i think it could’ve worked especially because i’d trust gunn to write it in a way that could’ve worked they wouldn’t even need to get ‘together’ in the film they could’ve just hinted at it 

i dunno maybe it’s just me",2023-05-09
biggest issue with the movie to me was gamora it felt like they opted out of a grieving plot and instead went with an exes learn they cant reconcile plot while still keeping the grieving angle and both were done an disservice in the process gamora is also such a terrible person in this with so few scenes that i did not care how her plot ended which also made no sense because she was brought from like a month before the events of gotg 1 and it was explicit in that one that she had the most moral backbone on the team peter even says so verbatim in this one the idea that shed revert to being a sadistic sociopath just because she was plucked from her timeline like a month early is ridiculous overall wish that shed been left out entirely or even died permanently again in endgame,2023-05-05

this trilogy has always been about rocket so seeing his story get the focus was great that hallway fight set to beastie boys goes  hard and was amazing just action so well choreographed in a big budget mcu movie i love everyones arc the best villain in any of the gotg movies and probably up there with namor as the best of the post thanos phases

"i loved it sure you can say that the rocket flashbacks were obviously going to be sad or that adam warlock is kinda just there but the jokes were great the action was great and all the emotional moments and ending were well earned super happy that nobody had to die and everyone had a good send off  

interesting that they just said starlord comes back i guess pratt signed a new contract for avengers films or something while the rocket team is up in the air i guess  

favorite moments full guardians hallway fight was badass drax mantis and nebula yelling at each other for their problems bio planet break in was fun guy who played high evolutionary did a great job being a crazy mad scientist",2023-05-07

first reactions upon leaving the theater are that i  mostly loved vol 3 few things didn’t work for me but they didn’t bring the film down for me overall some jokes didn’t land but i loved the banter between the guardians adam warlock felt shoehorned in didn’t hate him a couple hours later i don’t think i’ll be rewatching this anytime soon i’ll give myself a week or two rocket’s backstory was freaking heartbreaking don’t know if i wanna go through that again but hats off to james gunn for bringing the drama and not holding back the bonds he developed with the other animals while in captivity was bittersweet you simply didn’t want anything bad to happen to them but the film went there seeing him in heaven purgatory reuniting with lyla floor and teefs brought the waterworks up again cracked a smile when yondu popped up while kraglin used his heart to control the arrow,2023-05-10

one scene i dont see mentioned much was when they were breaking into that organic corporation and quill is having this heart to heart with gamora only to be interrupted by mantis telling him they can all hear them and the it goes into a argument on what the different color buttons mean and somehow quill is the only one confused by it",2023-05-10
"great movie definitely bogged down at the beginning with marvels signature 45 minutes of expository catchup™ but once it got past that it was a very funny surprisingly heartwrenching movie thats dripping with actual personality which feels illegal for marvel movies nowadays


it feels like marvel saw the suicide squad realized that sort of thing was possible and then let james gunn go buck wild in vol 3 in ways they never wouldve allowed in the first two kind of makes me bummed that we probably wont be seeing any more gunnhelmed marvel movies i want that howard the duck movie  damnit",2023-05-10

so nobody’s gonna talk about groot saying something other than “i am groot” that was a fun surprise,2023-05-14
i actually cannot stop thinking about this film it was so brilliant near perfection in fact i loved nearly every moment i cried so many times it was honestly heartbreaking and hilarious at the same time every part of rockets backstory broke my heart and even though we knew it was coming i still had hope his friends had survived  so naive mantis and drax constantly had me laughing i love their relationship i cried with drax as he said bye to mantis nebulas character has had one of the greatest developments next to mantis she’s got such dry remarks that i found hilarious im glad they didn’t bring quill and gamora back together that would of being so forced she hasn’t gone through everything old gamora went through to make her fall for quill and it’s nice to see shes got a family with the ravengers and i feel like stallones character is the father figure she’s always wanted cosmo was such a cute character the perfect doggo love that she was a big part of the film i love that rocket got closure from the guilt he was feeling for all these years i love adam warlocks character i know some people didn’t but i think it was done perfectly he’s not living to his full potential yet cause hes just a kid he just does what he does for his mum when he disintegrated that guy i was in stitches it was so funny and nathan fillions character was quite funny i think the only issue i had was rockets friendship with groot was kinda overlooked and it woulda being nice to show how they met 1010 film none the less,2023-05-29

they were the guardians of the galaxy",2023-05-05
"i thought i was emotionally prepared for this film i was not emotionally prepared for this film teared up pretty badly when they killed rockets friends abusing animals even cgi ones always elicits a strong emotion from me im glad not too long after that scene they had drax doing the monkey noises it really helped

i was definitely expecting rocket to die in this film the trailers and the vibe from gunn certainly gave that impression as soon as he was revived mid way through i knew it wasnt gonna end with him dyeing a second time which was a good choice it was a less predictable ending to have them all just decide to move on from the team",2023-05-05

on my 3rd rewatch and noticed you can see the moment when quill and groot fall down past nebula mantis and drax as they were trying to break in to rescue them gonna be a neat easter egg to see once it comes out on home media,2023-05-06
"the ending leaves me with a question if peter could easily go back to earth why did it take so long for him to go back there 

as the captain of the ship couldnt he have said to the others over the years i want to show you all the planet where im from",2023-05-06
"really liked it for the most part felt good to see an mcu movie with actual character development for a change 

gunn’s handling of superhero action choreography is best inclass would have loved for him to do an avengers movie eventually oh well 

the animal abuse was overdone imo and rocket’s backstory was kinda overlongtook him away from the core crew for a long time there weren’t many meaningful interactions between rocket and the rest of the guardians after he came back which is a shame considering that this is maybe one of the last times this iteration of the crew comes together on screen 

high evolutionary was just comically bad i mean i get that i am supposed to hate him mission accomplished but i just wanted every scene with him to end as soon as it began

that florence  machine needle drop tho bawled my eyes out gunn’s best soundtrack in the whole trilogy 

overall  some of the most emotionally resonant content mcu has churned out and serves as a fitting swan song for these weirdos",2023-05-06
honestly was pretty mediocre the first two were way better this felt like it dragged on so  much and could have been an hour shorter,2023-05-06
guy next to me was eating popcorn in the most absurdly loud way possible incredible how little self awareness some people have,2023-05-07
" i hate hate hate that gunn is leaving the mcu not because i dont want dcu stuff to get better but i always felt like gunn constrained within the mcu was just the right amount of james gunn and after suicide squad and peacemaker this film just  proves it for me

not that those things were bad they just pale in comparison to the guardian stuff for me

i expect the dc films to be better but they wont reach the heights of anything like this and all i can see is wasted potential especially in light of how disappointing this current phase has been

 as much as i love this film i cant help but feel extremely frustrated and disappointed that im not going to get something like this again",2023-05-07
did anybody catch that “the creation of adam” reference pretty cool especially given that one of those in the reference was named adam lol,2023-05-08

never cried this much on a marvel movie since endgame the scene where rocket finally accepted himself as a racoon had me bawling,2023-05-11
really liked it only two criticisms is it felt a bit too long and adam warlock felt kind of unnecessary,2023-08-06
really liked the movie but i think it could of been 20 minutes longer and maybe give time to rocket reflecting on his past with the crew and more time with rocket and peter peter saying he’s his best friend but it didn’t feel that way after guardians 2 also rockets theme of losing his friends and then everybody up and leaving at the end felt meh,2023-05-05
"man i think this was my most hated villain in the mcu all the others just didn’t compare for me and i couldn’t wait the whole movie until they finally defeated him a feeling that only infinity war had over me didn’t like endgame much 


i wish they ended the franchise here and didn’t have have the message at the end that star lord will be back it’ll probably be the last mcu movie i care about too",2023-05-05
them playing off each others strengths during fight scenes is the mcu at its best its what made the original avengers movie so great,2023-05-05
"really enjoyed it  my thoughts

x200b

it truly was an emotional roller coaster  back stories galore  each character had their arc and yet there wasnt a total everythings perfect in the end kind of feelto me the best movies out there  rockets backstory was absolute topnotch writing  

x200b

there were times were i thought the sfx were not quite up to   like in the tissue base  at marvels level i want the best and i could tell some of those effects were not 100  

x200b

the last song i feel wasnt the original last song  i felt they were dancing to something else but then couldnt get the rights or something  

x200b

agree 10000 on the i love you guys bringing the audience into the guardiansi even kinda heard i am groot anyways  beautifully done 

x200b

overall an amazing ride totally worth it and cant wait to rewatch 1  2and 3 again soon",2023-05-05
chris pratts acting bradley coopers voice acting karen gillans portrayal of nebulas emotional growth chukwudi iwujis perfect portrayal of high evolutionary and his madness all of the cast are really good but these guys acting really stuck with me,2023-05-05
my biggest gripe with the movie is how adam warlock is portrayed they could have made him older and be full on menacing instead they make him younger played by the maze runner actor and make him out to be completely ,2023-05-08
"did anyone else find it very strange that groot finally spoke in english and it just happened to coincide with the final movie

how are the characters able to understand what he is saying when he only just says the same three words over and over  

also is groot an immortal being is he capable of dying at the end of 1 he was able to regenerate and start over as a young groot will he eventually grow old and die",2023-05-09
honestly missed watching an actual solid marvel movie the ending was corny as  though lol,2023-05-14
i’m glad we don’t have to get more of this james gunn garbage,2023-05-17
the movie is really bad,2023-07-13
"it was a great movie full of emotional moments i loved rocket backstory and all the heartfelt moments but to be frank i dont think vol 3 fit that well with the narrative the movies were going for in vol 1 and 2 i always thought that the movies were mostly about peter and his relationship with his own past the stuff that he wants to forget aboutfeels guilty about with his mother and the part he yearns and desperately looks for to feel validated to feel important go finally feel good with himself with his father

i thought vol 3 would show us peter coming back to earth and what that meant for him coming full circle and finally facing his trauma instead vol 3 kinda just turn into a rocket movie and im not saying it was bad it was actually the best part of the movie imo but it just feels like the general story took a side turn all of a sudden 

i also feel like old gamora should have been there their relationship was kind of the emotional core of peters arc and in a way of the movies they were sort of the mom and dad of the group i know that wasnt gunns decision but it feels like theres something important missing at least the movie addresses it kinda good and doesnt make the fan service move of bringing old gamora back and actually commits with her death giving her a good sendoff",2023-05-11
"gunn it’s my last one so i’m gonna do some fcked up

did anyone catch what was written on the newspaper in the second article something about someone being abducted by aliens,2023-05-05
so can someone explain how peter quill and the other life forms can just walk around in space without running out of air or freezing up death peter should have died too right,2023-05-08
haven’t seen the movie yet and avoiding spoilers but can anyone tell me if this is worth seeing in rpx real 3d or should i just stick with the regular rpx i usually am not big on 3d but i do enjoy the occasional movie if it’s done right toy story 3 comes to mind immediately,2023-05-10
i wasn’t a big fan of how gamora was in this movie i get that this was supposed to be a different version of the character one that didn’t experience the things that made the original more kind and considerate but she felt overly mean to me here other than that i thought the movie was great,2023-06-08
"where to start 

i felt that some of the gags were misplaced causing the tone to feel uneven at times it also had some predictable beats at the end warlock saving quill cosmos being a good dog but not yet and i found it odd that groot seemed to not have as much of a reaction to rocket being near death as the others 

but with that said wow the best mcu film in a good while so much emotion and heart in this one so relieved that the guardians all survived rockets backstory while horrific was beautifully done the introduction to batch 89 reminded me of syds toys in toy story 

the hallway sequence is one of the best action sequences in the all the mcu seeing the team work so well together after their earlier dysfunction was great to see  

i said it was predictable but  it cosmos is a good dog 

probably could go on for a bit on all the great moments in this film will rewatch soon

also is the hes gravity tech the same as kangs it seemed similiar",2023-05-05
also shout out to the guy beside me who a hated the little mermaid for not be “realistic enough” ie black mermaid is bad but thought the live action lion king was good and then laughed at me for crying during the rocket teefs floor scene he got a comment from me of “at least i have better taste in disney movies than you mermaids aren’t real ”,2023-05-07
can someone explain to me how gamora was back and why was she a different version did something get messed up when tony snapped his fingers because she was dead on the magic mountain the one that came back was another version,2023-05-11
i was crying as soon as the marvel logo hit the screen done total mess,2023-05-05
2 things really seemed like they were out of place or just not the best choices opening with the song creep and groot not saying i am groot the song didnt hit and wasnt the least bit enjoyable for me and groot in the end felt forced or just too cheesy maybe especially since they all understood him those were the only two times i didnt get lost in the story i gave it an 8 out of  the poll and i understand everything cant be perfect every time those were just the 2 things i didnt like everything else was fun,2023-05-05
"went around telling friends this was the john wick chapter 4 of marvel movies and im really hoping that i didnt over promise was laughing crying  sitting on the edge of my seat and slumped all the way back while watching

"gotg 3

very sad for peter after watching this movie it was a good movie he just suffered so much loss he always wanted to find his family

spoiler below

here are my observations rockets backstory very sad is connected to gamoras  the high evolutionary was at the mountain when gamora was murdered by thanos they made it a point in the movie for gamora to take his mask off

what did the high evolutionary do to those children i believe one of those children rescued could be gamora and peters child repeat of peter and gamoras tragic childhood broken families are always so sad",2023-05-05
theres not many people seeing the late shows in the boston area tonight,2023-05-06
"i think people are misinterpreting the guardians 3 ending

i’ve seen so many people be sad over the “fact” that the guardians are no longer together and specifically how sad it would be for them to not see each other again 

there’s no way they’re never seeing each other again peter can come visit rocket and knowhete anytime and viceversa mantis will probably return from her solo trip in a year or two and gamora is still in contact with nebulaknowhere 

it’s not like they’re never gonna see each other again…",2023-05-07
man i was not expecting such an amazing movie i knew it would be good but not that good they nailed everything closing every arch beautifully adding just the right amount of humour while taking themselves serious enough to acknowledge that it’s not “just another superhero movie”… also loved the little bit of poulter’s character that we saw and look forward to seeing more rocket makes a great captain and if i never saw any of those characters on screen again i would still be satisfied,2023-05-07
glad we were able to get a happy ending without a tragic ending for any of the main characters i was anticipating being devastated by rocket’s death that i hear rumors about and i’m really glad it didn’t happen,2023-05-07

james gunn moving to dc is a big loss for marvel and if the wb bosses stay out of his way dc could actually be really good",2023-05-10
"after all is said and done can we agree this movie kicks 

that was  beautiful and i mean it after the second movie and the current state of the mcu for some time now i was pleasantly surprised how good it was i was thoroughly entertained i laughed i cried i was horrified surprised by how dark is got for an mcu film but at the end of it all i was left smiling the humor wasnt too overbearing the action was great the music was on point and i love it and they actually referenced  reaching out to adam with peter and adam at the end jesus this movie reminded me why i love florence and the machine havent smiled that much in a while

word  rocket raccoon

x200b

but with that said i do have a few questions like why the  at the very end get the high evolutionary seems so weak at the beginning he is almost crushing adam to death but then he forgets he can control gravity what and he can create highly advanced civilizations using primative lifeforms give himself superpowers but he cant just grow a new face really and what happened to him afterwards at the end did they just leave them there on the floor i couldve sworn i saw drax carrying him across his shoulders

and was that the first use of the f word in the mcu movies",2023-05-12

im done running literal shivers,2023-05-05
to recap before watching this in the cinema tonight which mcu movies should i watch,2023-05-05
i was really surprised at how much i enjoyed this the first one is great but the second one is at the bottom of my mcu list its hot garbage but i thought this was solid it redeems some of the character choices of the second one a little bit with mantis yelling at nebula about drax its incredibly emotional rockets neardeath experience is the first time a marvel film has made me mistyeyed and chris pratt did a better job when handed an emotional scene i was much more convinced by his grief over rocket than i was by his grief over yondu im a fan of both adam warlock and the high evolutionary from the comics so im torn over both their adaptations but the portrayals were good nonetheless phyla on the other hand no thanks didnt like that one at all the music choices werent bad but they werent as wellintegrated as the other films ive already said way more than i intended when i started this comment so ill wrap it up by saying it was good and i liked it,2023-05-05
i came back to my house and went straight to hug my animals,2023-05-05
super off topic but dont want to make a thread what are some good online movie clubs to join bonus if they do zooms,2023-05-05
definitely worth the wait  the guardians have always been my favourite and now that the infinity saga is over they were the only characters i was still checking for truly satisfying end to the trilogy,2023-05-05
cant wait to read all of these comments soon but just wanted to add my review  perfect  james gunn nailed this and i cant wait to see what he does with superman and dc in general,2023-05-05

"high evolutionary was a real standout of the whole film he was so irredeemably evil without anything other than his tech and creations to back him up it was so satisfying to see him get bodied by the team at the end and  the gore on his face when his mask came off was pretty unheard off for an mcu movie

also “there is no  thats why i stepped in” is such a raw line that really embodies his character perfectly",2023-05-06
this was just emotional damage also mcu still has hope lol,2023-05-06
"guardians of the galaxy volume 3 a yes for me

some mentioned it as the best since end game that might be too much but it’s a great movie james gunn does not miss at all it is a movie with a great background story around rocket probably my fav character of them highly emotional and written so well

the fights were awesomely shot the music was amazing and the duration did not hinder me at all i won’t go to much into detail to prevent spoilers but it had funny oneliners some cool new or funny characters and the emotional aspect of rocket’s past touched me glad to see marvel still can release great movies on to the next one",2023-05-06

"good movie kinda had a lot more  than the others you could almost hear gunn saying “would you let me…” “really okay”

but i think i was a little soured because the theater i was in projected on the walls at the format changes it was smeary nauseating and had all the problems of projecting at an angle like you know something that should move 5 of the screen laterally becoming a spotlight moving 20feet back and forth in your peripheral",2023-05-10

guardians for most people is considered as third rate and a side commedic group  i loved guardians since its debut something about it just works with its balance of its characters action and comedy like even thor movies tries comedy but it feels kinda lame spiderman has its dorky comedic moments but guardians has just the right balance 

i guess the diversity as a group really works because each character is has clear written quirks and traits whereas say a group like eternals they all feel too homogeneous and everyone in that group just blends into one character so it doesnt feel like a group but one entity",2023-08-04

 i was emotionally invested in every scene that had rocket raccoon specially that last scene with layla 
 beastie boys fight scene was def one of the best action pieces in mcu 
 adam warlock seem a bit underutilized but hopefully has more stuff in future movies 
 great cameos and callbacks from previous movies 
 movie dragged in few parts wish it was a bit tighter and well paced like the first one 

also the movie felt like a big ad for pet adoption and i def hugged my pup once i got home i would rate this a 6810",2023-05-05

the wrapping of all the arcs was so good

but man the high evolutionary he was such a good villain just complete and utter evil no sympathy  its great seeing a villain just be a 

he is a crazy alien with a megaship gravity powers and a face mask but his effectiveness is because he is a very real villain he is a nasty little abuser lording his superiority over others and is driven to hysterics and fury when he realises rocket is smarter than him mocking rockets grief after he murdered his friend the whole i created you so i own you for the rest of your life when his crew turned on him the towering fury as he destroyed the cockpit rather than sensibly compromise he could be a guy without powers anywhere and he would torture the people around him to justify himself and his superiority",2023-05-07

then you have the bad guy who is running around torturing them and screaming constantly  some real academy award winning material right there  several of the actors felt very phonedin with their performances zoe saldana in particular

the plot felt very the last jedireturn of skywalker as others have mentioned  didnt make a whole lot of sense to me and was constantly jumping everywhere  i also had difficulty believing with the level of violence that this got by with a pg13 rating

i think marvel and disney have really lost it since endgame  once they realized they were making money hand over fist they were compelled to continue to pump out movie after movie  in order to make their quarterly profit goals  super bummed about the high critical reception for this will probably start skipping these movies and saving my 50 dollars",2023-05-07

"that has been definitely one of the better mcu movies since a long time honestly my biggest gripe about it is that it kind of feels like two movies merged into one on the one hand we had the whole rocket and high evolutionary storyline on the other humour and music of previous gotg movies i think the latter could be better here it just all seemed kind of forced sometimes imo like music being there only because its guardians movie so it has to have music or humour not being the best still as a whole it was definitely good movie

and i really dont like phyla it was just so random i dont like her being one of hundreds children and not unique her being in guardians at the end without any good reason why would they take kid in her suddenly having powers plus according to high evolutionary the kids arent creative at all and that doesnt seem like an interesting character trait and of course another prominent lgbt character being very young

edit most guardians character still arent the best unfortunately especially drax who is still the same and nebula who should have a bigger role since shes the one who has know rocket the longest the game had them all so much better",2023-05-07
"loved this movie  

i came in prepared to burn the theatre down if they killed rocket  but once i saw that he was goign to be in a coma like the whole movie i knew he wasnt going to die which make me feel better

either way i loved the whole ride  it definately made up for the second movie which i really didnt like mostly because i hated the treatment they gave ego 

anyway the action was top notch the humor was great this was a glorious send off for this guys  

and throwing a  into this movie  i was not expecting that  amazing

however again we deal with the old chestnut of not killing the villain because youre the hero  you killed dozens of things to get to him  yet you stop at the main guy you should be killing  always annoying",2023-05-10

i have to say that i found it to be a disappointment pratt seemed to be “irritated”— not his character besides mantis and nebula characters felt disingenuous the edit felt odd too scenes went overly long jokes felt more like something from two and a half men rather than quippy 

worst of all was the tropy flashbacks to rocket— probably the most unlikeable of the group it was so obvious what was going to happen with the other characters there was next to no emotional connection or payoff it was like watching a racoon version of the book of boba fett when he’s in that bacta tank 

the square enix outing was far better and did more for all characters than this shambles 610 for me at best i’ll see you in downvote ",2023-05-12
i can’t seem to figure out why the critics didn’t like this movie personally i have it top 5 all time mcu the pacing was great the emotions and stakes were high the villian was probably the most sadistic we’ve seen and it was a good send off for the characters,2023-05-05
"rockets backstory was the highlight of the film for me it just goes to show how comic book movies dont need to have a quip right after something bad happens 

movie still suffers from marvel humor but it isnt as bad",2023-05-05
anyone who liked this movie but is not excited for the new dcu is just a hater this made me very excited to see what gunn will do with the dcu,2023-05-06
chris pratt acted his  off in this movie probably his best performance he’s given to be honest,2023-05-06
there was a pretty sus moment,2023-05-06
james gunn is so  good at this i sobbed at the sight of the word raccoon how is that possible i cried like 5 other times throughout the film not just tears full on crying this is one of the best endings to a trilogy that ive ever seen,2023-05-06
 this movie i cant remember the last time i got teary eyed during a film this one really got me i dont think i can listen to dog days are over the same again,2023-05-06
one thing i got fridge logic on was that counter earth should have had some serious religion  not only does their creator walk among them and they build statues to him but somebody from the ship should have let them know errr we are ready to end your world if you dont shape up  the missiles are ready to fire whenever,2023-05-06
"man this one was powerful top tier mcu for me really strong in pretty much every aspect 

tbh i’m confused on some of the mixed reactions i’ve seen like what were people looking for here that they didn’t get",2023-05-06

like this had my theater more invested in the entire movie than they were with quantumania",2023-05-06
movie made me well up 4 times maybe better than the 1st,2023-05-06
wow i was not ready for how dark this film felt but it was really beautiful and it didn’t hold back i really appreciated that it really had me sad thinking we as humans already treat animals so poorly and caged up at the end of the day they just want to see the sky like us ,2023-05-07
by the end of the movie everyone was dancing and happy and yet here i was sat in the theatre absolutely sobbing my eyes out,2023-05-07
really nice to see one of these loves with a real sense of design and so varied within one film,2023-05-10

"i get that people liked the movie but im not one of them the bickering and the animal cruelty was just too much for me my girlfriend was tearing up at those flashbacks and the payoff wasnt good enough in my opinion 

drax becoming a dad was cool but other than that i was more depressed walking out of the theater than happy",2023-05-08
it was complete  but i knew that going in,2023-05-06
"honestly that was the best mcu trilogy in my opinion 

the characters arcs were rich with growth and emotion and they all had their spotlight 

rocket’s story was so amazing and it hit me in the gut 
i cannot praise james gunn enough with this storytelling  this man introduced us to rocket’s story and friends with such sensibility they were pure and sweet despite everything they were going through 

and us the audience finally understanding groot’s language that was absolutely genious

i  cried in this movie but i also cried with that beautiful ending 
no deaths in the team despite so many speculation just everyone growing and learning from their own experiences 
beautiful",2023-05-05

“…but not yet” cried like a baby,2023-05-06
james gunn is the only blockbuster director who knows how to pick songs,2023-05-05
the film was  nebula and gamora were just shouting and screaming the whole way through it the acting was terrible minus rocket as usual drax making  jokes chris pratt seemed completely disinterested the whole way through adam warlock  one of the most powerful beings in the mcu  dumbed down to an incompetent imbecile who gets his  handed to him no thanks the only saving grace was the high evolutionary the guys acting was off the charts no  one liners just sheer focus and grit one of the best villains in a long time acted superbly,2023-05-08
that mechanical spider animal with the muzzle that rocket was with sounded so  annoying,2023-05-07
too long and too sloppy shoulda focused the whole thing on rocket more,2023-05-05
"did anyone else find it cringe when pete kept saying its a face off that is some seriously bad writing from james gunn

"goofy characters check

"the strongest feeling i had about gotg3 is it feels like a big budget version of the straight to vhs sequels of disney films in the 90’s far closer to the throwaway recent gotg holiday special than i was expecting 

it’s a very navelgazing and selfindulgent film james gunn seems to focus myopically on things that he’s passionate about  like the actors he obviously thinks of as family  to the detriment of good character writing and story while ideally filmmakers should speak from the heart he has a simplistic and heavy handed approach to emotion in his films and this is one of the worst examples

the pacing and editing makes the film drag for the 2 12 hour runtime scenes constantly hang uncomfortably after their natural finish before a new one appears with a sudden misplaced pop song that feels a far cry from the iconic soundtrack use of the first film

the choreography of many scenes including but not just action sequences is awkward and lacking dynamism events happen on the screen without any weight to them enemies are dispatched perfunctorily like an arcade shooter and there’s never a feeling of any real stakes despite the aforementioned overwrought emotions
the use of cgi has a large part in this with a flagship hallway fight scene feeling empty and lacking impact on the flip side the heroes’ home in knowhere is a decidedly practical single set reused from the holiday special that makes the space station built in the head of a dead celestial being feel like a small market square in a midbudget scifi tv show

there’s a cliched narrative structure of rocket’s flashbacks while he’s unconscious which penetrates throughout the film and disturbs the flow of the story this conceit is also responsible for the current rocket not being present for 75 of the film a very strange choice

outside of the admittedly emotive rocket backstory there’s very little meaningful character development and writing most of the interactions between the cast take the place of forced impotent disputes that resolve with a shrug or throwaway comedy moments which land flat meaning when the last act wraps up and the team all have their arcs concluded after several minutes of awkward dancing it’s unearned and unsatisfying the attention is spread thinly across too many players with gamora and adam warlock noticeably having very little to do the latter feels like a big disappointment after the promise of will poulter’s appearance in the mcu and the character could have been quite easily sliced out of the film with minimal adjustments",2023-05-07
i went in expecting to watch a fun movie instead i got a sad story about animal abuse the only thing missing was that sarah mclachlan song playing in the background “in the arms of the angel fly awaaay”,2023-05-08

so i havent watched every single marvel movie ever when does it show gamora coming back to life could have sworn she was extra dead,2023-05-06
wait how did they get out of the lab planet thing last thing i remember was quill  with nathan fillion space suits and then the next scene they’re on their ship,2023-05-08
"give a thumbs up if you were annoyed at how utterly  they made adam warlock instead of being a menacing villian such as the high evolutionary they made him out to be completely  and childlike when he is an adult

it was so cringe what they did with his character it made me think of shazam when the boy turns into the adult superhero he talks and acts like a kid i feel like they were doing the same thing with him

when they were interrogating the prisoner why on earth would walock shoot him that was so  and in the begining the high evolutionary would have sent him to capture rocket not  him

and at the end even though he killed someone in cold blood he gets to save peter and be a hero pretty much becoming an extended member of the guardians

the times he was in the movie were low points for me thankfully he isnt in the movie that much

i swear on my life if they made a movie soley about this particular adam warlock played by this actor i couldnt be paid enough to go see it",2023-05-09

despite being a lame derivative and silly movie it contains one interesting but dimly lit fact that is not highlighted by the storyline rockets ability to generate new ideas unlike the other altered species is attributed to his childhood spent playing with friends it is this experience that fostered his creative circuitry in the brain,2023-05-08

what was the meaning of using creep in the opening scene of the film is it something in reference to gunn getting twitter cancelled,2023-05-14
"wasnt planning on seeing this i havent even watched the second one  but im curious as to whether someone can give some insight into a facebook post i saw was curious as to whether theres actual merit to this 



guardians of the galaxy 3 is the most anti trans movie  ive ever seen how did james gunn canceled by the woke mob at disney then rehired get away with this jason farley clued me into this

spoilers below

bad guy literally transmutates animals turning then against their biology

rocket racoon struggles to embrace his true biology only later coming to terms with who he was actually created as

villian claims there is no  until he stepped in

wanted to create a world without bigots world he created resembles  laden streets of san francisco

the villian has tons of children in cages who are rescued

holy cow this is some subtle writing and the fact that disney didnt see the message is crazy to me

edit im getting downvoted for asking a question",2023-05-08

after all the recent marvel releases im happy guardians maintained their consistency with how entertaining and enjoyable their movies always are also adam warlock came of a bit of a comedic relief character but idc i laughed everytime especially when he was about to  groot up and then just passed out  hope we can see more of his serious side in the future especially with how strong he really is,2023-05-05
this film in a way reminded me of top gun maverick lots of red flags of the characters death but no one died  a satisfying ending for all of them its definitely the most emotional mcu film to date,2023-05-05
well add that one fight to the list of excellent hallway fight scenes in movies,2023-05-05
"it’s not as tight as the first but i genuinely think the first is one of my favorite written directed and paced blockbusters ever and without a doubt my favorite marvel film i adored this film i was a little concerned gunn was going to go a bit too far into the morbid and sadness of the guardian’s trauma but it felt so necessary to see rocket’s tragic backstory to understand why he holds his new family so dearly the high evolutionary may be a typical evil godcomplex villain but the performance actions against his creations and connection to rocket really made him stand out as a memorable and cruel antagonist 

i love how the 3rd act ties the characters up without ridiculous conveniences or killing them off instead choosing to give the guardians natural next steps and endings say what you want about gunn but you can tell he really loved these characters with how he chose to leave them off this film the line about drax not being a destroyer but a father really got to me emotionally and the whole montage on nowhere at the end was just beautiful 

i have loved these characters since their initial 2008 comic run and am so grateful this trilogy exists and gave them the spotlight they deserved flaws and all it’s like a 9510 imo with my biggest issues being warlock feeling a bit of a waste groot being a bit too much to the side and the rocket flashbacks coming abruptly at times even if they were great gunn really went for it with the violence and gross creaturebody horror with this one",2023-05-05
did anyone else notice that the singer from the christmas special was there and just had no lines,2023-05-05
"i think this was an amazing closure to the gotg trilogy it also makes me really excited to see what james gunn has in store for the dc universe because if you let him take the reigns he can make a  good movie i loved that it was a movie that basically stood on its own and didn’t need the normal marvel cameo hype or needed to be a preparation film for the next big marvel arc 

my only critique may have been because i was a bit tired the cinematography in the first half with the one shot techniques he was consistently doing was literally getting me motion sick i got so dizzy i had to leave for a few seconds could’ve been that this needed to be viewed via center seats for full effect but adjusting to the zoomins and 360s and all the other camera movement he did from the side of the theater was a lot for me

side note nebula was a  rockstar this movie probably my favorite character now it’s amazing to see the ending to her character arc and all the growth she experienced",2023-05-05
so just got back from the movie and it was very good but i had a question does peter know that gamora is from the other timeline,2023-05-05
"please more mcu movies and tv series should have a oneshot hallway fight scene like daredevil please looking at you born again

"910 movie for me fun adventure and feels good movie lots of death fake out and im happy no one died cause theres so much more stories to tell and its awesome for them to come back for cameos for avengers etc hits especially hard if you have pets

"since probably nwh marvel has lot the ability to write emotion the heart just vanished the jokes got stale the action became forgettable mcus crown on the blockbuster world slipped and fell james gunn reminded me that most of the mcu has still been defined by fun action well rounded flawed characters and a good sense of emotion to tie the whole thing together it stings he wont get to lead the cosmic side of marvel like originally planned but   it for dc the second mcu film besides endgame to make me tear up and over  cyborg animals none the less i love you gunn i dont know what will happen with the mcu from here on out but it might be the epilogue for me for now

"if wbd would let james gunn do whatever he wants with their dc cinematic universe or at least let him make his version of superman

as a marvel movie it felt so good to have another one that didnt talk down to you it was mature brutal and made it all the more real the movie looked like a movie and had incredible visuals and a great villain to hate what an incredible face reveal bravo shoutout rocket",2023-05-05

ive never wanted to see a villain get their  rocked quite like the high evolutionary,2023-05-05
james gunn could make a  good doom movie if he was so inclined to those biomechanical henchmen and the ways they were executed by the guardians in that hallway scene reminded me of some doom enemies obviously  be busy with dc for likely many years to come but damnit he’d crush a proper doom adaptation,2023-05-05
"we’ll all fly away together one last time… into the forever and beautiful sky

never had a mcu movie be so emotionally resonant with me before i’m surprised none of the guardians died but i’m glad they didn’t as an audience member i felt that everyone deserved the happy ending and it was nice to have purely happy tears for the florence and the machine dance sequence at the end after so many despair tears over the course of the movie 

if there’s a criticism i have to make it’s adam warlock it just didn’t really feel like james gunn knew what he wanted to do with him kind of felt like the idea he had for him changed between guardians 2 and 3 also it felt weird to have the “the legendary starlord will return” card after what felt like a tight narrative conclusion for the character i love starlord so i’m excited to see what kind of role he has for the future it’s just hard to see what kind of story he has to come back to the new avengers movies seem like the obvious answer but still i’m just wondering why they would need to include him",2023-05-05
"well this was really good worthy follow up to the last two guardians films and the best mcu anything since endgame rather easily mostly because it has so much more heart than anything else in this universe

they really let gunn loose with this camera movements were a bit much for me at times though it was a hard pg13 too with some really grotesque stuff i feel like some parents will be a little surprised might be a bit much for some kids who saw the other movies the scenes with animal cruelty were especially difficult to watch and really emotionally effecting 

overall though it really was a great conclusion to all character arcs i kinda loved it",2023-05-05

a top 5 marvel movie for me genuinely heartfelt and fantastic ending teared up a couple times can’t say how long it’s been since that’s happened in a theater,2023-05-05
no context spoilers,2023-05-05
cosmo is such a good boy,2023-05-05
"“you weren’t born to be a destroyer you were born to be a dad”

as it this movie wasn’t already an emotional roller coaster excellent stuff i think the only mcu trilogy that tops guardians is spidey",2023-05-05
i love you guys,2023-05-05
loved it so much my new fav mcu trilogy,2023-05-05
"you can feel the movie was a singular vision unbridled by the wider mcu or the “marvel look” this was a damned handsome movie that had its own story to tell i loved the fact that it didn’t even try to hook audiences into the main ongoing mcu story if even one exists at the moment

i appreciate that marcel let gunn finish his trilogy exactly how he wanted to in every way which means gunn fans get more of what they want and detractors getting more of what they loathe",2023-05-05
soo good,2023-05-05
"good lord this movie was dark 
dont get me wrong it loved it and the soundtrack was killer but  my son 15 cried more at this then infinity war this is actually the first mcu movie that id recommend actually waiting to take a kiddo to until they are at least 1415 actually warned a few adults off it as well with all the very triggering trauma scenes 
that being said this was a fantastic finale to this version of the guardians",2023-05-05
enjoyes the movie a fitting ending closing all the arcs of the grouop  the trilogy is pretty consistent and delivers its own brand of space adventure,2023-05-05
can anyone spoil for me what powers cinematic warlock has is he just some flying strong  or does he actually have his magical powers,2023-05-05
i’m hoping someone from the james gunn tree gets to direct the eventual starlord movie someone who he would trust to continue the story,2023-05-05
great movie with such an emotional rollercoaster was not expecting it to have me in tears yet here i am,2023-05-05
sorry im sure this is a dumb question but when rocket sees raccoon on the cage of other baby raccoons were we ever told what rocket thought he was like did he think he was human trapped in a raccoon body i know he always said im not a raccoon but im just curious if i forgot him saying what he thought he was,2023-05-05
where did lylla get her name i think i missed it,2023-05-06
the sky,2023-05-06
well really got some made in abyss vibes from this one,2023-05-06
"watched it with the family last night we all absolutely loved it 

overall they played it safe but wow what a movie great way to end it and i must admit i’m sad knowing that’s it

guardians for me personally are my favourite of everything that has come from marvel their is simply nothing like it",2023-05-06
glad that gunn gave mcu quality a needed course correction also bummed this’ll probably be his last marvel project while i thought quantumania was fine the glaring differences in quality are on display as trilogy cappers first movie since no way home that i am going to see twice in theaters,2023-05-06
ok i was admittedly setting my expectations low but oh my  that was easily the best movie since endgame imho might be my favourite mcu movie,2023-05-06
i dont know if id say this was my favorite mcu movie but it was definitely one of the best  i cried way more than i ever expected  gave my cat a big squeeze when i got home too  when lylla put her hand on rocket and said not yeti could see that line coming but it still hit me so hard  the storytelling in this one was phenomenal,2023-05-06
well there were definitely certain scenes that gave me an idea of the type of tone gunn wants to encapsulate in superman plus he does what he always does by showing how each character is useful in their own ways making me even more excited than i already was for his plans with the creature commandos dc is in great hands,2023-05-06
the high evolutionary was portrayed so well i really hated him lol,2023-05-06
i cried,2023-05-06
"expected this movie to break my heart

instead it strengthened it",2023-05-06
james gunn made me emotional and crying over cybernetically enhanced animal deaths… i feel good about his superman movie for someone who embraces the whacky and odd he writes fully fleshed characters you care about and he doesn’t cheat them or take shortcuts,2023-05-06
this movie reminded me why i fell in love with the mcu and superhero films in general after seeing sam raimis spiderman a great villain great characters amazing action some well placed humor and a whole lot of heart hope disney learns from this and stops pumping out mediocre films for profit,2023-05-06
i was on the verge of tears the entire back half of the movie what a beautiful sendoff to a really weird and fun part of the mcu,2023-05-06
 ive actually enjoyed all modern mcu projects but it was really nice to have a film that was just a film and not part of a bigger cinematic universe,2023-05-06
for going in almost completely blind guardians 3 blew me away humor that consistently landed violence and imaginative creatures that really pushed the pg 13 rating well crafted fight scenes intriguing character development for 6 characters at once a captivating villain who you actually hate and emotional moments that really hit and werent undermined by one liners and quips very well done imo and should be viewed as a good scifi movie just as much as it will be viewed as a good super hero movie,2023-05-06
drax loved the  out of that couch,2023-05-06
the first shot with creep helped setup the tone of the movie so well,2023-05-06
and that is why you let james gunn direct emotional intensity brutal violence and hilarious humor my favorite mcu film in recent memory there are some plot points i can get upset about the dude was a  but to take him down rocket just shot him but overall i enjoyed this movie very much,2023-05-06
what an amazing trilogy crazy how they just kept getting better or at least on par with the previous entry dc will be  in good hands with gunn at the wheel,2023-05-06
can someone tell me what song is playing when they’re in the spacesuits flying to the ergo planet,2023-05-06
i find it interesting this movie tells the origin of rocket raccoon,2023-05-06
so does michael york just stand outside james gunns house until he puts him in a movie,2023-05-06
rockets and peters screams were so powerful ugh i literally wanted to scream with them,2023-05-06
after endgame and after all those rushed mid movies marvel has been doing i wasn’t expecting anything really good this was amazing though rockets backstory is so sad,2023-05-06
"minor but i love the details on the ship how the thrusters flip forward to slow down i would like to say thats the expanse influence onto scifi shows in space  

loved the movie im not crying youre crying",2023-05-06

edit they were so excited about what was to come  so innocent and cute this one is going to stick",2023-05-06

star lord solo movie coming,2023-05-06
can someone explain how rocket broke free of the evolutioners grip before the guardians start beating him up he just suddenly was free i didnt get that part,2023-05-06
"can someone remind me of a line the high evolutionary said id like to get it verbatim

it was something to the affect  doesnt exist so i have to it was towards the end when his crew were attempting to munity",2023-05-06
i really enjoyed it cried so many times especially when the dog rays are over started playing and then they played come and get your love and yeah you could say i was bawling so fricking hard i love that the villan isnt some random dude thats wanna destroy the universe or whatever and i could actually hate him because of his connections to rocket the humor was very good and the gamora and quill situation was done really well i really enjoyed it its still hurts not to see them together but i understand that this is what they both need  with gamora finding her own path and peter finally moving on yeah overall i think its definetly a good and solid ending to the series with everyones characters being so beautifully summaried and ended it felt like old mcu movies ,2023-05-06
 the visuals were gorgeous in this movie hats off to gunn and the teams that worked on the cgi,2023-05-06
beautiful movie  had a lot of fun best marvel movie in a while,2023-05-06
"spoiler 

what is floor screaming when lylla dies all i heard was “rocket” i couldn’t understand c",2023-05-06
"im not sure what the end credits meant when they said starlord would return if he does return he certainly wont be played by chris pratt and a lot of the other main actors have said they are done with the franchise

all i can think of is disney will try to reboot starlord in a new movie and  it up",2023-05-06
the story characterization action and human really worked in this film the crowd i saw it with were laughing at all the jokes and the emotional moments hit,2023-05-06
that was awesome sad asf too though but awesome groot got stacked i hope rocket returns as well as star lord,2023-05-06
glad to see chris trott getting back into acting with teefs,2023-05-06
this was an awesome movie action scenes were great made me laugh and cry a lot as well,2023-05-06
wow,2023-05-06
when nebula said rocket got it worse than her,2023-05-06
the floor teefs lylla and rocket relationshipit was clear from the beginning that it was not going to end well for them but their story made me as emotional as i have not been in quite some time bonding in that horrific environment just for it to end like that just hurts,2023-05-06
wait what was the villain’s name again anyway yeah that villain guy pushed the limits of pg 13 but it was pretty interesting that the weird design of his covered up face actually meant something and it wasn’t just some goofy feature of them being an alien human thing,2023-05-06
kevin bacon is such a snitch,2023-05-06
incredible was in tears but a great way to end it,2023-05-06
what a great movie had me in tears,2023-05-06
what does rocket say at the end of the midcredit scene when theyre about to face off against the horde i couldnt quite make it out and its been bugging me,2023-05-06
end it with come and get your love is just beautiful,2023-05-06
loved that quill immediately made it his singular goal to make sure rocket lives good redemption from his arc in the avengers,2023-05-06
"the animations on rocket and his friends were amazing i definitely teared up during pretty much all their scenes together


im also surprised how much blood and bodily harm was in this i dont remember any mcu movie having consequences from being battle injuries high evolutionarys last scene was straight horror",2023-05-06
"drax the dad

oh my 

i did not expect to cry in a marvel movie like that  like the end of endgame and infinity war were sad but not really cry inducing for me  but holy   this  i guess animal cruelty even in cgi hits something different

edit aunt mays death up there too",2023-05-06
im gonna need a floor plushie to squeeze forever,2023-05-06
holy  man those scenes with rocket and his friends ripped at my heartsuper emotional scenes man,2023-05-06

im sitting here waiting for the post credits scenei wonder what will happen next",2023-05-06
ryan reynolds is probably so  he won’t be the first person to say “ the mcu,2023-05-06

warms my little sicko heart",2023-05-06
i haven’t seen the movie but from what i heard this movie is incredibly sad is that true,2023-05-06
i can’t… this can’t be it  i can’t believe the guardians are over guardians has and will always be the best part of the marvel cinematic universe,2023-05-06

"what an excellent way to wrap up the trilogy

man i love what gunn did with these characters  gives me a lot of hope for dc",2023-05-06
and just like that this movie jumps into my top 3 with infinity war and bpwf need to buy the hasbro figures now too,2023-05-06
its a really lovely movie wholesome lot of heart with the weirdness that youd expect from a james gunn movie the weird visuals and humor might not be for everyone but i think if you know what to expect youll love this movie the soundtrack was a banger the visuals were great too great to see legitimately good marvel cgi again finally and the camera work and action set pieces were some of the best ive seen in recent memory overall a great sendoff,2023-05-06
i made a really big mistake when watching this movie i forgot to bring tissues  there were so many just emotional moments rocket and his friends especially ,2023-05-07
"the two most heartbreaking parts in this movie for me that breaks my heart is rockets first word hurts little baby rocket was so scared and in pain he didnt deserve that  the second thing is lyllas death and then rockets anguished cry of pain that broke me im glad we get a happy ending for this its an emotional happy ending at that its the end of the james gunn guardians era now my review of it

ive seen it twice now and its a 910 for me i wish we saw more of adam warlock he was good with what we have of him i found him to be pretty funny but overall he was meh to me and i feel like we deserve a little bit of a backstory with nebula like shes an adopted daughter of thanos too where did she come from we literally have nothing of her backstory but maybe this movie was too overstuffed to give her a backstory too i didnt need it but i kinda want it everything else is a 1010 if it wasnt for those two things this movie would be a 1010 but no movie is perfect not even endgame loved this movie too we now have the perfect trilogy of guardians movies  rockets backstory tho  rockets first word spoken is hurts oh man that gets me everytime and then his anguished cry as he sees lylla die in front of him  literal pain little rocket didnt deserve that  another thing that i was hoping would happen is rocket meeting groot for the first time that kinda sucks i wanted to see that also who remembers this scene from infinity war thor i assume youre the captain sir rocket youre very perceptive thor you seem like a noble leader will you join me on my quest to nidavellir rocket oh yeah just let me just ask the captain oh wait a second its me yeah ill go they predicted rockets ending for guardians 3 not ready to say goodbye to these guardians tho im gonna miss them also that one long shot hallway fight scene with no sleep till brooklyn playing was fire asffffffff",2023-05-07
which classical music is high evolutionary playing while he explains the meaning of it,2023-05-07
"such a great conclusion to a trilogy probably the darkest mcu movie but definitely worth it 

i wouldve loved to see a drax and mantis spinoff but i guess the christmas special was the best well ever get from the two of them",2023-05-07
so refreshing thats what a good marvel movie is supposed to feel like    hope they can find their way,2023-05-07
"i haven’t felt this happy with and mcu project in a very long time it’s a genuine work of art and radiating gunn’s signature style

not super invested in any of the announced content so it might be last marvel film i see at least for a while what a way to go out though",2023-05-07
golden harry styles looking ahh,2023-05-07
lylla ,2023-05-07
so that was way more wholesome and not fatal than i was expecting great villain great introduction of warlock i guess bradley cooper will be around for a while was that him doing rocket’s younger voice i couldn’t always understand what he was saying but he nailed the big scenes,2023-05-07
first of all i freaking love their playlist in this movie the music selection for guardian of galaxy has always been on point plus the great story arc for everyone in the movie and humor were on points so far definitely the best movie from mcu since infinity war,2023-05-07
"i didn’t cry 


but i’ve never had a marvel movie get me as close as often as this movie did",2023-05-07

"my gfs dog passed a couple weeks ago she had had him for 15 years they had an incredibly special bond you can pretty much imagine the amount of years in this movie i think that emotional impact and gravity adds a ton to this movie and makes me actually care about the stakes their relationships and their personal journeys

“this was your story all along” for some reason really got to me i’ve been a person who has lifelong feeling of being a creep or freak i’ve always felt the character resonate with me pretty strongly and i really enjoyed his story and i’m a huge fan of what gunn plans to do with dc and their characters 

910 for me",2023-05-07
the no sleep till brooklyn scene did not have to go that hard one of the best mcu action scenes by far,2023-05-07
"this movie is so heart wrenching like got me teary eyed for so long

i dont know how they did it but they successfully pulled off how much the guardians love and care for each other

it was so palpable i got goosebumps tears and strange sense of longing for a friendship ive only seen as an audience",2023-05-07
"just got out of the cinema

i know its been said a lot but one of the best mcu films in a long long time 

really like that gunn is able to push the envelope a tiny bit further in terms of maturity 

also liked the robocop reference brought back memories of seeing robocops weird bald face after he took off his helmet",2023-05-07
i cried through the whole thing bc of rocket’s backstory ,2023-05-07
him saying im not a racoon the whole time was his internalized self hatred because he grew up being told he was not enough and when he saw the racoons and how adorable they were and how much they were worth saving and saw that they were called racoons he could finally call himself a raccoon he could finally care for himself the problem was not that they were inferior the problem was that the bad guy saw them as different,2023-05-07
"this was such a good movie after a run of not so good

high evolutionary was a fantastic villain",2023-05-07

during the afterlife vision there was some people getting emotional when they saw lyla but i started tearing up when i saw teefs and floor,2023-05-07
when rocket said hes done running and watch straight into the fight the gotg had zero hesitation and went with him immediately such a strong scene just like how the suicide squad decided they gonna do the dumb decision because they know its right gunn probably mastered the art of doing this theme,2023-05-07

rockets friends are like toy story but  up,2023-05-08
"everyone got to understand what groot was saying at the end 

i am groot i love you guys",2023-05-08
i do wish we had gotten to see peter and mantis as siblings here the reveal in the holiday special so good and heartwarming but here other than just mentioning the fact they still felt like colleaguesteam members then siblings it almost makes the reveal feel like an afterthought and just forced line inclusion in this film but overall i did enjoy this film a lot my heart breaking from the animal torture aside,2023-05-08
"i’m so freaking impressed right now what a great way to wrap this series up i was fully prepared to have my heart ripped out by this movie and it ended up being one of marvels best “feel good” movies

but i guess it makes a lot of sense after all the pain and loss every character was given closure to their stories best marvel movie since nwh",2023-05-08
great movie really rekindled my love for the mcu i think it’s hilarious that rocket refused to execute the high evolutionary and instead left him to die on his exploding ship wouldn’t shooting him the head have been the merciful thing,2023-05-08
them dressing up in different t colored space suits had to be a nod to the beatles or lsd,2023-05-09

"the guardians are certainly quite a diff breed than the usual heroes   
ive never heard a hero say  them all before   
and quill was saying that to groot who later saves adam since everyone deserves a 2nd chance  
im not complaining i actually never cottoned on the turn the other cheek philosophy  


also rocket is also from earth which could explain his affinity for the music even if he didnt know why guardians 2  


i agree the best mcu movie since endgame   
with gunn now coceo of dc this might turn it the other way now dc qualitywise over mcu   
maybe the studio execs shd back off dictating over the creatives",2023-05-14
guardianofthegalaxyvol3 was a great 3rd film and a fine addition to the trilogy the guardian films continue to be my favourite part of the  mcu and it will be interesting to see where they go in the future definitely had me tearing up at some of the emotional moments all the cast got there moments to shine and i think they all got endings that were fitting but left them open to return should they ever want to chukwudi iwuji was great as high evolutionary from his first introduction you just knew he would be easy to hate and he so was maria bakalova was great again as cosmo and i look forward to her turning up again the use of music was great as always and gunn certainly knows how to use it and weave it into his stories,2023-05-14

"man this movie really tugged at my heart strings i was not expecting so much hopelessness in the beginning  from quills drinking to gamora being dead to the team and of course rockets entire situation the scene of rocket and his friends choosing their names was just so beautiful too 

however seeing everyone have a happy ending in the end was amazing seeing nebula actually show emotion by singing and dancing i loved it all so much

definitely one of marvels strongest and it gives me hope for the future",2023-05-15

please tell me is there anyone else who also noticed in the scene with small rocket when he explained why the animals are angry after the transformation that a music similar to the theme song of doctor house started playing it totally felt like doctor house and i dont know if it was intentional or just random but it felt really cool to me,2023-05-22

"this is probably the most emotional movie in the series all while no one dies comicbook movies are often low stakes with emotional scenes not feeling authentic all flash 

there are some great marvel movies but this is one of the few marvel movies where i felt proper emotion i legitimately felt sad for peter accepting that for all intents purposes the gamora he knew is dead an entire life of abuse for rocket and how drax mantis and nebulas sad pasts are constantly pushing then to soul search its filled with themes like accepting reality facing trauma and moving on

all that plus realizing that this is an end of an era for possibly the best trilogy within the mcu impacted me far more than any reversible character death combined with nostalgic music like dog days are over and realizing that this was a trilogy that began over a decade ago i never expected a comicbook movie to hit this hard",2023-06-04
was it just me or did layla laiyla the ferretweasel have her voice morph a bit when she was in the light at the end of the tunnel scene she sounded different when she was talking about ,2023-06-05
honestly the movie couldn’t make me care about the other animal tests dying they did a great job with introducing them tho first time seeing the rabbit was horrifying,2023-06-06
the one shot hallway sequence was so perfectly executed,2023-07-07
teared up gotg was always my favourite of the mcu and this send off was always going to be hard but i honestly feel that gunn gave everyone an opportunity to stand on their own and be true to their characters self rocket  nebula were undoubtedly mvp of the movie,2023-07-07

did anyone else find quill super rapey it was weird how much he put on new gamora imo,2023-07-23
i didnt know what the movie was about other then ppl saying its emotional  didnt know it was rockets origins movie  and thats the issue it needed to be rockets movie which would then set up guardians vol 3 and then that couldve had a righteous ending  so yeah i dont think it was the right story for the last movie  the acting and production values were top notch of course good humor as well  what they couldve done is what makes the whole thing sad,2023-07-30
im super nervous they would  since the last few movies have been not very good but they stuck the landing perfectly super excited to see james gunn dcu,2023-08-02
am i the only one that cried or was it just the songs,2023-08-07
"3 months late

watched it twice on disney great movie",2023-08-09
this movie rocks it’s even better on a rewatch,2023-08-12
ok so the question at the end favorite musical acts arent there tons and tons of other planets with life on it whyd they only choose earth artists are we supposed to believe earth is the only place with music or good music i understand the audience wouldnt know non earth artists its just weird to me that the writers dont think of those things kraglin says the man garth brooks like theyre all supposed to know,2023-08-12
star lord no rocket boots or helmet was a little silly hes my fav mcu character and that like superman without his cape or spiderman without webs lol,2023-08-12
i just watched it so i’m still reflecting man i love rocket more than ever nebula was great kraglin was great too didn’t like puffy groot and i guess i never thought mantis should’ve been a mainstay just my opinions,2023-08-13
"gotg never disappoints such a good cinema i hope they do a sequel to video game too it was as good as the movies

the villain in this one was really good too both the writing and acting 1010 deserves special mention",2023-08-18
good film just like to know wheres the rock reference they did dont move or the bunny gets it from con air they take off the villains face from face off 2 nic cage films from the trinity the missing one is the rock,2023-08-18
"rocket teeths floor go now


thats all its been a few months but i just i justed wanted to remind everyone of that",2023-08-29
when i tell you i cried i did its probably childish but guardians is and will forever be the best marvel group to me sad to see it end but im glad they all got closure i will still watch all three movies every year,2023-09-02
"this was a weird one the only characters i actually cared about were the group of test animals i kind of expected rocket to have to sacrifice himself and then some emotional scene where hes back with them but what we got was a bit meh

ive watched most marvel films i dont remember them finding gamora or knowing she was alive they hammered home that she wasnt the same gamora to the point where maybe the film wouldve been better if her character wasnt in it i also do not remember the russian dog and the guy with the floating dagger thing i felt like they expected me to know them and i felt like id not done my mcu homework as for adam warlock he was just kind of there i kept waiting for him to become a more important character and properly team up with the guardians but it didnt really come i dont feel like the film wouldve suffered much if his character wasnt in it 

some of the monsters were a bit grotesque and creepy but i guess thats what it was going for there was also some that were kind of bad lookingthere was something a bit doctor who about them for me especially on counter earth which took me out of the film a bit the villain was decent but i kind of felt like he couldve been more he was ultimately easily defeated in the end he was a standard marvel villain

the ending was kind of meh their reasons for leaving the group felt a little contrived i think i was expecting a character to die or something so ultimately the final act felt a bit standard marvel when it couldve been something a little bit better this is one of the better recent marvel films though",2023-09-02
"horrible movie 

its a  goofy movie lets put some hardcore animal torture in it 

what the  is that  this movie",2023-09-06
why would you disband the gotg when there’s barely any likable characters left in the mcu dumb as ,2023-10-01
i gotta say i was really impressed with this movie with how alot of mcu is nowadays i expected lazy writing it really seems to me that spiderman and gotg are the two big stories of modern mcu,2023-10-23
loved it i adore the first movie and this isn’t too far off from it perfect send off for every single one of these characters it takes a lot for me to cry during a movie and i cried at least 34 times,2023-11-17
"just gotta say loved the movie chukuwudi absolutely killed it backed by a solid script knowheres worldbuilding blew my mind the written languages side characters fictional brands and all those other details made the gotg universe pop you could tell that they put a lot of love and dedication into it areta and orgocorp were a joy to explore as well

on the other hand counterearth was disappointing the high evolutionarys choice to go model it after mid 20thcentury us felt odd considering the advanced tech he possesses and his taste in music i expected a sleek utopian design or at least something similar to his ship maybe its just me though",2023-11-17
"“it’s not his face  it’s a mask”

rocket didn’t need to  him  he was already reduced to the disgusting pathetic wretch that he was",2023-12-06
did anyone catch that rocket and floor were cuddling before he came crashing in ,2024-02-14
i think it’s also worth noting that the third assistant of he seemed to have such a better moral compass than he’s not that she was better as a person but just lesser evil i guess even during the scene when rocket solves the violent problem she finishes his sentence in awe instead of feeling threatened like he did she was also opposing him in many ways then the ending when she finally gathers the courage to go against him and sadly dying,2024-02-14
also i’m cracking up because when gamora is fighting adam on counterearth the ship is definitely getting tossed around with rocket not secured on the medical bed they had but i like to think the little pet was holding him down ,2024-02-14
they nailed closing everyone’s arcs and none of it felt shoehorned,2023-05-05
i think we may all have been expecting him to die since this was bastista’s last role but perhaps marvel left the door open just in case,2023-05-07
i kind of wish they said drax the protector but they probably wanted to keep the alliteration going but one common thread of these characters is loyalty to each other similar to the animals living in cages,2023-05-07
when he started dancing i was so  happy,2023-05-08
especilalyy with how his big speech in the first movie was about how there were two types of people those who danced and those who didnt  he insisted that he was the type who didnt dance  his final scene of gotg 3 is him dancing for the first time,2023-05-20
is that supposed to be a monkey,2023-05-06
it felt to me like the flanderization was getting a bit much for drax even before this movie and it definitely hit its peak here but i did love how they confronted it by having mantis defend him from nebula and showed draxs true value as one of the guardians that drax the dad line was just the perfect way to encapsulate who he is now after thanos died,2023-07-11
idky mant couldnt stay,2023-05-07
,2023-05-08
drax the destroyer of bad mood,2023-05-15
"and he danced

gotg 2 had a whole thing with drax and dancing",2023-05-21
"in the hindi dub mfs said   
drax the daddy the whole theater was laughing ",2023-06-05
i thought this was the most idiotic line of the whole film lmaoo,2023-05-20
the movie was terrible  after thor love and thunder i thought that was the greatest let down of the mcu but nope this was such a great cast and they came out with that  the rocket backstory was depressing and not that intriguing  gotg movies have always been max entertainment and jocular the introduction of animal cruelty cast an unwelcome feeling unto the movie and ruined it ive a lot more to say about it but the one other aspect that was awful was the ending with groot cheesey and unnecessary,2023-05-26
i found myself laughing loudly during spoiler the scene where the otter was shot dead complete silence in the theater 910 jokes were a miss for me the buildup to the death of all the animals was just a culmination of how bad of a movie this was also found myself laughing at the animals in heaven scene at just how silly they made the animals look and the buildup main character early on in the movie is all about “hey no killing that’s not who we are” then proceeds to  everything including the headset guy in the water how the hero’s have fallen pacing was super slow ending scene was painful to watch the forced interactions and dancing scenes,2023-05-12
the he mocking rockets wailing was  cold thats when i needed him to die in the third act,2023-05-05
i liked his men turning on him not just being mindless goons  though they should shot before he turned around lol,2023-05-06
i did some research and i think why he did so well was because he used to do shakespeare he was in julius ceaser the merry wives of windsor king lear coriolanus and antony  cleopatra honestly im not surprised because he gave the high evolutionary such an air of grace and evilness,2023-05-08
also dude has a vision and he stick to it despicable as  but you completely understand his motivation and obsession,2023-05-06
"i was watching some reviews before watching the movie i know i sinned and most of them didnt like him  coming out of the movie i thought he was a fantastic one shot villain  he played moments where he was human like when he was proud of rocket for being intelligent and detestable really well

also a side note i really liked how the ship turned on him that was new for mcu iirc",2023-05-08
agreed he actually seemed unhinged and insane compared to most other marvel villains who are typically just major assholes,2023-05-08
to be fair non of the big villians in recent mcu movies are jokey or use quips wenwu green goblin wanda namor and kang were all pretty  serious and terrifying at points,2023-05-06
oh my  the way he mocked rockets crying to his frantic sprawl is some serious next level acting,2023-05-09
the actor did a phenomenal job i’ve never hated a villain so much,2023-05-08
yes  i thought he might be too similar to kang in antman they are similar types of character but the high evolutionary had a very different demeanour he seemed to be trying very hard to appear always the aloof “godlike” leader singularly focused on his “noble goal” but he constantly loses his temper and his composure exposing himself as just a petty petulant and cruel man,2023-05-08
he was perfect managed to hit pitch perfect reads of the most ridiculous lines and never let me stop hating him for a fraction of a second his commitment was godlike,2023-05-09
"yep as gamora noted

he wipes our entire species and civilizationseven thanos wasnt that nuts he would leave half of you alive",2023-05-09
 disgusting person even thanos wasn’t that depraved,2023-05-09
that  line gave me chills he played his role amazing made me wish he was kang,2023-05-09
he’s such a perfect foil to everything the guardians represent he wants complete uniform perfection the guardians welcome all strays and outcasts flaws and scars and all,2023-05-13
oh my gosh yes i wanted him to suffer the entire time i was watching the character not the actor he was amazingly written and well acted i especially liked when quill was like yeah we dont need to hear your backstory because we didnt need to he was a terrible person with philosophical motives who went nuts because someone was smarter than him honestly after watching i wondered why they didnt have gunn take over for antman  the wasp i feel like he would have done a better job with kang overall like yeah kang was kind of scary but the high evolutionary was straight up terrifying maybe its because he didnt have a cookie cutter goal of take over everything ever,2023-05-09
he’s not that big of a  in the comics but the mcu and the comics are two different things so it works casually blowing up counterearth is a great way to establish “this high evolutionary is a monster worse than anything the guardians have faced before” ,2023-05-09
from side character in peacemaker to toplevel villus iwuji really stepped up,2023-05-10
they need that type of quality acting when they cast doom,2023-05-08
"i agree absolutely loved him as a villain genuinely wanted to see severe pain inflicted upon him cant remember the last time i actually invested in disliking a villain 

and its nice that for once its just a villain a hissable detestable bad guy who kills cute animals instead of a tragic back story or reasoned monster or sympathetic",2023-05-09
for real his intensity was so insane watched antman other day and this guy killed being a villain the writing im sure helps but good lord the guy was brutal dont wanna spoil,2023-05-08
seriously he was amazing,2023-05-08
i just wish he was a little bit more powerful,2023-05-08
i liked his portrayal but i expected some more cosmic dude he gets his  rocked by a racoon hes just some mad scientist not a bbeg going by the caliber of the previous guardians villains,2023-05-09
" there is no  thats why i stepped up

and im like he doesnt know much about universe",2023-05-15
i totally forgot peacemaker was dc for a bit and was like is that murn,2023-05-11
he felt very…shakespearean esp with the mutiny gave some serious julius caesar vibes i think that’s the best way to put it i absolutely loved his performance,2023-05-11
he got stabbed repeatedly got his face ripped off and was left in an exploding ship,2023-05-11
he feels powerful and he is vile he is the best marvel villain in ages,2023-05-14
just saw it this week and this was one of the few villains in a comic movie that i truly hated with all my heart because of the animal treatment,2023-05-15
"and best of all the story wasn’t ever about him i even kind of wanted peter or rocket to cut him off when ranting at the end and yell “it’s not about you ” and then just  him or leave him to die in a way that’s kind of what they did i just would have liked the meta commentary that not every comic book movie needs to be about the villain villains don’t always deserve sympathy high evolutionary being the best example 

but absolutely i loved him he was so  intense i’ve missed that in other villains they’re always full of themselves but in the vain needy way this dude gave no  he was absolutely singleminded and focused on his own goal",2023-05-10
i cant ever remember feeling visceral hatred for an mcu villain before iwuji was brilliant,2023-05-10
"his performance made my skin crawl it was like watching a skinwalker or something

best villain in the mcu tbh purely for his acting and direction",2023-05-21
the way james gunn wrote him to show that rocket being special and getting away drive him madder and madder to the point his other creations revolted against him was brilliant tbh i didn’t think gunn was that great at villains but this is micheal keaton as vulture levels of great villians,2023-05-23
he was fantastic,2023-05-12
just catching up and seeing it  piggy backing here but this was my thought exactly that he was a perfect villain given that his pursuits were so clear and laid out but also so fundamentally detestable so so good,2023-05-28
"i was thinking exactly this dude seemed downright frightening and very powerful lots of gravitas 

guy killed it",2023-05-26
"high evolutionary

reminded me of the bad guy from the firefly movie",2023-05-10
he was such a shrieking psychotic mess it made for a very scary and thus effective villain i think it helps that everyone around him seems so helpless which i guess they were all of rockets origin scenes had me on edge and almost in tears had to be the most satisfying  whooping of any marvel villain so far,2023-06-11
this actor played it just right when a lesser actor would’ve eddie redmaynedit and played it horribly chefs kiss,2023-05-11
"more i think about it high evolutionary is by far one of the best mcu villains

you mean besides the terrible plan of getting his ship destroyed mutineied crew and incredibly weak fight finale

very well acted though",2023-05-11
jeah but he had no development i still wonder what his story is i didnt understand his motivation why the animals wh earth why  everyone why anything,2023-05-11
a classic villain yes— but no the best villains have a bit of give and take in them,2023-05-14
and not a single bit of sympathetic story that threw me off so badly with kang i want a big bad who is a big bad not just a misguided baddie,2023-05-10
high evolutionary was how kangs character should’ve been portrayed in quantumania…but seeing as that was only a variant of him im hoping they get it right in his next appearance,2023-08-06
i thought he was great and really liked the concept which made me think about how we think of the  in the bible creates us to please his own ego then when we don’t turn out exactly as he wants casts us aside yet his creations still love him,2023-08-05
eh it was cartoonish and lacking in nuance,2023-05-09
"no one holds a candle to thanos 

high e is also supposed to be so much more badass than he was his personality flaws in regards to rocket drove me nuts considering he could have just re created his experiments with rocket on another racoon at any time",2023-08-12
she looked so happy to go back to her ravagers family too it even felt like stallones adopted kid and how proud he was of her when he saw her again,2023-05-05
open the  door,2023-05-08
i like that they addressed it  quill would naturally have a problem accepting she doesnt have feelings for him and gamora would have a problem being treated like shes someone else  having this conflict resolved the way they did felt organic and allowed the characters to grow,2023-05-06
dog days are over has been stuck in my head since watching and i regret nothing also yeah honor of first full mcu fbomb goes to peter quill and i think thats beautiful,2023-05-09
i ignore trailers if i know i’m going to watch it makes it better but harder to avoid ads everywhere,2023-05-07
100 i’m done watching trailers the films are so much better if you go in blind,2023-05-07
"i definitely had some happy and sad tears and honestly for movies i’m pumped about i don’t watch trailers doing the same for the new zelda game i’d rather experience it fresh as i’m immersed 

glad you loved guardians 3 so did i ",2023-05-07
yup it was nice to see that ravagers were in fact her gaurdiansreferring back to when peter said to her that gaurdians is her family not ravagers,2023-05-08
they really broadcasted that this will be the last of the trilogy and definitely milked our fear of someone dying several times during the film but it was effective i really thought any moment could be the last for any of the main characters,2023-05-10
"yeah with the exception of antman 3 most of the marvel movies lately have been really dreary or at least were chill until a sudden bittersweet ending

i’m glad this movie avoided that despite having all the set up to axe half the cast",2023-05-08
"i stayed away from anything referencing the music too and every song just hit me plus the closing song is one that really has gotten me thru some rough times and then again with the family during covid 

i was weepy but my daughter was in tears happy steong joyful tears",2023-05-08
breakup plots in media like this never feel too nice even if theyre well written but the whole this is 2014 gamora og is still dead as  stuff helped it a ton,2023-05-08
i would say kindled is exactly what it was there’s a spark between them now that could develop whereas before gamora wouldn’t even consider the notion that they’d work well together,2023-05-08
yah bro first f bomb mcu and it’s to chris pratt here for it,2023-05-08
tbh they needed that ending i was crying through half the f’ing thing ,2023-05-15
it’s weird cuz while i agree with the end being happy i’ve never bawled through an mcu movie like straight up bawled tbf was going through a tough time and i went to see the movie specifically cuz i needed to feel happy then the movie started just that intro scene alone sheesh,2023-05-19
i hopethink theyre saving to reunite peter and gamora for next movie akin to gotg1 and 2 at first i was disappointed they didnt but when it said peter will return i thought alright maybe thats wgat theyre doing thinking after gamora spent time working with the guardians in this movie and starts to unlock her emotions and let down guard and she goes bavk to ravagers shell realize shes not as happy realize what real family is,2023-05-09
i would hope this is not truly a farewell to the guardians and that we see these characters again in other marvel projects,2023-05-11
but original gamora was replaced by a version of herself she would not have liked that broke her old relationships its happy for this new gamora not the actual gamora if that makes sense keep seeing this pop up this is not our gamoras ending not really happy to me sorry still great movie just not uplifting to me,2023-05-16
after trailers i though someone will definitely die but nope everything good i even like new team wouldnt mind watchign some short spinoff about them,2023-05-15
"well i think if xmen first class folds into the mcu it would be the 2nd 
but i dont know if it does or not",2023-05-08
i would have preferred a little more something from gamora thoughi felt like there was still something missing didnt need her and quil to get back together though,2023-07-08
has vin diesel in it then it must be about family ,2023-09-02
stopping watching trailers was the best decision i ever made,2023-08-23
i think that there was an fbomb in either iron man 1or 2 i think it was 1 i will have to go back and rewatch,2023-08-12
"also first mcu fbomb i think lol

they used up their entire cursing budget on that one lol",2023-06-20
 she filled a hole in stars heart he was already drinking because of it soon as grandpa dies in a year or two hes gonna drink again they shouldve got back together,2023-05-12
" that they didn’t rekindle quill and gamora’s relationship 

uh what version did you see some roughcut bootleg

the version that played in my auditorium definitely sets up that just like the other gamora peters character loyal humorous noble when he needs to be and above all else goodhearted is starting to change this gamoras attitude towards life and him

thats the beauty of gunns writing here avoiding a neat  tidy reunion between them even though quill entirely deserves this happy ending but gunn isnt going to just hand it to him to me its an accomplished balancing act that comments on the nature of true love that quill and gamora really are made for each other but its not some distany that bonds them its that they have and are witness to shared experiences that make them respect admire  love each other 

gamora is retracing the steps of her own self to discover that she is capable of it while peter is learning to accept that this gamora is a totally different person that he needs to relate to as a unique individual 

its a shame that alan horn didnt have the backbone or sense to avoid firing james gunn marvel is going to suffer from not having gunn around to help the mcu succeed in the post cap  tony phases but i guess some will argue that dc needed him more",2023-05-07
the ending was actually the weakest part of the movie cant they for once end on a more sombre note was 100 expecting one of them to die also rocket not shooting the high evolutionary in the head at the end is just an eye roll,2023-05-12
lol i noticed her spinning out of control in the space suits outside the biolab… then she just kept on landing on her head,2023-05-05
bruh it killed me every time hahaha,2023-05-05
not as brutal as nebula getting her neck cracked like that holy ,2023-05-07
i legit thought she died when she hit her neck,2023-05-08
i think mantis arc was interesting everyone treats the guardians like theyre dumb but astrophysics is common sense to them literally so she had every right to be  when everyone well one person in particular kept getting mad for her not knowing this ,2023-05-13
"she landed on her head then rolled backwards every time and it never stopped being funny to me the fact that no one addressed it is what made it so funny 

man i gotta rewatch this",2023-05-17
taika waititi should take notes screaming goats as a recurring bit  gets old real quick,2023-05-09
i noticed that when mantis slid off the abilisk after she calmed them down she landed on her feet but nebula actually fell awkwardly funny little reverse,2023-06-11
i was thinking jeez not even wwe would let he take that many bumps to that head like that,2023-05-08
she broke her spine like 3 times bruh,2023-05-08
real life neck broken great running gag about how physics work,2023-05-07
shes like anticat,2023-05-15
i like the way she does it like a big she’s just curious and looking to see how she can move,2023-05-23
goodbye to all her cervical vertebrae lol,2023-05-24
for me the bit never landed,2023-05-07
they had a closer brother sister vibe than most of the team especially quill her defense of drax was great standing up to nebula showed how much she loved him,2023-05-05
he wanted to go with her to protect her but i would argue that now shes a serious force to be reckoned with having the three abilisks as pets,2023-05-06
im i the only one that thought mantis would make the squid monsters fall in love with drax,2023-05-06
he gained a few hundreds kids though,2023-05-08
yeah i hope they don’t spend too much time away,2023-05-08
i hope we still get to see the celestial madonna mantis in the future,2023-05-10
yeah i agree i think she shouldve stayed on nowhere and wouldve been glad to writing that she needs to discover her self is pointless when this is thr last movie coukdve just left her to enjoy her family,2023-05-09
the fact that cosmo was a fullblown supporting character and not just a throwaway gag was pretty hilarious,2023-05-05
i never got tired of the bad dog jokes the part about the russians sending her to space and whatnot but still never called her bad dog was great,2023-05-05
that whole bit got to me almost as much as rocket i was not emotionally prepared for this movie,2023-05-05
"maria bakalova was fantastic as the voice of cosmo i love seeing her get more roles after playing tutar in borat subsequent film one of my favorite rising actresses currently 

cosmo a good doggo and girlie indeed",2023-05-05
and a whole lot more powerful than i thought holy  holding a ship like that in place is a feat and a half,2023-05-06
she’s the best dog and kraglin is a big meanie,2023-05-06
as a fan of cosmo in the comics i was so glad she had a big part in the film and was able to show off her amazing abilities,2023-05-07
a very good dog,2023-05-06
cosmo is the best dog in the whole galaxy,2023-05-08
shame that there was not enough screentime where she was being petted,2023-05-08
maybe i’m just easy but i loved this recurring joke,2023-05-06
blocks on reveal though,2023-05-06
"also the most powerful dog in the universe

the dog manage to hold the high evolutionarys ship in place which was as big as knowhere",2023-05-25
the bestest doggo anyone can ever ask for,2023-05-08
voiced by borats daughter shes been killing it since borat2,2023-05-08
i just knew it was going to have that payoff but i dont care because it was so awesome thats really all dogs care about,2023-05-20
like that pay off was so obvious yet still hit so good,2023-05-08
 that was such a good  payoff maybe the best of the movie tbh,2023-05-21
im now considering getting longjohns a red fin thingarrow and a dog astronaut costume for me and my dog for halloween this year xd,2023-05-26
i know it’s not niki yang voicing cosmo but cosmo sounds a lot like bmo,2023-05-08
her voice was annoying tho,2023-05-24
that whole bioplace was a blorp and a half,2023-05-05
naw cause this scene absolutely  me up look once i saw these animals at the start i knew they were doomed but good  i didn’t think i’d hear the saddest most painful cry ever from rocket,2023-05-06
that bio station felt like something straight out of rick and morty,2023-05-06
this was the scene i came here to talk about i just saw it i can still hear that little bunny frantically yelling i cried a few times during that movie and it was very painful at moments they didnt have to go that hard but i respect the decisions made i liked the movie i thought it was good but i dont know if i can ever watch it again,2023-05-08
the whole thing made we feel uncomfortable to be honest i mean guardians was always weird but in a good way here i felt uncomfortable,2023-05-07
"spoilers ahead read at your own risk

this whole backstory disturbed me greatly i was emotional the minute the movie started when the hand came into the baby raccoon cage and they were cowering and hiding in fear rocket gets thrown into another cage after undergoing horrific tests the poor guy is scalped among other things he can only utter the words hurt in a sad and weakened voice then we’re introduced to his other animal friends who have endured pain torture and other ungodly body horrors the reveal of floor this sweet little white bunny was the hardest for me poor thing has a metal jaw for a mouth her cute little feet dangling in front of her and then these terrifying spider legs coming out from her sides anytime the movie did a flashback to rocket and his friends i would cry even after those scenes were over i was still very upset because i couldn’t take my mind off of them it was a good movie but i felt very drained once the credits rolled haha i didn’t expect it to be that dark

edit i’m glad i’m not the only one who was scarred from the animal abuse those scenes were very harrowing and heartbreaking i’ll be thinking about it for a long time",2023-05-08
 that scene and him seeing lila again  dude two seats was making fun of me and i just gave him the  you if you think it’s ok for them to shoot rockets only friends at the time,2023-05-07
rocket teefs floor run nowman that was a sad heartbreaking moment poor bunny was having a panic attack rightfully so just saw it for 2nd time and im glad i did i didjt catch wgat she was saying the first time,2023-05-10
oh my  that poor bunny got me so bad ive gor pet bunnies and she reminds me of one of them they did a great job transferring a rabbits personality to her,2023-05-08
oh thats what she was saying couldnt figure it out also i thought she named herself flora,2023-05-05
every time they were on screen i was about to cry when they were choosing names…yeah i was a mess i’m still sad a day later,2023-05-13
when baby rocket said “it hurts” it hurt the animal testing lab scenes were pretty tough to watch,2023-05-15
"rocket teefs floor go now

 i just tear up while i reading this im not saying im a peta person but never could watch animals suffer hate when people hurts them",2023-05-19
rockets scream when lylla dies and hes just standing there in that wide shot all helplessdamn that scream was just sorealand full of pain it was so good that i got scared the mcu is gonna pull a classic mcu and have a high evolutionartu guy drop a joke or something else comedic and ruin the moment but nooope they just let that sit and man that was just suchhh a real and hard moment i miss when mcu used to do that thank you james gunn you killed it this was seriously the best best mcu movie ive seen since no way home good  all around,2023-07-22
who knew a bunch of animal freaks with metal bits bolted on can make you cry,2023-05-08
movie made me realize that i didn’t have superhero movie fatigue just tired of  superhero movies lol this movie was perfect 1010,2023-05-20
the part you quoted for some reason brought me to tears in the theater  i felt floor,2023-05-07
"everytime they opened a door they had to slam their hands in that slime i was cackling

dude there were a few scenes in this movie that wrecked me that one where rocket just crys is one of them",2023-05-11
bunch of dudes sitting next to me just kept laughing during his whole backstory it was pathetic,2023-05-12
the biobuilding was so gross and i loved every second,2023-05-10
one of the strongest in all mcu i would say,2023-05-15
i was confused about that part why did the bunny keep saying that,2023-05-05
oh  the bio building it was triggering for me cause it felt like the inside of the alien in the movie nope,2023-05-07
i have two white bunnies and the  wrecked me,2023-05-15
"rocket teefs floor go now rocket teefs floor go now

manwhen i was watching it  i couldnt make out exactly what floor was saying but seeing this now hurts even more ",2023-05-23
yeah that moment rocket teefsfloor haunts my quiet times,2023-06-09
if you want to watch something that has similar vibes to the animal experiments check out made in abyss its an anime but its  amazing,2023-05-13
what was the bunny saying what did she mean by that i missed it,2023-05-16
rocket teefs floor go now followed by silence absolutely broke me,2023-08-03
i literally teared up just reading the go now part,2023-05-17
there were like 10 separate scenes that it got really dusty in the movie theater  the bio building looked like meow wolf in denver,2023-05-15
in late but they just put it on disney and that scene is definitely memory banked into the nightmare category,2023-08-03
i thought it was teeth since he got a big teeth ,2023-05-09
best marvel movie since quantamania,2023-05-07
i just thought it was too sad and i hate to say boring several people in the theater got up to go to the bathroom during that cage scene,2023-05-06
idk why it sounded like rocket takes floor go now,2023-05-17
"it was at that moment that i first really regretted getting a chilli cheese dog 


the second time was several hours after eating it",2023-05-26
i cried at this part it was so disturbing and they didnt have to  off all of rockets friends,2023-08-05
please make that sentence stop the tears that fall from my eyes every time i hear it  floors panicked demands,2023-08-13
that scene messed me up ,2023-08-22
hhhhuuuurtss,2023-09-12
a planet of people were wiped out and somehow we still got a happy ending it didn’t jus tell a smaller a story it actively fought against it loved it,2023-05-05
i say this time and time again this is really when marvel is at it’s best,2023-05-06
that is legitimately the trick  low stakes isolated stories the weave em together and you only do the major consequences when you have the enormous ensembles,2023-05-27
exactly  this is what dc could use  it doesn’t always have to be an apocalypse,2023-05-06
so much of the plot drivers for guardians have been to resolve items of their past and just feel complete,2023-05-18
perhaps the biggest of small stakes,2023-05-13
which emotionally are very high stakes,2023-05-17
this,2023-05-11
gotg reminds me of onepiece in space sometimes in that regard,2023-05-28
this film absolutely convinced me hes gonna do great with superman gunn may like over the top gore and snide remarks but  theres no denying he knows how to inject heart into his work,2023-05-05
"well one did die

but only to mostly dead and they got better ",2023-05-05
"i swear at some point gunn even confirmed on twitter that at least one member of the team was going to die

i bet that dude is just hella tired of people asking him  questions on twitter  i dont know why he entertains them",2023-05-08
"i think that after game of thrones there was a surge in killings of main and important characters and it was to a level of a trope that if something horrible doesnt happen to one of main characters then its bad and not serious enough and its plot armour it become almost automatic spoiler that something like that will happen

and got example is funny enough because after initial deaths in early seasons and books there are not that many deaths of main characters",2023-05-07
"the dcu is gonna rock and i hope marvel learned as many lessons as they could from gunn’s time with them 

i dunno if they did i felt like the only real problem with this movie was how rushed it all felt in the first half there was kinda too much squeezed in there and thats been the biggest issue with all the stuff since endgame too much in too tight a package leading to a movie that feels rushed but is still too long something tells me theyre going to keep doing that for a while at this point 

gunn is definitely gonna save the dcu though and im looking forward to some actual creativity being applied to stories like superman",2023-05-10
really hope gunn and wb finally drop miller though im not going to see flash and theyve said theyre not ruling out the possibility of working with miller again in the future,2023-05-10
same i spent the entire third act expecting rocket to leave us,2023-05-10
there was no flipping of the trope disney doesnt  off its protagonists the only one i can think of is tony stark and that was after a very very long time,2023-05-14
didnt gamora kinda die though i mean we all thought she would kinda come back around but she is a totally new gamora,2023-05-16
gunn understands how to do superhero movies in a way that few do dc will be lucky to have him,2023-05-25
agree trailers made it look much more depressing,2023-05-15
gjsuf,2023-05-25
i was thinking the same poor girl ,2023-05-05
they made a point of showing her a few times wonder if its an inside joke with james gunn maybe a personal friend,2023-05-05
those sentient animal people got  up for laughs drax straight up killed one of them and stole its motorcycle,2023-05-05
in addition to being funny i think it was trying to not improperly sanitize our relationships to animals like thats part of the cost of liberating them,2023-05-06
there were a few moments of needless violence that were very funny gunn’s sick sense of humor really works for me,2023-05-07
when the animals were running through i had a thought like no way the animals arent gonna cause some harm thatd be way too corny  then the girl catches the monkey and it starts  her up and ngl i cackled,2023-05-08
i think that was gordy,2023-05-06
shes going to be the high evolutionary in the sequel,2023-05-06
just wanted to remind you that these were still wild animals and this wasn’t completely a “disney moment” lol,2023-05-08
same she will have some hard pstd dafuq she do to deserve that,2023-05-05
high evolutionary 2,2023-05-06
i thought it worked because these are wild animals and i was having a hard time suspending disbelief when they all got released from their cages and didn’t descend into pure chaos  that made up for the silliness for me,2023-05-07
let me share the story of troma films,2023-05-06
 you in particular,2023-05-08
she got the zara young treatment,2023-05-10
"i havent watched the movie but you can take this comment and throw it in the nope movie thread and it would still fit

x200b

minus the hilarious part its rightfully horrifying",2023-05-05
especially after seeing what rocket did to the high evolutionary,2023-05-06
you can’t trust monkeys man they will  you up,2023-05-13
"a similar thing happened to a lady who had a chimp as her pet nsfl
",2023-06-28
they were setting up the high evolutionairee,2023-07-09
oh my  possibly unintentional travis the chimp reference,2023-05-05
i actually hated this after establishing that all these animals are potentially sentient good natured and kind they threw a chimp attack for a quick joke in there felt inconsistent,2023-05-05
always bump the lamp,2023-05-07
monkeys gonna monkey,2023-05-28
you’re a psychopath,2023-06-02
wait which girl was that ,2023-07-07
because its a wild animal,2023-07-08
was actually a bit disappointed ayesha just kind of died like that,2023-05-05
"i think what i loved most was gunn gave it a realistic ending instead of your traditional happy ending mainly i am thinking of him not letting quill and gamora ending up back together no matter how hard quill worked for it its a very realistic ending for me but i know i cant be alone 

it gave me a sense of peace leaving that theater because most movies are too scared to take that risk but its more common than not to not get what you want but things still working out in another way 

side note while im here young rocket saying hurts is crushing even now but i feel it so much little buddy",2023-05-08
i might be wrong but i think its sean gunn that voice rocket in the flashbacks,2023-05-05
sean gunn did the voice of young rocket in the flashbacks,2023-05-05
" appreciate that the villain was defeated easily and the main mission was saving people and animals



i like it when superheros are actually doing superhero things aside from saving the world  or fighting someone that doesnt like them



low scale stakes they saved a bunch of peopleanimals after trying to just save their friends",2023-05-08
for the hallway scene is it just me or did no sleep till brooklyn not fit right for the record im a huge beastie boys fan and it was fun when it first came on as they were walking out but once the fighting in the hallway began it felt a little off and not as heavyfast paced as you normally would have in a fight scene,2023-05-07
surprised ayesha was just killed just like that considering she was the antoganonist in 2 it felt very rushed you barely even see adam react to it,2023-05-05
i was so confused what was destroying his ship was knowhere attacking after the big gun,2023-05-08
would be a really good end if bradley cooper finally got his oscar for playing a racoon,2023-05-10
i dont think it was bradley cooper in the flashbacks the credits said there was a different actor that played young rocket i could be mistaken though,2023-05-14
i felt a tiny bad for cosmo with the choice of end song,2023-05-26
" bradley cooper as rocket is the mvp his performance in the flashback is amazing

dont forget the cgi team which marveldisney famously abused",2023-05-09
"bradley cooper did a fine job as a voice actor for rocket but id hardly call him the mvp of what made this movie great as a cgi racoon he didnt even have to put on a visual performance to show emotion 

think about rocket shaking in the cage with horror as he met the other group 89 creatures rocket saying hurts was simply the cherry on top to a well put together already emotional scene

kudos to james gunn  the film writers for building the script  environment around rockets origin story",2023-05-13
"appreciate that the villain was defeated easily and the main mission was saving people and animals

okay but they didnt save the animals they slaughtered so many of them just saved the cute ones and that one cool looking one and they brutally  them too because theyre not human",2023-05-05
i know your comment is like 3 months old but i just got done watching this movie and dog days are over is going to hit differently for the rest of my life,2023-08-13
what was the fbomb,2023-09-12
for real he came through and chose violence with every guardian and it was so early in the movie i thought to myself is someone dying this early already,2023-05-06
who threw this thing at me,2023-05-17
they threw a pair of black air force ones into that incubation chamber and i could tell his first appearance was sick as ,2023-05-13
kang who is a multiversal being with infinite lives got beaten by ants  ants man and hes supposed to be the next thanos of the mcu l,2023-07-11
nah kang gave me goosebumps when he first came on screen and he was terrifying adam was funny and i liked how he just automatically threw hands but i can’t let u disrespect kang like that ,2023-05-28
then he became a joke the rest of the movie so,2023-11-27
"it felt like a play on the obnoxious trope of all the characters of said animated film dance around  i think shrek started the trend

the difference is that here it felt earned just some light relief after saving the galaxy and your friends i’ve never cried at a ‘shrek in the swamp karaoke dance party’ scene before and i don’t see it happening again 

at least until i rewatch this",2023-05-07
that ending song got me i was a freshman in college when that song came out and i have a lot of emotional ties with it my roommate and i would play it on repeat and just dance so freely in our room it really is a song to just dance in whatever way you want so when i saw rocket and groot start to dance with such happiness and absence of grief in a way that i havent since i was 17i got filled with all sorts of emotions,2023-05-08
the lyrics had me feeling a little bad for cosmo what a good dog tho who would definitely be taking it personally,2023-05-26
  ,2023-05-05
28 days late just saw it what made me laugh was they clearly didn’t know what song they were going to use because nobody was dancing to the beat of that song,2023-06-03
the opposite would be spiderman 3 lol,2023-05-15
"“i hate this song…”

cosmo probably",2023-08-17
"definitely worth a read for anyone who wants to read more of a story similar to the flashbacks

im good thanks",2023-05-07
i havent thought about we3 since i read it years ago  man that was a tough read  i lump it in with pride of baghdad,2023-05-05
the moment i saw the rabbit i immediately thought of we3,2023-05-05
we3 is one of my favorite comics of all time and i was constantly reminded of it throughout this movie especially every time they showed floor i had no idea gunn tried to make a movie of it thank you for sharing this,2023-05-06
"the whole time with rockets backstory i kept thinking of the comic called we3 


as soon as i saw the bunny thats where my mind went too",2023-05-06
i thought about we3 through the whole movie especially the rabbit with its limited speech reminded me so much of it one of my favorite comics ever and so glad to see some dna of it in this movie,2023-05-07
whoa its crazy to see that someone was also reminded of that its such a great story but i never want to read it again,2023-05-07
i was thinking of the same thing i could actually feel this unease as well when it went to those scenes like a huge lump in my throat because of how fantastic and horrible it was,2023-05-08
i thought the same thing love that comic,2023-05-07
holy  yes  hadnt thought about that story in years but  when the bunny showed up i just went oh nooo and immediately thought back to pirate,2023-05-08
i thought of we3 also,2023-05-07
exactly this all of the rocket flashbacks i had we3 in the back of my mind,2023-05-08
 the missing pets posters in each we3 chapter made me feel so sad,2023-05-16
im going to go add this to my wishlist now,2023-05-08
im hoping gunn would be interested to adapt the magus storyline from gotg game we’re at exactly the right place to do it too,2023-05-28
" i forgot i read we3 what a lovely memory  thank you

by lovely i mean the quality of the story not the sad content",2023-05-13
i will be first in line to watch james gunns we3,2023-05-14
literally my first thought when i saw floor thats such a nod to 3 ,2023-05-14
it wasnt just the animal experimentation but also cosmos good dogbad dog routine reminded me of we3,2023-06-20
"idk i felt like the rocket stuff was a shameless ripoff of we3 to inject emotional weight into an otherwise incredibly bland script morrison shouldve gotten a credit at least

edit weird nobody actually disagreeing with this with words how is what i described not what happened",2023-05-06
whats so special about the back story its the same rehashed story as wolverine,2023-05-18
after watching vol3 a second time i remembered i had the hard cover on my shelf and picked it up again to see how similar the stories and character design was,2023-05-18
great now i’m crying again ,2023-05-05
"i do like in retrospect how adam warlock was basically the same as rocket in some ways

what does adam say when nebula stabs him through the chest at the beginning

that hurts

all of the high evolutionarys creations are children and they are all victims",2023-05-05
all his scenes were just so sad the first word being hurt was rough,2023-05-05
"my wife and i saw guardians 3 on friday night four hours earlier our beloved cat salem had emergency surgery at that very moment  when rocket said hurts  my heart shattered because it was likely that our boy also was hurting

we almost left we werent sure we could endure this story given what happened earlier in the day but we did stay and loved the film

oh and salem is home and healthy ",2023-05-08
all of his scenes made me sob intensely ,2023-05-05
my heart broke and i didn’t stop crying from that point on,2023-05-07
 you for setting me off again,2023-05-07
the rocket backstory might be the saddest story i’ve ever seen and i watch one piece,2023-05-05
"those 4 all shared something unique but in society needs so dearly we need inventors nuturers protectors and carefree happiness when times are rough

high evolutionary literally made perfect species without noticing it was right in front of him from the beginning",2023-07-07
 kills me poor little rocket,2023-05-07
why did you have to remind me how i have to cry again,2023-05-08
everything hurts here too rocket,2023-05-11
that movie  i sat through too much of it while crying  it was everything i could do to not openly weep as rockets life as he knew it came to an end,2023-05-14
jesus christ  this broke me again,2023-05-10
i hate you for this comment,2023-05-11
,2023-05-07
i mean what did you think the nine inch nails song was about,2023-05-15
dude i almost full on bawled when that scene came up  hhhhurts  what a heartwrencher,2023-08-20
bro realized he ain’t built for that ,2023-05-06
"him finding out he was a raccoon allalong was great closure

it shows why he gets annoyed being called raccoontrash panda etc as he literally had no idea what he was ",2023-05-05
this trilogy really was rockets story all along,2023-05-05
the whole trilogy was just rockets origin story to becoming the leader of the guardians,2023-05-05
my only complaint with the movie was thechoose not to seek revenge part like come on the dude killed billions of living beings just do the galaxy a favor,2023-05-08
 of a day,2023-05-05
the not yet and the pain moments made me choke hard grown  man btw,2023-05-08
for me it was a tuesday,2023-05-06
i don’t remember the exact words but didn’t someone say early on something about it always being his story which is kind of true he’s had the most detailed and progressive arc or at least on par with peter and this movie really drives it home,2023-05-10
so did he not know he was a raccoon before this  peter never said anything ,2023-05-29
"i dont think he found out that he is a raccoon hes still definitely an alien that looks like a raccoon but the point was that this was his first time seeing what raccoons looked like and this whole time he thought everyone was just relentlessly mocking him and in that moment he probably thought about the fact that those raccoons were there solely because of his success as an experiment 

x200b

i think thats more meaningful than he was a raccoon all along",2023-05-13
i loved the bioship stuff so much so weird and gross the guards dressed up as gross tardigrades,2023-05-05
"agree i didn’t care for guardians 2 tbh but goodness guardians 3 will probably be my favorite superhero movie ever it did what a good story should do laughed cried saw old “friends” come to terms with their issuesfriendships met new faces that contributed to the story

and it made me appreciate gotg2 a ton more maybe it was the callbacks to many of those characters  conversations

best superhero trilogy imo  like i said i didn’t really appreciate 2 at all i just feel that 3 made much of 2 make a lot more sense",2023-05-30
super solid movie i kinda felt going in it was about to get heavy and boy did it  i had expected rocket to die and that would be the driving force and they made it way darker,2023-05-10
forgive my ignorance what are the traits of 70s scifi which resonated here could you please recommend some 70s scifi,2023-05-22
agreed on the 70s  it was the movie they all wished they could make back then and early 80s   i was blown away  easily one of the best mcu films,2023-05-21
i was screaming at something scary behind you,2023-05-05
those scenes destroyed me dont think i could ever rewatch this movie even though i loved it,2023-05-05
reminded me when we get introduced to sids toys in toy story,2023-05-07
i think i cried like three times while watching it the close up tear in rockets eye set me off when lylla died,2023-05-07
the body horror animal torture and general gore and violence made me deeply uncomfortable great movie but boy i’m never watching it again,2023-05-22
rabbit spider is gonna  my dreams up for awhile now and why do i feel so bad for the walrus we need his backstory too,2023-05-17
same here it seems like people liked the movie but the animal stuff was way too much this movie just made me feel depressed,2023-05-06
at least he is polite he said thank you probably a nice guy thing,2023-05-07
i want to see how james gunn filmed sean gunn linda cardellini and the rest of the actors in mocap suits acting out these scenes,2023-05-11
she tall and i fall,2023-05-05
her height though ,2023-08-05
oh man the horror imagery was something i wasnt expecting at all they definitely pushed the boundaries of what they could do and i feel as though james gunn wanted to see how far disneymarvel would let him go by using up as much of their budget on music licensing and also the extent of how creepy some of the creatures looked gamora peeling the guys face off and the movie included the first  the mcu felt like things that james gunn wrote in to see whether theyd make him take it out and they didnt,2023-05-05
i was getting big time bebop and rocksteady vibes from the evil animals,2023-05-05
you mentioned body horror stuff and didnt even go into the bio engineered station,2023-05-05
"james gunn really wants you to remember he directed slither and that he could do it again if he so desired 

this is how i felt during his suicide squad movie after starro showed up",2023-05-05
dont forget the groot  explosion,2023-05-05
the  mole rat ship controller reminded me of the hybrid from bsg it was so terrifyingly cool,2023-05-05
cant believe they get away with this much gore and body horror in a disney marvel movie then again hollywood got away with this when they did the bayformers movies,2023-05-06
a lot of the visuals were very reminiscent of doom enemies half living half cybernetic gruesome weapons for limbs horns,2023-05-06
nebula getting mangled and then just cracking back into place lol,2023-05-07
"pig monster was voiced by judy greer scott langs wife

and lylla was voiced by linda cardellini hawkeyes wife",2023-05-07
and groots head walking around on the spider like legs in the opening total horror movie stuff,2023-05-07
"yeah i think gunn still would’ve made it r if he was able to especially because some of the dialogue felt like he wanted to include a bit more swearing 

but i don’t think the early reactions were exaggerating when they said it’s about as adult as the mcu has ever gone definitely among the hardest pg13s out there",2023-05-07
"the darkbody horrorish aspects get amped up in this one the  up experimented animals that worked for the high evolutionary and invade knowhere were legit creepy

there were definite shades of the island of doctor moreau in there",2023-05-06
"gunn did the horror aspects better than raimi in mom

gunn did the kiddad aspect better than in love and thunder",2023-05-08
" and of course probably the most satisfying scene in the whole movie when rocket shreds up the high evolutionarys face for a solid 10 seconds and at the end when they tear away his mask and show just how much rocket  him up

when they started peeling it back my first thought was oh theyre gonna make another faceoff joke then it was why are they trying to shoehorn red skull into this movie then it was oooooohhhh shiiiiiit",2023-05-10
i feel like the high evolutionary is a cross between joseph mengele and dr moreau island of dr moreau james gunn really pushed the envelope with this film making it by far to me at least the darkest emotionally exhausting marvel film,2023-05-08
slither was dope,2023-05-05
i really liked the oxtopus,2023-05-08
i couldnt help but think of slither when we saw that orifice planetary system,2023-05-05
definitely felt like he’d freed up after getting bit grosser and gorier with peacemaker and suicide squad i wonder how much of that is going to make it into his superman movie,2023-05-08
i got meet the feebles vibes for floor and teefs scenes,2023-05-06
i talked with a friend about how he really is going to insist on reminding everyone of his troma roots,2023-05-06
i think it all worked so well as it didnt feel like it was trying to be realistic cgi like war pig didnt feel like a grounded character but more like some spooky doodle from a comic same for all the stuff in the fleshy world and the prosthetics on the animals,2023-05-07
he directed a lot worse than that should check it out,2023-05-08
my gf and i just got out of the movie it needs a warning for all the animal stuff,2023-05-19
i wish james gun would go back to horror he is able to find the perfect balance between horror humor and gore particularly body horror that is so hard to get right,2023-05-20
honestly considering the quality of the mcus cgi recently behemoth and warpig were such a flex he had them out in the daylight and they looked great,2023-08-05
just watched a trailer for slither lol what the  should should i watch this,2023-05-09
i dug how gory this one was truly shocking at first but once i got it i got into it laughing at the audacity of some of the things that made it into a disney movie,2023-05-10
nebula with broken neck in hallway scene ugh,2023-05-15
"the one time i 1 go to the theatre and 2 convince my very squeamish mom to join me because itll be fine its mcu xd


the horror aspect has nothing to do with whether i go to theatres but i rarely go just because i hate them my mom came with me because i almost never do and i didnt think to check about gore or horror stuff for her because its mcu",2023-05-26
man floor had her back legs cut off and capped with prosthetic nubs and the nubs  wiggled around in every scene the experiments were dark as  and i felt so bad about it lol,2023-06-12
i thought the reveal wasnt that he  him up  i thought that was the red skull revealed was i wrong,2023-05-06
"james gunn really wants you to remember he directed slither and that he could do it again if he so desired

perfectly threatening energy",2023-07-10
"is the words of the screen writer guy 

hey shut up",2023-05-05
they just really wanted to do the “the creation of adam” shot,2023-05-06
because the emotional moment wouldn’t work if he had them not sure why they didn’t just break them in the fight or something,2023-05-05
i really thought he was going to use the mask and rocket boots when he was in space because we hadnt seen them the entire movie,2023-05-05
"gunn confirmed that due to the hectic beginning of the movie peter had to make snap decisions quickly and simply forgotleft the helmet behind on knowhere they never returned there for him to have the chance to pick it back up

the boots were also confirmed by gunn that rocket made antigrav boots for everyone that were all around just far superior and vastly more upgraded than peters old misfiring rocket boots they do the same thing peters old boots did but with added gravity functionality its why rocket is testing the newest version of them at the start of the movie while talking to nebula and why gravity was played around with so much during the movie its also one of the key ways rocket kicks the high evolutionarys  at the end he controlled gravity so rocket made antigravity boots to counter him also playing into the entire notion the high evolutionary hates rocket for being more creativesmarterfree thinking than he is rocket had years upon years of how to think about beating his  and he did so thoroughly",2023-05-10
he even had the new uniform that has a cool helmet with it from the comics,2023-05-06
he answered this very question on twitter ,2023-05-08
they broke didnt they,2023-05-05
"drunken stupor dont drive in space and drink psa

but yes thats a plot hole",2023-05-05
my guess is he ditched them because they reminded him of gamora their first meeting he used the rocket boots to take her down and his first selfless action was giving her his mask to survive in space,2023-05-05
"james gunn felt the need to explain this on twitter todayquill left his helmet in his apartment because he rushed out so quickly and he stopped using the jet boots because the jet packs rocket built for everyone worked so much better its a contrivance but its word of  canon now

source",2023-05-08
his helmet broke in gotg2 unsure about boots,2023-05-05
"yeah it was a really weird scene because
a wed already gotten a scene like this in the first film
b he didnt have any of his normal gear
c all his friends and allies seemed to be about 100 feet away and none of them had a spare jet pack to use",2023-05-07
idk about the boots but masks in movies are important because you dont have to pay the star as much to be on set and have a stuntman fill in some people think thats why the black widow movie took so long to get made no masks mean  more expensive movies im thinking with this being the gaurdians last hurrah disneys hands off approach and gunns influence the creative team didnt have to worry about needing to use a mask and wanted you to see the stars faces as much as possible,2023-05-06
seeing as rockets suit had the antigrav suits i assume quills suit had too so not his rocket boots and the helmet could either be stored as a memory to yondu who gave him his first helmet or destroyed between movies,2023-05-06
pawned them off for booze,2023-05-06
it was a faceoff not a trap,2023-05-07
"i said this in another comment

i also wondered about that but then remembered they all left knowhere in a hurry to save rocket

whether thats the explanation or not its always a bit jarring to have those kinds of questions in a movie you otherwise lived so much",2023-05-07
others probably already gave gunns answer but the helmet was left back on knowhere since he left the planet in a hurry to save rocket and the rocket boots were no longer in use by starlord as the jetpacks that were made by rocket were a major upgradeeasier to control the rocket boots essentially were retired,2023-05-08
"gunn addressed this peter had no time to get his helmet 

he woke up from his   stupor into a fire fight and was rushing off to save rockets life helmet be damned

as for the boots he gave them up because rocket already designed for him a superior jet pack",2023-05-11
i figured the rocket boots were going to come into play when he jumped out the window with the scientist definitely wasnt expecting what actually happened,2023-05-10
i read that it was because he was in such a hurry to leave knowhere to save rocket ,2023-05-21
this is what i was wondering lol maybe it broke in some other movie who knows it looked cool though right,2023-05-08
"i thought of that his mask broke when he was fighting ego but it’s so weird rocket never made a new one so yeah that’s annoying and like reverse plot armor and the boots also yeah so yah…

“heyshutup”",2023-05-08
i think the helmet was destroyed in the previous gotg movie ego broke it so he didnt have it to wear and give yondu the other device which would have saved him,2023-05-08
he left in a rush so he forgot them at home,2023-05-10
i think the mask is only for atmosphere but yeah after seeing such clunky big spacesuits i was really missing the mask,2023-05-10
this was one of my few gripes with the movie especially considering ive recently seen a few stores heavily promoting a wearable star lord helmet via the likes of instagram i nearly picked up for a friend hes a huge gotg fan and is his birthday soon glad i didnt because i dont think star lord wears the helmet at all in the movie,2023-05-13
probably sent back to manufacturer for warranty service  breaks down in space sometimes,2023-05-16
so much going on i didnt even realizeyea thats definitely a negative no reason to not have his signature helmet,2023-05-25
when he pushed that guy off the ship midair i legit told my friend hes ok he got his rocket boots,2023-07-09
haha the wife who doesnt really follow these mcu movies much even queried out loud as to why he isnt pushing those buttons for his mask and rocket boots,2023-08-21
almost bro i was legit weeping,2023-05-05
hallway fights win again,2023-05-06
you can take out the word almost it’s ok to cry my friend we all did,2023-05-05
almost i left the theatre legit dehydrated from sobbing so many times ,2023-05-06
guardians isn’t as much superhero movie as the rest of the superhero movies though it’s got a very different vibe and the characters aren’t really superhero’s as much as they are aliens interacting in an alien world in which they aren’t really anything special,2023-05-06
the hallway fight screen had me tearing up just knowing that was probably the last time we would see them all kicking  together but then we got one more cherry on top,2023-05-06
"
3 this movie proves i’m not bored of superhero movies i’m bored of  superhero movies


this should be the rotten tomatoes blurb for the film",2023-05-08
does someone know what music was playing during that scene cant seem to remember what song it was,2023-05-05
i know it’s late but this so much  i don’t ever want to hear “people just don’t want to see x in a movie because they are  humans” bro it’s two days later and i’m haunted by how emotional i feel over a cyborg bunny with 10 lines i would die for floors just give us good stories and make us feel something we want to so easily,2023-05-07
i cried a lot but the thing with rockets friends almost had me bawl out loud i could feel that muscle that makes someone cry out loud start moving,2023-05-06
i cried 6 times this movie hit hard,2023-05-05
i think the coolest thing about the hallway fite was like it was shot on the super wide angle handheld camera for some shots get the vfx still felt so organic it felt like a really cool way to integrate vfx into filmmaking,2023-05-07
only 3 heart of ice,2023-05-05
this gives me further hope for dc with james gunn leading it he did an amazing job with peacemaker and thr suicide squad so excited to have him continue there,2023-05-07
my  contacts almost came out,2023-05-08
the thing is though  is this a superhero movie its no more of a superhero movie than dungeons and dragons,2023-05-15
dudeyou cried  everyone cried,2023-05-06
i cried three times when baby rocket says hurts when rocket is talking to his friends in the afterlife and when quill reunites with his grandpa,2023-05-22
yep this movie reignited my faith in marvel and super hero movies if they managed to ruin guardians it probably would’ve been the last straw for me,2023-05-24
i cried for probably 14 of the movie and off and on again for a few hours after jfc,2023-05-09
i was straight up sobbing,2023-05-13
"i might just have to watch it a second time so i can release all the supressed tears i hid from my wife and kids


quill seeing his grandpa almost got me",2023-05-08
i never ever cry while watching movies or shows or any content at all i cry in real situations and while i get really sad for movie characters i never manifest it this movie made me come really really cloes to crying repeatedly,2023-05-15
the hallway fight scene was amazing like all the team work and showing off all the skills my favorite part was star lord throwing the zappers then setting them off with the hand in front of the screen,2023-05-20
"the guardians movies kind of aren’t like the rest of the superhero movies though the characters can take space laser blasts and live and i guess sometimes adam warlock resurrects dead people no problem but i feel like the guardians movies are more just like scifi adventure movies than superhero movies in terms of tone music story and even language

splitting hairs i guess",2023-06-12
guardians of the galaxy is more of a sci fi movie than it is a super hero movie,2023-07-16
dcu has entered the chat,2023-05-07
this guy cries also me,2023-05-15
hallway fight scene seemed to be inspired by train fight scene from sucker punch,2023-05-23
it really was perfect that whole get in the carjust press the button thing is so overplayed i was thinking oh great this gag will go on for another 30 seconds but then he just said get in the  car ,2023-06-05
does deadpool not count,2023-05-10
did any one else hear rocket say “i let you  die” truly sad if he did,2023-05-11
im really hoping this brings a whole new audience for them cause florence is incredible not one bad album,2023-05-14
i cant listen to it without crying now,2023-05-10
i couldnt make out the lyrics to 90 of the music in this movie and i saw it in dolby atmos,2023-05-24
you need to see more movies,2023-05-12
that was so unexpectedly horrific for an mcu film i couldn’t bear it they were so happy and hopeful and sweet and innocent even while being in cages and being experimented upon i know there’s probably more horrific and more painful stories out there but this one got to me,2023-05-05
"rocket teefs floor go now 

im a grown man but jesus it felt the walls were closing in on me 

rocket teefs floor go now i dont like this anymore

james gunn playing around with my emotions like a beach ball",2023-05-05
my wife has been crying for two hours at this scene,2023-05-05
as good as it was i dont think i could rewatch this movie ever i managed to stay strong in the theater but after i left i kinda fell apart and sobbed on my bf for an hour ,2023-05-05
this this was the scene that absolutely broke me and then rocket turning around to find them lifeless on the ground man i couldn’t believe what i was watching everything just felt so wrong and devastating i was praying that when rocket and lylla hugged each other in the trailer it was a reunion not a final death scene in a flashback its been 18 hours later and i still have that scene playing in my head absolutely heartbreaking…,2023-05-06
it was so dark that entire sequence had me emotional when lylla got shot i legit jumped in my seat,2023-05-05
when lylla was shot i didnt think it was a gun at first it panned down to her chest i think and i was expecting to see an exit wound or something and when i saw none i thought does she have some kind of  switch that goes off for unauthorized exiting of the cage i thought her heart exploded or something,2023-05-06
"absolutely brutal

also isnt it weird that the final scene the scene during the credits had rocket leading a mission to slaughter a bunch of wild animals am i missing something about how that scene was about to go down or was that just a totally bizarre choice",2023-05-09
floor was right tho go now ,2023-05-06
i just lost an old friend to an overdose he died monday these scenes were incredibly painful for me but cathartic also i found parallels to him and rocket they lost friends and had suffered so much in life the scene where rocket meets lyla and his other friends made me happy because while my rocket cant come back i would like to think he is in the infinite sky with his friends now,2023-05-06
i  cried in every scene with these 4  it,2023-05-06
"when they were choosing their  names i was going theyre all going to die and im going to cry when it happens

sure enough",2023-05-08
started crying from the beginning scene and then continued to cry off and on until this scene where i sobbed uncontrollably,2023-05-05
one of the toughest movies for animal lovers that isn’t a documentary  ever didn’t expect that from an mcu flick still processing it tbh,2023-05-06
stop it,2023-05-05
the only reason he wasnt shot was because they were ordered not to touch him and he probably felt all the guilt due to that  he had a gun and couldnt save them atleast he tried,2023-05-07
oh  i was bawling this scene i need an alternate timeline where rocket teefs floor and lila find groot and become the guardians this has to happen feige,2023-05-07
"i’m sobbing all over again 
that scene was absolutely devastating rocket’s crying out when lylla dies was too real",2023-05-08
i want a what if story where they escaped and livied  but then rocket may have never become a guardian of the galaxy,2023-05-06
i have two bunnies so that scene hit me extra hard,2023-05-07
no cuz this genuinely broke something in me,2023-05-06
i almost left after this i’m glad i didn’t but watching the pain these sweet cgi animals went through was nauseating,2023-05-07
i need to hug a bunny,2023-05-09
that is burned into my soul now itll be 10 years later and something will remind me of that phrase and i will break down in the middle of a supermarket,2023-05-10
i want to hunt james gunn down and punch him so hard in the face for subjecting me to that scene im going to be traumatised for ages,2023-05-08
im a 22 yearold who watches horror movies and stuff but that made me cry a lot,2023-05-09
traumatized and sobbing because of that scene,2023-05-10
this part hits me every time i think back to it,2023-05-07
was this the scene where the high evolutionary shot llyla not sure how to spell her name or right before that i was so emotional basically bawling my eyes out and didnt hear it subtitles arent in english in my country,2023-05-08
i  lost it in the theater my wife had to hold my arm went home and hugged my three cats and two dogs,2023-05-08
im never watching this movie again because of rockets backstory way too real,2023-05-08
,2023-05-07
what did that mean,2023-05-11
 you shut up,2023-05-16
this is going to go right next to “hold the door” in lines that ruin me just thinking about,2023-06-06
quill probably brought a medpack or two with him,2023-05-05
it felt like quinn quill may have called ahead since the lady and the grandpa both seemed to recognize himnot be too surprised,2023-05-06
dead grandson shows up alive prank gone wrong gone ,2023-05-06
love the mundane human talk between quill and his grandfather in the end credits scene  you think grandpa will eventually hint to quill that it’s time he moved out  ha ha,2023-05-16
i know gunn says he wishes they didn’t have peter do some of that stuff so maybe,2023-05-05
also good to summarize things for more casual viewers since the dynamic of the team changed dramatically between guardians 2 and 3,2023-05-05
what were they saying i already forgot,2023-05-05
i dont typically watch marvel movies but really like gotg ive seen 1 and 2 obviously and was so confused i had no idea important things happened in other movies i thought maybe the gotg cast just fights some bad guys with wolverine or something,2023-05-07
feels like it,2023-05-05
i think so it wasnt particularly subtle but its probably a little nodcomment to the past events and some of the decisions that they made in non gotg movies gunn didnt 100 agree with,2023-05-05
i just took it as a little bit of lampshade hanging on the convoluted mechanisms and series of plot points by which gamora was brought back from the dead,2023-05-15
i made a comment to my brother about this while watching felt a little like gunn taking a jab at the russosmarvel for sure,2023-05-07
that was kinda the central crux of why the high evolutionary was screeching about rote memorization sure there is information in their heads but they cant use it to create anything new,2023-05-05
"they seemed to just be a society from the 80s maybe only a small percentage of them could create kind of the same with regular earth in a way are we saying that anything that they had was basically just imported from earth on creation of the planet and that this is why they were still stuck in the 80s presuming he started creating the inhabitants and the planet after rocket escapes thats got to be what at least 20 years ago

seemed to me hes plan was flawed from getgo eg ok he can make an initial set of perfect creatures but then there isnt anything guaranteeing the offspring will have same characteristics its similar to a premise in another movie called i mother ai tries to raise nonviolent human thinks its done it but nothing is guaranteed in terms of whether this first set of humans will be able to raise offspring the same way let alone many generations down the line

and did he friggin clone or rapid growth those kids kidnap them how did drax speak same language either way he was  up and him getting his  beat by all the guardians ending with gamora shanking him in a manner that he probably thought was imperfect was so satisfying",2023-05-08
huh human music i like it,2023-05-14
ok so i wasnt just imagining the vocaloid music on radio i thought that was what i heard but assumed i was just imagining things,2023-05-17
i would be so mad if i endured horrific torture to force me into the perfected evolutionary format only to have to live in suburbia,2023-05-14
counter earth shouldve been a much bigger part of the story really it gets like 8 minutes with the bat family who dont even speak english then our heroes drive past 80s nyc crime pasthices then were on the ship the and the world explodes,2023-05-24
yeah i didnt think about that but i wonder if that develops from being forced to evolved in a matter of seconds theres no real development just becoming fully sentient with no real experience,2023-06-12
"sure they handwave the whole 80s vibe as the high evolutionary copying earth back then but theres subtle hints its doomed anyway hatsune miku playing on the radio means the people on

was the world trade center still there i couldnt tell",2023-06-05
same drax was the odds on favorite for me,2023-05-05
i went into this one expecting rocket to die but i’m so glad they went the direction they did way more emotionally satisfying,2023-05-05
"floor and teefs were definitely major to me 

edit and lylla",2023-05-05
if peter actually died to pick up a  zune,2023-05-05
"i was ready for drax to die honestly since dave was constantly saying it was his last time playing the character

i’m surprised yet really relieved no one died it’s awesome",2023-05-05
ego’s expansion almost definitely killed a bunch of people in vol 2,2023-05-05
the movie did a real good job at making ypu believe anyone can die at any point which i think is ultimately the point of killing characters of its more about feeling like someone can die and knowing the stakes vs killing people off for the wow factor,2023-05-05
"in this a whole planet is blown up

i have to admit that bothered me a little bit mostly because the characters didnt bother to acknowledge it millions of people were wiped out and the guardians didnt bat an eye they could have at least had the high evolutionary plan an orbital bombardment to give the guardians time to stop him even if they failed  which could have then built on the characters a bit the film never really explored two key ideas which really could have funneled into this firstly that gamorra meant something to everyone in the guardians and that her return meant that they had to process their grief in new ways and secondly that peters obsession with people dying around him meant that he would go to any lengths to save rocket even if it meant neglecting counterearth",2023-05-06
similar stakes that shouldve happened in love and thunder ragnaroks strong point was its good villain and letting them villain causing the protagonist to progress and love and thunder shouldve done the same,2023-05-06
"yeah i honestly thought they wouldn’t be able to save rocket especially when he literally said “can i come” i think i would have also been interested in seeing how that could have played out especially with how it would have affected quill but i like what they ended up doing too

i could have done without that last minute random fakeout of quill almost dying in space yet again though that sort of came out of nowhere for me it wasn’t super heroic and it’s been done before i thought i didn’t think for a second he was going to die so it just confused me at least it gave something for adam to do i guess but that’s obviously the only reason it was included and it felt excessive and unnecessary",2023-05-05
rip bat family,2023-05-06
it should be endgame if you count snapped  death  anyway i like that the guardians survive a hopeful end instead of a sad one,2023-05-05
i thought they actually killed quill,2023-05-05
" i was surprised not a single major character died in this

its become far too common to  off a main character to either make it an emotional experience or for shock value  the fact that youre surprised means they did a good job making you believe that this characters werent safe from certain death",2023-05-06
"i mentioned in another comment that this movie kind of benefitted from james gunn leaving marvel after finishing this because i felt like there was no plot armor there were a handful of times where at any given moment i felt a core member was in trouble and nope they all made it out okay but it didn’t feel cheap either because every character found a reason to keep going even if it meant retiring from the guardians of the galaxy i was sure that drax was as good as dead with how vocal bautista has been about wanting to not have to stay in immense shape like that anymore as he gets older and how he was glad to be done with drax but nope they just wrote him into a nice little gray area where he can either never come back or come back in a less significant way and not have to be so yoked 

i am however very shocked to see starlord will return i was almost positive that chris pratt was going to make the jump to dc with james but i’m eager to see what comes out of that hoping it’s not a disney show and if it is i hope it’s more loki and less ms marvel",2023-05-06
"gunn really pulled out an uncharted 4 ending for the last act

honestly good for them",2023-05-06
also ego probably killed millions attempting to take over all the planets he had seeds on even if they stopped it,2023-05-05
"same i think there is an issue of stakes in all marvel movies but sort of figured james gunn could at least  off drax given his age in real life

i sort of liked that they didnt subverting my expectations in other ways",2023-05-05
"i think they headfaked us good i heard so many rumours of people dying so i was expecting multiple deaths there were several moments rocket throughout the film drax and nebula when they were shot in the back quill that they made us feel like someone was going to die that it felt like they were teasing us on purpose 

touché",2023-05-06
not a major but i was bracing for cosmo to die the way they built it i was expecting in the final fight cosmo does something selfless and as shes dying is told she was a good dog,2023-05-08
"i mean you cant count infinity war when talking about the most movie deaths it wins by an absolute landslide half of all life in the universe was snapped out of existence 

no other movie has come close to the trillions of lives that were ended in one act",2023-05-05
half the asgardian species doesnt get unsnapped,2023-05-05
wow they  so many nameless background characters so brave,2023-05-06
"infinity war  half of all life  

and then yeah the guardians movies",2023-05-05
thanos would be proud,2023-05-05
i was expecting drax  rocket and maybe even mantis to die  very glad i was wrong,2023-05-05
to be fair there are like… 50 asgardians left,2023-05-05
this was the most tragic gotg for many reasons i can never watch gotg again you have to watch this movie closely to see the other tragic outcomes,2023-05-05
i was honestly expecting rocket drax or nebula to die would have been cool if drax gave his life for his family but i like how every character gets to live happily ever after,2023-05-06
you know i think he had two choices go the standard route and  a bunch of characters for the finaleor break our hearts even more by breaking up the group itself,2023-05-06
a whole planet was blown up in the last one too,2023-05-06
everyone expected people to die no not killing anyone became the surprising option,2023-05-06
1000 bravo to the false leak that someone dies i also liked how the trailer covered the first 30 mins of the movie didn’t feel too much was spoiled aside from that drax ball moment,2023-05-06
good thing world war ii had no deaths s,2023-05-07
im glad no major character died this movie was already heavy enough with its themes a major character death would have made it too dark in my opinion,2023-05-07
after the first trailer i thought someone would die then i remembered its james gunn and i reversed on it i had a pretty good feeling he wasnt going to  anyone off just to throw off the viewer and the fact he hit so many emotional beats already it wasnt really needed he almost had me when quill didnt make the jump with how brutal he had him bloat up and freeze the biggest surprise to me was the fact star lord will return did not expect that at all i thought pratt would be done after this i wonder where he ends up,2023-05-08
i think gunn knew that we were expecting to lose at least one member of the team it felt like we was teasing all of their deaths throughout the entire film,2023-05-08
infinity war they mention how thanos wiped out xandar to get the power stone,2023-06-05
i woulda bet money that drax was going to die saving the children “you weren’t born to be a destroyer you were born to be a dad” ruined me so once again the professional film makers got it right,2023-07-24
not to mention insanely hateable as some of the best villains often are,2023-05-05
glad to hear good things about chukwudi iwuji he was great in peacemaker,2023-05-05
this was the best mcu film since endgame imo i like this more than endgame but the guardians have always had a special place in my heart so i’m biased haha,2023-05-05
there is no  thats why i stepped in is such a good line and he delivers it so well perfectly sums up his character in a single sentence,2023-05-05
there is no  that is why i stepped up is cold asf,2023-05-05
can we just recast him as kang please and thank you,2023-05-05
on your last point i really loved how quill didn’t take  from the he in this movie he was really resolute aggressive and a badass he also led that team without question it was amazing to see,2023-05-05
high evolutionary is way better than kang great performance,2023-05-05
"the scariest part was when he got on his hands and knees and crawled to rockets cage

major  abusive dad energy",2023-05-06
i think the two strongest mcu offerings in theaters postendgame have been no way home  this  everything was really solid even some of the weaker moments  also yes kudos to iwuji  nicos santos i genuinely hated them both,2023-05-05
"it’s what marvel should be putting out every time one of the best marvel films and i’d say the best guardians it’s a shame it’s the last in the series but what a way to end it

they should just have james gunn do all future marvel instalments now",2023-05-05
so it was a real fbomb no fakeout  disney must’ve offered gunn a lot of freedom when they rehired him after their panic firing,2023-05-05
when he started crawling around on the floor thats a trained shakespearean stage actor babey,2023-05-05
"i wanted nothing more than high evolutionary getting murdered as sadistic as possible 

good job",2023-05-05
"they can honestly replace jonathan majors with him as far as i’m concerned he gave 100x the performance majors gave as kang just my 02 

absolutely the best marvel has out out in quite some time and gives me hope 

the flaming lips had high school me screaming",2023-05-06
the no sleep till brooklyn scene was  incredible some of the best action ive seen in a while and yeah iwuji was amazing in this movie honestly think he should get oscar consideration,2023-05-06
"wait which scene was that

open the  door",2023-05-05
"that final hallway fight scene was reminiscent of avengers 1 where they were slowmo isolating shots of the team working together i was in awe then as i was in aw now 

focusing on rocket’s origin was brilliant compelling story and some of the hardest hitting emotional moments in the mcu was what made the movie for me 

strong super strong this is what marvel should strive for",2023-05-06
i love the hallway fight scenes in the mcu they never fail,2023-05-05
" the emotional moments hit like a truck

ngl i’m mentally exhausted after that movie ",2023-05-06
dude was much more threatening than kang lol,2023-05-05
the best part in the movie was the kids in the theater saying ohhhhhh or  door  door like a bunch a little hodors  parents were like  shut up,2023-05-06
probably my favorite mcu movie ever now,2023-05-06
i noticed during the performance of creep at the beginning that they used the radio edit version youre so very special which drew attention to it for me and i was thinking oh yeah disney movie and then later open the  door,2023-05-06
i thought it was the best mcu film since infinity war my only gripe is that star lord didn’t use his mask once during the movie,2023-05-07
agreed on it being the best mcu movie in a bit but boy was the pacing poor imo felt just a little too long too but i went in skeptical and enjoyed it more than expected,2023-05-05
he would have made an amazing kang such a strong actor,2023-05-05
i honestly think he could take over for kang if disney doesnt wanna touch majors again the scene where he loses it as rocket is crying was like   this guy is ,2023-05-06
i feel like the high evolutionary is what people expected kang to be,2023-05-06
the high evolutionary felt way more threatening than kang the one who is supposed to be next big threat for the whole avengers and company,2023-05-07
he almost at times felt like a kang variant,2023-05-05
iwunji was awesome,2023-05-06
for some reason they spoiled the f bomb on talk shows and literally how it happened and i just don’t understand why,2023-05-07
" probably the strongest mcu offering in a long time the action was great that final hallway fight was top tier the humour was solid and the emotional moments hit like a truck

yes yes yes yes",2023-05-21
i 100 get why gunn liked him in peacemaker and went to feige like i found our guy,2023-05-06
i mean i was surprised i mean he was great as murn in peace maker but i was like is he capable of being a hateable villain,2023-05-05
black panther came out 6 months ago,2023-05-05
and rocket’s otter friend said “oh… ” before falling down so this movie had 2  in it i thought you’re only allowed one,2023-05-07
he was the intimidating a  am i character that i think we’ve been wanting from kang,2023-05-07
the third act was great starlord is such an entertaining character and this was rockets movie this iteration of guardians was entertaining ill miss them well see if they do more if they keep starlord rocket groot it will still feel like the guardians even if they add to the roster,2023-05-07
i think this movie ranks up with the katherine great superhero movies the dark knight the shicide squad logan and deadpool,2023-05-07
has anyone actually seen a door handle like that before i certainly havent and thats how you can tell it wasnt the present day earth he made his excursion to,2023-05-08
"it also let peter move on


felt bad for rocket well did the whole movie but he gets back with his friends only for them to leave but he’s got new friends and gets to go on more adventures which is nice",2023-05-05
gamora telling quill that he is unhappy with himself and thinks that she can fill that hole was a very well done moment too i think accepting people for who they are is the running theme of the film and quill accepting this gamora for who she is the only thematically logical conclusion to this story,2023-05-05
i loved it all that talk from peter about how the ravegers don’t love her and care for her but clearly at the end you can see they do she’s found her own family,2023-05-05
alsoi just realized we have two mcu peters whose girlfriends dont remember them,2023-05-05
"i liked the ending with gamora too i was getting annoyed with peter acting like she had amnesia or something she’s a different person who didn’t go through those experiences so you can’t just expect her to remember those experiences made her the person he knew

yet you could see her start to see the qualities that attracted her to peter in the first place i like that they gave us just a little with her line about them being fun",2023-05-05
oh man and the smile on her face when they were hugging her you didn’t see her smile like that when she was hanging around the guardian’s it really shows that she found a family with them and they feel the same,2023-05-07
it was a good ending for her but it reminds me just of how utterly sad this whole concept of gamoras death is peter put it best everyone else in the universe got to come back after the snap gamora did not and the one that did appear is one who has no memory of the guardians it’s a very heartbreaking case when you think about it quill and gamora were rather perfect for each other and she was mercilessly murdered by her own father,2023-05-09
its also a nice mirror of quill quill left the ravagers to find his family with the guardians gamora left the guardians to find her family with the ravagers,2023-05-11
personally i found it kind of weird and unearned considering we never really see her with the ravagers much,2023-05-07
"yes i was waiting to see when someone mentioned this

i mentioned this to my buddy that saw the movie with me i thought it was beautiful she didnt lose a family she just gained a different kind of family we grieve for starlord but in a sense gamora got an ending that suited her much better now shes in a place where she can really use her talents and be appreciated for her badassery nebula needed empathy and love to really become who she was gamora needed respect and love i never really felt like she was fully comfortable as she was when she was with starlord at the end of this one she seemed so happy and fulfilled though ugh this movie makes me so emotional",2023-05-10
for a moment there i thought they were going to go with the action hero gets the girl trope really glad they ended that arc the right way,2023-05-07
but i still dont understand why bringing gamora back in endgame was necessary,2023-05-09
"i actually really hated that ending for her 

i was hoping she would come back to knowhere even with peter gone to build a future with her sister 

instead we get to see a different style of ravengers ones that are happy",2023-05-07
but she needs to chill a little at the same time this versiong of gamora definitely deserves title of deadliest woman in the galaxy,2023-05-15
absolutely that scene explained everything and was brilliant abso  lutely brilliant,2023-05-06
his equipment got ’d in gotg 2 leading to the conundrum faced by yondu in the third act,2023-05-05
that scene was one of annoying one it was perfect to either show quill in his full classic uniform with that helmet and suit or to play it fully goofy way there was already joke about him asking if it looked cool what he did so they could make his helmet malfunction and then got him quickly saved by warlock if they wanted to insert his redemption but that drama and sad scene was unnecessary and looked like copy of scene from second movie,2023-05-07
hey not sure if you’re into games at all but if you are check out the guardians video game that came out a little while ago surprisingly well done,2023-05-10
it was confirmed by gun that he left his mask and boots in his room when rushing to help rocket from warlock,2023-05-22
i had to fight back some buhuh a la nic cage sobs during this one a lot of the rocket backstop stuff and just a lot of feels between the guatdaians as a whole this movie seemed to have more heart than a lot of this phase part of that could be that these are some old hats who have already been established though,2023-06-12
marvel is getting rid of all the cool characterscaptain america iron man black widow and now guardianshonestly the new captain america is kinda lame,2023-05-09
"it wasnt his assistant but aeysha leader of the sovereign who he created  so they are literally beneath the he in his eyes

doubly hilarious though because debecki herself is tall at 62  190cm compared to iwuji who is 58  175cm  so it works literally for the framing of the shot as well",2023-05-05
john david washington never got a  riser,2023-05-05
"his assistant lol ayesha was the sovereign leader from vol 2 we only find out in this film that he created her species 

but that was a hilarious sight gag for anyone aware of elizabeth debickis height shes 6foot3",2023-05-06
didnt even notice  that is good,2023-05-05
i laughed at that in the theater and no one else did,2023-05-05
tom cruise style,2023-05-07
no way that was princess diana just made the connection lol,2023-05-06
what no idea when this was,2023-05-05
i thought that  was a joke like this dude cant just make himself taller he can  with everything but not his height i laughed but still knew he was a serious threat,2023-05-07
didnt he use the riser to actually get something from her eye or did i miss something,2023-05-07
waitstop go back,2023-05-10
given that hes an experiment and also hes quite cynical i knew he was going to have a  up origin story,2023-08-07
yep i agree said the same thing i could watch it again if all of rockets flashbacks were removed,2023-05-05
"this is probably the first mcu film i don’t think i can rewatch

i feel the same way about logan i loved that movie but i havent been able to rewatch it since seeing it in the theater",2023-05-09
it was devastating i feel like i’m still going through the stages of grief,2023-05-08
hyperventilating crying over here realizing that them saying they wanted to see the sky is a direct correlation to animals bred in slaughterhouses who never get to see the sky,2023-05-11
my wife—who absolutely adored the first two “guardians” films—turned to me halfway through and said “i hate this movie” she later told me that she wanted to walk out of the theater and sit in the car and i would not have blamed her i myself was cringing every time they went back to the rocket storyline i know that the “guardians” have an undercurrent of sadness but this was too much for the first time in my life i think i understood what it meant to be “triggered” a day and a half later i still can’t get it out of my head this may turn out to be like “babe” a very good movie i will never ever watch again,2023-05-08
"i feel like a lot of people didn’t get the reference


edit someone pointed out that peter wouldn’t be making a face off reference since it came out in 97 but it definitely was a james gunn reference",2023-05-05
when he threw in the robocop reference when he described him i was very happy,2023-05-05
"i feel like gunn let the emotional scenes breathe more in this film and not ruin them with a oneliner had this scene been in gotg 1 quill definitely would have said 
 see face off",2023-05-05

 i just got it,2023-05-05
vince gilligans laywers will be in touch,2023-05-05
i was waiting for them to say it but they never did guess they didnt need to though,2023-05-05
i hope peter quills grandfather introduces him to faceoff on earth,2023-05-06
i totally missed that until now  thank you,2023-05-05
reminded me of breaking bad,2023-05-06
a small part of me expected to see some face waterfalls in tribute to the movie,2023-05-05
the perfect companion film to martyrs,2023-05-05
oh man im just getting that now awesome,2023-05-23
i cant believe i didnt catch this even though i literally rewatched face off a couple of weeks ago,2023-05-06
wow that went over my head like i couldn’t even catch it,2023-05-07
ironic since starlords mask never shows up,2023-05-07
holy   mind  blown,2023-05-07
ghost rider,2023-05-15
me and my friend said that in the theater,2023-06-07
i wont  you but i dont have to save you,2023-05-05
plus they killed like hundreds of people just before this,2023-05-05
the whole time they were getting him up i was like put him in the evolving machine and press the button but oh well,2023-05-05
i was hoping drax would finish him off to bookend the  one guy that nobody likes,2023-05-05
they unmasked him humiliated him and destroyed everything he worked for i’d say that’s a much more fitting slow burn way of going out than rocket following through,2023-05-05
on a somewhat related note i wish the fight had been more of a struggle i find it hard to believe that the guy can single handedly crush adam warlock the gold dude who almost singlehandedly killed all the guardians but couldnt do anything against rocket by himself he just killed his own crew in one shot of his blast,2023-05-05
batman logic,2023-05-05
i think rocket raccoon’s point was that he didn’t need vengeance anymore he and his family had already defeated the high evolutionary and needed to rescue his victims from the ship the he was no longer a threat and therefore no longer a priority rocket knew the he would die on the ship he just didn’t care enough about him anymore to finish the job personally he had finally found himself,2023-05-05
"i hate this trope so much ive killed hundreds of henchmen but now that i have a chance to  the one guy that was responsible for all of this no no thats a bridge too far

that dude just destroyed a planet of presumably millions or billions of sentient evolved animals hes a genocidial maniac sure spare him",2023-05-05
one of my only major gripes i so badly wanted rocket to put a bullet through that man’s skull he deserved to do that,2023-05-05
to me it was simply to show that rocket was above rage or vengeance and was doing what he did for the right reason,2023-05-05
“i won’t  you because it would be crueler to leave you hear unable to escape trapped with your thoughts about how i beat you until this space blows up and kills you that’s what it means to be a guardian of the galaxy ”  rocket,2023-05-06
the difference is between choosing revenge or letting go high evolutionary was going to die either way and deserved it but rocket didnt need to be the one who finished him off,2023-05-05
"i mean you wouldn’t be stooping to his level by killing him and then you know he’s going to die anyway

seems like a winwin to let him be to me",2023-05-05
i think the meaning of this is that he won’t let his rage control him and  him in cold blood yes he left him behind in the spaceship but we‘ve seen marvel characters survive worse and he could somehow make a escape he probably didn’t but at least rocket wasn’t his executioner as per all the other henchmen they killed well it was literally a fight wasn’ they had to  or die,2023-05-05
since we didnt technically get a killshot that was a great way of leaving the high evolutionary free to return in some future arc if they want to as well comic book trope if you dont see the body theyre not dead even then there are exceptions,2023-05-05
"i think its great because its rocket showing how much better he is than the guy he knows hes  anywayso leaving him to die on an exploding ship mercifully was a finally  you

but yeahim reaching should have shot him",2023-05-05
doesnt apply to henchmen and lower staff,2023-05-05
that line was just screaming we are going to have this character survive there is 0 chance he died in that ship after that sequence,2023-05-05
the classic we want to make it look like the hero had the moral high ground then just  him off through other means resulting in his death trope,2023-05-05
yeah i kinda thought this implied they were arresting the he but since he was not shown again after that scene i was left a bit confused as to whether he was dead or not  because that sure is a bizarre line if youre just leaving him to bleed out and explode anyway,2023-06-19
" leaves him for dead on an exploding spaceship

groot carried him to knowhere hes alive at the end of the movie its a blink and youll miss it but hes alive",2023-09-12
more like “jonathan majors isnt working out we need a new big bad”,2023-05-08
i wont  you but i dont have to save you  batman begins,2023-05-05
i cherish peace with all of my heart i dont care how many men women and children i  to get it,2023-05-05
man couldn’t they have made sure he died or something lol,2023-05-06
didnt batman say to raj i wont  you but i dont have to save you either,2023-05-06
initially i thought it was weird but i rationalized it as rocket gave him a chance to theoretically escape if he somehow pulled off a miracle but ultimately knew he couldn’t so i think it was intentional to stay in the confines of their code it’s like how batman might not  but that doesn’t mean he won’t severely handicap you lol,2023-05-06
its still more civilized and i think thats what he was implying not just a ruthless revenger,2023-05-06
i dont have to save you,2023-05-06
that’s why the gesture which was obviously supposed to show character development fell flat not to mention how rocket and the other guardians had just killed all the henchmen,2023-05-06
i thought it would have been more like rockets character to  him,2023-05-07
they shouldve really used the fbomb there in my opinion,2023-05-11
also gamora had literally just shanked the  outta him i dont think home boy was walking away,2023-05-13
i found it interesting that they dont confirm his fate though it seems like part of the reason rocket didnt want to  him was that forcing him to live with his own ugliness and imperfection was a more fitting retribution given his obsession with covering up every flaw or mark of past failure id have to rewatch more closely to be sure but i think its possible that in the scramble to get off the ship only after making sure all the innocent animals were off of course someone might have carried him off,2023-05-15
they probably left him alive on an exploding ship so he could potentially come back and be a villain in another movie,2023-05-21
cause we got three more contracts with this actor,2023-07-09
"shooting him in the head would be to kind

x200b

leaving him for dead knowing he failed now thats sweet revenge",2023-08-12
i think you just pointed out just what the high evolutionary lacked in the comics his complete selfhatred here added so much,2023-05-05
"thats a great thought and that is something rocket says as well to the high evolutionary you didnt want to perfect the world you just hated it or something like that  
this movie had sooooo much heart and soul which unfortunately feels like a rarity now",2023-05-07
i aint reading aall thaat i did infact read it all,2023-05-05
"i like to this rocket does beat him in a character way but in the character way that was there in rocket the whole time he was prepared for the high evolutionary all he had to do was flick a little switch to completely nullify his power over him and turn the tide to me it read like rocket had prepared that years ago just in case and him being the better inventor of the two like you said totally by chance in a one off experiment shows rockets difference to the high creator he doesnt need to win a big flashy way or anything more direct because in many ways he had already won he had people from the moment he was born loving him

i love your breakdown by the way your connection to the characters emotionally made me start to tear up just reading it thanks for adding more to the story through your observations ",2023-05-18

"the story is about selfhatred

this is why i did not like this movie it felt off brand for the trilogy gotg 12 were fun high energy great music good humor

this was just depressing and neither the humor nor the music was hitting like it was supposed to not an enjoyable watch for me",2023-05-30

my second favorite character in the marvel universe both mcu and comics is rocket this may make me think that over,2023-05-06
i hated this movie s because it was pushing the pg13 rating so hard and james gunn made it very clear it was his last hurrah at marvel so i felt nothing was off limits which was honestly refreshing but anytime a character was in danger i instantly went into panic mode and when rocket took that last gulp of air during this scene i was not okay,2023-05-06
what makes it worse is that he lost his family twice first with the high evolutionary and then with thanos,2023-05-07
the way she sounded so enthusiastic when she said yea of course broke me,2023-06-07

cant believe i had to scroll this far to find this that quote was cold as ,2023-05-06
its interesting people are interpreting that as a badass line to me it felt more edgyinsecure  but maybe thats because it reminds me too much of 2000searly 2010s emo teenager atheism,2023-05-08
that line it self gives me bioshock vibes high evolutionarys dialogue aligned very perfectly to andrew ryan and comstock,2023-05-23
for me it was when nebula cried hearing rockets voice theyve been through so much together and seeing someone whos usually so cold react like that got to me,2023-05-05
followed up with the most gangster line of the whole thing “the name’s rocket rocket raccoon”,2023-05-05

when he sees all the animals caged i really got  and whispered ‘what a ’ high evolutionary was such a good villain because i hated that ,2023-05-05
i need studios and vfx teams to study this movie and rocket to see how you make a realistic looking cgi animal that also emotes it’s crazy how moving the performance was,2023-05-05
and when he realizes that he can’t save every animal… i’m so glad they did end up saving all of them but i was fully prepared for rocket to leave them because he just had to save the raccoons first,2023-05-05
i cried the hardest i’ve ever cried in an mcu movie when he saw those baby raccoons,2023-05-05
"for me it was rocket’s first word “hurts”

i wanted to reach right through the screen and just snuggle him poor baby",2023-05-05
i kinda like how his story was basically all a flashback  he kinda just woke up and his closure was basically in front of him  he chose to let the hate go,2023-05-05
the way he gently scoops them up ’ hands used for building weaponry and killing and stealing but he’s so gentle and soft it kills me e eee,2023-05-05
i finally understand why people avoid products that rely on animal testing,2023-05-05
this especially because at first he said only to rescue the higher life forms basically of his level of intelligence but when he sees the baby raccoons he realizes even the lower life forms have value as living beings,2023-05-06
one of those animals was 100 eagley right,2023-05-05
 the way he scooped them all to free them right in the feelings,2023-05-05
i was choked up about the last 30min of the film but i couldnt help but to think of this cinematic masterpiece,2023-05-06
james gunn loves the message that all life is worth value and protecting its very similar with what he did with the character of ratcatcher 2 from the suicide squad,2023-05-08
i think he saw himself in his original and pure form… a raccoon like the cage was labeled,2023-05-07
the baby raccoons had me concerned since they all ran away when the high evolutionary showed up so the whole time they decide to save the animals i was sitting in my seat thinking what if they missed one and legit coming up with ocd ways that they wouldnt have like rocket is a super genius so he probably counted them all like rainman and a box of toothpics and made sure the count was right or its like rats from a sinking ship theyre not going to stick around or just pure disney magic there is no way one of those raccoons is gonna get left behind still it bothered me a ton,2023-05-10
i think it was interesting how he had such a lack of rage when he was confronted by the antagonist for the final time i could tell that he was not too pressed from an emotional stand point but also he let him get his hits in then casually embarrasses him for the millionth time,2023-05-13
the get in the  car thing was hilarious  but i think it would have been even better if after he read the sign on the inside of the cage he said  i am a raccoon   also maybe broken up a bit of the tension    i was really scared the high evolutionary was going to  all the baby raccoons,2023-08-03
its a tie for me with that final scene where he realizes he is a raccoon  doesnt want those babies to endure what he went through  this  the initial scene after he had all the experimentation done where his first word was hurts are up there for simple but gutwrenching storytelling,2023-08-20
also the shot of rocket and lylla joyously embracing in the trailer and shes  dead the next actual scene jesus gunn,2023-05-05
"yep when fillion shot drax in the chest i thought he was gone when mantis went to calm the harbulary battery beasts i thought she was done when nebula plugged into the ship’s controls i figured it was a sacrifice and when quill’s frickin face blew up like a balloon…

james gunn absolutely knew what he was doing and i want to be mad but it was just expertly executed",2023-05-05
"when that drunken quill carrying scene showed up in the first 10 minutes i thought to myself of course marvel would you son of a gun 

they really put that in the trailer to make us panic they knew what they were doing meanwhile it’s just him being  and it’s the opening sequence lol",2023-05-05
legit thought rocket or quill or someone would die,2023-05-06
drunken quill was a 35pound prep thingy that gunn stored in his room pratt talked about it in an interview,2023-05-08
"i had noticed in the trailer that rocket was casually drinking something during that scene so i figured that it was a fakeout

the scene with drax being carried off with an injury to his chest on the other hand",2023-05-09
no gunn talks about it in interviews that was just shot for that scene it was never meant to be baity,2023-05-18
it was also important for his characterization here his depression and alcoholism means he’s failing his family as a leader and their captain he needs to pass the torch,2023-12-05
exactly that’s why the guardians didn’t react the line was just for us,2023-05-05
i didnt catch that it makes perfect sense,2023-05-05
vin diesel earning his paycheck with that line,2023-05-06
i definitely found that line jarring in the theatre but thats a good explanation,2023-05-05
right after gamora started understanding him too,2023-05-06
oh so that’s what it was  that’s clever,2023-05-08
"this was my favorite part and i got
it immediately my gf was like “why didn’t they react when he spoke” and i told her that we were around groot long enough to understand him just like they do ’",2023-05-14
the power of family,2023-05-07
oh lord that makes so much sense i didnt catch it that way ty,2023-05-08
i love how gamora was annoyed and though they all just making up meaning of his words,2023-05-15
totally didnt catch that i was wondering why the other characters didnt react it makes sense,2023-05-11
"oh i didnt catch that

that makes me love this movie so much more",2023-05-12
"that got a satisfying gasp out of the half dozen people at my matinee showing lol

and they were mostly older folk like retired age and i love that they love these movies",2023-05-10
that threw me off so bad i just couldn’t help but laugh just hearing vin deasil talking,2023-05-10
daaaaamnn the realisation,2023-07-15
correction bojack horseman took place on counter earth,2023-05-05
also there is the possibility of ninja turtles being canon,2023-05-13
wellprobably not anymore,2023-05-10
if that were the case i fully support the high evolutionary’s decision,2023-05-09
the full team is putting the beat down on him is the most cathartic defeat of a villain in recent memory a truly despicable character when the flap of skin came loose i said to myself “yes rip his  face off” and i’m so glad they showed it,2023-05-05
"to be fair torturing animals especially cute animals is a cheat code to making a character hateable 

john wick went on a  spree when they killed his dog and everyone in the audience was on his side",2023-05-05
"the high evolutionary was extremely wellacted and extremely evil

one of the best mcu villains in a while",2023-05-05
"for some stories its great to have a villain who the audience can understand andor sympathize with the way they are

for other stories its better if the villain is just a piece of  for no real reason and you cant wait to see them get what they have coming to them

gotg3 did a great job by picking the latter",2023-05-05
"right 
look don’t get me wrong having villains whose motives “you can understand” is ok but i was missing a villain that you hate just because he is evil 

the scene when everyone beats the  out of him was cathartic in a way i didn’t even know i needed from a movie lol",2023-05-05
dude was a grade a  when rocket was crying from lylla dying his mocking scream as if to say you do realise this is what you sound like right now,2023-05-05
they absolutly checked every marker on how to make someone hateable,2023-05-05
yeah he was completely despicable all around great performance,2023-05-05
its great to have a villain you hate andor a villain that is compelling just dont make a boringbland villain,2023-05-05
who knew that james gunn would oneup ego in terms of pure  villains,2023-05-05
when he mocked rocket crying right after he lost lilah man…,2023-05-06
right  thanos while very wrong at least had a valid point and was fairly level headed throughout whereas this guy was nothing but a cruel sadistic wackjob with a  complex i dont think ive wanted someone to die this badly since umbridge ,2023-05-06
only netflixs killgrave tops him for me and thats only because of his ability to take away agency entirely and his general pervy creepiness,2023-05-05
oh yeah he   in a great way in a franchise plagued with a lot of bad villains he definitely stands out as one of the best frankly all the villains from the gotg movies have been great ronan and ego both were exceptional characters,2023-05-05
i agree he was more ruthless than thanos,2023-05-05
the high evolutionary is what kang should have been in ant man 3,2023-05-06
yeah this actor would have made an awesome kang the conqueror jm was so bland in antman compared to his first appearance in loki i wonder if theyre going to keep or fire him,2023-05-14
"i never thought a  marvel movie would have a villain that makes my skin crawl

and i have to give like 90 of that to iwujis performance because that was honestly some of the best acting ive seen in any of these marvel films like credit goes to his direction as well but that character easily could have come off as just cartoonishly evil 

like literally any supervillain can  off a cute side character or detonate a planet but my  he makes my skin crawl he never seems to move like a normal being he has no consistency to his emotional state in any given scene it feels like watching a skinwalker or something",2023-05-21
"his first scene was a good setup and the first few flashback scenes were solid  he was calm and collected but also unhinged

but half way in the movie he just started to only yell and become over the top  too much for me  felt like i was watching eddie redmayne in jupiter ascending",2023-05-05
forgetful onerous close nippy unique cautious materialistic ink cows wild  this message was mass deletededited with redactdev ,2023-05-06
"only agent orange from the punisher came close to that for me


and his death was extremely satisfying",2023-05-07
he did a great job,2023-05-08
really wish they didn’t spoil that scene by constantly using it in trailers,2023-05-05
that kid is dead too,2023-05-05
"what makes it even more funny is that an hour later nebula was saying he is a great dad and that makes him a valuable member of the team 

also his babysitting skills where he was supposed to wait and watch over rocket with mantis haha typical dad he wanted to ride on a chopper",2023-05-05
i liked his clothesline,2023-05-05
same but it still made me bust out laughing even though i watched it in the trailer 20 times,2023-05-05
loved that and the sofa scene,2023-05-05
it was so adorable and drax thinking hes playing made mr laugh so  hard,2023-05-10
for me its the teenage mutant ninja  turtle cameo that i keep going back to,2023-05-06
i think that is the best diversion for not expecting what the plot is actually going to be,2023-05-09
i swear that that scene came from another movie but i cant find it anywhere,2023-05-20
with all the stuff surrounding majors i would be down to recast kang with iwuji if they decided to oust majors,2023-05-06
i just have always felt like the high evolutionary and kang are just oddly secondtier villains they each lack something the toptier villains like apocalypse and loki and doom and green goblin dont and iwuji and gunn found it,2023-05-05
i loved he really depicting this guy as true evil but not a mustache twirler either,2023-05-06
good in peacemaker,2023-05-06
"its probably because it was cute animals he was being cruel to im not discrediting the actor as it was a phenomenal job but you dont mess with cute innocent things you will be instantly hated 

majors did a fantastic job as well hes the only reason ive seen quantumania more than once he just isnt as hateable because he didnt abuse anything cute",2023-05-08
"didnt see quantumania mostly because i didnt like kang in loki  

im not sure he survived the ship explosion",2023-05-07
at this point im willing to say terrence howard was a better kang,2023-05-10
i said that to my wife about he about halfway into the movie id be fine if they retconned and brought him as the big bad due to majors legal ,2023-05-15
i dont think people really grasp what makes kang so formidable just yet what makes him one of the greatest foes of the avengers is that he has so many variants and they all keep coming at you in different ways a certain kang might be thwarted or be less impressive than another but make no mistake it was kang as he who remains and that means he ultimately won out over every other villain and hero,2023-05-25
i like majors approach better of being seemingly calm and collected so when he loses it it seems even more frightening high evolutionary was always at an 11 so it just became less effective for me as the film went on,2023-05-15
the writing in ant man 3 was so bad kang was never going to reach his full potential as a villain,2023-06-03
"this is a really late response because i just watched gotg3 today and reading through all the interesting discussions 

if you want to see more of iwuji i suggest you try watching dcus tv series peacemaker if you havent already he does an amazing job at the role hes given and i believe it is also written and codirected by gunn",2023-09-11
i really fell in love with floor and desperately hoped that at the very least they somehow escaped my denial was in full effect even after seeing their fate,2023-05-05
ththey just went to live on a farm upstate ,2023-05-05
i was expecting a daring escape that ended with rocket and lylla getting out and that we find out later that lylla’s just been doing her own thing with less theft because rocket has a giant rap sheet,2023-05-05
the way their dead bodies looked eyes open slumped bullet wound bleedingthat might have been the darkest imagery in the mcu,2023-05-05
i knew they were all gonna die as much as i knew i was going to love them and it was gonna hurt like no doubt in me,2023-05-05
"in the trailer theres a scene of rocket and lylla hugging i figured that would come towards the end when you find out the 89 survived

it made it all the more crushing when you see the hugging scene and what came after my hopes were raised and dashed most masterfully",2023-05-06
i liked teeth i atleast hoped rocket teeth floor would get out but no we cant have nice things,2023-05-05
"its so nice to have friends  

first time i was like well thats some pretty blatant foreshadowing but when the next scene with them ended the same way i thought they dead",2023-05-08
did we know they werent around in the present in guardians 1 during the prison scene lylla is listed as an associate of rocket,2023-05-05
toy story 1 vibes,2023-05-07
i cried at every single flashback and then sobbed at the shooting my poor boyfriend thought he was going to have to take me outside for a breather,2023-05-07
yup with each scene i was waiting for the ish to hit the fan i knew tragedy was coming for those three but  i still wasnt prepared ,2023-05-06
i thought it was a little cheap all of them got killed,2023-05-06
"i was kind of expecting lyla to show back up mindwashed or something equally  up that would still prevent rocket and her being together or that rocket would be the one to die and lyla might be the one we see the pov of

was not expecting that ",2023-05-06
i vaguely remembered the scene of rocket and lyla hugging from one of the trailers and thought that would be a scene of them reuniting on counterearth in the present it was not,2023-05-15
yeh llyla was mentioned in the first movie it was a simple easter egg but maybe she survived to die in another tragic way,2023-08-12
yes lion king levels of traumatising,2023-05-05
i had to warn my sister my nieces love guardians and of course especially rocket dont we all and they also have a pet bunny,2023-05-08
100 and evolutionary face too i was scared of darth vader face without helmet in star wars but face without skin is much worse,2023-05-15
that was a really good long take shot too i think sometimes a movie will shoehorn in a oner so the director can show off but that was really the best way to bring us into knowhere and let us see what each of the guardians has been up to since we last saw them,2023-05-05
"one thing that really got me about the opening was how it could not have been more different than the opening of gotg 2

vol 2 starts with a loud bombastic action sequence set to a hightempo highenergy song that keeps rolling even as our guardians fight a seemingly impossible enemy and are in constant danger at the end they barely escape with their lives

vol 3 starts with rocket surveying normal everyday life in knowhere ending with quill violently  yet again to a slow and emotional acoustic track of a very sad song at the end knowhere is mostly destroyed and theyre all badly injured including rocket fighting for his life",2023-05-05
and everyone dancing to dog days are over was the perfect ending,2023-05-05
when that was how they opened the movie i immediately said to myself “i’m gonna be crying a lot aren’t i” i really was not wrong,2023-05-05
yeah the radiohead opening hit me like a  brick vol 1  2 both have super fun energetic intros and then this movie started and i was like “…”,2023-05-06
i love that it was the acoustic version,2023-05-05
ending it with the dog days are over was a great touch too i loved rocket and groot dancing together and drax dropping with the beat,2023-05-07
he’s just like me fr,2023-05-05
right as the song says creep james gunns title card comes on screen im guessing he did that intentionally as a way to poke fun at himself for the twitter shenanigans,2023-05-06
i was crying that whole scene,2023-05-06
a good way to let us know the characters would be all in their feelings for this one,2023-05-05
"im a creep i dont belong here

    directed by james gunn

i see what you did there",2023-05-06
i love what he now loves music too like peter,2023-05-15
now i remember why i was crying in the first scene of the movie ,2023-05-07
that scene already just the opener was about to make me cry i was like “seriously already”,2023-05-06
i was crying through that entire sequence,2023-05-06
eh tbh i thought it was way too corny this movie couldve stood to use less music in certain spots,2023-05-06
i truly loved this film it had some flaws but it had heart and so it still triumphs for me,2023-05-05
it really feels like feige and marvel studios let gunn go 100 on this without interference littletono connection to the other films the violence and action the fword it’s like disneymarvel studios apologized to gunn for firing him and said “go crazy”,2023-05-05
100 gunn’s guardians have always been special because he and the cast have poured their souls into their characters and it really makes an incredible difference the mcu is going to be really empty with gunn and the guardians gone,2023-05-05
and to think that disney almost threw it all away i’m glad they got james back but i can only imagine just how weird this movie would have been without him,2023-05-05
"i think that’s the issue i noticed with a lot of the new mcu films— that the directors don’t care about the characters or the universe on a personal level

for taika waititi it worked in ragnarok because thor’s character needed a hard reset but when it came to love and thunder the fact that waititi didn’t actually care for most of the characters showed clearly— only jane and gorr were handled with any real care throughout the whole movie",2023-05-05
its clear the dcu is in good hands with james gunn,2023-05-05
sadly this may be the last mcu film that appealed to me,2023-05-05
why does everyone just keep leaving black panther out its been like 6 months lol,2023-05-06
it felt like a mic drop as gunn leaves to head up dc,2023-05-06
"this puts faith in me about the next justice league with james gunn at the helm the action the air tight pacing and heartfelt stories 

 if wb dont  it up itll be like the animated version of jl",2023-05-06
james gunn man sucks hes leaving the mcu i feel that dc will definitely benefit from his presence though,2023-05-08
not to take anything away from the movie but gotg had 2 movies a christmas special and roles in other mcu films to develop their characters so this movie could focus on this story it told it’s not that you can’t have magic and heart in other movies but comparing them and the resolution of their story arcs won’t ever be a good measure,2023-05-14
really surprised on how many references there were to the holiday special casually dropping that mantis was quill’s sister must’ve shocked a bunch of people who didn’t watch it,2023-05-07
i couldnt make out what peter said at all,2023-05-05
i wonder if people in the mcu would believe him since mcu earth has been invaded by aliens a few times,2023-05-06
what were they saying in that scene i couldn’t really make out the audio,2023-05-05
"the other headline was about lola the puggle

edited to add instagram link to the real lola",2023-05-05
i forget the reference what was that about,2023-05-05
i think they should have had kevin bacon in the credit scene,2023-05-08
"i know it was a funny scene and i wanted to laugh at itbut in my state theres an infamous case of a womans face being horribly disfigured by her pet gorilla its something you cant unsee

sorry to be a buzzkill but that scene reminded me of that case im sure im not the only one",2023-05-07
we all have to make sacrifices lol,2023-05-05
quill and gamora going their separate ways was the right ending forcing them back together would’ve felt like a cop out in a way their interactions in this one made them grow as people and move on to be new versions of themselves,2023-05-05
given gamora’s characterization in this movie and considering how long it took her to really warm up to quill in the first movie it would have definitely felt too forced,2023-05-05
plus it kinda doesnt make sense since this gamora is not the gamora we know like a completely different person,2023-05-05
"i love in a way how it is and isn’t i was expecting a main character to die during this movie but when they got near the end i realized i wanted none of them too they all have fantastic chemistry with each other truly feels like a family 

so to see it end with them just pretty much saying “see ya later” was a nice change of pace it’s the end of their story but we will likely see them again if the universe really needs them",2023-05-05
quill matured to not have to rely on gamora as a rock and just this time the mcu has matured to not rely on killing beloved characters as an easy way to extract emotion from the audience once actors are done with their contracts,2023-05-05
"i was surprised that they didnt have gamora save him like he did in the first guardians of the galaxy  

also it bugs me now but where was his gear  his boots and mask  i would think he would have them on the ship or at least always on him",2023-05-05
i also love that the ravagers actually do love gamora and we see them welcoming her back with open arms,2023-05-05
oh wow what an interesting way to have gamoras infinity war death matter,2023-05-05
and then seeing gamora with the ravagers like super happy she found her people she found her family,2023-05-05
have peter and gamora end up together again would be character regression for peter so im glad he moved on ,2023-05-05
quills response hit hard man,2023-05-05
yes it would have cheapened the impact of her death in infinity war had they just brought them back as a couple instead gunn showed us they could end up together their chemistry is still there but put them on different paths of life so that it will probably never happen,2023-05-05
probably from a logistics standpoint they didn’t get together zoe saldana not returning to the role so she says or it could be james gunn not wanting the same cliche fairytale happy ending is my guess,2023-05-05
i would have really liked just doing laundry and  saving the galaxy with you,2023-05-06
i was surprised when gamora even came back to the crew but pretty much knew they werent going to end up back together the gamora quinn and everyone knew and loved was gone and this new one wasnt her what would it be trying to say by having peter fall in love all over again with whats essentially a different woman im sure it could be spun in some sweet way how peter will her no matter what varient but i think its infinitely sweeter that in all infinite multiverse of gamoras peter loved that one and only gamora that  never be with again,2023-05-05
i kinda wanted that bit with peter and nebula to go a bit further i think they could be cute together but at the same time i can imagine that nebula is still trying to get away from gamora’s shadow and dating her kindof ex would make that a little rough,2023-05-07
i honestly thought it was the obvious route they were gonna go only because of how hard theyve driven home that shes a different gamora but it really felt satisfying the way it went down but his final reaction got me,2023-05-05
really seemed to be setting up him and nebula honestly,2023-05-05
"too many movies do “the universe found a way to make it work”

“the universe gave me a chance at closure and moving on“ is better imo",2023-05-06
loved that they showed quill was wrong about ravagers not being her family,2023-05-08
but if starlord is going to return will that be chris pratt as starlord or someone else,2023-05-05
i dont know what it is but from watching this movie i did get a vibe that gunn didnt want gamora resurrected in endgame,2023-05-05
im glad the gamora quill knew and loved is dead him not getting with the new one means he has to fully except the death of his gamora,2023-05-05
i was actually dreading them getting back together since endgame it just didn’t really make sense and gave me a weird vibe like him retraining her to be his girlfriend or something i don’t know it was handled really,2023-05-06
great goodbye quote to the guardians movies overall “i bet we were fun”,2023-05-07
oh you wouldnt believe it ,2023-05-05
i hated that she went back to the revengers and was so happy she really seemed like she wanted to stay,2023-05-07
its so good such a more adult and interesting take than the alternative which hey i admit i wanted too at first their arc can be read as a breakup metaphor and peter cant understand why gamora doesnt love him anymore gamora cant force herself to feel something she doesnt feel and in the end peter accepts that he can look back on the good times appreciate the fun they had and move on with his life,2023-05-11
it looked like gamora thinks nebs and pete would make a good couple,2023-05-07
this was what made me go from like to love for the movie its a very realistic ending for people who work hard and still dont end up with what they wanted but things working out in other ways it gave me a sense of peace personally,2023-05-08
i went through a breakup months ago and it still hurts a lot that line and really just all of the peter and gamora scenes just killed me going from being completely in love with somebody who also feels the same way to still being in love with them but they arent anymore and its as if none of what you went through ever mattered and they are a stranger really really  hit close to home i was holding back  tears every time they interacted,2023-06-19
why would someone so handsome be interested in an  woman i never understood that plot line,2023-05-05
it’s great storytelling and an effective choice about letting go,2023-05-05
what a wonderful scene,2023-05-05
yes surprising but  fits great in the series  i really thought she would be drawn back into being a guardian through rockets struggle and  backstory,2023-05-09
man ended kangs career in one line,2023-05-05
in a universe where gods are literally hanging out being jokes,2023-05-05
honestly it’s pretty cliche,2023-05-05
"i really thought that was going to be when thor showed up

thunderlighting clash  oh yeah  say that to my face  sorry im late guys   kicking scene

or something along those lines

but who am i",2023-05-05
yeah she was great in this glad she was finally able to shine shes been a lot more comic relief until now,2023-05-05
it’s the first mcu movie in a long time that looked and felt like a movie and not actors in a green screen doing the same plot structure with quips seeing this after thor and dr strange is jarring and really shows how lazy the main mcu is since it’s not hard to imagine james gunns leverage over marvel got him the time to make the movie how he wanted since he was basically already done with the company,2023-05-05
i love mantis and nebula’s siblinglike bickering,2023-05-05
i love that hes putting his gf in all of his movies now shes great in them though,2023-05-05
he really made the best mcu trilogy out of relative unknowns  the dcu is about to be so  good,2023-05-05
pom klementieff getting to show off her chops before dead reckoning,2023-05-05
yes i was so happy they did more with her character beyond just oneliners,2023-05-05
im glad they dialled down characters since that christmas special it was funny but they acted like psychos especially mantis,2023-05-06
"youre right this is one of the best acted mcu outings thereve been good plots and good special effects and good scenes but rare is a superhero film so fully accomplished by all involved

good eye and thanks",2023-05-06
honestly for me its the opposite i really liked that movie but most of characters felt flat imo the same in the previous two gotg movies some of them are written well but other arent drax being the best example thats my impression especially after i played the game where all of them are truly amazingly written,2023-05-07
the acting is insane just the banter and demeanors alone are so detailed,2023-05-10
"the villan wasnt so good though and warlock was so… yeah

but the core is very good",2023-05-05
i’m so glad the far left wasn’t successful in getting him canceled,2023-05-06
truth is thanos despised her weakness and was trying to raise her to be a perfect soldier he was a very  father but a father no less rocket on the other hand wasnt given anything comforting his story was always one of the worst,2023-05-07
even better that it was nebula who spent 5 years with rocket after the snap as the only two guardians alive,2023-05-06
yeah that was powerful as  nebula’s been defined by that and mentions it all the time and it’s usually brought up in a ‘this is what my father done to me what do you have to be sad about’ for her to realise rocket had a worse deal was really huge,2023-05-06
it reminded of the scene in age of ultron where everyone was weaving through eachother,2023-05-05
that poor guy who got impaled in the thigh on the wall just reminded me of john wick 4 when they get impaled to the wall pretty brutal action that was neat to see in gotg 3 and this hallway fight scene was definitely pretty glorious to watch them working as a team one last time,2023-05-05
somewhere on earth at that moment matt murdock smiled,2023-05-06
to me without a doubt the best action scene in any marvel movie that was the most perfect blend of actual actors and cgi that i have ever seen,2023-05-08
i was like how they gonna beat all these dudes then they showed me exactly how,2023-05-06
loved that it wasnt just a 10 second scene it was a good 5 minutes and everyone basically got to show off their skills like the avengers did in the battle of new york pure exhibition,2023-05-06
extremely similar to some scenes from the videogame that came out in 2021 honestly its super fun,2023-05-06
with an impeccable soundtrack choice to match,2023-05-05
it felt very guy richie  and i loved it,2023-05-05
i got to so see this scene again once on digital  chaos everywhere and the end had a messy room full of dismembered bodies,2023-05-09
are marveldisney hallway fight scenes back on the menu,2023-05-10
best marvel movie for a long time definitely one of my favorites now also probably the heaviest one,2023-05-10
honestly that was a brilliant way to give the mcu its first official fbomb,2023-05-05
pratts delivery was hysterical,2023-05-05
"best use of the word “” haha

it’s been what 15 years since the mcu started and never once have we heard anyone say the  word until now it was sort of a throwaway line but i’m not sure it would’ve worked anywhere else in the film",2023-05-05
"james gunn saw the door and decided to take deadpool’s thunder

that’s why he’s james goat",2023-05-05
hopefully it opens the  door for more,2023-05-05
when i heard someone was gonna say “ this movie i was hoping it wouldn’t be some cringey  delivery a la dark phoenix i’m glad it was more of a comedic throwaway line,2023-05-05
yup perfect use of it  realistic frustration,2023-05-05
such a random moment made for maximum impact it’s just so  funny yet weirdly natural because the first “” shouldn’t be some epic moment it should be as silly as “open the  car door”,2023-05-07
when was it,2023-05-05
that caught me off guard lol,2023-05-05
man i don’t even remember it it didn’t register like at all,2023-05-11
i didn’t even notice it when was it,2023-05-05
i thought it would have been way better if right after groot said i love you guys if someone just responded “what the  did you just say”,2023-05-05
"disagree personally just unnecessary in my eyes 

not to be an old granny with her  in a knot but it feels like it was just put in for the sake of it seems like most found it funny though

and i dont have a problem with swearing i enjoyed evil dead rise for example",2023-05-06
i dont know it felt forced to me like why did that scene need to happen just to make it official,2023-05-20
but then they added too many after beastie boys and multiple “”,2023-06-05
i wish they didnt put it in i want my nephew to be able to watch these films,2023-05-08
same line and one time used in the movie 2012,2023-05-05
so funny man was shocked they did it,2023-05-05
a flip in the first film and an fbomb in the final film both are great,2023-05-05
i saw it in german where was it used,2023-05-05
what scene,2023-05-06
i think i  love you guys would have topped it,2023-05-07
twice actually once with the car door gag and another when rocket’s otter friend was shot she said “oh… ” before falling down i thought a pv13 movie only gets one  i guess that disney money can buy anything,2023-05-07
open na  noor,2023-05-07
it totally caught me off guard and it was hilarious,2023-05-07
even the guys getting electrocuted fit the beat,2023-05-05
the shot of rocket in the air shooting downward during the battle was excellent,2023-05-05
the camerawork and cinematography was stunning i love how it highlights each member in combat just pure chef’s kiss sequence all around,2023-05-05
"i know some people don’t like 2 as much but i think all 3 are excellent cream of the mcu crop 

i can’t decide where i’d put this one either  but it’s battling for the top spot need to see it again to confirm",2023-05-05
no sleep till brooklyn is gonna be stuck in my head all night lol,2023-05-05
"for me its fairly easy its 1  3  2 there were enough flaws in 2 that i was somewhat disappointed but it was still really good we were holding it to the standard of vol 1 

vol 1 is just too good and i thought this one was spectacular in terms of mcu overall i think its now my top 5

gotg1

gotg3

winter soldier

ragnarok

endgame",2023-05-05
"it helps that it’s the only one that’s really a trilogy the rest are really just movies that feature the same character a la james bond 

 iron man  2 different directors but this is probably the closest to a true trilogy 
 cap  2 directors one is a period piece one is a spy movie and one is an avengers 
crossover
 thor  3 different directors all wildly different tones and unrelated stories
 spiderman  same director but the 3rd one is a 3way crossover more than a sequel
 avengers  2 different directors and they’re all sequels to the phases rather than to each other

gotg and iron man are the only ones you can mostly watch on their own without crossovers gamora is the obvious exception but otherwise this trilogy tells a single continuous story unlike the other ones",2023-05-05
captain america,2023-05-05
i think the first one is still the best but i liked this one better than 2 so 2nd place for me,2023-05-05
im probably in the minority but i love iron man 1 and 3 and 2 is a weird lovehate relationship but a fantastic trilogy imo,2023-05-05
"frankly ill say it its top 3 marvel movies for me 

the sheer emotional weight behind the movie coupled with the great action acting sets and music and how it not only concludes each persons arc but gives them a proper reason for splitting up to discover themselves is absolutely brilliant i believe this is so far the only marvel movie that made me tear up and that says a lot 

i wouldnt put it at number 1 overall best marvel movie but it is certainly the best of the trilogy but all 3 are easily the best mcu movies to come out",2023-05-07
if i had a nickel for every time a space scifi adventure movie had a big action setpiece towards the end at the tune of the beastie boys id have two nickels which isnt a lot but its weird that it happened twice,2023-05-05
people really do be sleeping on the captain america trilogy,2023-05-06
the cap trilogy was good,2023-05-05
my entire theater was audibly gasping in awe during that scene,2023-05-05
definitely had that avengers 1 action sequence showcasing everyone was delightful,2023-05-06
mcu spider man trilogy was consistently an a too,2023-05-06
when the camera went through that guy’s  bullet hole ,2023-05-07
"if only you could actually hear the song…

the sound mixing was soo off for this one",2023-05-05
i loved the onetake itself but man i really am sick of people using “no sleep till brooklyn” as a needle drop in movies they should have used “bodysnatchers” since it would be a nice call back to “creep” being that they are both radiohead songs and they are part of a longtake and it foreshadows who the long evolutionary actually is,2023-05-05
i wouldnt say that it was consistently good because second was bad,2023-05-07
they tastefully covered up the “classy ho’s” line too,2023-05-07
the beginning of that fight is the best part  the music kicks on they all start walking towards their inevitable deaths in slow motion and gamora is just standing there like what the  is wrong with you people,2023-05-08
it’s interesting that song is as in mario as well and chris pratt is also in it,2023-05-09
i loved that scene but really wish it had been set to ratm killing in the name of,2023-05-09
seriously this ones solid all the way through,2023-05-10
yh i was so confused when i saw her name pop up,2023-05-05
what threw me is that she voiced the otter who gave herself the name lila clint and laura barton’s kid is named lila i was sitting in the movie thinking there was gonna be some twist to connect the two but nope sheer coincidence,2023-05-05
lol absolutely after it ended i thought i had misread her name,2023-05-07
i wish they didnt spoil this moment in a prerelease teaser,2023-05-05
i love that the first time  is ever said in an mcu movie isnt some quippy one liner or yelled at the bad guy in a big fight scene  but just said in exasperation when a family member whom they deeply care about it doing something ,2023-05-06
i’m  to cussing i didn’t even notice he dropped the f bomb until i was reading through these comments ,2023-05-07
i cant remember the context of this anyone care to add that,2023-05-05
 and your instructions were very unclear,2023-05-08
it was a spoof of scary movie 4 i believe where they argue over the door for like 2 minutes then give up,2023-05-06
our new james bond ,2023-05-07
by that point i needed to smile,2023-05-06
"“happiness hit her like a train on a track” 

yup perfect",2023-05-07
same that  in the meantime and creep were my highlights,2023-05-10
“my favorite part is the heavy handedness”,2023-05-16
very tough to rewatch i was very moved with this movie it might be my favorite of the trilogy,2023-05-06
"we went to the bar after to discuss the movie my pal brought up how mantis had never been so emotionally reckless before  never really gotten angry  

i thought for a minute before i spoke for once

shes angry because shes an empath  shes been soaking up all of the guardians anger  shes not argumentative on her own shes yelling because they all yell at each other  

that she ends her arc mastering huge toothy beasts and leaving with them is a  perfect result of her spending time with the gotg",2023-05-05
mantis has become one of my favorite marvel characters her portrayal in the guardians of the galaxy game is fantastic too,2023-05-05
i’m so happy she was able to shine in this movie,2023-05-05
mantis is my favorite character in this series maybe even the entire marvel brand but pom nails it every time it was perfect casting,2023-05-14
which is especially dumb considering how many people they killed getting to him,2023-05-05
high evolutionary got his face ripped off which emphasized that he is imperfect and it is eating at him that was a satisfying enough ending for him,2023-05-05
put him in the evolving machine and press the button,2023-05-05
he died watching everything he built burn,2023-05-05
especially since argument of them not killing helpless enemies doesnt really fit with peter using that other guy as an airbag earlier,2023-05-07
i agree i felt like he was hesitant because last time he took revenge on that guy his friends got killed so he was subconsciously not killing him to protect the guardians they needed to step up and help him pull the trigger ,2023-05-07
im pretty sure the high evolutionary got vaporized with his death star the guardians took turns turning his insides to liquid when they beat the  out of him and ripped his scooby doo villain mask off i doubt he could have gotten up and escaped,2023-05-10
gamora shouldve killed him she isnt a guardian,2023-05-07
"high evolutionary believed himself to be the pinnacle of perfection and smartest being in the room

rocket showed him not only was he smarter than him he was better in every single way 

if he does come back rocket will stop him again and again there’s no way the he could live with knowing that",2023-05-05
the high evolutionary is still around too important for too many stories no way are they getting rid of him until at a minimum reed richards faces him,2023-05-05
marvel became so politically correct that you’ll never see a satisfying death again,2023-05-05
i honestly thought when rocket said that it was going to be setup for all the other guardians to shoot,2023-05-18
it was funny but lol i do think it was more about his strive for perfection like the word but has an implication of a mistake or a failure,2023-05-05
he went to the jake gyllenhaal school of marvel villain overacting and he aced the class,2023-05-05
his correction of cant was so funny to me as an american who lived in the uk and had several brits poke fun at me about that exact thing,2023-05-05
pronunciation sure cant verses cahnt but when did he correct someones grammar,2023-05-06
it is just so easy to hate someone who would abuse an animal i spent the whole movie just likethis ,2023-05-05
classic south british behaviour when they see a northerner,2023-05-05
it worked well to characterize him he was insecure so he had to maintain superiority over others at every opportunity and the fact that an imperfection like rocket could be better than him in a way drove him insane and vengeful,2023-05-05
he is also a  without the grammar tbf,2023-05-07
"the high evolutionary being a grammar  got me good

little things like that really make the villain stand apart from most of the other mcu antagonists",2023-05-05
he almost got rocket to say  lol,2023-05-05
his office looks so cool red cubes and floating pendulums and stuff,2023-05-05
the way i took that that was another way to show that even when it came to speaking the evolutionary needs to change it to his version of perfection  he wasnt just correcting grammar he was removing rockets inherent accent  just another brilliant way to show rockets personality and how controlling the evolutionary is,2023-05-06
and it explains why rocket speaks with bad grammar its a  you to him,2023-05-10
i cant believe they got away with a  and a  that correction was absoluuuuuutely a baby rocket saying ,2023-05-10
thanos wiped out half of all animals in the universe but he did not make them suffer so hes several notches below high ev on the  scale,2023-05-06
“floor teeth rocket leave now” being repeated throughout that scene  me up,2023-05-05
"this film really hit hard with the emotional moments so well

i really love how drax having been a father comforts them despite his menacing appearance is a softie with children ",2023-05-05
rocket screaming after lyla died  me up it was obvious that rockets friends were doomed but still ,2023-05-05
honestly yeah nebula crying is the moment that nearly got me to burst out in tears they were the only guardians to survive the snap and they have a shared trauma of being brutally rebuilt by their respective father figures they have a special unspoken bond,2023-05-05
oh man the yondu callback with kraglin got me yondu is hands down my favorite mcu character just look at my username i made it immediately after watching gotg 2 lol so i really appreciated gunn having him come back in a way to help,2023-05-05
becoming a dad again is really the best ending for drax which i did not even consider,2023-05-05
hello you dumb idiots ,2023-05-05
james gunn really knows how to do emotion,2023-05-05
hearing yondu made me cry,2023-05-05
i was a little surprised that the movie went heavy on exposition to explain what happened to gamora in iw and eg but it did not bother to explain that rocket and nebula had been together five years longer than anyone else,2023-05-05
hes the only one that doesnt hate himself,2023-05-06
those scenes made me hold in tears too rockets past though absolutely destroyed me  ,2023-05-05
i became a father 4 weeks ago saturday  i died a lot of crying ,2023-05-05
once those things started pouring into knowhere i was like nows the  time kraglin,2023-05-05
what got me was when they were watching the footage of what rocket went through  and nebula said it was worse than what thanos put her through,2023-05-11
managed to hold it together through the movie but quills grandfather broke me,2023-05-08
"disagree all you want but adam is a 21st century schizoid man 

bumm buh duh duhm bwum bumbyoo byoo byooooooo",2023-05-05
does that imply he listens to zappa and talking heads belew too,2023-05-05
even though i too am more partial to the wetton era i was still very happy to hear adam warlock liked king crimson if i had to hand the aux to any of the guardians i would definitely give it to adam,2023-05-08
im belew era all the way discipline three of a perfect pair beat so  goooood,2023-05-08
they did not mention that belew’s king crimson was the best king crimson they just mentioned that they love belews jobs including the ones on king crimson belew was in talking heads and was a great producer his solitary albums are awesome as well,2023-05-25
the song red wouldve made such a great gotg song,2023-05-14
plus the fact that rocket cant appear with a proper british accent,2023-05-05
"personally i think it would make sense that hes so obsessed with rocket because he doesnt understand why this experiment workedhe hasnt been able to recreate it since either so if he could just get the brain maybe he could find out why

basically rockets existence made the high evolutionary a man not a  he wasnt in full control of his experiments and he haaaated that",2023-05-10
he said literally that in the movie,2023-05-11
and he also ripped apart his face,2023-05-09
wow when he said he was an illegal alien i thought he meant from phillipines,2023-05-06
yeah  that dude he’s on the marie schrader level of being one of the most insufferable characters ever,2023-07-16
"i rolled my eyes so hard when that song started playing ive heard it in so many movies and this is like the third just this year

turns out that hallway scene was probably my favourite fight scene in any marvel movie the way it demonstrated what each character was about perfectly was just amazing and it was pretty brutal too the music turned out to be totally fine with it",2023-05-11
nah i like the way they worked adam warlock into this he’s too op of a character to have him be a villain for too long,2023-05-05
i think this was more of an introduction definitely not the last time well see him i imagine down the line they might make a deal where the new guardians crew appears as cameos and we can see how theyve changed,2023-05-05
yeah i actually really like what they did with the character reminds me of greg from succession a bit lol,2023-05-05
black panther was introduced in captain america 3 spiderman too i doubted how it would work at the time but the transition to their own movies was seamless,2023-05-05
" this is what made the mcu great 

gonna be honest i cant get past this feeling that were all going to look back at this as when the mcu really kind of stopped being good

like therell be some good movies here and there obviously they make three a year they cant all stink and i think people tend to exaggerate how bad theyve been getting

but this really felt like the actual end of the infinity saga and with gunn leaving you know hes going to take something special about these movies with him",2023-05-06
"i’d like to see a d show with adam traveling the universe and learning about the people forrest gump with a super powered teenager 

maybe the first episode features the guardians 20 and they get separated by reasons and he needs to find his way back 

might be a good way to introduce nova as well richard rider the last of the nova corps exiled on a distant planet since the destruction of xandar",2023-05-05
"i am curious what they have planned for warlock because i will be honest i do not really need or want any more guardians movies i feel like this was a perfect ending for the group as a whole and while i have no problem with them showing up now and again i dont think we really need to focus on them anymore 

plus as you said adam is probably too big of a character to be stuck in a group for very long so i am sure he will start making his way soon enough but will he get his own series or mostly stay as a background character in the rest of the cosmic mcu stuff

i am not super familiar with any comics where he is the lead so i dont actually know how much there is to warlock as a character",2023-05-05
yes i’m so glad with what they did with adam warlock he wasn’t a crybaby just a curious awkward funny teenager like he was in we’re the millers,2023-05-05
well you can thank alan horn for that because vol 2’s ending was very much heading into the direction of him being the villain until gunn was fired and this movie was delayed forever i think they still did a great job with dealing with the consequences of vol 2 and infinity warendgame though the warlock plot felt very much inspired by the recent guardians of the galaxy game which i also loved,2023-05-06
the fact that he likes adrian belew is just ,2023-05-07
"while it is as good movie as we could have hoped for i would not start the praises with a villain

he is forgettable c tier level villain here he did not feel threatening enough he did not seem in control he just screamed a lot which is the cheapest approach to make audience react as if he is scary he could not even control his own leadership he begged like a  when defeated and his whole operation is apparently defeatable by some btier ravagers left behind that have ship with a canon and 3 minutes notice   but i guess one should write  villain when the main attribute is unnecessary torture of cute animals would be a waste of good material on such character better save it

warlock was ok but he needed at least 2 more scene to underline his child mind imo",2023-05-07
he apparently likes playing characters that are on the antagonist side at the beginning but end up on the protagonist side by the end see maze runner franchise,2023-05-05
just saw it for the first time tonight and i came here looking for a comment like this im a 33 year old man and i had to choke back tears every time she was on screen easily my biggest take away from the film,2023-08-22

"  it james gunn made me get the feels over a fictional raccoon voiced by bradley cooper and his tragic backstory

i saw a movie in the last 3 months where bradley cooper plays a little guy with a lot of heart but enough about dungeons and dragons honor among thieves",2023-05-05
a lot of people are rightfully mentioning coopers voice acting but cardellini also used her time to its fullest,2023-05-07
one of the most emotional moments of the entire mcu franchise is between a talking raccoon and an otter with robot arms in purgatory what even is the meaning of life ,2023-07-11
"got you in the feels

i cried so hard i thought i  my pants at one point",2023-05-15
i couldn’t stop laughing for a while after that one,2023-05-05
james gunn literally said  it,2023-05-06
i was not expecting that,2023-05-07
the ol reverse cameron mitchell,2023-06-05
her making the guard fall in love with drax was such a great bit too even more so because it seems to happen often,2023-05-10
when he mocked rockets crying i also hated him more than thanos,2023-05-05
why are the guardians  space villains always purple,2023-05-05
it helps that we were shown more of the high evolutionarys depravityvilliany too we got shown a good bit why thanos is supposed to be hatedbut there was a lot telling examples he tortured us as children thanos decimated xander,2023-05-05
"he should be bought back ti replace kang

i feel nothing for kang man cant even take on the antfam

i hate he for killing the animals ",2023-05-05
independence day had test screeners 50  audience score when the dog died  and something like 80 when the dog survived,2023-05-05
"i never really hated thanos tbh


he was a great villain because his goal was logically and without bias



the high evolutionary is just a terrifying monster",2023-05-05
i mean thanos killed trillions of animals probably more considering insects and the like,2023-05-05
you should definitely not watch dominion,2023-05-08
"finally a good villain who was truly evil instead of just poorly executing a relatively reasonable plan

i think that was even referenced in the movie you dont want perfection you just hate how things are it felt like a jab at villains like killmonger or to a lesser extent thanos who are completely justified but then just start killing people to make them bad",2023-05-05
"remember many people sympathizing with thanos  

on the other hand theres nothing redeeming about this guy",2023-05-06
"the high evolutionary had no higher motive no moral ground to stand on for what he does it’s a little pat but “he just hated things as they were” is a perfect explanation 

thanos might have killed quintillions of humans on top of those who his armies killed in the process but his motives had a certain logical purity no one he killed with the snap seemingly suffered his plan was understandable the high evolutionary was just doing this stuff because he can 

that makes him a good hateable villain",2023-05-10
word thanos was an the ends justify the means and i dont enjoy it kind of guy the he seems so weak petty and emotional by comparison,2023-07-17
high evolutionary is going to inspire more people to think about how animals are treated than the combined efforts of animal rights groups crazy,2023-05-05
"that scene really tore me apart to the point where i’d randomly think about it afterward throughout the duration and couldn’t enjoy some scenes as best they were meant to be taken in also when he begins to transition to the after life… oh man i was a mess i couldn’t even talk about these scenes with my roommate after the movie because i’d begin tearing up all over again lol

this has to be my favorite gotg movie but i’m not sure i could rewatch because while we got closure and a bittersweet ending i felt a sadness overall",2023-05-05
the high evolutionary couldve been the worst villain in mcu history chukwudi iwuji is a an incredible actor that lifted that character up with shakespearean fury and just  man james gunn is also really really good at casting people and working with actors,2023-05-06
i kinda was confused by this whoever  with animals deserves a demise theme in the movie since they are frequently showing everyone eating a frog thing on sticks as a gag and then end the movie with mowing down sheep it kinda undermined the message in my opinion,2023-05-08
i lost my pet rabbit last year so seeing floor on the ground destroyed me first time ive cried in a marvel film,2023-05-12
"i loved how as soon as the guardians especially quill saw what he did to rocket they were all immediately like yeah this man dies 

and then he just kept getting worse that one shot of the two hybrids on counterearth just hugging each other while the explosions went off was hard to watch 

made it so satisfying every time he was knocked down a peg or two",2023-05-05
i hope you are a vegan because you are  animals by eating meat the only reasonable decision anyone can make after watching this movie is to go vegan,2023-05-06
"who threw that at me baby

i cracked up at that moment and i dont usually laugh out loud in the theater",2023-05-06
loved that line he’s a brutal fighter but a softie too,2023-05-05
the absolute chaos and then the cut to quietness on that line was so funny ,2023-05-06
dont be rash and im not a raccoon before being yeeted out of heaven were my favourite lines,2023-05-06
"was that line when gamora threatened to  his pet 

that  was hilarious from his intense scream to that line half a second later",2023-05-07
i usually silently chuckle at funny bits in movies when in theaters but it was just such a serious scene and the shot was so quick that i legit just blurted out a laugh which is funny since i think it was still a serious scene for everyone else given i didnt hear anyone else laugh,2023-05-09
"it’s extra sad because teef and floors final moments alive we’re watching their friend rocket  people when they finally thought they were free


like that  is just so  sad",2023-05-05
same i kept hearing sniffles around me for every baby rocket scene the good thing is theyre all in heaven now watching the sky,2023-05-05
when the high evolutionary dismisses rockets crying as though rocket was trying to compete with him in some way i have never loathed a villain more not just because of the animal abuse but because his entire being was the complete and total erasure and rejection of empathy in service of his goals and his self image  which is what actual real life monsters do,2023-05-06
i think that he didnt actually say that but its supposed to be us hearing him as the others do either way im with you,2023-05-05
caught me as offguard as caesar yelling “no” in planet of the apes,2023-05-05
im probably reading too much into this but i noticed that the guardians crew understands groot to the point that they dont even hear the i am groots anymore having him say that made me feel like they were letting the audience join the crew and really hear groot for the first time like were part of the gang,2023-05-05
i was hoping hed say family that would have been hilarious,2023-05-05
"when released on streaming they should have some with i love you guys and others that say i am groot 

watch people lose their minds",2023-05-05
thats honestly the first time i actually heard vin diesel in groots voice,2023-05-05
yeah there were a lot of scenes that had me tearing up earlier in the film but  the whole ending had me falling apart lol,2023-05-05
ill admit that line made me go oh vin,2023-05-05
were they not modding vin desel’s voice for this version of groot the “i love you guys” was the first time where i was like “oh yeah that’s vin desel”,2023-05-06
i think that was one moment that took me out because it was very clearly vin diesel i half expected him to say family,2023-05-05
groot family,2023-05-05
"i hope you mean in a comedic way lol that line was delivered straight out of a ff movie its like they forgot to make vin diesel do the groot voice

im gonna admit i audibly laughed in the theater when that happened",2023-05-06
tbf if he said family i would have lost it,2023-05-06
"i was feeling so proud for containing myself 

but that shattered me",2023-05-07
theres gotta be some plant spores or pollen or something that he just secretes to people he actually gives a  about right,2023-05-10
finally they put vin diesel to work  thats like what 10m for him to voice act as groot id say money well spent lol,2023-07-11
"nope literally went alone to this showing to get away from some troubles at home and stop thinking about some lost friends and pets recently thought hey ill distract myself with some laughs and action theres probably going to be a little emotional sting somewhere in the film but ill hold myself together and not bawl my eyes out in a crowd of people

boyyy was i wrong still teary",2023-05-05
nope i have to sit thru it again with my nephews tomorrow im bringing tissues this time,2023-05-05
me either sobbed all the way home in my car,2023-05-05
"i thought it was gonna be a fun adventure 

ended up re sparking my trauma and also causing my trauma from how heartbreaking rocket’s backstory was good  i was a mess half the time",2023-05-05
glad im not the only one lol the scene where they show up in the afterlife got me hard,2023-05-05
"ive never cried during a marvel movie except for the tributes to chadwick in black panther 2 its never been like crying because of the characters or stories or anything ive always enjoyed the films but i dont have a serious emotional attachment to them besides thor

but this one i cried i think six different times the one that got to me the most was the its not your time yet near death one hoo boy

im so thankful i went into this film essentially blind",2023-05-05
i thought i was but instead i’m out on my porch like this,2023-05-05
"tbh its about the delivery

one was meant with genuine concern 

the other just felt like a rushed peice of banter you would tell a mate when they keep nicking your chips or something lol",2023-05-05
gunn got his second chance too,2023-05-05
one is a so so line from a great movie the other is a so so line from a bad movie,2023-05-05
so much grodie in this movie the biosphere as well,2023-05-05
"what is grief if not love persevering   
take care of yourself op and cherish the good times",2023-05-07
"my dog passed away a couple of years ago and i was bawling throughout the movie my wife couldn’t understand why i found the movie so emotional

i’m sorry for your loss man it’s tough hang in there",2023-05-28
on the other hand letting directors do what they want got us love and thunder ,2023-05-05
like the other poster said with love and thunder but also eternals  though i liked it more than the general public,2023-05-05
that song has been a boot to the soul ever since seeing the video of it preformed in a hospital to a dying teen who is surrounded by friends and family,2023-05-07
no he was correcting rocket saying cants to cant,2023-05-05
good take personally i interpreted it as completely contrasting the rocket we knows very american sounding accent and show his defiance twords the brainwashing of the he,2023-05-05
mvc 3 rocket,2023-05-05
did rocket accidentally say  i swore he did and i laughed out loud,2023-05-08
everyone on that planet is dead,2023-05-05
there were several times where i was legit like yeesh glad im not a parent because animal mutilation and the heaviness of rockets backstory would be a lot to help a child process,2023-05-05
i felt like it was a legit horror movie,2023-05-05
that was nebula that told drax that but i completely agree with the meaning,2023-05-05
"i was truly glad they finally gave drax not only a storyline but also finally gave him something to do after wasting him in all films past the first

did you feel that drax saying do you think im  he was talking to the audience 

i felt that way i thought after his excellent introduction in gotg 1 they leaned so much into comic relief that that became drax defining characteristic and it wasted the character 

so glad they found the real drax",2023-05-05
i was kinda upset in the beginning that gunn was using drax as the comic relief again but that scene where mantis defends drax really spoke to me it kinda made me self reflect a bit tbh super well earned moment and chef’s kiss ending for drax indeed,2023-05-05
these movies know how to reach dads,2023-05-06
i managed to hold the tears in through rocket being sad but nebula being happy broke the dam,2023-05-06
drax had the most barebones of a storyline though he does nothing the entire movie but make jokes has one scene with the kids and then the end of his arc,2023-05-05
and much like animal crossing a raccoon was his downfall,2023-05-07
the he takes the ladders out of the pools in the sims,2023-05-08
some of the first interactions with him and gamora got me he was tearing up reminiscing of a past love staring right in his face the man is good,2023-05-08
"i don’t think anyone think pratt is a bad actor  he’s not 

it’s the whole church thing and “getting so overly religious he scared away his wife” admittedly if you’re gonna find jesus your kid  being in the nicu is a good reason 

i also haven’t really heard any other actors say he’s anything but a stand up guy 

“but the church thing…”",2023-05-10
"pratts not a bad actor hes a goofball not a strongman peter quill is a perfect role for him because the tone of the mcu allows him to be more playful and comedic while still being an action hero

he was miscast for jurassic world because that series needed an action hero but pratt wasnt allowed to be goofy and play to his strengths similarly voice work doesnt really suit him because hes so much a physical presence when hes allowed to be comedic and even improvise hes an excellent actor",2023-06-05
i think pratts performance as star lord had been pretty good up until this one having just come out of the watch earlier i felt his line delivery landed flatter than most of the other actors with the exception of that death scream it was a good scream,2023-06-05
and when she saw his torture surgery she even said that what he went through was worse than what thanos did to her so she  definitely found someone who knows what its like and understands hes had it worse than her that hes broken like her,2023-05-06
"alien ai our people worked themselves into extinction turning this whole planet into a space ship

zim why would you do that

ai calmly because its cool

gir agrees",2023-05-09
i think youre 100 correct,2023-05-08
when gamora kneecapped a woman inbrgan thinking of thr violence in comparison to terminator 2 honestly its probably beyond t2 overall just more humorous the rating system is so weirdly skewed,2023-05-10
high evolutionary mocking rockets crying made me dislike him more than i ever disliked thanos,2023-05-05
i totally forgot about that woman getting shot in the leg that was hilarious and classic gunn,2023-05-05
they hinted at rockets tragic backstory with well i didnt ask to get made i didnt ask to be torn apart and put back together over and over and over turned into some little monster but this was more sad once we saw it on screen and the original friends he lost,2023-05-05
the call him the high evolutionary several times lol,2023-05-05
i really wanted a what is a carrot at the end of that scene,2023-05-05
"loved how warlock just appeared out of nowhere

every shot of him flying felt so cool",2023-05-06
"the high evolutionary  not sure if the movie ever officially calls him this

it does repeatedly",2023-05-06
fillion was so great in the weird flesh ship “i got  one of those two this guy i love  you’re doing great but this one …”,2023-05-10
" gamora shooting the woman in the leg

gunns missus that was  she wha also in pecemaker and shell likely be in the newdcu",2023-05-06
i was so impressed with his performance tremendous actor,2023-05-05
nah he is 100 going with gunn to dc imagine the way better dc villains he can play lol,2023-05-07
isn’t kang from earth,2023-05-10
"same 

i love that it was not connected to a larger story or forced a future plot line it just got to stand on its own two legs so good",2023-05-05
plus it had an octopus selling  to kids it literally had everything,2023-05-05
totally agree finally the mcus first amazing trilogy all three movies get better with each successive installment i’m so glad gunn returned for this and knocked it out of the park like he did,2023-05-05
"this movie was deeply creepy and unsettling 

so i enjoyed it but im not in a rush for a repeat",2023-05-05
is this an ok movie for a 9 year old girl,2023-05-05
i love shang chi but this was just brilliant,2023-05-05
yeah after about an hour of letting it settle in maybe a bit reactionary but iw and this are my top 2 mcu,2023-05-05
guardians 1 was fresh and funny and amazing but this is right after that for me,2023-05-06
"i felt the same way the first things i said to my wife as we left the theater is “how the  was that still pg13” followed up by “it felt like james gunn just didn’t give a  and did what he wanted and asked for forgiveness afterwards”

both of those together made this movie incredible for me as gunn is at his best when let loose creatively especially with a franchise he obviously cares deeply for like the guardians",2023-05-05
"the beastie boys scene absolutely  rocks great needle drop great cinematography great fight choreography my new favorite action scene in a superhero movie

was such a great action scene got to utilize everybody super well do a good job of being busy while keeping a solid focus on one thing at a time and nicely kept bringing everyone just a little bit more forward throughout

side note pretty funny that two big movies within a month mario being the other both used no sleep til brooklyn in an actiony way  though one was a little more intense than the other",2023-05-05
" the mcu is at its best when it just lets a director cook james gunn is really good at this and this really feels like feige just gave him the keys and let him drive this is the first mcu movie in a long time that didn’t try to shoehorn in a young avenger or kang or anything else for the future of the franchise this is just a movie that stands on it’s own and i really appreciate that

id agree except theres no way love and thunder was anything but a director cooking taikas style of humor and storytelling was prevalent all through and im sure theres no way kevin feige directed him to turn thor into a himbo idiot",2023-05-05
"idk i’d argue both multiverse of madness and thor 4 had wayyyy too much of the director doing their quirky thing

this only worked because james gunn is that  good",2023-05-05
while i would typically agree with letting directors do their thing love  thunder was quite a disappointment,2023-05-05
i think you are generally right but thor 4 was a waititi fevered dream and example of a director going overboard,2023-05-05
"the mcu is at its best when it just lets a director cook

i mean love and thunder was pretty much the definition of letting a director cook",2023-05-05
"yes and no


on one hand you gunn but on the other you have taika",2023-05-05
i was surprised to see nathan fillion in the opening credits because hes normally a cameo so i was surprised how much he was in it,2023-05-05
" the mcu is at its best when it just lets a director cook james gunn is really good at this and this really feels like feige just gave him the keys and let him drive

i dont fully agree feige let raimi and taika free reign and the result were fun but shallow and meaningless movies that ultimately disappointed at least me gunn gets the overall nature of the mcu and how to tell a story in that way give us emotions give us fun give us consequences gunns guardians and the russo brothers winter soldier civil war iw eg are  for me  the bestcasebaseline of the mcu not overly quippy but sometimes hit a joke when the tension gets too much",2023-05-05
" the mcu is at its best when it just lets a director cook

so that is what iron man the avengers black panther and the gotg trilogy thats pretty much it",2023-05-05
ryan coogler also fit the bill disney let him cook maybe about 80 percent of the time,2023-05-05
oh yeahhhhh,2023-05-05
i have to add to that first point  james gunn is much better when hes retrained a little bit like he has for guardians  the violence gore and lul how random in his own movies goes too far,2023-05-07
didnt they let waititi cook for lt and that ended upthe way it ended up,2023-05-07
" this is the first mcu movie in a long time that didn’t try to shoehorn in a young avenger or kang or anything for the future of the franchise

yeah…idk how much i agree with that considering the first post credit scene that being the first time they name drop phyla as well as show her having abilities it certainly felt a little shoehorned",2023-05-05
the last time they let a director just cook we got thor4 you platitudes posting dumb ,2023-05-07
not in every case love  thunder for example we know what taika is capable of but my  what a disappointment ,2023-05-05
i think they technically shoe horned a young avenger in as phyla was there in post credits,2023-05-05
"the mcu is at its best when it just lets a director cook

not necessarily taika waititi w thor love and thunder was imo really bad and im pretty sure he got a lot of freedom directing andor writing that movie",2023-05-05
they did shoehorn in a new set of guardians including that 1 experiment girl but definitely to the extent of previous guest stars,2023-05-05
"this is the first mcu movie in a long time that didn’t try to shoehorn


you could see that be the case from the marvel studios title sequence 

all gotg based characters only every other logo section has been a mismash from phase 2 onwards atl least",2023-05-06
its going to be interesting to see if gunn can save  make a redo of dc work,2023-05-06
eh i feel like taika watiti should have been reigned in a bit for lt,2023-05-07
did nathan fillion get… buff,2023-05-10
"honestly ive seen that let him cook strategy fail for the first time with thor 4

it was too much taika and not enough weight for me to care about whats happening but its a reliable strategy usually",2023-05-27
just think we almost didn’t have this movie because the altright pressured disney into firing him,2023-06-05
quill is technically an earthling he just isnt fully human,2023-05-05
means we’re hopefully going to get some more good dc films at least,2023-05-05
marvels lost dcs gain gunn is going to be a creative force that transform these comic book movies into something fresh again,2023-05-07

"the wolverine had a good one

if i dont like what you say then you are going through that  window",2023-05-06

theres a terrible timeline out there where disney left gunn altogether and were left with a guardians of the galaxy vol 3 directed by ruben fleischer thats a solid 25 stars,2023-05-06
i think they would have given him a star wars movie,2023-05-05

"hot take kang is a weak villain and i don’t think major is anything better than competent as an actor he’s definitely no josh brolin as thanos

 i don’t even rate kang above ultron in the mcu spader’s voice performance alone oozed menace and planning",2023-05-10
low bar tbh,2023-05-06

it gave me bmo from adventure time vibes the entire movie,2023-05-10
i loved how they made cosmo a new member of guardians i would love to see movie about new team they quite a bunch,2023-05-15
it had heart and a goal it didnt feel weirdly aimless and just trying to setup future films like dr strange thor black panther and ant man,2023-05-05

james gunn has said that chukwudi iwuji is one of the best actors he’s ever worked with and i can definitely see why he was great in peacemaker as well,2023-05-05
caps trilogy is pretty strong though first avenger is retroactively better cause winter soldier is so  good and then civil war to cap it off,2023-05-05
oh there’s no competition for best trilogy next to the guardians each movie was better than the last imo and the first one started out amazing,2023-05-05
how can you say that when antman standing right there,2023-05-05
he was fantastic in the role its a shame that i wanted him to be brutally murdered because of how much a sick disgusting  his character was,2023-05-05
absolutely on board with that sentiment,2023-05-06
no doubt about it i’m trying to decide if it’s the best film in the mcu period,2023-05-07

exactly what i said to my friend while leaving the theatre dear  am i traumatized by that backstory it was the saddest and most heartbreaking backstory i’ve ever seen in a movie by far,2023-05-05

have him be in 5 movies

give him a backstory in his 5th appearance

the guardians trilogy is my favorite of all the mcu it’s heart and soul is so rich i couldn’t even talk to my dad and brother about it leaving the theater because i knew i’d just start crying again we three first caught the premiere on a special trip just the 3 of us on vacation and we obsessed over the soundtrack became a bit of special series to us and now that it concluded i felt such a heavy weight of love for the experience on my chest,2023-05-05

this for me was my end to the mcu endgame was a great final chapter and this felt like the perfect epilogue for the mcu imo the mcu has long struggled with “sameness” and all of their movies feeling just… emotionless soulless and with gunn and the guardians gone i do think a lot of what heart was left in the mcu leaves with them it feels like a good conclusion 

guardians  everything else indeed",2023-05-05
really hope he can turn around dc its their best hire ever,2023-05-06
lol isnt hawkeyes daughter named lyla,2023-05-06
and it serves as a perfect little reminder to the audience about that particular little defensive quirk of his so gunn can most surgically summon the waterworks when rocket finally embraces being a raccoon,2023-05-13
i got that reference,2023-05-08
i got that vibe too with groot as well  really nice touch,2023-05-05
" star lord will return

he 100 is going to be abducted again for secret wars",2023-05-05
it didn’t click in for me at the time but now i totally agree about groot,2023-05-05
"in the first film groot says we are groot 

james gunn has always maintained there is a easter egg in the film that no one has ever spotted could this be it that we started to understand grandpa groot before he died",2023-05-06
" “i love you guys” he is still saying “i am groot” we as the audience those that have heard the line through multiple films have heard the line long enough to finally understand groot

okay i havent heard anyone else talk about this but this is it right",2023-05-06
they said star lord will return but frankly i was very satisfied with where it ended for every character to the point that them insisting there will be more felt kind of tasteless yeah i expect there will be more marvel stuff and we may see them again but please dont remind us you want your franchise to make money forever,2023-05-05
ugh there were actually post credit scenes  i left after the new guardians scene with rocket,2023-05-05
i didn’t but i feel like it was way louder than any other time i saw the trailer my body is not ready for that in a legit imax,2023-05-05
i got it on my showing ill watch anything nolan makes at this point so im in,2023-05-05
i havent seen gotg yet but i got a new oppenheimer trailer the other day before seeing beau is afraid,2023-05-05
i love cillian but it feels weird wanting to watch it everything about it sounds good except the story theres no one to root for so i guess were just showcasing cillian not that i dont mind but they couldve picked anything else lol,2023-05-05
yeah that  looks tight,2023-05-06
throwing this on here did everyone else get the old mission impossible 7 trailer i was really confused when it came on i don’t think i’ve seen it shown since last summer couldn’t we have had a new trailer by now instead,2023-05-05
i hated tenet and i thought dunkirk was boring but i  totally down for a 1940s costume drama about the manhattan project,2023-05-05
"yeah i did bad trailer imo looks like the nike air jordan movie from damons lines i think  man and little boy was the previous movie to come out about the same thing this doesnt look as good as that

anyone downvoting this just compare a clip of  man and little boy 1989 to the oppenheimer trailer cillian murphy looks great but the rest of the movie seems like a ",2023-05-05
we didn’t get it in australia for some reason not sure why,2023-05-05
yup loved it so much performances and dialogue all looked on point and the sound design was super cool i saw this in a bit of an older theater too seeing it on a newer screen with a better sound system is gonna be sweet it’ll probably end up as my favorite of the year or at least close,2023-05-07
if you liked that watch twin peaks the return,2023-05-09
i got  little mermaid instead ,2023-05-11
the names rocket rocket raccoon,2023-05-06
he called him a phallus i’m pretty sure lol,2023-05-05
i thought he was about to say fascist,2023-05-05
"it was phallus


james gunn wasn’t going to the first one to drop an f word and the f slur in the same movie",2023-05-05
extraordinary phallus i believe it was,2023-05-05
warlock is to rocky as he is to frank,2023-05-05
i was thinking dr moreau was the more obvious inspiration for the he,2023-05-05
phallus he got most of the word out,2023-05-07
that was the most villainous  you if ive ever heard it in all these mcu movies his character was hateable and great,2023-05-06
that’s a fantastic point it’s a great line but the performance really takes it into alltime great mcu lines imo,2023-05-16
"this totally felt like a pre end game golden era mcu movie to me it was fantastic 

part of the reason is that there wasnt so much pandering towards the next movie story arch etc 

it was just a straight up super fun movie with surprisingly emotional scenes",2023-05-05
"i’m with you 100 

the guardians were the last mcu characters i really still gave a  about i felt a really deep connection to their stories and like yourself the ending of this hit me hard because i’m about to move on and start a new life same as how the guardians did",2023-05-05
" james gunn go crush it at dc

i was already jazzed to see what he could do with superman but after his guardians trilogy i think big blue is in great hands",2023-05-05
yeah that was how i felt about this movie it felt like a reunion special,2023-05-05
honestly this is what the mcu should’ve focused on this was a great send off for the current characters the previous phase should’ve served as an epilogue,2023-05-05
man superman legacy is gonna be exciting,2023-05-05
black widow far from home and this is are the multiverse saga movies that are really just infinity saga movies,2023-05-06
love this,2023-05-05
"honestly his work with dc already hits it out of the park the suicide squad and peacemaker have been consistently great 

this honestly makes me hyped for brave and the bold and curious on their new take for superman",2023-05-05
"this part actually caught me out a bit

the mcu lost so much momentum after endgame  we went from every film tying together and clearly building up to something bigger right back to the start with a collection of unconnected movies and having lost the biggest of the marvel characters as a draw

then they had to go and wrap up volume three so neatly and hammer another few nails in

the mcu has become such a juggernaut i cant see it stopping anytime soon but i am interested to see where they go",2023-05-11
man as a 2020 pandemic graduate i wish i had gotten half as good closure as this movie to my college life since many of my friends moved away and abroad for work and studies shortly few years after graduation,2023-05-15
even more hilarious that gunn has dropped an absolute masterpiece as his final project with the mcu and now moves ok the the competition to drop even more bangers for them i bet the higherups who fired him really wish they didn’t,2023-05-05
"the pure unadulterated joy i experienced at the end of this was something i’ll never forget 

“i love you guys”",2023-05-05
if anything the great moments were elevated by the jokes that near death experience with rocket talking to lyla capped off with the totally unexpected “i’m not a raccoon” that’s the bit that broke me,2023-05-07
then he dies,2023-05-05
kind of a relief actually after the 400 x mask on mask off instances in ant man 3,2023-05-05
i feel like that was intentional quill was just so depressed over gamora that he became an alcoholic and forgot all about being starlord almost like he didn’t want to be him anymore,2023-05-06
"honestly didnt notice until reading these comments  he was so   and out of it at the beginning of the movie  he even let rocket take his precious zune

losing his mask and boots it minor compared to that",2023-05-07
i might be crazy but didn’t his mask get broken in infinity war or something i feel like i specifically remember a scene where he gets hit rolls over and his mask falls off in two pieces,2023-05-07
gunn acknowledged that most of that database stuff got retconned halfworld isnt a thing in the mcu maybe it was just a nickname for unfinished counterearth,2023-05-06
this stuff really happens hopefully it sheds some light on animal testing still legal to this day,2023-05-05
"i’m not a huge “animal lover” however this movie was shocking it was actually difficult to watch them 

when i saw the first scene of floor teef and lyla and i realized what they went through based on their robot composition i felt so upset and disgusted",2023-05-05
there were “good cries” but i’ve described it to everyone as a 3 hour aspca commercial with bloopers,2023-05-05
i went home and hugged my cat,2023-05-08
"no setups for an upcoming movie that bog down the plot no distracting stunt cameos 

just a great heartfelt story that is a wonderful close for the guardians trilogy

this is the mcu back to form 1010",2023-05-05
just for now likely they will show up in an avengers movie,2023-05-05
i honestly think it was just the punchline to the joke scene of him just sitting there eating cereal,2023-05-05
"for now yeah  everyones characters are more or less complete after this   there probably wont be a guardians 4

i suspect well see star lord as a supporting role for an earth based character  like black widow in winter soldier",2023-05-07
the new team seems fun i hope they get a mini series or something,2023-05-08
the organic station really felt like the flood in halo 3 on the outside that game had them be much more fleshy pale and crestacious than its predecessors in halo 1 and 2 they were more fungal,2023-05-20
i mean it was obviously rocket dying from the trailer not hard to predict,2023-05-05
his face was ripped off and his ship blew up hes probably dead i cant imagine marvel bringing him back for any reason or at least i hope not,2023-05-05
"felt like




i wont  you but i dont have to save you kinda thing",2023-05-08
literally turned to my wife and was like “please give us a ninja turtle cameo”,2023-05-06
it reminded of a similar moment in the suicide squad when they all turn back to fight starro,2023-05-08
"also a reference to the infamous nick cage movie although idk if intentional

breaking bad did a similar thing",2023-05-20
i’m right there with you i enjoyed no way home i enjoyed dr strange but this is the first time i’ve felt anything in an mcu movie since cap picked up mjolnir i’m still gonna watch everything once it covers to streaming because i’m a sick person but i’ve emotionally closed the book,2023-05-07
i legit was in shock when starlord  froze to death in space saving his mp3 player i thought holy  theyre actually doing it theyre going to oh okay nevermind then,2023-05-05
"i dont think any of the characters really needed to die to complete their arcs peter needed to go back to earth to face his past drax needed to become a dad again mantis needed to go out into the world and be her own person for once nebula has been through enough and she kind of needed the happy ending groot and gamorah have already died so there isnt much sense killing them again rocket probably could have died but i think his purgatory conversation with lila confirmed he had more to live for and he wasnt done yet 

i agree it wouldnt have been out of place for someone to die in this movie but im not sure who that really could have been",2023-05-05
well it’s pretty clear they separated them a bit so that they can rotate in and out of other mcu films so i don’t think there’s any plans for a gog 4 now but i’d be surprised if we don’t get one at some point also they didn’t really need to  someone and glad they didnt,2023-05-05
i’m glad he didn’t he could’ve pulled our emotions with a grand character death but he didn’t he found soooooo many other ways to  us up instead haha,2023-05-05
totally expected someone to die which made the stakes way better in my mind,2023-05-06
i did the same thing like we all knew the good dog moment was coming but it was still so satisfying and then cosmo puts in so much work to help save everyone at the end too,2023-05-05
ohhhh  yeah all i could think was i gotta get home and hug my dog movie was great from what i could see between all my crying ,2023-05-05
there are many pets tonight that are gonna have some extra tlc let’s be real  they’re probably like what is going on  haha,2023-05-05
“she’s a good dog”,2023-05-05
i got home and i wanted to get a dog,2023-05-05
"some of them reminded me of doomduke nukem

thats what i was thinkin too the hellspawn or whatever they were called totally looked like some badass enemies from some game",2023-05-06
the hellspawn were stroggs from quake except with animal parts,2023-05-06
who are the other two ,2023-05-08
it was unnerving,2023-05-05
you mean figuratively but “momma’s boy” is a very common trope in films,2023-05-05
i am so glad im not the only one who thought that during the movie my brother was like  how did you make that connection,2023-05-05
isnt he from narnia 3,2023-05-05
maybe nobody’s talking about it because he “literally” isn’t prince charming from shrek 2,2023-05-05
golden haired prissy mommas boy constantly thwarted by green people and talking animals huh i guess so,2023-05-11
also homelander but an antihero,2023-05-20
i feel sorry for the superhero fatigue people who might have loved this if they werent lumping all marvel together,2023-05-06
i swear some of the reviews for this one felt like critics were actively searching for something to overly criticize,2023-05-08
i assume its because hulk only snapped away thanos and his forces and gamora already defected,2023-05-20
or his cool rocket boots,2023-05-07
that scene was insane and a good showcase for what was to come him dropping only groot’s head was kinda terrifying,2023-05-08
there were a lot of jarring cuts early on  im usually the guy saying that movies shouldve cut more i love a slender movie but this one couldve used an extra 15 minutes especially at the back half of the first act,2023-05-05
lol chekhov’s grav boots that “just seeing if they work on a ramp” was i think the most heavyhanded foreshadowing james gunn has ever used ,2023-05-05
wellsome colours blend better with some skin tones than others,2023-05-08
thoguht i was the only one that shot of swollen peter looks lot like pedro pascal,2023-05-05
and mediocre bp 2,2023-05-05
"question why did peters face swell up wouldnt tje opposite happen in a vacuum air gets  out of you

or is it because the human body was mostly water which expands when frozen",2023-05-20
also plants just grow back different if pruned and he is plant,2023-05-06
thats how groot looked in his original comic book appearance where he was also able to talk properly,2023-05-06
papa groot was taller but lankier this groot in the movie not credits is more of a younger 30ish year old stockier bruiser,2023-05-20
i immediately went on spotify to see if they had put it in because it wasn’t on there and found out it was rereleased about a month ago because of the movie,2023-05-05
peter going back to his grandfather got me,2023-05-05
loved that bit when they’re floating in their suits and mantis is spinning lol,2023-05-09
someone had to fill in for thor faceplanting all the time,2023-05-10
almost certainly not until avengers 5 pratt is very expensive to put in a movie so they arent going to do it unless hes a main character and nothing really fits until kang dynasty,2023-05-05
maybe  meet kitty pryde somewhere along the eventual xmen route chris pratt’s comedy chops could definitely work with shehulk too lots of options for sure but glad he’s back with gramps for now,2023-05-05
i think  head up to indiana and start working as a shoe shiner in a local city hall,2023-05-06
is there any story lines where quill does his own thing,2023-05-05
probably where adam warlock shows up next some whacky space adventure maybe a big avengers movie to help take on kang,2023-05-05
if secret wars is even vaguely like the comic  have a role,2023-05-11
i knew the redhead looked familiar but couldn’t place her,2023-05-05
same cried on the first scene with creep playing to rocket,2023-05-07
,2023-05-05
"i cracked up when starlord just assumes the passcode is in the guys head implants rocket wouldve loved that 

tbh its a small weak link of the plot for me that it was indeed in his head implants thing since quill totally just made a guess",2023-11-27
my headcanon is that ego gave her a reinforced spineneck since her antennas are probably reinforced as well so shed be hitting her head on things a lot,2023-05-20
im a 43 year old guy that hasnt have a rabbit since i was a child and floor broke me   its still randomly making me tear up,2023-05-09
i thought for sure one would die my money was on drax but after watching the film i see a random death would have just been distracting and made the movie all about mourning the dead character when the movie was already about accepting the old gamora is gone wasnt necessary it also would have blocked the scene of rocket finally being happy which is what the whole trilogy has been setting up,2023-05-08
because goodbyes can hurt,2023-05-05
"this is why people throwing the arguments of you all just expect the next endgame or you are just burned out need to stop the problem is not you the problem is the quality of the movies

mcu can still nail it gotg 3 proves that in spades",2023-05-08
lol im glad i wasnt the only one that fell asleep with love and thunder that movie was incoherent as ,2023-05-09
i get it might not be everyone’s cup of tea but i actually thought it was realistic for once you’ve got these life and death situations combined with all these people having been teammates for years bickering and yelling at each other seems like something that would happen naturally their stress levels are off the charts not everyone can be cool under pressure like steve rogers,2023-05-08
"the villain is the worst of it 

especially compared to ego who was immediately hateable from the moment he said he killed quills mom or the stellar kang performance in quantumania you can be hateable without frying your vocal cords dude",2023-05-08
i think this one is easier for him he didnt really lose them they just retired and its not like they cant visit or call rocket called earth during endgame for a chat with black widow why not with quill plus i wanna see a scene with the old guardians trying to work a zoom call,2023-05-07
and nebula saying it was worse than anything thanos did to her shudder,2023-05-08
his story is finished id rather them follow up on any other of the guardians for me the whole point of the trilogy was peter quill giving up on childish fantasy life and going back to the real world,2023-05-07
audience loved it in mine,2023-05-06
they could have a different character take up the mantle of the legendary starlord and still be technically fulfilling their promise i cant imagine the general public will be very happy about that so i dont see it happening but its an option,2023-05-14
feel the same here ive also been burnt out on the mcu and super hero movies in general outside of the spiderverse this movie feels like the perfect stopping point for a while at least until the big event avenger films release,2023-05-05
"i like this idea but it being a marvel movie i dont think theyve put a lot of thought to it

youre overestimating these movies man",2023-05-05
its explained in universe the counter earth cant really think for themselves so they need music that sort ofmusics for them,2023-05-05
itd be kind of funny if they did a lopez red v blue bit lol,2023-05-20
"yeah although i dont think drax is  so much as he is literal doesnt understand similies metaphors or idioms

feel like he got flandarized a bit since guardians 1",2023-05-20
"admittedly i’m really late reading this thread but only yesterday did i finally get a chance to see this film your comment about a post death experience was the only one i saw in this thread so i have to ask was it very similar to rocket’s
not everyday that someone mentions having such an experience so don’t divulge if you’re not comfortable but after seeing your comment i was really curious",2023-06-12
there is no crossover plotline or any semblance of over arching plot even in the other phase 4 marvel movies and they are still mediocre i think it all just comes down to james gunn having full control over the trilogy with a beginning and an end,2023-05-06
"he is also sort of like the forerunners in halo killing all life then reseeding it which itself was also inspired by noahs ark  the main installation that can fire the halos and is out of range of them is literally called the ark

they were arrogant af and thought themselves better than other species but unlike he they didnt create them and only killed them and most of themselves because they exhausted every other option against the flood between getting infected by the flood and a painless death ill take the painless death

yes i know the forerunners technically caused the flood outbreak because they killed the precursors and used their corrupted dust on their pets or something 343s storytelling but the flood outbreak is more karmic retribution than something they intended on",2023-05-20
"honestly i can understand it not being there

this is set in the same year as endgame which was 5 years after infinity war except peter got snapped so gamora died he died came back saw another gamora that rejected him and claims they never met

i also imagine the mask is rare or hard to come by so  if it broke between endgame and now it wouldnt get replaced given peters mental state",2023-05-20
good,2023-05-07
"its basically we the audience finally being able to understand groot

he didnt actually say those words it was just i am groot but we have watched these guys for 3 movies now that we can also understand groot",2023-05-08
haiyah,2023-05-05
then adam would have even less to do,2023-05-05
honestly im happy to have a pure villain again im bored of every villain having to be sympathetic and redeemable,2023-06-10
oh yeah well someone crashed my theater too it was some random  guy he came in yelling trying to distract everyone and the ushers were following him and security dragged him out so who is the real winner here hmmm id say me,2023-05-06
where is this,2023-05-06
they literally save the whole galaxy in the 2nd one,2023-05-07
thats more ant man and spiderman both guardians 1 and 2 were about saving thr galaxy,2023-05-20
i loved it i was tired of all the garbage marvel had released after endgame,2023-05-06
funny enough i thought this too,2023-05-08
i noticed this for sure during that last line,2023-05-08
i wish thor was still part of the gang op adam vs thor would be insane,2023-05-05
"i liked warlock in this movie but i do agree he could have been used a bit better loved his debut brutal as 

also same the game is phenomenal",2023-05-08
im assuming warlock got snapped which is why he was undercooked after canonically 9 years because he was only actually in the incubator for 4,2023-05-20
look at the other movies he reallt hasnt in endgame he almost got crushed but that was more just getting trapped,2023-05-06
same i usually go see movies again but i really dont think i can see floor again i have four english lops myself and its been rough since i saw the movie thursday,2023-05-06
i was really expecting something to come from that considering she says she doesnt do it to friends but it kinda just moved on,2023-05-06
i like that he was an irredeemably evil villain marvel always trying to give their villains motivations that audiences can empathize with to varying degrees of success but with the high evolutionary the audience immediately understands this dude is as bad as it gets and he has got to go,2023-05-08
"star lord told groot to  them all

sudden reluctance does not compute",2023-05-18
would be pretty hilarious if his next appearance is just a short cameo where hes mowing in the background especially if they make it a stuntman,2023-05-20
yeah its the first mcu fbomb,2023-05-05
" is this the first nondeadpool marvel movie ever to feature an fbomb

first mcu f bomb but other nondeadpool marvel movie have dropped the fbomb wolverines used it in first class for examplethen he used it many times in logan",2023-05-07
not that i can recall which is super weird i mean he did seem really disheveled nearly the entire time,2023-05-05
"i avoided gothg 2 ike the plague  so when i saw the floating head ravager i figured that it could be some sentient ai who stole his mask and lives in it

ps  looks like its called mainframe",2023-05-05
"  i have renewed hope for gunn’s superman movie

why renewed

what in gunns past made you question it",2023-05-07
what  that wouldnt be his first time  he saw it his his own eyes previously  when he was listening to medieval music with robopriest  it was wal rus magil and floor who never got to see the sky ever,2023-05-06
he was stunned i assumed  it probably helped that gravity was one percent less than earths norm,2023-05-06
it was just one guy that had nobody probably,2023-05-19
walking out i said if the stuff with majors blows up just bring iwuji back,2023-05-06
"the old cliche of killing hundreds of people and then saving the piece of  villain whos responsible for everything so dumb

i understand the whole idea of letting him rot rather than killing him yourself but the justification is im a guardian of the galaxy

what",2023-05-08
oh that  does much worse in the comics im glad they didnt sugar coat how much of a  he is,2023-05-08
i saw the movie saturday and im still  up over that  the panic in floors voice during the fight when they were trying to get rocket to run and then the utter silence broke me,2023-05-09
yup my showing was completely silent leaving my husband made a comment why is it so quiet me because everyone is trying not to  cry on the way out,2023-05-15
from what i gathered gunn deliberately had the mask destroyed in the second movie because of this but the avenger movie brought it back which poked holes in him not having it anymore his explanation is peter left in a hurry to save rocket and forgot it,2023-05-10
or the jet boots,2023-05-12
between that and mantis calling drax  and then just wiping his memory she had some real  moments in this movie i don’t understand for sure were they supposed to be funny  hints that her character is darker than we realized  either way they were weirdly jarring,2023-08-03
something like “well i’d like to hear it” and his grandpa doesn’t respond at all,2023-05-05
it was something like “well now i kinda wanna know” his grandfather implied he had gossip to tell about the guy who wouldn’t mow the lawn it was just meaningless normal banter you’d expect everyday folks to have starlord’s just eating cereal talking  with a family member like a regular guy,2023-05-08
entire soundtrack was amazing,2023-05-05
i will dare from their album let it be i was psyched to hear it,2023-05-11
he was making fun of a neighbors 45 yearold son who wouldnt do it when hes in the same situation himself,2023-05-05
i mean the human got his face ripped off,2023-05-07
i thought the same i bet that was the original idea but somebody second guessed it last minute,2023-05-07
yeah it was kind of odd to have adam be the one to save peter when i don’t think the characters exchanged a single line of dialog all film,2023-05-07
but they saved the children,2023-05-08
people were audibly crying during the scene where rocket is dying on the table and gets reunited with his friends the film has a ton of tear jerker moments and was definitely one of the darker mcu movies,2023-05-09
thank goodness there werent other marvel characters and plotlines in this it was so refreshing to have it be cohesive for once,2023-05-11
the amount of horror and creepy imagery was something i wasnt expecting to see the way gamora peels off the guys face at the end was so extra haha,2023-05-05
and they had someone who actually know what the mcu is about and not trying to rewrite the lore to include all the diversity,2023-05-05
no one really knows who the guardians were they all seemed to avoid earth in general apart from the fight in endgame and im not sure anyone apart from certain avengers would believe him lol,2023-05-07
" even though the last two words were unintelligible

you thought go now was unintelligible

the sentences was rocket teef floor go now",2023-05-07
that was her communications code being displayed because she was trying to contact the ship essentially her caller id is shown when she calls the ship he was asking where she was because she was not on the ship and he saw she was trying to call them at that moment,2023-05-06
he says her “comm code is on the way behind you” he’s saying that she’s trying to get in touch with them over comms,2023-05-06
the whole car scene where nebula couldnt open the door and quill not knowing how to drive had me in hysterics im british and find our cinemas are fairly quiet it was difficult to contain my laughter,2023-05-07
"im sure the critters would appreciate it 

and if you do don’t let any weeniebutt bully you into making a timeline for it some change overnight some take years and some have their own approach 

not sure if you are a foodie i am and picky…like it better taste close to or as good as the real thing but vegan life is much  easier these days i make cakes and smoked gouda burgers all day sometimes a sausage egg cheese and hash brown biscuit sandwich 

also rvegan is a wonderful place but sometimes isn’t always the best cup of tea like most lifestyle subreddits",2023-05-08
yeah the music felt really off to me i wished they had just kept the 70ish vibe from the first 2 movies no sleep till brooklyn felt out of place in a gotg movie,2023-05-08
i thought that the needle drops in this were really disappointing they felt like an afterthought the music felt so integral to the first two films and this time it just felt like something they were forced to do and my two very favorite songs on the soundtrack were over the credits—i was so looking forward to seeing i will dare by the replacements used in a cool guardians scene i agree that vol 2 is best musically,2023-05-08
pick a dang era and stick to it,2023-05-08
i honestly didnt know that it could do that that was a pleasant surprise,2023-05-23
i did a triple take not sure if that line was religious  it reminds me of the book of job  when we read it in high school just as literature not for religion one of the students said something along the lines of  and his buddy satan sit down and have coffee and take bets on how badly job can be treated and still remain loyal  in the end the story is just disgusting,2023-05-11
"i also didn’t really understand the line too well but here’s what chatgpt has to say which makes sense as a way of telling rocket you don’t have to be held down by your past or the person who made you which opens up for forgiveness and ties to the ending where rocket chooses not to  him 

this quote is referring to the idea that there are two types of people who influence and shape your life the first is the person or entity that created you such as your parents or a higher power depending on your beliefs this is considered the hand that made you

the second type of influence comes from the people who guide and direct you throughout your life these could be mentors teachers friends or even strangers who offer advice or assistance this is considered the hand that guided the hand

essentially the quote is saying that while your creator has a significant impact on your life it is the people who guide and support you that help shape you into the person you become it acknowledges the role of both nature and nurture in shaping a persons life and character",2023-05-13
they wanted to retreat and escape to safety while the he wanted to stay and continue to capture rocket,2023-05-10
because the ship was actively exploding and he was only obsessed with rocket and wouldnt listen to them their lives were on the line and he was like it doesnt matter mattered to them,2023-05-11
prob just doesnt wanna see someone she cares about like that,2023-05-11
"she probably misses her too it isnt just peter that lost her it was everyone especially after gammorah and nebula finally bonded in film 2 

but nebula probably has a slightly different perspective when she lost everyone for five years having gamorrah back in any shape or form has to be preferable to nothing at all",2023-05-11
its undoubtedly best post endgame mcu movie then again thats not saying all that much,2023-05-13
i’m partial to the spider man trilogy because i think tom holland nailed the character but gotg trilogyset was pretty close to matching it this movie felt perfect and had all the right parts i didn’t feel like the adam storyline brought much to the table but i’m not complaining on this movie it’s still one of the better trilogies in the mcu right now,2023-05-15
uh a world got destroyed,2023-05-14
too many kids in the mcu movies,2023-05-21
the movie confirmed starlord will return in the after credits scene,2023-05-23
when i rewatched i noticed floor and rocket cuddling before evolutionary angrily barges in such a sad sweet detail ,2023-05-24
 no there is a difference between torturing animals and killing them to protect others,2023-05-29

i really hope we can do something about this and stop it people should rally against animal brutality now,2023-05-14
 so that means that the he did not explode on the ship,2023-05-05
wait i thought he was carrying adam warlock this is wild,2023-05-08
easily the best acting he’s ever done,2023-05-05
"his wail when rocket ‘dies’  i felt that in my soul…

his eyes and longing looks at gamita…jeezus",2023-05-15
gamora peeled a mask off but that doesnt make it better since rocket was the one that clawed his face off  it sounds like james gunn got the desired effect from you since that stuff was supposed to make you uncomfortable  i understand what youre saying though  the second dr strange was like that to me but it was disturbing enough i didnt like that one though i loved this one,2023-05-11
" and while the movie feels a bit bloated especially with warlock who seemed like a very predictable section of the movie its clearly set up for future stuff and i feel like at this point with marvel youre either on board for that stuff or not plus i will never say no to more debicki in movies

isnt debicki dead i thought they showed her exploding with the rest of that planet ill look the other way on that if marvel wants to bring her back because im a huge fan of hers but i got the sense that she was dead and grieving her death is going to be part of adams character arc going forward",2023-05-05
its definitely between 2 and 3 as my favorite,2023-05-05
vol 2 is regarded as one of the worst mcu films to date not sure thats where you want to hang your hat,2023-05-05
" vol 2 is one of my favorite marvel movies overall 

hoo boy",2023-05-05
"they were in purgatory not yet to “heaven” or whatever their universe afterlife is so they still had the appendages that they died with it’s also why they were shown still in front of the cages they lived in once rocket passes away they will all leave purgatory together and perhaps have their original bodies that you speak of

edit saw this on another post…a heaven does exist ",2023-05-11
remember pink alien they abducted at the desk and took racoons archive or elevator scene where quill being insufferable,2023-05-05
this was a very different star lord then i remember he was extremely disheveled and acted on his emotions the entire time which does make sense if the entire movie was in the span of 48 ish hours,2023-05-05

in his defence he probably didnt practice using it very much odd at the end how seeing his father makes him very skillful at it and take down all the baddies i call that plot convenience also what was up with the beginning he has the bet with the spacedog couldnt he have killed someone,2023-05-07
yeah but at least he finally figured it out after using the power of love or something,2023-05-07

"in all honesty though drax didnt deserve the defense and nebula was right mantis then made drax forget the exchange and undid any personal growth that could have resulted from it just to save face and not deal with hurting his feelings

now that would probably been one of the lamest way to go for sure,2023-05-09
thats how i took it  he visited earth in the 70s and modeled ce after it,2023-05-09

you are right that it looks amazing and not only because of the colorful visuals but also because the cgi is not garbage unlike what weve seen in most recent mcu projects,2023-05-11

yes,2023-05-13
weird way of spelling mantis,2023-05-17

no offense but i feel like gunn deserves the credit its not so much marvel and the mcu or feige this was gunn and of course his team but gunn really made this what it was you look at a lot of other things that are backed by more than enough source material and its still handled poorly gunn took these characters not many knew about with little material and crafted an entertaining and touching story without him im certain this wouldve turned out like every other bad mcu movie that is why that despite a lot people dont like him as coceo of dc this further proves that  handle it well,2023-05-05
he is not a  he is a demiurge he is incapable of creating thing from scratch he is only able to transform that already exists rockets intellect wasnt something that he made he was only able to extend his capacity and making him able to talk but that was a gift he had from the start,2023-05-06
hes arrogant,2023-05-05
"i figured that he has done exactly that

and it never worked except for with rocket this leads  to his obsession with rocket in the movie

but when it played during the ending i had the exact same reaction it all just overwhelmed me and i got super choked up ive been listening it to it more and more ever since and man its such a perfect song to end this type of movie on",2023-05-07
captain america trilogy was solid,2023-05-10

"what made me sad was the death of rockets friends eased by their apparently going to some kind of heaven where rocket can go eventually

but what really made me sad was high evolutionarys heartless  destruction of counterearth  we met those folks just before they were killed",2023-05-18
bro you rock that exact feeling is why i love the gotg movies its up there with the best trilogies of all time,2023-05-24
"not alone i place it as one of the bottom three mcu films

"i just scrolled through like 10 screens to find a single neutral  bad review

i thought this was one of the worst movies ive seen in decades yes i liked the villain and some of the plot details but it just went on forever when they ended the movie with that song from the first movie come and get your love that was when i knew that the filmmakers themselves believed the movie was sht and they were using every cheap trick in the book to try to please the audience

peter quill dies in outer space and we see the tissues in his face and skull starting to explode from the pressure differential then his dead body is brought inside then he wakes up and makes a joke what is the point of that so many pointless things in this movie

reddit owners definitely getting some financial love from the studios with the way comments are getting voted in this thread what a joke im glad ive switched from reddit to twitter mostly

i had low expectations for this movie and i still didnt enjoy it that much the villain was interesting but the filmmakers drew our attention away from the villains motivations he wanted to use science and genetic experiments and a kind of totalitarian control to create a better society thats really interesting where does that come from were the filmmakers borrowing this from an old comic book i wish the movie had explored this idea a whole lot more as it is its barely mentioned

have marvel movies gone downhill since stan lees passing

for me this was really two movies combined into one 1 a really interesting movie with a fascinating plot and talented actors and 2 cheap entertainment pointless incidents and a runtime that just went on forever",2023-05-08

"and between this and ant man is phase 5 promising to be the angry black man villain with magic throw people around somehow powers

iwuji wasnt cast because he was black  or was the race of the villian considered he was cast because gunn was so impressed with his work on peacemaker that he pushed hard for the actor to get the role because he felt he could do it justice

but sure go ahead and be very weird about it",2023-05-07
"saying that the rocket flashbacks are bad storytelling just because animals are getting tortured is looking at the flashbacks at an incredibly surface level no  people are going to react to animals being tortured that doesnt make it cheap storytelling how else did you want gunn to tell a story about rockets past and not show what happened in his past
 
the flashbacks  actually expand upon rockets character and let us know why he is the way he is but it seems like you saw animals being tortured on screen and immediately went ermmm this is cheap storytelling and a lazy way to get people to be sad because cute animals getting tortured is cheap without paying attention to what was happening in those scenes",2023-05-05
"	and so much random nonsense we have to break into a place to get mcguffin a but it’s actually a living building how kooky and there’s an earth where all the people are half animal wackadoo also a talking psychic dog zany

weird  random i hate when people say this

like would you have preferred the place they break into be a normal looking space station with generic uniformed soldiers marching down the corridors blending mechanics with organic material is not some “lulz so random” idea either it was a cool way to display the vastness and variety of the galaxy as well as allowing for some funny set pieces

same with the counterearth stuff yes it was silly and meant to give opportunities for some laughs but it wasn’t “random”",2023-06-01
literally could not agree more,2023-05-07
"funnily enough i believe tarantino is the solution to marvels problems

marvel needs to grow up it cant rely on the cultural phenomenon  zeitgeist it had for the first ten years

theres a mid credit and a post credit scene if thats what youre after,2023-05-05

you mean nebula yeah she is sort of a surprise to be sure she grew up a lot from the first two films,2023-05-06
"having only watched this film yesterday and pouring over all the comments i can’t believe how far down i had to go before i found someone mentioning this

when warlock smashed through the ship that gamorra and star lord were in i immediately thought that they should have died any kind of breach like that would be a death sentence so it was bizarre to see the dangers of space essentially ignored until an important end scene that could have been the death of that character as well",2023-06-12

starlord  the one that chooses to focus their time to improve  repair  or just to maximize whatever time they still can with their family

gamora  the one that worked at a company or something formed new bonds with new coworkers etc

drax and nebula  the couple in the group who decided to have a family of their own

mantis  the one who decided to get to know their self better like travel the world alone etc

rocket and groot  the pair who decided to push through with a business idea or something went on to become cofounders of a businessstartup or something",2023-05-07
"same it was a bittersweet ending and it was very sad for me

it’s the perfect ending if they stay together or some members die i enjoy the movie but don’t think too much about the characters afterwards now i’m “oh  what’s going to happen with them are they going to be happy by themselves i don’t want marvel to ruin their awesome story by bringing them back but then i wouldn’t know if they’re doing ok”",2023-05-07
felt the same way its my least favorite of the three guardians movies but i still enjoyed it im also tapping out of the mcu for a while im just totally burnt out on it never thought id get to this point but here we are,2023-05-07
i said the same thing to my wife the similarity was strong enough that i’m almost convinced it was intentional,2023-05-07
"rocket reaches for and activates a device to disable it

rocket is literally smarter than him something that i think he feared most of all he either knew high boy developed the tech or he anticipated he would have by now or its just a generic device to disable all tech in the area its probably why rocket loves mechanicalbased weapons that cant be disabled like that",2023-05-07
rocket activated a device that neutralized his powers,2023-05-07
rocket activated the gravity boots from earlier in the movie so he couldnt be thrown around by hes gravity,2023-05-08

yah but like how long have they been hanging out for her to understand him,2023-05-09
"im pretty sure thats the purpose of that line

its to signify to the audience that we now understand groot",2023-05-10
i totally agree  i was afraid of james gunn constantly saying he wanted to finish rockets arc  i was delighted to find what he really meant was rockets beginning arc  whether we see more movies with him or not the character is clearly just getting started as a leader,2023-05-11
i thought it would be peter in fact i  the opening when rocket had the zune my first thought was oh  is pete already dead,2023-05-12
yes i kept on thinking about my dogs during the movie,2023-05-16
look for phylavell in comics her origin is a bit complex and very different from what gunn went for i believe he wanted to introduce the character briefly and thats why we saw her at the end with the team,2023-07-09
yeah i loved the previous guardians films and holiday special but this new one was so good it blows the others out of the water james gunn just gets better and better all the time it’s crazy,2023-07-14

i’m with you  i don’t get all these positive reviews,2023-05-06
"i did watch it for free  at home and i cant tell you how many times ive hit the fast forward button i rated gog 1 as top 5 film in mcu infinity saga 

whatajoke

how are this many people enjoying this film how was it any different from thor lat which people hated tell me  someone tell me the difference",2023-05-27
lol the mass of kids was kind of weird feels like the same studio note that thor 4 got i really liked the movie but that was a bit distracting,2023-05-05
there was no sense of danger or purpose whatsoever in the film the movie was comprised of 5 running jokes and threw so many topics and ideas into the mix that made no sense whatsoever there was no direction or coherence or actual plot and i hated it and marvel just keeps getting worse and worse,2023-05-13
"1 he did not listen to digital newspapers

2 this is the first time

3 disney",2023-05-06
"the flow was really choppy it was half an hour too long and there werent enough moments to breathe

still liked it but its flawed",2023-05-05
the weakest when volume 2 exists,2023-05-14
this is leagues ahead of volume 2 if you ask me,2023-05-06
well the other two are very very good so thats not really a diss,2023-05-05
"dang respect your opinion but honestly i liked this movie the most out of the three 

i felt like gunn kept one upping himself in this trilogy",2023-05-05
impossible this is my favorite from the trilogy i 100 disagree,2023-05-06
maybe rewatch the trilogy,2023-05-05
yea i think im done with marvel if not superhero films as a whole i want to be annoyed at the film but i dont know why im expecting anything more at this point,2023-05-05
i was pleasantly surprised  and i didnt give them my money i assumed that my reaction would be the same as yours so i saw are you there  its me margaret according to my movie ticket  but in reality i walked into this film  i got the impression that the filmmakers dont understand how time works and i didnt like the acting of the high evolutionary but i liked the film as a whole,2023-05-05
me too this was a one and done movie the animal torture was too cruel for me teefs floor and lyla ,2023-05-05
the worst part of the counter earth is that it becomes pointless as within a few mins its blown up,2023-05-07
"the entire part with counter earth served no purpose it was odd that he would make an ideal society be a 1980s american suburb with animal people 

i agree with you on some points  but i think that it was good overall  and the point i quoted was one of the better points  i feel like good films live in the past while  bad films generally are aiming and failing to be relevant to now  for example the original halloween  set in the time period it was released to theaters but sociologically set in the time period that the film maker grew up in  kinda like i figured that the suburb in this film was kinda like the time period that the writers grew up around",2023-05-05
you literally parroted jeremy jahns verbatim,2023-05-05
disney has always gotten away with getting their films lower ratings but between this and the last doctor strange movie it is becoming ridiculous,2023-05-05
i feel like his character became the victim of the edit i dont have anything to base this one aside from my own gut but i think the script probably had a lot more for him but to get the movie down to a good runtime something had to go,2023-05-05
i think a bunch of scenes were deleted from the third act like this one,2023-05-05
i think he was blaming the guardians for the explosions but they didnt make it clear  its a fair criticism however,2023-05-05
he’s done a bunch for once during this one however,2023-05-07
when we got to that part i was thinking “there is no way this is how the guardians are going to end right”,2023-05-05
"i dont think it was too dark but i do think there is a legitimate argument that this should have had a higher rating or more warnings it has a lot of triggering imagery and multiple people are saying that they or the person they went to the theater with had to walk out during some of the sequences 

i was going to take my mom to see this for mothers day and now i am seriously reconsidering because i dont think she could handle the animal abuse",2023-05-06
i  cried jesus christ it was depressingbut a very important film,2023-05-06
" also the high evolutionarys idea of a perfect world being 1990s earth was just  hilarious but 

that wasnt his idea of a perfect world he created the animal people hoping theyd achieve something perfect but the film explains they have very limited ability to be inventive they dont have the imagination that rocket has they cant think anything that hasnt been thought before so they end up copying earth from information about it presumably that he gathered from the time he visited

they failed to achieve perfection and thats why he destroyed them",2023-05-06
 i thought that exact same thing,2023-05-08
i found the film to be quite excellent and i loved its shift in tone from your average mcu film but i completely understand your perspective this was more along the lines of james gunns suicide squad rather than anything else in the mcu im shocked the mpaa gave this a pg13 rating to be honest some of the stuff in here would be shocking and actually scary to your average 7yr old who loves avengers and spiderman i personally thought the scene where adam incinerates that guy was unneeded gore lol,2023-05-11
my interpretation was that thanos surgeries were advanced and professional at the very least and used proper cybernetics that would be considered an upgrade on the other hand the high evolutionarys labs were grungey and underground he was just haphazardly adding  to see what happened to work not caring about the consequences,2023-05-13
i think that part with nebula’s eyes was improv by pratt i do see where you’re coming from though,2023-05-15
i had the exact same thoughts while watching  the  cuts were so jarring and it legit reminded me of rise of skywalker too many plot lines with different emotional elements sad backstory cut to comedic drax cut to action filled petergroot etc it was just so all over the place lol,2023-05-05
"the story was rather sloppy and reminded me of rise of skywalker we gotta go here and get this thing oh wait that didn’t work now we gotta go over there and get that thing

and then which per south park creators is a cardinal sin in screenwriting",2023-05-07
i ain’t reading all that i’m happy for you tho or sad that happened,2023-05-05
"its garbage im shocked people are receiving this film well the entire story is one mcguffin after another and plot of we fight but were family felt like same script writers as fast and furious 

oh you think this character is about to die nope",2023-05-27
lol i thought about doing the same but i went to a theater with the luxury recliners and i was tired so i let myself doze off a bit,2023-05-07
the movie in my opinion does not really start until 14000 when we finally get some rocket action,2023-08-05
thats the way i took it too,2023-05-07
another commenter has said that james gunn has confirmed that to be correct idk if he actually has but another commenter said it so there is that,2023-05-07
"yeah it didn’t sit right with me either to me at least the whole underlying theme of the guardians series is the idea of “found family” these people are all “losers” having lost their families and homes but they found a new one with the team so the idea that they all willingly decide to go their separate ways just seems off peter and mantis in particular felt odd since they had both just discovered that they are literal family but decided to leave for very flimsy reasons 

all in all the idea of the team breaking up felt forced and not really in line with the characters up to this point",2023-05-07
peter is just going home for a while mantis wants to find her own way but its not like she wont keep in touch nebula is in charge of the gotg hq and drax is raising kids there  the only ones to leave outright are mantis and peter  and gamora died in endgame  this version found family with the ravagers,2023-05-08
it felt really contrived for several of them at once to start saying that they were going to leave quill and then mantis says uhh me too and nebula all of a sudden wants to be a caretaker since when felt like a hurried way to break them up,2023-05-08
it’s not like the guardians could stop the mass destruction of counterearth at any point the he already wanted to do it and just pulled the trigger then,2023-05-08
"i see it as  they saved who they could including random animals

they couldnt save counterearth but then they tried to redeem themselves by saving everyone on hes ship",2023-05-08
replace kang with he,2023-05-08
still thinking about it 3 days later i want to watch it again soon while also i never want to see it again,2023-05-08
"ethically speaking we have always considered a difference between killing someone who is an active threat to your life and killing an already defeated opponent for revenge the latter arguably being a war crime if you imagine executing captured enemy combatants seriously its a big nono i dont know why people have taken to ignoring that

but in any case i kinda interpreted it more like it would be a more fitting punishment to leave him alive powerless with his influence eroded his minions killed his experiments freed so hes only able to watch as the messy imperfect universe he hates so much flourishes without him but idk",2023-05-08
"while i always have an issue with that mentality i assume it is because in that moment he was helpless and not an immediate threat the others he killed were actively trying to  them so it was defensive killing someone is fine as long as they are trying to  you not fine if they are just laying there waiting to die

it shouldnt matter what they are currently doing if they are a genocidal maniac that makes torturing entire species a passtime but they make a distinction based on situation",2023-05-08
im sure he gets blown up along with his ship though lol,2023-05-08
that  me off he should have just   blasted him,2023-05-08
"meh the high evolutionary was basically a goner at that point bring stabbed by a giant sword by gamora he was basically immobile and helpless he aint getting off that ship 




rockets never really killed anyone that was helpless the only one weve seen do that is probably gamora and nebula",2023-05-09
i wish they did that but that likely shows language competency that drax doesnt possess,2023-05-09
hes also the lead agent in gunns peacemaker show,2023-05-16
i thought oh  rocket has the zune is pete already dead,2023-05-16
i agree with almost all of your points the movie was solid and better than a lot of recent mcu projects but i don’t love it as much as some others do few of the jokes landed for me as well the previous movies had moments that had me laughing out loud while this movie only managed to get a few chuckles out of me i don’t think the movie necessarily needed a death but i was surprised there wasn’t one at all i appreciated the darker elements and rocket’s backstory but the rest of the movie only pretty good for me this was not the return to form for marvel that i was hoping it would be and that others are claiming it is,2023-05-05
"he might have just been on a emotional bender 
the woman you love is dead ohh and here is the woman you love but before she met you so its a constant reminder that you could have her but she is gone 

if one is responsible enough one can get  and let it loose to allow emotion to be free",2023-05-06
i don’t think it’s the biggest deal he’s basically forced out of it because he’s on a two day time crunch to save rocket who is his best friend and basically all he has left,2023-05-07
agreed  the emotional beats in the film hit with all the subtlety of a wet noodle  gunn is a proficient director but hes not good some people seem to think proficient and good are the same thing,2023-05-09
definitely agree to an extent they picked the cutest baby animals,2023-05-09
arent all movies emotionally manipulative the choices of shots actors lighting and music are all purposeful to make us feel a certain way,2023-05-09
idk thought the flaws are the most important characteristics to the gaurdians as a whole the characters are so flawed to the point they arent even honorable heroes just a common family with common family problems and thats where a lot of people including me relates to imho the movie kinda resembled family road movies where the whole cast screams at each other about how someone hates others but ends up rediscovering their love or stuffs like that guess im a bit biased tho,2023-05-06
i disagree completely if gunn would have made a third film exactly the same way as volume 2 it would have  the series needed a conclusion and that’s the beauty of movies you can always rewatch what you like,2023-05-06
kind of weird to single out james gunn for the third movie while ignoring he also wrote and directed the first two guardians movies you enjoyed,2023-05-05
"how is ronan worse  the high evolutionary created species and granted creatures higher intelligence and just killed them all because he wasnt happy with his results he pretended to be a benevolent biologist but only did it to feed his ego

ronan was iirc seeking revenge on xandar for a war that killed multiple generations of his family",2023-05-06
absolutely and they didn’t even  anyone like they promised,2023-05-06
i liked it a bit more than vol 2 but not as much as vol 1 ymmv the scenes that apparently made 99 of the people in this sub cry did not really land with me at all and i would have liked more humor towards the end of the movie,2023-05-05
screentime of large cast huge improvement than gotg 2 aswell as retain multiple storylines,2023-05-05
"will you be rewatching in theaters or at home 

i want to go again but it felt a bit long to me the first time",2023-05-05
maybe they stopped because of the impact on draxs ,2023-05-05
his family has grown up and while he misses her he has to find something ,2023-05-06
"we will see he was taken out early and just not fully ready 
more mature in time ",2023-05-06
i was thinking the same thing also in the first two movies wasnt he shown to be super powerful,2023-05-06
my wife was thinking like gamora we’ve been around groot enough we understand him,2023-05-06
he was shot twice  first in the chest second in the back,2023-05-07
he wanted his brain rocket was the only person to have creative thinking none of his other creations were able to think critically he said they have genetic memory brains like a computer they can remember things but lack critical thinking and creativity like rocket was always creating weapons and tools,2023-05-06
"the high evolutionary sees rocket as nothing more than a prototype to him rocket is an  messy creation bolted together with crude tech and rocket cant even talk right he is seeking perfection and rocket isnt theres no place in the hes vision of utopia for living mistakes

but rockets brain does something none of the other creations do the villain wants that factor added onto beings that look right and speak right floor and teefs dont seem to be as smart as rocket so they dont even have that going for them i think lylla is arguably very emotionally intelligent but he wouldnt value that

its just the way high evolutionary sees things rocket almost disgusts him",2023-05-06
it broke in vol 2,2023-05-07
the latter the characters don’t react,2023-05-07
its the second one as confirmed by james gunn,2023-05-07
swol groot and he expanded his vocabulary by 3 additional words,2023-05-07
i think what he meant was rocket was the only one who could create without him giving them the knowledge how to create it he helped create adam like gave them instructions or something on how to do it and they did it but for rocket not only did he figure out something without the help of the high evolutionary he even figured out something the high evolutionary could not solve,2023-05-07
well depends on your perspective high evolutionary killed everyone on that planet he made lol,2023-05-07
the scene in the corridor where her neck breaks and she kills a couple of grunts whilst snapping her neck back into place was incredible,2023-05-07
he was so good better than kang in am3 imo,2023-05-07
they were also all of a sudden all beat to  after the explosion im pretty sure their was a fight scene in there they just cut for time,2023-05-07
very weird but i guess they felt they really needed to explain how they escape personally could have just cut that scene and have them show up on the octopus dudes and i would have accepted it lol,2023-05-07
"yup 

from the opening frames i knew i would be in love with this film it was literally love at first sight for me",2023-05-08
high evolutionary is extremely intelligent but not invulnerable as we’ve seen he really struggles in fights where he doesn’t have an immediate upper hand also he has so many grunts and underlings that he can use before having to get his hands dirty he could have eventually captured rocket with this strategy if he had not lost his cool,2023-05-08
"this is a case where the high evolutionary despite being the boss bad guy isnt the physically strongest and isnt invulnerable rocket  his face up once already yeah no  hed send warlock or big mechapig to do the dirty work for him why put yourself at risk again

hes power comes from intelligence and influence  that",2023-05-08
"so the movie can happen 

wow wow wow     wow",2023-05-08
i knew just from the trailer what was going to happen to rockets friends but i didnt expect it to hit me like it did  just seeing what was done to an innocent soul like floor at all choked me up every time but then hearing their panic during that scene and the utter silence after gutted me  im still not ok ,2023-05-09
they all tried to  each other in the first film nebula did so many times over its kind of the shtick of this team,2023-05-09
"arguably what adam did isnt remotely as bad as peter attacking thanos at a crucial moment and actually getting half of everyone killed yet that didnt seem to have repercussions

warlock was just created and doing it to protect his people from being eradicated if anyone would understand it would be the guardians",2023-05-09
they get targeted from death by like half of the galaxy theyre housing the collector in their hq planet they dont really take it personally,2023-05-09
"i felt like adam was a bit shoehorned in in terms of balancing the plot he either needed more screen time to get a proper arc or be cut 

i really enjoyed when he was on screen but none of it was necessary",2023-05-17
i feel like nebula or gammorah shrugging off his born to be a weapon thing would have made sense but no one ever really had a conversation with the guy so yeah it doesnt make a whole ton of sense,2023-05-10
seriously i get the comedy balance in 2 might be a little wack compared to 1 and 3 but the character stuff in 2 is astronomically good,2023-05-09
i dont remember the exact phrasing but the spirit of it is that peter has been a frog jumping from lily pad to lily pad woman to woman relationship to relationship but what he needs to learn to do is learn how to swim,2023-05-09
"quill life is a pond youve been living your entire life leaping from women to women as if they are lily pads upon this great pond perhaps what you need to do quill is learn to swim

 drax mantis",2023-05-11
maybe he just never needed it near his heart area before but he is pretty small and nimblei could see him avoiding bullets much easier than the other guardians,2023-05-10
the goats didnt leave with the guardians and i dont know why taika waititi said they did the goats were with thor jane and valkyrie later in thor 4 during the blackandwhite scenes way after the guardians leave,2023-05-11
i hated the goats hope the guardians had a mutton dinner,2023-05-13
the only thing i felt from that was annoyed when it didnt progress warlocks character,2023-05-22
"when they are getting in the car on counterearth after telling nebula to push the button and then she asks what next peter says open the  door

i think you missed a very key point there with groot he says i love you guys and none of the characters reacted as it being anything other than his normal i am groot phrase we as the audience got a glimpse of understanding groots language",2023-05-22
yeah that part of the movie felt like it needed to be much longer or not exist at all just to show off how evil high evolutionary is i guess but nearly every one of his creations besides rocket and warlock have zero personality besides dumb or being a mindless drone,2023-05-24
here ,2023-07-09
yeah it was the same for me too i thought rocket was gonna die and i am not ready for it cuz hes my favorite character in the mcu im so happy he was now the official captain of the guardians,2023-09-24
i agree with your take the first was the best this was ok tho but not the best,2023-05-06
its the best marvel movie since the original imo ,2023-05-06
who tf hates the guardians soundtracks,2023-05-06
you are entitled to your opinion but the only thing i agree is the soundtrack  there were some good songs but it was underwhelming this time  creep was a perfect fit for rocket  loved no sleep in brooklyn sequence but it would impossible to top the magic of mix tape 1,2023-05-05
this,2023-05-06
" like huh of all the races creatures worlds civilizations you specifically chose earth 

he explains it in the movie  humans managed to create art that he never seen before he fell in love with it but fell out of love due to their bigotry and hate",2023-05-07
thank you,2023-05-06
"granted it wasnt as bad as the first two films but man these tracks just do not work and reinforce the human centered universe trope

thats the whole  point  the awesome mixes are songs that peter quill like and of course since hes human theyll be human songs i mean its played on a  walkman ffs",2023-05-14
harsh i loved it but i don’t care two  about the comics so fair enough,2023-05-05
i thought they actually understood groot like how c3po can understand r2d2 and han solo can understand chewbacca,2023-05-07
"drax mantis and peter talk like they are doing baby talk

thats the level of the people that like this drek",2023-05-07
true love is letting go,2023-05-05
"because he loved the other gamora and went through a very traumatic amount of  surrounding her death and now there she is in the flesh

it would be hard for anyone to process",2023-05-05
"well it’s hard to lose someone you love and they’re a literal copy in front of you

he realized it in the end tho",2023-05-05
what was weird is that they handled it totally differently in multiverse of madness nobody had a problem grasping the different universes alt versions there so why is peter quill asking do you really not remember,2023-05-07
somebody missed the point of the movie,2023-05-05
i thought it was natural for him to miss her but when he openly dumps on her that they used to be in loveseemed like it was more for the audience than something hed actually say knowing full well she woudlnt have her memories,2023-05-07
its called a character flaw the movie calls him out for it and he learns to get past it i dont see the issue,2023-05-06
i wish i felt the same way but i do think theyre real what a terrible movie,2023-05-20
mcu and james gunn both have cult followings thats what a cult is you cant admit the emperor isnt wearing any clothes or else youre shunned as a nonbeliever and cast out into the wilderness,2023-05-07
people can have different opinions,2023-05-07
i completely agree with your criticisms here i enjoyed the movie for the most part but it just lacked a lot of what made the first two so enjoyable the chemistry amongst the group just wasnt the same in large part because rocket is normally such a big part of it and helps tie groot in the music didnt work nearly as well they were all over the place in terms of era and vibe i dont think anybody in the world has ever danced hard to the beginning of dog days the way groot did felt really forced you mentioned the trope of almost reaching heaven how about the trope of the surprise bullet in the back just when everything seems great the flashbacks as a whole felt very predictable and manipulative and not in the spirit of the franchise,2023-05-07
i don’t agree with every point you made but i’m glad you wrote out your thoughts for me to read ,2023-05-07
i agree with a lot of this i also did not like the choice they made regarding gamora and quills relationship in the end i think having her be in the entire movie sets it up for them to at least crack open the door to rekindling in the future if they were not going to then i would have rather had her only show up for like one act of the movie their final lines to each other were just like utterly depressing and it left me feeling very sad in the end which is not how i wanted to leave this movie just feeling depressed especially since everyone keeps saying this is a happy ending and a great sendoff for these characters like what the band breaks up and everyone goes off to reflect on their pain how the  is that a happy ending it would be a great ending if there was a fourth and final movie coming where they band up again but as it sits this movies ending is   depressing and apparently thats it for this group ugh that was not the ending i was hoping for,2023-05-07
completely agree about the screaming it’s annoying because the movie wants you to think it’s funny,2023-05-07
"i agree with every point you made though i would go so far to say that it was not a good movie to me i loved the first movie i thought the second was alright even if the emotional beats didnt really land for me but i felt checked out of vol 3 in the first halfhour

i dont know how people give such high praise to bradley cooper when hes unconscious for most of the movie and its a baby cgi version in flashbacks with the most sacrificial friend characters that i can think of just very cheap emotionally and sad moments with animals always get me in movies the tone was all over the place and never had time to breathe

side note i found it hilarious at the end when the evolutionist guy screams over the radio to his citysized spaceship for everyone to get rocket and it ends up being like 30 dudes in a hallway",2023-05-13
totally agree the tone was unclear the movie was trying to be very dark and grim and then theyd have drax make a joke about his  felt so   forced and strange,2023-05-08
which is odd considering the sovereign were made by the high evolutionary he could have played a more serious and relatable role besides wanting to arrest rocket the whole time,2023-05-05
i also hate animal abuse and had a rough time it’s just a few scenes though,2023-05-05
it’s all fake cgi,2023-05-05
yeah they even call attention to it too i guess the implication is that theyre kind of a predatory invasive species and that rocket isnt a completely different character now but its still odd they couldve picked anything,2023-05-06
found it very strange too it clashes a lot with the rest of the movie even if they are wild invasive animals it doesnt really matter especially when the ending was about saving children and animals they could have done a different mission instead or maybe rocket finds smart solutions to fix the issue without killing them very odd indeed,2023-05-06
sums up how i feel the death of rockets friends is so obvious and there are multiple death fakeouts which i knew were definitely not going to be real and would feel dumb if they actually were,2023-05-08
i want to go rewatch it but i think it would have been a better movie without the gamora thread she contributed nothing and had no arc,2023-05-08
honestly villains right now are overly saturated with overly relatable and sympathetic villains that have some sort of backstory attached it’s refreshing to see the trope turned on its head just like it was in  in boots 2 with jack horner sometimes just having an evil  that needs to die is a refreshing take also it set up a great team up “fight” where they just  him up before leaving him for dead,2023-05-14
"it was better than i thought  but you want to talk about the high evolutionary  i dont think that you will like what i have to say its not positive regarding him  

in my opinion he should have either had a more face concealing mask or leaned more into being a religious zealot if you are going to change the costume then make it more religious  maybe a better actor could have done better job or looked visually more like some sort of priest  while an expressionless metal facemask would have been more of a blank slate",2023-05-05
yeah totally looked like red skull to me as well,2023-05-06
friends grow apart in life and can’t always stick together,2023-05-05
i saw it as them growing theyre all family and will still see eachother and help when needed they just arent the guys that guard the galaxy right now they need to do whats best for them,2023-05-05
he still wasnt over the original gomora dying and new gomora wants nothing to do with him so after saving rocket he thought he needed to go home and be with his grandfather,2023-05-06
i am happy that someone agree with me about quill leaving the guardians it was too forced like they wanted so badly to make the ending emotional,2023-05-07
gamora being disgusted at the high evolutionary proves that he’s more evil than thanos,2023-05-18
those people did just blow up a planet to be fair,2023-05-10
i love the drax and mantis dynamic they had perfect stories this movie mantis is probably my favorite guardian character if not my favorite mcu character but pom nailed mantis,2023-05-15
"i can hear it ahaha

i know he says hes tired of playing drax but he does it so well",2023-05-17
" i know that the marvels is coming out and they will probably keep making space adventures but gotg 3 is the last mcu movie for me they are never gonna make a movie as good as this

are you from the future they definitely could it will be hard but not impossible",2023-05-14
apparently they had a few big names going after the role but after working with chukwudi on peacemaker gunn knew he wanted him,2023-05-17
"for me the 2nd one is the worst of the three because it falls into the marvel trope of the villain just being a bigger badder version of the hero

thats been the thing since iron maniron monger

guardians 1 was a breath of fresh air

guardians 3 is also in that the stakes are so low he doesnt care about ruling or destroying the galaxy nothing would fundamentally change if he got rocket back or not other than the guardians would lose their friend

compared to the typical cut and paste marvel movie this one had more heart than the rest of them put together",2023-05-16
i noticed it but i didn’t mind it so much mantis suddenly screaming in this movie is like when drax would suddenly bust out laughing in the second movie it was cute and very onbrand,2023-07-10
the villain was so lame and one dimensional  that’s all his character did was scream  it was so annoying to me  one of the worst villains in the mcu and i don’t get the praise in here for him at all,2023-08-03
totally agree with this this movie ends on a very strangely depressing note absolutely felt like james gunn straight killing this group to be sure they cant come back and that he can move on total bummer,2023-05-07
,2023-05-10
heroes don’t execute unarmed villains,2023-05-05
yeah i dont think this movie is particularly noteworthy compared to anything that isnt also an mcu film,2023-05-06
i think the pace was great sucks for you that you didn’t like it,2023-05-06
"totally agree i get most of these first couple day comments are by the marvel fan boys so they’re gonna be mostly positive but man i really disliked this movie 

20 minutes too long pacing was disjointed and all over the place weak soundtrack   

and i thought these movies were supposed to be funny  there wasn’t one moment where my packed theatre laughed out loud together prior movies had several  a few random chuckles here and there but almost all the jokes and comedic moments fell flat",2023-05-06
"i’m not trying to start an argument but i’m genuinely curious why makes it  to you 

like that seems pretty extreme there are definitely far worse movies out there even just exclusively in the mcu",2023-05-07
the xmas special was terrible this movie was very good just needed 1015 minutes cut,2023-05-06
they turned on him because of his self destructive arrogance not because hes atheist  that line was just the final straw,2023-05-08
"the scene where the villain says theres no  and then the entire crew decides to mutiny him for saying that made me cringe hard

that was not the scene at all dude im hereby stripping you of your fedora and banning you from critiquing filmsfor 2 weeks",2023-05-07
the mutiny scene was good and felt natural to me you just completely misunderstood it they didnt mutiny because of his line about there being no  they mutinied because his personal obsession with catching rocket was negatively affecting all of them they straight up said this in the movie,2023-05-08
" but the scene where the villain says theres no  and then the entire crew decides to mutiny him for saying that made me cringe hard atheism doesnt deserve that sort of unnecessary prejudice 

you might want to check your own narrative and then rewatch that scene you are definitely seeing this scene through your own worldview not gunns

if were gonna pull our bonafides out i too am an atheist but i am also an mcu fan so apparently i need to remind you that gods have been a part of the mcu since the first thor film natasha literally says of loki  thor that they are basically gods 

not that that matters for this scene if every one of those minions was a rant on ratheism all day long hard core atheist they still would have mutinied when their leader proclaims himself a  in response to their concerns that the mission is being jeopardized by his person fixation of rocket and the real reason he pursues him is not for his brain but simple crude  revenge 

in short they tried to  him for being an egotist about to get them all killed for nothing he doesnt just say there is no  he proclaimed himself to be it and many gods proclaim they are the one true  the others are just pretenders hence the use of no  addressed to a group only means the one they worshipfearlove",2023-05-07
i dont want to sound like a fedora tipper proceeds to sound exactly like a fedora tipper ,2023-05-07
the villain was obsessed with perfectionism for me personally i didnt need any backstory on him theres already plenty with rocket and gammorah that shouldnt be distracted from to throw in a villain arc would have overbloated the film,2023-05-10
"i dont know about that for me i think this was a better quality movie for sure 

but endgame was just so satisfying in so many ways",2023-05-07
huh interesting i didnt catch that makes sense though,2023-05-07
completely agree this was an entertaining movie but it was some of the most obvious fan service i’ve ever seen which is why you won’t find many critical perspectives in here,2023-05-14
"gamora actor just wanted outthere was no way you are getting a mini series
 
it was weakest part of the movie because storywise it made zero sense i call  she wasnt ready to betray thanos her timeline was right when peter got the orb within in hours of meeting him on xander does this feel like or act glomora from gotg

it was pushed on us as a drugged out skinny crinimal ravanger it was poor plot thread im glad it wasnt front and center",2023-05-08
i never wanted to see a villian die as much as him he was written very well,2023-05-08
definitely wasnt feeling this one as much as volume 2 it was fun but i agree some segments really didnt hit for me,2023-05-08
i totally agree i also hated how they used gamora in this and felt the ending for some of the characters was depressing and strange starlords final scene is him just eating cereal with an old man really thats the legendary star lords final   scene he left his friends to go to the grandpas house and eat cereal utter  mantis leaves to what like what what does she want she cant find herself while living in knowhere she has to leave where the  is she even going none of that makes any   sense ugh,2023-05-08
"respect your opinion but disagree with almost all of it 

i do agree that the music was the weak point of this movie which is strange to say for a james gunn film i also agree the death fakeouts were starting to get annoying 

i thought the flashbacks were powerful stuff it’s good to understand why rocket is the way he is even if i may skip those scenes in future viewings 

do we really need a clever twist or character curveball in the end of a trilogy and presumably end of the franchise i can’t think of a movie under that scenario where that’s happened typically you want to see character arcs get wrapped up and get a glimpse of what’s in store for the characters’ futures",2023-05-08
totally agree this movie is getting far more praise than it deserves i went in very excited and left feeling very depressed and diminished was not a fan of the way the characters actedinteracted at all,2023-05-08
i thought he was great in this especially when he was trying to save rocket,2023-05-08
your  was not watching the second movie,2023-05-09
i would 100 pay to not see pratt headline another blockbuster,2023-05-09
because he was literally born like the day before the movie they said that the he rushed him out of the cocoon prematureltto get rocket,2023-05-13
because he was just born,2023-05-10
"in the comics he was introduced as him kind of a nothing character

the movie was doing him who would later become adam warlock",2023-05-12
i love the characters and still felt underwhelmed,2023-05-14
i’m not madly in love with these characters and i throughly enjoyed this movie ,2023-05-15
we’re in phase 5 now buddy,2023-05-05
maybe but i thought it was not a reference but inspired by the filmakers reading one of the copypastas years ago about  what pacman is really about  notice that he has pacman ghosts on his backpack  and if the spacesuits werent seen in space by the crew they could have assumed that the suits were secure and tried to leave that way later,2023-05-05
nobody older than 13 cares about that its a straight forward pacman reference or at a push an 80s lego spaceman reference,2023-05-15
his humor is definitely hit or miss i didnt find much of the suicide squad funny at all and these last two guardian movies are meh in that department as well i will say i mostly enjoyed his peacemaker tv series though for some reason that juvenilegross sense of humor of his works really well in that format and especially with an actor like cena,2023-05-07
youre giving the movie a 410 because you couldnt handle the gore,2023-05-10
the parts you found disturbing are designed to do that it doesnt make it a bad film,2023-05-14
that bunny with spider legs voice was so annoying,2023-05-07
"man man you’ve put my exact thoughts into words i’ll add two point of mine

• everyone seemed to be either chill or angry out of nowhere why did „emotional“  „angry“ if a character started elaborating on his feelings since when does mantis shout at people so much same goes for gamora nebula kinda always had this pissy attitude but it’s still so silly they just raised their voices and yelled if they wanted to get their point across

• why the  would they discuss at length that they should leave the exploding ship if they didn’t wanna die then rocket goes „no more turning back“ and everyone just turns around and seem to immediately forget the looming threat that they just discussed seconds before and follow rocket on a revenge killing spree freeing spree 

so much forced emotions in this movie barely anything felt natural

• also apparently it was ok for starlord to request for backup from his homie with the giant skullship only for them to get absolutely wrecked as soon as the station docked why did starlord get off of this so easily he knew what danger he was sending them into and still called for them felt like they could do anything just because they the guardians had some weird higher motif with saving rocket so  soulless towards the habitants of that space station insane",2023-05-07
only downside of the movie for me was that aspect,2023-05-05
i liked what little character development he hadbut i hated he was 110 underutilized and the movie wouldve pretty much resulted the same if they didnt use him at all,2023-05-05
"that stuck out to me too that last fight ended so fast

i just realized that he had never really called himself rocket raccoon before,2023-05-05
totally agree  loved it,2023-05-06
a characters death can have meaning even if theyre not the main character and a characters story can be good even if they dont die,2023-05-06
i wish it had more warnings i dont care about someone saying  but when youre talking about rather graphic sequences where animals and children characters are threatened there should be more warnings,2023-05-06
this might be tldr but you’re not alone  i was thinking the same about myself being the one who’s tired never been a massive marvel movie fan but i loved guardians and while this was entertaining and i enjoyed it i felt confused by the amount of praise it received as one of the ‘best marvel movies ever’ it’s got loveable rogues it’s funny it’s a gut punch it combines elements well but i don’t really understand how it does anything beyond the scope of other preexisting material  at one point drax even says ‘try picking on someone your own size’ and it’s like for a movie praised for its characters they still need the old cliches i get that its aimed at a wide audience and it can’t be overly complex but it felt like where it thrived was in its smaller situations the creep intro quill venting about his relationship to a hostage dinner with bat humans etc and not the large scale big baddie stuff the rocket stuff was well done and obviously was key to the story but it also felt like it was removing the pace the general plot around rocket was basically 101 dalmations but instead of a fur coat it’s a civilisation elements like the warlock felt unnecessary and like he existed as a deusex machina for quill at the end visually i don’t think anything was as uniquely arresting as the opening from guardians 1 but the multicoloured spacesuits were cool it just didn’t really subvert expectations and i don’t get what makes it noteworthy i think because they tried to cram so much in rather than a final instalment to send the characters off it felt like getting tiny fragments of them it almost felt like it should have been a tv show so every character could have more focus before we could see the results of their experiences and teamwork with a different lens i don’t know if that lines up with what you experienced but just thought i’d share i did really enjoy it but not enough to be like wow amazing it makes me wonder  the other marvel movies are like if this is one of the best,2023-05-07
"well they didnt give him one it was being forced upon them 

alan horns boneheaded reactionary decision to fire gunn for something they were already aware of did not go over well in both the guardians cast marvel feige was totally against it but he saw that horn had made his decision so it was dangerous to fight it not after horn  iger made ike pearlman irrelevant to marvel studios operations and disney but it also upset not just the fans but many in the industry thought it was a   response to what was a coordinated take down move from the right against gunn it was just going to encourage them to keep bullying hollywood over issues 

horn rehired gunn to save face bautista was letting it be known that he would only do the required minimum of his contract and after that would be gone from the mcu bautista and pratts reactions to gunns firing is a study in what true loyalty looks like pratt did not come off well imho",2023-05-07

"i thought it was fine

even though they’ve been in five movies together at this point and a cameo in thor 4 their ending seems very premature

i’m not wild about the gamora plot line in general either maybe they’re setting it up for a warlock and gamora love interest but gamora in this is kind of a  even in gotg 1 she wasn’t this stubborn and obnoxious i would have added a scene where kraglin gives advice to peter ‘she’s not your gamora’ and gamora ‘he had a special thing with the other you you don’t have to like him but try to understand his situation’ separately and he helps them both accept the other’s situation it would have been a good rounding off of kraglin’s development too

it’s got a good corridor fight scene

all in all i wasn’t bored watching the movie but the end of their adventures feels very forced also the new guardians team looks kind of 

using adam warlock as comic relief was a terrible decision by gunn hack level garbage",2023-05-09
yes this movie is not that great yet everyone seems to love it i don’t get it the 1st movie was way better than this one,2023-09-05
dude i saw the movie yesterday and literally felt the same dont know why youre being downvoted are we so starved for a good marvel movie that were giving this a 910 even the first guardians was way better than this,2023-08-09
same here i went to the bathroom about an hour in after bawling my eyes out continued to bawl my eyes out in said bathroom and didn’t know if i was going to make it back into the theater i did go back in and like you said it was a pretty miserable time was it an overall great movie yes but will not be rewatching ,2023-05-05

"past gamora wasn’t with the guardians at the end of endgame or in thor 4

last we saw her in endgame was before tony snapped  we just know at the end of endgame the guardians are aware she’s still around somewhere

the whole “not remembering her time with the guardians” thing is in fact because she didn’t spend time with the guardians she’s not the same gamora the one that died in iw  so she never joined the guardians and experienced what old gamora did",2023-05-05

"i really really do not understand all the praise for the villain in this film  i came to this thread expecting a lot of  about him and instead one of the highest comments is praising him over and over again  easily the worst villain in the entire mcu apart from whatever the  mickey rourke’s character was in iron man 2  

all this villain did was scream and yell and throw tantrums  it made zero sense for a dude they tried to build up as this ultra intelligent dude playing   one of the worst on screen performances i’ve seen and that’s partly on gunn and partly on the actor  i guess redditors just think that screaming your  head off on camera makes for good acting

minor nit i was kind of disappointed in the soundtrack on this one  song titles were all over the place in era and genre it made sense with volume 1 being his mom’s favorite songs and then him discovering her volume 2 at the end of the first movie ok we get her taste in music evolving a bit stepping firmly from the late 70’s ballads to mid 80’s stuff when quill was born  this just felt less organic with the transition and i think there were better choices from the late 80’s and early 90’s we kind of just skipped through the whole decade for no reason  

i know it’s weird to keep harping on the music but i feel it’s so central to the movies it’s worth discussing  there were way too many scenes where loud music just booms over a quiet scene with little to no other noise  it was cool in the first movie the second did it more without it getting to old but it felt like they did it 910 times in this movie compared to once or twice in the other movies  i was rolling my eyes by the 5th or 6th time and it kept happening 

last of all it just felt like they put in cute animals and tortured them specifically to tug at our heart strings  having a “pulled down from heaven” moment as rocket is getting revived felt so corny and out of place for the mcu let alone the guardians movies  

one bright spot was zoe saldana’s acting she showed more range in this movie than i realized she had  her character was a bit uneven seemed like her turn from being a  to softening up a bit came out of nowhere but i put that on writing more than performance",2023-08-03

gamora cant rememebr quill because it isnt the same gamora she is from the past before quill met her and shared all those moments with they are effectively two different people she didnt die and came back she died and stayed dead another one took her place,2023-05-08
gammorah is this movie is literally a different person shell never remember it because she didnt experience it,2023-05-08
i wouldnt be so  karen here nebula is a terrible character both in the movies and the comics that really limited what she could do with the role,2023-05-08
i liked it but i did think 2 blew this one out of the water this one was more darker which is completely fine it just felt like 1 more film would’ve been even better before jumping into this one as their last,2023-05-24
the cuts felt so jarring really emotional moments to really sudden comedic scenes just pulled me out of the experience,2023-05-05
yep absolutely annoying,2023-05-08
yeah the costume design was really poor here like they just looked silly and the animal people looked so  it took me out of it,2023-05-07
very strange choice why in a movie with such onthenose needledrops throughout  do they whiff on the closer song with one that hasnt stood the test of time,2023-05-07
yeah that was not my favorite thing it totally took me out of the scene,2023-05-07
james gunn said that was the audience being able to understand his language,2023-05-07
too bad’s groot’s been boring since the 2nd movie,2023-05-05
i agree with a lot of this assessment i felt the villain was very shallow because we never got any real backstory or motive of why he was doing what he was doing,2023-05-06
gunns wife was the comms lady on the orgo station that got shot in the leg,2023-05-06
i was def not expecting it there was thinking it would come near the end and that it would be directed towards the bad guy,2023-05-07
gonna be honest i didn’t even register it forgot marvel movies don’t do that,2023-05-11
you mean someone said  wow ive never heard that word in my entire life,2023-05-07
on warlock i think gunn expected he’d make appearances in the avengers films at some point but it never came to fruition warlock was alluded to in the end credits of gotg2 so he was a loose end that needed tying up before he left the studio,2023-05-08
it could have just been rocket hallucinating  but those characters are only sapient due to thier modifications  thats how they see their own bodies,2023-05-08
i hated that end dance sequence felt like it turned into some kiddy pg movie there the rest of the movie was great though,2023-05-05

"for all intents and purposes adam is a child who is experiencing things for the first time like physical pain kids process complex emotions like grief differently adam seems to have more of a stoic response and that’s okay 

as for badass moments the danger is if you make adam too op he will steal the show from the guardians it would be like when the justice league are getting their  handed to them and superman swoops in at the last minute and wrecks shop 

now you might ask why introduce adam if you are just going to nerf him well that’s the ongoing question that seems to plague marvel going back to the early days of hulk i don’t mind the nerfing if it fits well in the story and this seemed to fit in my opinion",2023-05-08
yeah i was hoping for that too he understood who killed his mother,2023-05-08
there was probably a different guardians movie in mind or more before james gunn got fired so adam probably had a different role so i guess he had to be change to fit the story and resolve that thread,2023-05-09
most mcu movies i’ll watch once and then never be interested again,2023-05-08
most mcu movies i’ll watch once and then never be interested again,2023-05-08

he didnt think he would get trapped in space after trying to get it and if youve seen vol 2 you should know why the zune is important to peter,2023-05-12

it was a minor side tangeant but it didnt feel shoe horned in to me when the last film ending with him getting the finarrow itd be weird not to see him using it at all in this film and since he uses it it goes by extension that he probably has to get good at it by the end,2023-05-10
they do explain warlocks motivation his species was created by the high evolutionary so they see him as a  he and his mother were tasked with getting rocket otherwise their species would be wiped out or at least fall out of favor with their  as we saw with the furry planet the high evolutionary doesnt think twice about destroying the creations that disappoint him,2023-05-13

yeah that is one of the negative comments people make that i agree with  not much focus was put on the enormity of it   it was acknowledged but you killed all those people kind of understates itdid any of batch 90 survive  they rescued batch 91 which i think was the green people  its not really clear just how big the colony was  we know at least the bat family had kids  we saw the first generation likely was created as adults  i dont remember how old the kids look so the society is at least as old as those kids i would guess  also i dont think it was nicer than our earth  that was the point it ended up as just an anthropomorphic animal version of earth  the high evolutionary wanted all of the art and society without the problems,2023-05-11
i thought the point of it was that it was literally the same as earth and the high evolutionary fails at pretty much everything he does there was still violence and crack dealers so it’s reasonable to assume there were still wars and other bad ,2023-05-13
not dark or sad a whole planet of innocent animal people gets killed some blowing up right in front of your face and the rocket scenes were sad as ,2023-05-05
i too loved their romance but this is a way better direction for it theyre different people now its bittersweet in the best of ways,2023-05-09
"if this was going to be zoe saldanas last film as she wants out and chris pratt was still in then what options would they have had even if gamora hadnt died i can imagine 1 gamora dies anyways while fighting to save rocket 2 gamora and peter realize they are not meant for each other and go their separate ways 3 gamora finds some new purpose where she has to leave the guardians 

giving gamora a happy ending of sorts and having peter accept her as a new person and accepting that his gamora is dead was a better end for me than any of the other options",2023-05-09
"i actually really identified with the emotional core of the situation i had a girl i was head over heels in love with and then we drifted apart and she reinvented herself in a way that to me feels like this she still exists but its not her anymore its weird and sad and confusing and frustrating

so theres that",2023-05-11
"i agree killing off gammorah was dumb not that it happened at all but how rushed and glossed over it was in an overpacked film but she did ask peter to  her if thanos took her so technically its what she wanted

personally i would have hated them getting back together in 3 thats so cliche and shes basically a different person who will experience different things she has zero memories of quill i think him coming on way too strong and her rebelling against that fits her character very well and it was great character growth for quill to accept that his gammorrah is gone and finally start moving on from that",2023-05-10
i think thats kind of the point though  both peter and the audience need to understand that the gamora he loved died  she was murdered by her adoptive father  she cant come back  and without the several months of events together prime gamora had she never formed the same connections to the others or to peter  you can see over the course of the movie her reactions to the team and how much they love each other  then at the end she loves her ravager family  i think by the end of the movie she understands how prime gamora was part of the team and loved peter but shes a different person,2023-05-11
yours is an interesting take glad ive set the comment to automatically sort by controversial,2023-07-13

in a bad way or good way in my understanding he talked but in a way it was as if us the audience could understand him now,2023-05-06
i was reading that the reason we understand him is because we have spent so much time with him that we are starting to understand him,2023-05-06
i mean the movie doesn’t portray him as being particularly intelligent lol,2023-05-06

he wasnt speaking english it was meant that we are part of the family and we finally understood his language like gamorah at the end,2023-05-09
a believe its his anti gravity boots  he mentions them when he was walking upside down at the beginning  high evolutionary power was gravity based so it was countered by the boots,2023-05-10
it started off almost immediately with a fight scene after very brief  carry so i disagree i was actually surprised there wasnt more expository and they waited until the elevator scene to play recap,2023-05-10

when the violence is fantasyalien they dont tend to be as strict so long as youre not seeing a lot of human blood and gore so like that scene where rocket was tearing up the dudes face was more implied i think they did a great job of making a pg13 movie feel more r rated pushed the limits for sure,2023-05-13

im kinda curious what he does with superman though thats not exactly the type of character for fbombs and  jokes,2023-05-07
i agree with you about the gunnmcu combo i really bounced right the  suicide squad he was very little constraint but in the mcu he really is just the right amount of himself as you say,2023-05-08
aside from quill referencing the events of iweg in what sounded like james gunns thoughts in the elevator scene was there any connectivity or references to the rest of the mcu i didnt see easy and it was great for it,2023-05-09

" be full on menacing

adam warlock is a good guy though and being naive is how he is initially intorduced of course in the comics eventually warlock matures into thanos rival and in fact he is the one who beats thanos after thanos obtains the infinity gauntlett but of course we are never getting that character",2023-05-08

groot is not immortal this groot is not the same being as the one from the first film",2023-05-09

knowhere seems to have some kind of atmosphere around it to an extent but its never really laid out plainly or anything also lots of movies portray dying in space as freezing but you wouldnt actually freeze and you could survive after being in a vacuum for as long as quill was,2023-05-08
its fiction  so is  the hitchhiker’s guide to the galaxy which says that if you hold a lungful of air you can survive in the total vacuum of space for about thirty seconds  so by fictionrules hes fine,2023-05-08

gamora was killed by thanos to get the soul stone i think it was one of them and that gamora who connected with the guardians is dead in endgame nebula and don cheadle go back in time to get the time stone from the planet peter found it on they do but because nebula is a robot person there being two of her is picked up by thanos this past thanos past gamora and past nebula kidnap nebula and send past nebula into the future she brings thanos and gamora and nebula into the future right after hulk snaps to undo thanoss snap and then everyone fights past gamora then kills past nebula due to nebula talking to her and then flees this gamora is for all intents and purposes a different character,2023-05-11
i think they were building to the groot thing with new gamora not understanding him until the end implying that weve been with them all long enough to understand him finally,2023-05-05
naw you didnt over sell it this movie was  incredible i didnt think i would love this as much as i did this is probably in the top 3top5 best marvel movies of all time,2023-05-05
i think the feel is similar to what happens after let’s say school  college graduation where everyone start to walk their own paths the bond between friends is still there sometimes you aren’t even far from each other you get to see each other from time to time but the best part the happiest part is over you can just reminisce about it everyone starts a new chapter of their life which is both happy and sad,2023-05-07
it was by far the best post endgame mcu and to me probably deserves to be top 5 overall it had heart and the instant switch from comedy to drama to action back to comedy to heartbreak and back again was so natural that so many other films fail miserably at,2023-05-13
they use the gravity boots so his gravity powers don’t matter without that he’s just an insecure faceless loser,2023-05-13
he was in a post credits scene in vol 2 with stakars ravager team so i guess it made sense to bring him back here,2023-05-05

they typically have a human standin for rocket scenes with him being cgied in later sean gunn who also plays kraglin usually does this job whether he sits in high evolutionary’s lap for those young rocket scenes i can’t tell you,2023-05-08
you should have complained maybe should still complain because clearly that wasnt supposed to project like that,2023-05-11

ned who,2023-05-13
that confused me because yondu said that to peter not kraglin but yeahwe can just assume he heard it,2023-05-18
i think people generally think of guardians as one of the top tier marvel franchises actually at first before people saw the first movie sure they thought it was going to be third rate side comedic group but after i feel like it became one of the most anticipated maybe not spiderman iron man or avengers level but def a tier with thor and cap maybe im bias because theyre s for me,2023-08-12
how did that scene not add anything to the movie,2023-05-07

well they me too multiple times in the movie he is basically a child he was born too soon out of his egg in gotg2 and isnt fully matured he basically is like shazam also he was never going to be the villain because warlock is a  the comics,2023-05-10
isnt adam being childlike a core part of his personality though to be fair ive only seen him in one other thing but he was like a kid there too,2023-05-10

my big issue with his motivation is that it made him feel like discount thanos what would have been more interesting to me is if hed been directly influenced by thanos in that he agreed the universe needed saving but he wanted to do so by creating a perfect society to serve as a model for everyone else having him be fueled purely by ego was kind of boring for me,2023-05-07

same  i was waiting for him to start ranting about a better world a world without sin,2023-05-12
the thing is that it makes sense when you consider his character this was a man who absolutely could not stand the very idea that one of his creations made to be thrown away could be better than him any capacity and stepping back even the tiniest bit was an admission that rocket was smarter than him high evolutionary could always get another ship another colony another crew but he would never be able to get back his ego because of how fragile it was,2023-05-12
the man was a selfdestructive narcissist and not a fighter not at all he was a perfectly acted excuse to delve into rockets backstory and develop multiple characters not everyone has to be a universeending threat this was personal,2023-09-12
"i didnt understand his motivation why the animals

they are part of his experiments to try to uplift lower lifeforms

wh earth

because he visited it at one point and took a liking to their culture he explain this outright to quill

why  everyone

counterearth was not perfect so he blowed it up again he explains it to quill when quill point out the flaws in counterearth

why anything

because he wanted to created a perfect society according to his vision

 i dont see why you need to ask these questions the high evolutionary literally monologues about what he does in almost every scene hes in",2023-05-25

but isnt this a happy ending for a different gamora isnt the real gamora like oficially dead now never to regain her life like everyone else that didnt fall off the magic cliff,2023-05-16

you gotta avoid more than just trailers nowadays and it really sucks  before watching this movie today i scrolled past a youtube video with the caption zoe saldana reveals why this is her last time playing gamora and i was so ,2023-05-08
i watched the trailer but by the time the movie out i completly forgot what was it all about lol,2023-05-08
problem is theyre unavoidable in the theater unless youre just the right amount of late i was forced to sit through the renfield trailer at least six or seven times ive involuntarily seen the marvels trailer like three times was forced to endure the trailer for elementals yesterday before guardians for the second time seen the dead reckoning trailer at least 8 times by now although that ones actually good,2023-05-07
i enjoyed the soundtrack a lot but in the back of my mind i was really expecting nirvana the whole time super happy to see the the on the sound track bonus points to the little girl at the end who lived britney spears and korn,2023-05-11
finally some one else said it everyone seems to be missing that og gamora did not have a happy ending your right it does make the breakup make more sense everyone keeps saying how happy gamoras ending is that is not this stories actual gamora we really just met this charactor and this is her first full movie,2023-05-16
i hope so to man her and peter story was really sad to me i think that zoe said she is done though which is a bummer i mean peter is back on earth with a grandpa who is about to die and now all alone with a dead mom love of his life and family and the real gamora is one of the only charactors that was not brought back even tony stark has a potential ghost or download version of himself gamora and black widow are like dead dead which is sad,2023-05-16
"the original gamora went through a chain of events that made her left thanos and led to the event at the first movie then found love and family with the guardians

the current gamora didnt live those moment she was still a loyal ruthless daughter of thanos nebula always mentioned about how cruel gamora was and this new gamora showed it 

to her defense imagine coming to a new universe where everyone loved an alternate version of yourself and tried to convert you to become someone who you are not thats why she didnt go along with guardians ravagers however accepted her as who she is she found family in them",2023-05-19
northyam i have been thinking the same thing how is his ending good girl is dead and now there is no way to get her back his grandpa is going to die and hes now alone on earth what working some 95 until he dies of liver failure at 60 this was a great movie but star lord and gamora got the shaft not happy at all,2023-05-16
i mean i love the movie just didn’t think it was a super happy ending,2023-05-16
"i get that read but i didnt take that last interaction as suggesting shes into him or that theres real potential for something between them it was more going from being pretty annoyed by him to realizing hes a decent dude kind of a okay now i sort of get how this happened its not her giving the green light its her saying she now understands why that other girl gave him the green light

for example in real life if your exs twin sister is adjacent to your friend group as a result spends more time around you and eventually concedes okay i get how you and sis worked now shes not saying she wants to date you",2023-05-08
you’re a film studies major aren’t you,2023-05-08
i agree but sadly i think because gunn and some of the actors this is the end also it seems like people weirdly like star lords clearly depressing ending and are even saying it is happy i get visiting your estranged grandfather before he dies but leaving your family and giving up on a love that was rekindling for good to move back to earth watch your grandfather die in a house full of pics of you when you were happy with a living mother kinda sad but i do agree gunn left the door open not closed like everyone is saying its just that we will never see it,2023-05-16
"end on a somber note guardians 2 literally had the movie end with a funeral for yondu and peter grieving him with a final shot of rocket crying infinity war ended with everybody losing

theres actually quite a few bittersweet mcu endings",2023-05-22
how the  did she break her wrist at the beginning her neck at least is indestructable,2023-05-10
the more i watched the more i think shes literally top heavy like some of it is her messing around but the other part is that her head must weigh much more than her legs so it throws her weight off balance,2023-05-30
and then using the new visual angle to continue fighting  wild,2023-05-07
shes the t1000 at this point unkillable  building weapons out of her body,2023-05-08
man nebula gets her  rocked so many times in this movie and i love it,2023-05-08
it doesnt feel brutal to me given what her body is at this point,2023-05-08

that last one had an actual loud cracking noise when she got up like nothing was wrong after that probably one of my hardest laughs during the movie,2023-05-15

that was so ridiculous that it was entertaining,2023-05-06
meanwhile howard the duck has been relegated to just a throwaway gag once per movie across the trilogy ,2023-05-06
james gunn is good at elevating the silly support characters,2023-05-07
i mean in the comics cosmo was a proper member of the group,2023-05-07
wish howard the duck got a bigger role though or at least is shown fighting instead of just appearing he did appear in endgame  but we never saw him actually fight,2023-05-06
the sincerity of james gunn he just does it,2023-05-08
loved every moment with cosmo i wish she was in the series from the start,2023-05-24
i was just reading some of the comics recently where cosmo is head of security for knowhere and i was so happy it was a similar level of job importance there,2023-05-26
why is that hilarious,2023-05-07
tell that to howard the duck,2023-05-13
i love how that’s a play on the common saying of “it may have been terrible but atleast we had “insert basic need” in the soviet union” when old people are reminiscing,2023-05-07
im not a full blown comics fan so im probably under educated here but i loved that this was the explanation for cosmos being with the gotg i was laughing on the inside for this as a life long space nut,2023-05-08
the poker game was the best everyone there was just so tired about the beef,2023-05-08

what happened to rockets friends especially floor really got to me ,2023-05-08
that’s what i said afterwards too,2023-05-07
also in “bodies bodies bodies” good movie,2023-05-05
shes the head of security at knowhere in the comics op telekinetic space dog,2023-05-20

"cosmo was actually in the first guardians collector had her in a cage and then she escaped after the base got blown up from the power stone seen again in the end credits with howard the duck

next time seen in the holiday special so basically cosmo just stayed on knowhere the whole time since the first movie and when the guardians came to setup shop on knowhere started hanging out with them

mantis was always quills half sister as she is a daughter of ego but they didnt go into that in gotg2 but she tells him at the end of the holiday special",2023-05-07

i unfortunately understood that reference ,2023-05-06
the bad dog joke was not funny  talk about beating a dead horse,2023-05-30
like one giant gross scene set in a walking colon it was so gross,2023-05-07
when they showed the orgocorp hq and it  looked like a giant  i knew we were getting something special  what an absolutely on brand thing for james gunn to do and im so happy his legacy in the mcu includes a giant  space station ,2023-07-11
he cried like i do in my crying dreams,2023-05-07
 floor man she really tug at my heart strings during the wailing and then when rocket turned around and saw teefs and floor dead i burst into tears i’m still not over it james gunn is officially my favorite direct lol i’ve never had a movie make me full blown cry,2023-05-08
that can i come too scene was where i started to cry a little,2023-05-13
tbh i was expecting the other animals to appear as mutated bodyguards for he kinda like the pig so i was honestly shocked when they all died,2023-05-15
i saw what was to come and i knew i wouldn’t be strong enough to face it,2023-05-14
it was heart breaking  i cried a lot during this movie lol,2023-08-11
cronenbergesque imo,2023-05-06
remind me a lot of made in abyss  up ,2023-05-17
i got back from seeing it a couple of hours ago im still telling myself that its ok its only a movie it didnt really happen that was possibly the most traumatic scene ive seen in a marvel movie,2023-05-08
it was uncomforatble the whole time i am super sensitive to seeing animal abuse i could not watch this stuff and pretty much cried very hard for me and i dont think ill watch it in theaters again with that said it was a great film,2023-05-08
agreed i mean it’s a good film but it’s extremely difficult for me to separate my sadness and judge the film on its merits if my sister were still alive she would have walked out and cried in the car james gunn really got me in the heart with this one,2023-05-07
at the scene where rocket says his first word i said “i hate this” like full volume and the feeling never send away i just…i don’t know i can’t remember anything except the upsetting parts and it’s really bothering me but i guess that’s my fault for going into it blind,2023-05-07
yup same  it was brutal  i cried a lot  knowing it’s a movie and rocket would eventually  the villain up in the finale was the only reason i wasn’t obnoxiously sobbing in the theater  poor floors,2023-05-10
oh  same all around i still cry just reading your comment im traumatized a bit,2023-05-09
just saw it and feel exactly the same really  me up and wasnt expecting that from the film,2023-05-13
i keep seeing the images of the animals every time i wake up in the morning and become upset and cry i have a cat and i’ve been holding her and playing with her to help ease the pain of seeing animals abused but this was just too much for me most disturbed i’ve been from a movie reading everyone’s comments is making me feel better though i thought i was being too sensitive but it is grounding to see other people say it felt like those scenes went too far,2023-05-26

i watched it in my country with subtitles and i can confirm she was saying rocker teefs floor go now,2023-05-07
i thought she was saying “rocket teach floor go now” like she desperately was looking to him for direction on how to survive which made it even more heartbreaking for me at the time,2023-05-06

panic attack,2023-05-05
"she just saw lilah get killed she wasnt as intelligent as the others to communicate as well all she knew was danger we need to go feeling and kept repeating it

she knew they needed to leave but also wanted her friends to leave too lastly she again wasnt as smart so she knew they should leave but didnt have a plan on how to escape or where to go

so she just wanted rocket and teefs to lead her to safety

more disappointed warlock didnt do much,2023-05-29
quill and gamora’s ending is also a way for us to know why gamora isn’t there with him or around him the next time we see him saldana is firmly and solidly done with the role they were always going to end up apart gamora was apparently supposed to die in vol 2 but was spared i imagine that if she hadn’t died in infinity war than she might have died in this one,2023-05-08
his first word too   someone else in the comments brought up the parallel with adam’s first word we hear him say is “that hurts” lots of parallels between him and rocket for sure,2023-05-10
"ill put it here since this thread is old so not a lot of people can see it but the peter and gamora parts hit really hard for me in a beautifully sad sort of way rocket has and will always be my favorite guardian so i was so surprised that the quillgamora stuff got to me the way it did 

i got divorced last year and losing her is the hardest thing ive ever gone through it wasnt a negative or hateful split we just werent compatible anymore as spouses but shes still my best friend and id do anything for her the kind of relationship that played out in the movie obsessed with the old relationship being around the woman you love move than anything in the world but knowing that what you had before is gone and its not coming back coming to peace with the way things are now while not letting go of how you feel inside especially the lines you know im still not who you want me to be i know but who you are aint so bad its just perfectly written and encapsulates that feeling of bittersweet acceptance of not having what you want but appreciating what you still have i was watching this with a friend in a call and i hate to mute my mic after that for a few minutes to collect myself movies never make me cry but this one brought a tear or two 

sorry for the wall i just really wanted to get that out",2023-09-03

the floor character definitely brought the we3 vibes into the story but its hardly a shameless ripoff and calling the script for this movie bland just seems disingenuous 
 
i dont want to get into we3 spoilers but the stories arent that similar beyond being experimental lab animal stories you might as well say its a the secret of nimh ripoff",2023-05-11
i agree with you the rocket stuff was all that kept me interested part of that is knowing how far gunn has taken all these characters from their comic book roots adam warlock as mediocre comic relief is so strange,2023-05-15
i think morrison is listed in the credit alongside other comics authors whose workcreations were adapted for this film i might be wrong but i think i saw his name there,2023-05-17
imagine being brought into existence only to immediately just know pain and suffering how horrifying and tragic that must be,2023-05-06
dammit me too,2023-05-07
you dont have to given thats the one word a lot of jav girls say,2023-05-24
"he actually couldve still beaten the guardians but ranaway instead because of the shock of getting hurt

he had enough strength to fly back to his planet after all",2023-05-06
the fact he was so surprised by the pain and struggle says he isn’t used to it at all unlike rocket plus he was clearly a spoiled brat and it wasn’t his first word,2023-05-05
i love this version of warlock hes naive kid in strong body and he doesnt understand a lot but follows his heart,2023-05-15
which is why it took me out a bit when rocket was gleefully killing the soldier creations thy were so similar to his original friends,2023-05-06
this is random but will pourter’s shirtless moments at the end didn’t hit as hard when he’s all gold,2023-05-09

"reporter how do you want to respond to uhandtoglandwombat  

me … hurts",2023-05-07
my interpretation is that he always knew and that powerful moment was him coming to terms and embracing it rather than discovering it,2023-05-05
i never got that it kept bugging me that everyone seems to have forgotten that nebula and rocket spent five years on earth nebula would probably know how to drive a car and rocket would for sure know what a raccoon is,2023-05-06
its not that he hasnt known hes super intelligent its just every time hes been called whatever creature it has always been to insult him its just his defense mechanism the only time he allows being called anything is when thor does it as he never does it with malicious intent,2023-05-08
and now it means hes also from earth like peter,2023-05-15
it was sort of sweet to see that he is an american raccoon technically he and quill were from the same hometown when he was first introduced i thought he was an alien which is why he was sentient as an animallooking being,2023-05-28
astounded at the payoff to his “i didn’t ask to get made” line in gotg1 when was that 2014 there’s no way they had all this in mind all along really really impressive throughline,2023-05-20
kinda  at starlord never sitting rocket down and going “no dude you are lichtrually a raccoon that’s the name of your species i know this because our species are from the same planet”,2023-08-04
gosh i was so slow i didnt really get that moment i thought he was just ensuring its the right cagw he wanted to save until when my boyfriend said that its the first time he confirmed his species i thought he was just furious being called a racoon as he has evolved to be better than an animal but dude really didnt know what he is ,2023-05-19
i love that they managed to incorporate that without breaking my favourite mcu running joke of all earth mammals are universally known and recognized except raccoons,2023-05-26
yep makes sense james gunn said that he mostly came back to do volume 3 because he wanted to finish rockets story,2023-05-07

"i remember disneymarvel hyping up doctor strange 2 for having horror elements

this movie had an order of magnitude more horror elements than that and they didnt hint at it at all",2023-05-06
i’m pretty sure after the  james gunn was hit with getting fired for old tweets he regrets by one exec who allegedly didn’t even talk with anybody about it they let him have full carte blanche with the movie especially since this movie was supposed to come out long ago,2023-05-06
it was pretty grimdark for a marvel movie they basically took that guy with the computer in his head and murdered him in cold blood,2023-05-08
coming off making the suicide squad its probably hard for him to tone himself back down,2023-05-06
"  i feel as though james gunn wanted to see how far disneymarvel would let him go by

my general understanding of the story is that the guardians cast was in full mutiny unless marvel studios rehired gunn and he must have already known he was getting all or most of the keys to to the kingdom at warner bros so he had the brass over a barrel

im guessing that the deal was that he finishes up the trilogy for them if he got to do it however he wanted the results speak for themselves this movie rules",2023-06-15
chris pratt actually suggested in an interview that his fbomb was improvised,2023-05-08
to be fair gunn uses lesser known and older music not much cost in that not like hes getting music from frank “coachella” ocean,2023-05-05

gives me hope for blade and mcu horror,2023-05-15
i dont think its so much that he pushed the limits of pg13 but that he actually bothered to utilize it too many movies these could easily be pg imo,2023-05-30

she did that in the first movie too tbf its just that she was an antagonist then,2023-05-08

me too i was still crying after i reached home from the movies thinking about rocket lyla teefth and floor this movie really showed animals perspective and the things that happened to rocket and his friends are happening to animals in real testexperiements we humans are no good,2023-05-19

it was rough i’m a big animal lover so those scenes were especially painful to watch but beautifully done",2023-05-06
it was nice that rocket saw lylla teefs and floor in their new world with ‘beautiful skies’ when he was being revived though,2023-05-06
"knowing how it must have ended with the other three dead and the horrors that were being inflicted upon them made every scene with them thick with tension in the background as i waited for the shoe to drop when it did it wasnt unexpected  but that rising tension really hit

that scene hit me so hard i was bawling my eyes out in the theater all the rocket flashback scenes with his friends they just wanted to live and be happy,2023-05-06
that’s what got me the most ,2023-05-05
gunn perfectly encapsulated the sweet innocence and happiness of animals and how it often directly contradicts with the cruel and deceptive  manipulative nature of humans cosmoss bad dog bit was another great example of such dichotomy kraglin called cosmos a bad dog out of spite when cosmos was just always eager to please and help out,2023-05-08
it was very difficult to watch honestly first time ive seen a marvel film and thought is this really appropriate pretty traumatic,2023-05-07

not the kind of person who cries at movies but my word… every scene with rocket just about had me welling up the beginning alone with creep all of the young rocket scenes not sure if it was because rocket reminds me so much of my dog but i was not prepared for it that scene was tough,2023-05-08
my beard was wet my dude i just wanted to be home to hold my bunny right to my chest the whole time it was  me  animal testing,2023-05-17

just watched the movie tonight and that scene had me sobbing like a baby,2023-12-28
i cried the entire 2 hrs and 30 minutes starting the minute the hands reached in for baby rocket all the animal cruelty cases his friends dying… did me in  i immediately ran home and hugged my dog extra long,2023-05-06

my girlfriend was still crying for like 10 minutes after the credits,2023-05-05
your wife and i should be friends  i started crying 5 minutes in to the movie ive been home for an hour still crying  like had to take ibuprofen know im going to feel hungover tomorrow crying,2023-05-05
im crying just reading this entire thread it was an emotion masterpiece and obviously we laughed so hard at the comedic relief,2023-05-05
im honestly afraid to watch it after reading about these scenes which sucks because i really do want to see the rest of it but im like your wife this kind of  gets to me and will stick with me for ages i can still tear up on cue just by thinking about that  futurama episode i might have to wait until its streaming and just find out where to fast forward ,2023-05-05
i’m sitting here watching the credits tearing up because i read these comments and they reminded me of the scene,2023-05-06
i cried three times during this movie really didnt expect i would,2023-05-07
i held it together until i got home and saw my cat  dont think a marvel movie has ever made me feel this much before,2023-05-06
oh  no its a good thing i had my mask on because it was basically nonstop for me the moment it started haha my mask absorbed my tears i waited till almost everyone walked out and just in case i avoided eye contact with everyone by keeping my head down when walking out,2023-05-05
"i usually just cry on sadtouching scenes on tv shows and movies but for some reason i did not shed a single tear on this probably because i expected them to die i am pretty sure most people predicted that but some part of me still hope i was wrong when they died i just feel sad sad that they never got a chance to at least see the sky before they die my thoughts then was really on how rocket must have felt that there was nothing he can do at that time to change the outcome

but i dont think i can watch the movie again i watched the movie really late at night so i was probably a little sleepy to really process the movie i will probably cry manly tears if i watch the movie again",2023-05-05
that’s how i’ve been thinking about it all day phenomenal movie but i plan on never watching it again ,2023-05-06
an incredible movie and i do want to watch it again but those scenes are devastating  my partner and i kept saying how good it was but oh my  i think i can only watch it at home from now on i was trying so hard not to sob out loud,2023-05-06
agreed i can’t watch this again i’m going to start bawling because of that one scene it was lowkey traumatizing,2023-05-07
i said this too incredibly good movie but i will not be able to watch this ever again also i dont think anyone under the age of 18 should watch it im 27 and i could not handle what i watched,2023-05-05
when i got home it was like that rick and morty episode where they start cry screaming when they get back home in the ship,2023-05-07

that was the weird part about iweg is them writing the characters outside of their franchises,2023-05-05
like magically giving him his mask and boots back that got destroyed by ego in gotg 2 and then make it weird that he didnt have them for the entire 3rd movie lol,2023-05-06
yea this is it both ragnarok and love and thunder had similar scenes designed to catch up casual viewers on the story disguised as a gag,2023-05-13
quill explains what happened with him and gamora to the manager in the elevator including a line where he mentions he lost his temper and almost killed half the universe by punching thanos  gunn has said he disagreed with that creative decision,2023-05-05
"tldw is that gamora and nebula are the adopted daughters of a guy named thanos whos obsessed with killing half the universe to ensure long term stability against resource depletion yes its kinda dumb obviously the population will replenish with time thanos plots to get a bunch of powerful artifacts called the infinity stones to enact this plan once he has them all he has to do is snap his fingers to get what he wants but to get one of them he needs to sacrifice someone he truly loves  gamora  so he kills her by throwing her into a bottomless pit that gamora is still dead

eventually he succeeds in killing half the universe with the snap because peter  up and punches him in the face in revenge for gamora when theyve temporarily successfully subdued him after the snap thanos is tracked down and thor slices his  head off but ultimately it doesnt matter because he already won

everyone is sad for 5 years because he also destroyed the infinity stones to prevent anyone from reversing the snap but then they do time travel to get a new set of infinity stones to reverse the snap in the process they bring thanos and gamora back via time travel as well and this gamora is still working for thanos because its before she ditched his  and past thanos  near reacquires the stones tony stark manages to trick thanos and gets ahold of the stones and undoes the snap killing both himself a human overwhelmed by cosmic power and thanos probably intentionally killed by tony in the process some real jesus imagery in all of that too",2023-05-19
" this just made me realize rockets friends must have been successes too

they may not have been as smart as rocket but they were able to give themselves names i guess the high evolutionary overlooked them because they couldnt do the crazy science  that rocket could",2023-05-06

"the way they played the song “do you realize” and cut to drax during the line “everyone you know someday will die” 

i totally started getting emotional and was waiting for him to bite the dust",2023-05-05
they hit a  goldmine with casting dave bautista as draxbut james gunn definitely should have invested in drax tragic backstory,2023-05-06
"i really thought that was gonna be it in the weird as  bio engineered angel of the bible it now makes me wonder if that existed and that’s how the bible got those descriptions of angels

but then i realized it was rockets story so i put money on him next loved where gunn went with it",2023-05-07
i was sure going in rocket would die,2023-05-10
it’s much more satisfying to see all the guardians choosing their own destinies rather than one of them dying and they decide to disband,2023-05-05
he’s slowly becomes a bigger and bigger deal in the comics and he has been leader of the guardians a couple of times in the comic he and groom play a huge role in secret wars so i’m looking forward to see what they do with him in that plus rocket is basically mcu’s grogu so they can’t  him off he sells too much merch,2023-05-05
i was sure rocket and drax would die all the trailers set up rocket bautistas contract was up and he’s said he’s done with marvel i also expected quill would die nebula was pretty much the only one i thought was safe but by the end they had done so much character growth for her that i wouldn’t have been surprised kraglin i wasn’t sure about he’s james gunn’s brother but then again he’s james gunn’s brother,2023-05-05
yeah i kept thinking  this is how he dies,2023-05-06
the whole plot was saving rocket so i feel that he was the only one who was safe as them failing to acomplish their initial mission would frustrate the viewers,2023-05-08
well technically i think he did die,2023-05-06
i was almost sure drax was going to die cause of some leaks am really happy the leaks i saw werent legit,2023-05-10
during his moment with lylla i legit thought they would go what way and the rest of the movie would be about guardians revenge,2023-05-15
yeah i totally thought he was going to die about midway through and the movie turn into a revenge flick,2023-05-07
"yeah i like how they handled it too he was about to join lyla teef and floor but they knew he had a higher calling and more people who depended on rocket to live

it puts him in such a different light now before he was just the comic relief but now he literally has a higher calling to save species who need protecting",2023-05-20
what really got me during that scene was floor frantically repeating just full on panic mode ,2023-05-06
man that freaked me out real horror movie vibes it was devastating,2023-05-05
im still heartbroken those babies died ,2023-05-06
floor  me up… i can’t handle animal cruelty i wish i could unsee this is one of the most heartbreaking movies,2023-05-06
no love for lylla i see,2023-05-05
i spent most of the movie thinking that was anne hathaways voice and its hawkeyes wife,2023-05-06
man microsoft should’ve totally revived a special edition of the zune on this movie,2023-05-06
same i was confident rocket wasnt going to die it seemed like a clear mislead drax however was my favorite for likely to die since hes expressed hes done and i believe him,2023-05-05
"i think some of the more interesting points were not focused on enough in lieu of action scenes i get this franchise has always been more about humor but would have been nice to get some more serious moments besides just the backstory for rocket so many people dying warlocks moms death gamora and the void it left the whole team quill and nebula etc

thought it was very funny that they were all dancing at the end rejoicing when so many casualties happened moments before

i think mcu doesnt give enough weight to female characters conclusion arcs like gamora and black widow when they died",2023-05-24
love  thunders biggest crime is not letting gorr do more butchering,2023-05-07
i was thinking gamora would save him as a call back but they didnt go that way,2023-05-05
that poor dad thought the worst part of his day would be letting some aliens steal his car ,2023-05-08

" there were a handful of times where at any given moment i felt a core member was in trouble and nope they all made it out okay 

i found with all the fake out deaths  had they gone through with it or would have really made an objectively worse movie to the point i was more relieved they didnt make that choice than i was the character was alive 

like imagine if groot had died at the start of the movie by adam decapitating him and that was just it for groot  or drax actually got killed by nathan fillions little gun after  charging down thanos and stabbing the tentacle thing from inside its stomach  

dont get me started on what a terrible  story choice or would have been to  rocket on the operating table after the whole first two acts were about saving him  intercut with his orgin story  and we never see him actually confront his literal maker after hes grown over the last decade   or if quill died floating in space because he went back for his zune without even speaking to anyone after the whole movie hinted at going home to find his grandfather",2023-05-06
but they all came back so its hard to consider them dead,2023-05-06
yeah but they come back,2023-05-05
him responding to rockets screams by starting to scream himself and then go alright you win the screaming crying contest was some cold ,2023-05-05
"also some badass lines

there is no  thats why i stepped in",2023-05-05
"james gunn has a knack for making his villains utterly detestable and has you rooting for the heroes

its a lost art these days",2023-05-05
might be the best mcu villain because he is portrayed as completely evil…,2023-05-06
"all the guardians even thor to an extent came from  dads with  complexes but none of them were as repulsive as this dude

ego seemed chill at first and thanos is kind of likeable in his own badass way but this dude was just loathsome it was great",2023-05-06
"yes 

i really liked that we had an actual movie villain not some tortured relatable tragic sympathetic villain that weve had a lot of in marvel",2023-05-09
"not really i loved killmonger but he was one of the most relatable villains because he was actually right

but a good hateable villain is always fun to see as well",2023-05-07
he did very good with what he was given i can’t put him in the top tier of marvel villains because he just wasn’t developed enough but that’s what happens when you’ve got like 8 characters you’re trying to move along their journey,2023-05-21
"james gunn was so impressed with chukwudi iwuji acting in peacemaker that after a few weeks of filming that gunn knew he wanted him for high evolutionary and arranged for him to be one of the front runners for the role 

iwuji was freaking awesome in this film hope he gets even better roles next i was rewatching john wick 2 and was surprised to see him pop up for a very small role in that",2023-05-05
when i heard about iwuji in gotg i was likeoh hollywood cronyism at it again  butwow iwuji totally nailed this role for me it was even better than his role in peacemaker and same with gunns wife too even though her role here was small it was completely believable and there are probably more in gunns stable that crossed from peacemaker to gotg those were the only two i recognized,2023-05-06
oh   thats where i remember him from,2023-05-08
it is equality to have a black guy play a  ,2023-05-07
  that was him  i was thinking the entire movie where have i seen this dude,2023-05-08
i didnt even put that together until now he was chilling in that too,2023-05-20
"  chukwudi iwuji

he better come back for f4",2023-05-24
agreed  and separating it as it’s own trilogy it’s probably one of the best movie trilogies ever,2023-05-06
yeah idk how it happened but the guardians have consistently been my favorite mcu films the second one is probably my favorite one due to all the great character moments,2023-05-08
endgame wasnt really a good film it just had s good ending,2023-05-06
no way home iswas the reigning champ,2023-05-25
disagree strongly i felt doctor strange 2 is the best so far,2023-05-24
the way gunn writes narcissists in that no matter how outlandish their plan is or how over the top they look they still feel real and grounded in their abuse is chilling,2023-05-08
confirmed atheist,2023-05-06
yup that line was dope  and the fact that made his crew turn on him was pretty cool i thought too,2023-05-06
it really defined his megalomania,2023-05-06
holy  i spotted melasd in the wild,2023-05-06
 since this is technically the “multiverse saga” having the main kang variant moving forward being a variant of the high evolutionary  after already knowing how he thinks and what he’s capable of  would be quite threatening indeed,2023-05-05
he’s already a black villain in a purple suit with telekinesis and energy powers nobody’s going to notice,2023-05-05
retconning him as a variant could be quite interesting true,2023-05-05
this is a fascinating idea though im sure they wont do it there could be different routes to a kang it doesnt have to be through that one guy who after all is just a smart human,2023-05-05
nah if they dont cast titus burgess then whats the point of even doing it,2023-05-05
yeah that definitely could work,2023-05-05
kang actor wasnt the problem at all it was thr writing,2023-05-05
i literally thought it was kang until this thread,2023-05-10
i think james gunn has father issues given all 3 films,2023-05-26
"they should just have james gunn do all future marvel instalments now

im not saying i disagree but this is how you get directors and creators being burned out leading to a drop in quality which doesnt solve the problem",2023-05-06
you’re allowed one free fbomb perpg13 movie and it’s not the taboo it used to be kids hear it all the live long day on tiktok and streaming now “what the ” is basically the new “oh my ”,2023-05-05
"you can tell when someone has the chops 

they dont simply recite a line they let go and throw their whole body into the role he was deep in the character and every part of him reflected that",2023-05-06
nebula struggling to get into the car,2023-05-05
it might be tempting to call him a kang yes but at the same time theres definitely enough evidence that he isnt one at the same time like what reasons would a kang have to experiment on animals and populate an utopia with them,2023-05-08
this movie is an order of magnitude better than wakanda forever,2023-05-05
i dont think so i just saw it and i dont remember hearing that,2023-05-08
agree except suicide squad doesn’t belong on the list,2023-05-08
and i mean  they arent dead   he can still see them   as far as we know the guardians base is still on knowwhere so he will still see drax and nebula all the time  quill is not in hiding or anything he can easily pop in for a visit and im sure mantis and her teeth squid babies arent gonna cut all communication,2023-05-05
he wasn’t ever away from his friends he was in a comma for like 2 days he went out and came back with them all,2023-05-06
only ones that left were mantis and peter really knowehere i imagine will always be the hq where drax and nebula are other than that he still has everyone else on this team groot etc and some new ones,2023-05-10
as long as hes always with groot ill be happy thats a team they cant split up,2023-05-07
from a collection of broken people in gotg 1 to healed and whole characters what a trilogy,2023-05-05
yea it would have been veryyyy cheesy if they ended up back together again,2023-05-05
100 percent  that’s why i loved this trilogy  nothin is forced and everything feels logical  it would’ve  to force quill and gamora together and typical movie ending but not real life ending,2023-05-06
that was a really good scene he needed that  he thought hed figured out life when he fell in love but the truth was he still had a lot of figuring out left,2023-05-07
everyone’s story ended how they wanted and if gamora’s ended with quill then was was she really in control of her story peter going back to earth was a better ending given what’s happened to him,2023-05-08
and i love the fact he doesnt challenge her on that he realizes that shes right and moves forward in stride its nice to see the respect for his growth from 2 where he isnt just a man baby but is able to accept that kind of critique and move forward learning from it,2023-05-18
i thought zoe saldanas acting was great in that scene,2023-05-29
this story meaning the third movie,2023-05-10
peter at the end of 2 realized he had a family in the ravagers as well right due to peters emotional state i believe he couldnt really see it and said some hurtful things,2023-05-06
yea was a nice touch,2023-05-05
yeah one of the ravager pulling her hair is definitely a brother move,2023-05-10
well one peters girlfriend was killed,2023-05-06
and both of them are orphans too,2023-05-11
"i liked that too and the touch of her being alone in the ship with rocket makes it clear she actively chose to help in all those situations  no pressure of someone talking up a dead version of you in your ear  strictly based on what she learned on her own 

plus the end credit group scene she’s the only one not in costume as she isn’t a guardian ",2023-05-05
everyone but black widow…still salty about her and gamora permadying,2023-05-11
isn’t that the point tho  peter didn’t see their interactions either and assumed from his experience with a different version of her it wasn’t “real” and thought their relationship was more important not realizing it isn’t even the same person  we and peter are making an assumption based off feelings of a past and gone gamora  she found her family in the ravegers and that’s who this current one wants to be with,2023-05-07
the writers did it so that gunn would have a gamora to use in vol3 if he wanted to,2023-05-09
he did have it in infinity war probably a continuity error tho,2023-05-06
oh thanks for clearing that up,2023-05-05
"i enjoyed it i really thought they were going to let him die end of the guardians era

he never used his helmet or jet pack in any other scene in this movie so i didnt presume he had them",2023-05-07
i chuckled  that action it might seem like a throwaway gag as debicki is very tall but i agree it also feeds into the character of the he that  complex he has makes his ego so fragile enough to want to up himself over his subordindates,2023-05-05
 bless elizabeth debecki we need more tall women,2023-05-05
what happened to the sovereign at the end anyway are they left without any leaders,2023-05-05
" debecki herself is tall at 62  190cm

i also noticed that she was also wearing very tall heels had to have added 4 inches to her height",2023-05-05
she also had bigass heels on in that scene so was probably standing at 66 or something would tower nearly everyone else normally so him having that box showed so much of how he views his creations,2023-05-05
its like those rdj facetoface shots with pepper strange etc where hes obviously standing on something,2023-05-06
im 6ft and would love aeysha to be standing over me  let her put some heels on,2023-05-08
"most movies work around the height of actorsactresses so i actually liked how in tenet that christopher nolan just let her be tall as  

kept putting her in heels and then that chase scene in the suv",2023-05-12
why did they make her look unhinged do ya think,2023-05-06
190cm is 6‘3‘‘,2023-05-06
its okay though he ordered his hot sauce an hour ago,2023-05-06
the tenet blu ray has a behind the scene pic of kenneth branagh threatening debicki and its hilarious because of the huge difference in height the film lessens it with the camera angles but without that its so stark,2023-05-15
yeah i confused the characters  thanks for the correction makes sense since shes 6 3  either way i was dying,2023-05-06
it was when he entered his main corridor in the first act i believe the scene when he found out that adam warlock couldnt catch rocket,2023-05-05
he kind of examines her eye and then touches her face and mouth as hes talking to her as a sort of creepy powerdominance move,2023-05-21
i thought it was a gag looks like ill have to go see it again to make sure oh well,2023-05-07
yes to this i need an animal crueltyfree cut,2023-05-08
which part did it for you in logan,2023-07-30
nooooooo ,2023-05-17
animals aren’t bred in slaughterhouses…,2023-06-12
this is exactly how i feel like the movie was well made and all but it went way way too far for me im very sensitive to extremely dark depressing disturbing  and this movie really piled it on it was a good movie but i dont think i liked it i think some of that stuff is going to be lingering in my mind for a while triggered is the perfect word for it,2023-05-10
dont watch bambi then  some kids movies are really sad,2023-08-07
"i saw it with a pal thats pretty quick most of the time  after the first post credits scene i said so it wasnt a trap after all  it was a face off

he looked at me and shrugged with his face  what

the line it gets repeated its not a trap its a face off  it was a face off

he furrowed his brow at me still not getting it  

they took his  face off kyle

ooooooooooooh",2023-05-05
i mean he had a playlist of 2000s music so he might’ve known the movie,2023-05-07
he was on earth for endgame someone definitely loaded him up on nic cage movies before he left,2023-05-05
because it wasnt a reference quill left earth over a decade before faceoff was a thing hes being literal about it being a face off like in 80s movies the fact that they literally peel the hes mask off is just a perk,2023-05-05
"im sad this joke got lost in the italian version adaptations in the italian are usually great but i guess this one was too difficult to port

in italian the recurring quote by star lord is something along the line of its not a trap its a confrontation",2023-05-06
they dont make any of it a reference to the movie though its easy to think of it but at no point does peter refer to the film he just refers to a faceoff as a generic concept,2023-05-06
was james gunn involved with faceoff,2023-05-09
how could you know this,2023-05-05
also that faceoff in 2013,2023-07-14
yeah there was a lot more moments to breathe like even the moment where quill was trying to have a private conversation with gamora even though had a joke scene shortly after still had longer to breathe than when we saw in gotg 2 when all of the other loyal ravagers were killed off and then we got the taserface joke,2023-05-05
noticed that too was actually anxious a few times because i thought a great scene was about to get the “mantis look out” treatment from vol 2 pleasantly surprised i don’t recall it happening in this one,2023-05-05
gunn might need some help from a big reputable law firm maybe hhm,2023-07-13
its way better that they didnt show dont tell is a mark of a great movie,2023-05-05
didnt drax yell something like his face came off,2023-05-06
now that would have been a 1010 post credits scene over eating cereal,2023-05-11
don’t go chasing face waterfalls,2023-05-06
right after murdering an entire hallway of people ,2023-05-13
"i feel like this quote should be comedically inserted somewhere like

“i won’t  you…but i don’t have to save you from that fatal stab wound i just inflicted you with”",2023-05-05
im batman i mean rocket racoon,2023-05-06
meanwhile in another universe i wont  you but i will turn you into a  vegetable  vengeance,2023-05-20
yeah def felt like the trope of “i’ll  all the henchmen but i can’t stoop to the bad guys level and  him so i’ll let him live” loved the movie but that’s one thing i don’t think was executed perfectly,2023-05-05
"it felt especially weird to me because the goons they  in the hallway were all or many were at least twisted creations of the high evolutionary just like rocket is like they had no say over their creation either they were obstacles and i could’ve certainly overlooked it if it weren’t for the fact that rocket ‘spared’ the head honcho

loved the movie to bits every step of the way don’t get me wrong but yeah that stood out in my mind for sure",2023-05-05
those people were attacking them it’s not like they were shooting people in the head that were no longer a threat,2023-05-05
"slight difference between killing someone who is actively trying to  you and executing someone you have managed to take down and is now defenseless

still weird they just left him",2023-05-05
its a pretty common problem in action movies tbh goons and the like are ok to  but the main villain whos causing the most harm nah they cant stoop to their level,2023-05-05
yes but they were all bad,2023-05-05
"this bothered me too but the more i think about it i like it he was killing goons to get through the his objective of saving the kids and animals but having found a family let him let go of the rage that would have driven him to revenge 

the high evolutionary was a bad guy but he was hardly a threat he wasn’t trying to conquer anything he was just an awful person with his own little fiefdom that he  with as he wanted once rocket got the kids out he was done with him

he wasn’t saying “i’m not like you” like this trope often does he was saying “i don’t need this anymore”",2023-05-05
drax was a complete  to the civilized animal people for no reason too lol probably killed the guy who’s motorcycle he stole,2023-05-05
i think the difference is that high evo was no longer a threat whereas most of all the henchmen were actively fighting them and they did spare some henchmen that they convinced not to fight,2023-05-07
he was defeated and no longer a threat to them im pretty sure we can classify every other  as hostile combatants,2023-05-09
and gamora stabbed evo in the gut just seconds before pretty sure he was finished by that,2023-05-11
they actually were stunning a lot of the humans now the  spawns were murdered,2023-05-18
 that would have been great it could have played out in a variety of ways,2023-05-07
ooooh yeah and at first he is all you fools  you made his smarter and then rocket reverses the polarity so he devolves,2023-05-09
the movie already basically had tokka and rahzar why not super shredder,2023-05-15
hey we didn’t see him die he could have gone in the machine to survive,2023-05-18
if he did that and then dropped that line again with a shrug or something it would have been both in character and in tone for the movie and a satisfying end,2023-05-06
the dude blew up a planet mirroring earth with billions of sentient life forms i dont think a bit of defeat and humiliation is enough of a punishment and certainly isnt going to put an end to his schemes,2023-05-09
rocket did something to bypass his tech which is why he was able to get a cheap shot in from there the rest of the team just caught him off guard i believe rocket may have even found a way to disable his suit completely i dont quite remember,2023-05-05
"we really didn’t need another five minute action sequence there it would’ve ruined the thirdact pacing and damaged the emotional weight of rocket’s victory

plus the guardians are actually really powerful when they work together like they did against the he and the he was never that strong he mainly just had his gravity powers as soon as he got caught off guard he’s just a dude he’s way way weaker than thanos or kang",2023-05-06
when criminals fight me its exhausting because im so good so they often have to nap afterwards,2023-05-05
i feel the sentiment but not doing it was a crucial part of rockets growth,2023-05-05
it was drax actually,2023-09-12
nah wouldve taken away from the actual moment its better used for comedy,2023-05-11
agreed brilliant in bandersnatch as well,2023-05-05
my first real exposure to him was the movie detroit and he was pretty fantastic in it and since he was fantastic in it i have an instinctual revulsion to him that im slowly rehabbing,2023-05-05
he was great in dopesick,2023-05-05
"i kept thinking about how james gunn said he refuses to work with any actors who arent cool and calm on the set and how that kid is probably super chill 

like gunn just wont take any ego drama on his sets",2023-05-10
maybe but as a kid he was already a gem son of rambow and that sketch show school of comedy he was brilliant he was even quite good in that narnia movies,2023-05-06
dude has earned a permanent spot on my list of guys i love to see in a movie,2023-05-08
he never was a bad actor a lot of people only know him from that adam sandler comedy but poulter has a long acting career since he was a kid that doesnt just happen,2023-05-17
hes grown in to his eyebrows thats for sure,2023-05-14
he was always good anyone who could convincingly do the eustace scrubb redemption arc at that age had potential,2023-08-03
i completely agree and i think some people are getting angry thinking gunn  warlocks character when in actuality he did the right thing nerfing him and portraying him as a inexperienced and immature cosmic being he literally could of just carried the whole movie had he been at full power,2023-05-07
hes just a baby  im sure in future he will realize his full potential,2023-05-05
pretty much all of his lines had me laughing poulter’s line delivery was superb huge fan of him as an actor,2023-05-07
the opening made me very excited for gunns superman film  he clearly knows how to handle a  tier character which isnt something most people can do  he nailed that fight  adam was flying around putting the hurt on everyone and not a single second felt wrong or skewed in the guardians favor,2023-05-08
i was gonna say he felt shoehorned but they dealt with it as they could since the cocoon was set up in vol 2 but having him be released early with more room to grow was smart he could have been a major character for the infinity gauntlet adaptation but i hope to see more of him through these next few phases his voice felt like adam,2023-08-12
haha yes that line was my favorite of the whole thing either that or rockets delivery of im not a raccoon as hes leaving purgatory after his and lylas heartfelt conversation both were so perfectly placed,2023-05-06
probably the only moment in the entire movie that got a genuine hearty laugh out of me it was so natural and bizarre at the same time to hear that given the context,2023-05-06
literally,2023-05-05
he would’ve been the lead in the silver chair but they stopped making narnia movies,2023-05-07
"and when she said yes he  died like he was cool dying if that meant being with them again



also “my sweet my raccoon you still haven’t realized this was your story all along” was just gunn speaking to bradley cooper ",2023-05-05
and the way she replied she just said yes but the line delivery was so good there was an of course you can come where else would you go in that one  syllable  great job from hawkeyes wife on that one,2023-05-05
the thought that he maybe thought they wouldnt welcome him because he was guilty over their deaths is crushing,2023-05-05
yea man having lost a pet a few weeks ago this movie being feel heavy for rocket definitely made the feels come back,2023-05-05
i sob,2023-05-05
i was holding back the tears and then the unexpected “i’m not a raccoon” tricked me into laughing and opened the food gates masterful emotional manipulation,2023-05-07
lylla walking out to rocket and hearing her footsteps clanking made me think of a ticking clock,2023-05-06
so many movies make scene like this but in them characters  realize they have something to live for and they go back but rocket decided he wants to go his old friends and because of this i thought its the end for him,2023-05-15
you mean the ones where kraglin was refusing to call cosmo a good dog,2023-05-05
so many people who saw the early screenings were saying it wasnt that bad i was like what sure it wasnt overly graphic but it still definitely made me a bit uncomfortable and sad,2023-05-05
huge animal rights movie also i noticed a theme of alcoholism obviously peter in the beginning but  the high evolutionary stumbling to the cages and abusing the animals,2023-05-06
guardians 3 sponsored by the people for the ethical treatment of animals,2023-05-05
wait til you find out what us companies and the us government do with basically zero reason behind it other than to claim they tested productsin tests that can be done in other ways at lower cost,2023-05-07
as per the ny times “guardians of the galaxy vol 3” is a “dour visually offputting twoandahalfhour aspca nightmare of a film”,2023-05-05
that was the most haunting scene since the snap in infinity war except those three arent coming back,2023-05-05
"im wondering if james gunn is a we3 fan

edit in the wiki it says when asked during an impromptu facebook qa in march 2015 on what other comic book movie he would like to make james gunn expressed interest in we3

",2023-05-05
that’s a strange thing to say if you never saw the scene you honestly couldn’t imagine people getting emotionally invested over those animals i question your sanity more so if you can’t hypothetically think that way when it comes to the power of movies,2023-05-05
i think they were making a deeper philosophical pointlike it doesnt matter what things in your life physically made you the way that you are whether evolution family your upbringing whatever thats not what defines you  you can still have a higher sense of purpose and meaning whether thats fate or  or truth or whatever you want to call it,2023-05-08
"i mean we know that in the mcu there is an afterlife its reasonable to believe those are the souls of his friends and to look at it another way for all of rockets suffering hes hes saved the entire galaxy 4 times seems like pretty good work for a  no

between that and the brief bit of valhalla im curious if theyll lean further into it",2023-05-07
lol it reminded me of that scene too,2023-05-05
its definitely a tearjerker trope i just recently saw it done in this anime ranking of kings that said it never fails to make me cry lol,2023-05-15
that and neo from matrix 2 were in my mind,2023-05-09
but before they got their prosthetics they were “just” animals they wouldn’t be able to talk to each other or give themselves names or imagine the sky they’re their “real” selves in the afterlife,2023-05-06
part of me thinks that gunn was binging made in abyss while writing this script,2023-05-05
green goblin was so good in nwh it was a good idea to bring willem dafoe back he was honestly terrifying during parts of that movie,2023-05-05
not necessarily a line but the moment when he gets punched in the face and just cackles in response burned in my mind,2023-05-06
"wenwu namor and evolutionary were great tbh 

kro was forgettable though arguably ikaris was the real villain 

goblin was great too 

not sure how i feel about dreykov

kang needs more time to show off imo and a better script",2023-05-07
“strong enough to have it all too weak to take it”,2023-05-11
the line goblin has about a sabbatical is so  good lol,2023-05-07
i am not sure about that there are a lot of weak one and the main guy seems to be weaker than most,2023-05-14
wenwu is great because his villainy is lowkey and then youre reminded hes a bad dude because he loses his  in that restaurant and then blames his kids,2023-05-05
"shangchis ending was ruined for me because of that you had a perfectly good villain and a great storyline about a son fighting his father and prevailing with peaceful nonviolence you set up a great final battle between son and father 

and then everything gets wrecked by adding in a dumb cgi dragon monster that kills the father like bruh made shang chi getting the rings feel a lot less powerful if he had converted all 10 rings on his own rather than been given them because his dad died it would have been thematically so much better 

honestly  that dragon made an otherwise fantastic movie kinda mediocre at the end",2023-05-07
having tony leung in your movie is honestly just a cheat code its just not gonna be fair of course hes gonna make a meal out of an mcu villain,2023-07-11
it had serious i am the one who knocks energy to it – another line people misinterpret as coming from a place of strength,2023-05-08
i just finished watching the movie for the first time so i know i’m very late but yeah this line made me roll my eyes and say “aaalright” very cringey and insecure line imo so i’m very surprised by all the people in this thread who are saying how badass of a moment it was,2023-08-06
"agreed  it was a good nod to the fact that they presumably spent a lot of time together considering they were the only two guardians for like five years between infinity war and endgame

by contrast we didn’t get enough recognition of rocket and groot’s relationship in my opinion",2023-05-05
nebula truly had one of the best character developments throught the entire mcu i already thought it was so cute how she played that fingerfootball game with tony while they were lost in space she even looked somewhat sad at his funeral which was so unlike her and she just kept growing from there on,2023-05-05
not even cries broke down i bet thats the most feeling she has felt since thanos adopted her,2023-05-05
i think people don’t realise that gamora and rocket were the only 2 guardians that didn’t get dusted off so yea for 5 years they must have really bonded,2023-05-05
her reaction hit me like a ton of bricks i cried so much this film it was like a  emotional rollercoaster being yoyod between cool music funny action scenes and then hey animal torture,2023-05-06
i know rocket spent more time with groot but the way he rebuilt nebula has to hit especially hard for her,2023-05-06
yup that was it for me i love nebula,2023-05-06
"and seeing someone whos usually so cold react like that got to me

like drax saying goodbye to mantis",2023-05-07
this right herethis got me bad,2023-05-05
ive really been hoping to see more of their friendship and even if their five years during the blip wasnt explicitly acknowledged this and a few other subtle moments between them made me very happy,2023-05-06
there arent enough words to adequately convey how much i love nebulas journey over the many films shes been in shes honestly become one of my top 5 favorite mcu characters,2023-05-10
that part was beautiful,2023-05-08
yeah it was good and overall nebula is so much better now,2023-05-15
i saw a matinee and my theater had about 20 people in it but i kind of wish it was full to hear the reaction after that line,2023-05-06
rocket raccoon is his name in the comics so seeing him finally title drop was awesome to see since before no one in the other movies call him anything other than rocket,2023-05-28
i cried at literally every flashback scene somehow i don’t cry very often,2023-05-05
bradley cooper really tapped into something for that scream during the escape it’s honestly one of the most harrowing i’ve heard in any movie anger sorrow despair conveyed realistically,2023-05-05
happy cake day yondu,2023-05-05
i don’t think i’ve cried so much since john wick’s dog scene tbh  normally i don’t cry but yeesh those flashbacks were so sad,2023-05-05
those were the hardest for me i feel so very vulnerable  i hated them and loved them at the same time,2023-05-05
absolutely i wasnt ready for a talking raccoon otter walrus and rabbit to destroy me emotionally this afternoon those were dark scenes at times,2023-05-07
man the high evolutionary might the the villain i had the most visceral reaction to as just the most evil piece of  in the mcu,2023-05-05
man the high evolutionary might the the villain i had the most visceral reaction to as just the most evil piece of  in the mcu,2023-05-05
lets give a little credit to bradley cooper too the actor that played rocket im going to guess that the production did some motion capture with his face and if not then ill guess the animators at least studied his performance,2023-05-06
and the fur industry and the dairy egg and meat industries,2023-05-05
he always “knew” but he was not accepting of his past that’s why calling himself rocket racoon is such a big moment,2023-05-05
next second,2023-05-05
this killed me i thought they would be reunited ,2023-05-07
the same actual scene,2023-05-07
man i thought the movie would be them going to rockets home and being reunited with his old friends ,2023-05-15
it was cruel so many people speculated what rocket will save her and they live together and this is how it will end his story,2023-05-15
to me the embrace in the trailer made it seem like they were reconnecting after years of them doing their own thing maybe after escaping the experiments instead we got rockets very disturbing past,2023-06-12
actually think that was the same scene she dies right after they embrace no,2023-05-13
you forgot about rocket flatlining too they showed the shot of quills spittycry in the trailer too,2023-05-06
it was smart they went on and on about how sad this one was which is definitely not untrue but made everyone speculate who would die,2023-05-06
this little bit from that interview is hilarious their laughter is contagious,2023-05-09
oh  here i was thinking that he had learned to speak another language that we could understand i may have thought that because the entire movie i was wondering if groots species could even learn other speech i mean clearly he understands others so it stands to reason he could learn english or universal or whatever they call the common language in the mcu,2023-05-15
"he should have said i dont have friends i have family


s",2023-05-06
yeah it was a bit jarring to me because i heard vin diesels voice much more in it than i normally do in i am groot,2023-05-09
oh yeah rip ,2023-05-05
life’s a  and then you die ,2023-05-06
thoughts and prayers,2023-05-13
this movie was fuccckin gory and i loved all of it i can see james gunn getting some heat from parents deeming it too gross but hey the dark knight had harvey dent we can have a similar horrifying skinless face effect and still rate it pg13 this will be future generations temple of doom heart scene ,2023-05-05
"it was pretty cool how they didn’t even have a fight against him they instantly hit him with the combo and wiped him out

therefore the final fight in the gotg trilogy was that oneshot hallway scene which feels suitable really",2023-05-05
they were also all so angry and horrified about what he did to rocket so i was so happy that they all got to let out that frustration by beating him senseless,2023-05-05
the rest of the crew beating the  out of him more than rocket did made me a little emotional  i never throught reading berserk to get my mind off despair was a thing,2023-05-10
"they all saw and were horrified by what was done to rocket so glad they all took it out on the villain

also satisfying seeing how much damage rocket did to his face",2023-05-12
i am so glad they showed that rocket  mangled his ,2023-05-20
it was awesome combo,2023-05-15
theres even a named trope for it kick the dog,2023-05-05
theon greyjoy being a  has lead to over a 1000 people individually dying in that franchise,2023-05-05
yup and condescending to boot he just bullied baby rocket he was the perfect hateable,2023-05-05
john wick been out for vengeance since then and the audience is rooting for him to  everyone,2023-05-05
but even if you dont consider that bro just exploded a planet because people in it had flaws like jesus,2023-05-10
do you remember ‘drag me to ’,2023-05-05
i didnt get what was done to floor teef lyla and rocket had upgrades floor had no real legs replaced by spider legs and a metal muzzle  was that improving,2023-05-08
"veiled marvel reference to the likes of mengele and co 

the unethical scientist is a worthy marvel trope these guys were first gen jewish migrants the bogeyman of their real life  recent history presented as comic villains as the stories explore morality",2023-05-07
to be fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff,2023-05-06
not to mention he planned on killing kids next,2023-05-06
yep it’s not subtle but  it’s effective,2023-05-07
,2023-05-28
or when patrick bateman kicked the dog in american psycho,2023-05-05
" john wick went on a  spree when they killed his dog and everyone in the audience was on his side

its not like he was fighting against saints he was going up against the russian mob so people would be on his side even if they just  him up and took his car without touching his dog",2023-07-16
"first villain i did not want to keep alive for another movie  he was vile and he needed to die at the end 

for floor teefs and lyla",2023-05-05
 far more of a villain than kang imo,2023-05-05
he was probably the most evil character in the mcu thus far but then again i have been skipping content since mom,2023-05-05
as much as the output by marvel hasnt been the greatest as of late weve still has some solid villains kang comes to mind straight away,2023-05-08
"but i was missing a villain that you hate just because he is evil 

black widow had one",2023-05-05
my avoidance of trailers pays off again they still managed to get me with groots extra arms shooting scene,2023-05-05
usually i hate that but somehow it still managed to make me laugh,2023-05-05
it really is a better experience not watching them i know its hard to stay away but so worth it imo,2023-05-05
pro tip dont watch the trailers,2023-05-05
glad i just watched the first trailer once or twice drax line we  one loser that nobody loves still got me hard in the theatre,2023-05-05
i wish i didnt watch the one with the suits and colored buttons it was funnier in theaters than when i first watched it in the clip presumably because i was in the movies flow so i wish it was the first time i saw it,2023-05-05
unfortunately there were several funny jokes that got spoiled by the trailers,2023-05-05
they showed that to us in the theatre before the movie like why we are already here to see the movie we don’t need anymore teasers to convince us,2023-05-05
i think the worst part of that is including the scene in the trailers made it so it was clear he wasnt dying when nathan fillion shot him   i remember almost immediately that this scene in the trailer hadnt happened yet,2023-05-05
this is exactly why i don’t watch trailers more than once,2023-05-06
studios have been blowing all their best jokes in the trailers and we are being robbed of legendary moments,2023-05-05
almost the whole movie was spoiled in the trailers  disappointingbut i guess its my own fault,2023-05-05
ive seen that clip so many times that i assumed it was a throw back to a previous movie,2023-05-05
bro just don’t watch trailers lol it’s really simple,2023-05-06
they probably made that scene specifically for the trailer it’s just a ten second gag that had no consequences to the overall plot,2023-05-06
i turned it to my advantage when that scene started it was my cue to take a  break without missing anything,2023-05-07
"don’t watch trailers 

when i see a movie coming out that want to see i avoid the trailers they offer me nothing",2023-05-07
good thing i never watch trailers,2023-05-08
for the most part the trailers misrepresented a lot and i really appreciated that,2023-05-10
i was really expecting the climax for this film to be centered around them saving counterearth it was wild to see it just get destroyed in the end,2023-05-05
that lovely family who helped them this film was dark ,2023-05-05
the poor family that helped them too,2023-05-05
rip counter earth,2023-05-05
i know  like  that is really depressing,2023-05-07
brutal clothes line to some random civilian leaving them lying possibly already dead on the road on a planet thats about to explode,2023-05-05
same won’t happen but same,2023-05-07
isnt kang one of the marvel villains,2023-05-09
so did majors lets not be silly here,2023-05-08
he got his role in this because of his performance in peacemaker,2023-05-09
majors is an insanely good actor too bad he  that up,2023-05-15
quantumania was disappointing you didnt miss out on anything,2023-05-08
you realize that the one who remains wasnt the kang from antman right,2023-05-24
mayng the conqueror,2023-05-15
he can rage against the avengers about how 1 x 1 should equal 2,2023-05-11
honestly i hadnt really been following the mcu all that much in recent years so i just thought the high evolutionary was just another variant of kang it felt like their goals from what i know just from loki seemed sort of aligned,2023-05-28
floor was straight up nightmare fuel for me visually and i felt bad because  was so kind,2023-05-05
i mean the one happy thing about the mcu is they have confirmed they do have an afterlife and if that scene was rocket seeing his friends in that afterlife before he came back to life at least theyre happier there than in the high evolutionary cage,2023-05-05
"a  otter bunny walrus with wheels and a racoon hit harder than anything i could have anticipated 

and when she tells rocket the it’s been his story from the start gut punch 

and then she tells me they’re waiting for him but not yet ",2023-05-05
i have a bunny and i’m still torn up over floor every time i think about her i want to cry poor baby was probably in so much pain,2023-05-05
i was not expecting them all to get shot to death,2023-05-05
i have four rabbits every scene with floor was horror for me ,2023-05-05
i genuinely thought at least one of them would escape and reunite with rocket in the future or something or at least they’d die offscreen and they’d tease the possibility of one of them having survived the finality of showing every single one of his friends dead was so grim i was shocked in a good way,2023-05-05
"i honestly didn’t think they were gonna die for some reason it felt like rocket reunited with her in the trailer so when it actually happened i was like “don’t cry at a marvel premiere user”

i cried at a marvel premiere",2023-05-06
rocket teeth floor go now will be etched into my soul for the rest of my life,2023-05-08
oh i knew they were not going to hold back on the villainy in this one as soon as i saw that friendship start i told myself they were all going to die so i better prepare for it and i’m glad i did i shed enough tears in this movie,2023-05-07
they got to fly away and see the sky,2023-05-07
imagine rocket and lylla having a  in bootskitty softpaws dynamic lol,2023-05-05
that was probably the most traumatic mcu scene for me,2023-05-08
teefs,2023-05-05
nah teefs got everyone killed he didnt believe rocket and still though they were going to the new world,2023-05-05
retcon baby worth it though so ill allow it,2023-05-05
lylla isnt just a name for 1 individual,2023-05-06
he could have befriended someone named lylla and went through a whole character arc of accepting loss,2023-05-08
my son said “that was sadder than the lion king” he was so excited to see baby rocket before we went to the theater after we were all just bawling,2023-05-07
rip bun dad here rough,2023-05-17
same with the hallway fight scene too so many directors don’t realize the best way to shoot a team fight scene is to make it easy for the audience to follow where they are in relation to each other and gunn does that wonderfully there,2023-05-05
when i saw nebula putting up their sign i thought what a nice moment i bet that sign is gonna get destroyed soon lol,2023-05-05
yeah it did a good job of showing what the guardians had done for those audience members that maybe hadn’t seen the holiday special,2023-05-05
"the best part of that long shot was that it was paced at rockets pace  he walks slow and so it matched him and took longer than an average human would

it was paced for rocket so we would know it was his film and his story",2023-05-06
it was such a good encapsulation of teamwork in cinematic combat the final fight in the recent dd movie is another strong example,2023-05-05
insert children of men,2023-05-05
opening with the generally placid daytoday of knowhere made that poor asteroid getting its teeth kicked in for the third  time sting a lot more for me that dead  just cannot catch a  break,2023-05-08
reminded me of the game when you are just walking to a destination and just listen to them talk,2023-05-05
it felt like a right way to up the ante from the opening of the last film with all the characters basically demonstrating where they are mentally while groot dances in the middle of the battle really great way to demonstrate that despite being in a good place they all have some mental scars they havent really dealt with,2023-05-05
song is gonna blow up again,2023-05-05
it was such a nice contrast to im a creep a full well done arc,2023-05-05
only dumb people dance,2023-05-05
that made the dam break for me it was my graduation song,2023-05-07
such a perfect song to use in that final scene there is so much passion and emotion in it i highly recommend anyone who hasnt seen pentatonix perform it on the sing off to give it a watch,2023-05-07
not to mention the action sequence with warlock afterwards really set the tone i was aware of gunn’s statement about how this will be the last film with this team together but i wasn’t really sure what that would mean for the fate of each of the guardians seeing them get the  beat out of them by warlock really got me nervous for the ending,2023-05-05
didn’t catch that one did catch the lingering shot on nebula for the “i want to feel special” line though,2023-05-07
oh thats clever,2023-05-06
in a guardians film,2023-05-06
what are the flaws in your opinion,2023-05-05
i see absolutely zero flaws it’s perfect,2023-05-06
true made me tear up and feel so many different things loved it ,2023-05-06
"it really feels like feige and marvel studios let gunn go 100 on this without interference

thats the whole trilogy pretty much and i wish they did it for more directors as well",2023-05-05
"alternate gotg from someone else would have only ever invitied criticism towards what could have been glad gunn stuck the ending what a special trilogy he made 

i do wonder what this film would have looked like if it came out before iw the biggest difference being peter and gamora",2023-05-05
i’m just bummed out because i imagine he’d still be making stuff for marvel if they hadn’t pushed him to dc by caving to right wing   i guess the plus side is that dc has a shot at improving now,2023-05-05
yeah i really wish they would have killed off thor and just kept jane they’ve pushed thor into being so dumb i just don’t care about him anymore,2023-05-05
"after this it’ll only be deadpool 3 for me

then whenever they do the xmen",2023-05-05
"sames 

i remember i few months ago me and my roommates watched michael clayton and sicario and i was like oh yeah im a grown man maybe i should knock it off with the superhero films for a just a little bit",2023-05-05
black panther two has heart but is poorly written,2023-05-07
black panther 2 was a wake it’s special because we came in expecting a sense of loss,2023-05-06
in fairness i did say most projects not all projects,2023-05-06
i thought that was pretty much established in gotg2,2023-05-08
the zagnuts that drax was eating but wouldn’t share with mantis,2023-05-08
wait there was a special in between galaxy vol 2 and 3  no wonder i felt kinda lost and was wondering when did we get a planet ,2023-05-12
something about someone’s son watching as peter mows the lawn and how it’s weird cause that person is 45 years old and doesn’t help i’m assuming the lady who answered the door’s son jason’s stepson,2023-05-05
i mean everyone on earth knows about thanos because of the snap im sure someone getting abducted is pretty easy to believe,2023-05-07
they whole neighborhood saw the abductors,2023-08-12
something about someone’s son watching as peter mows the lawn and how it’s weird cause that person is 45 years old and doesn’t help i’m assuming the lady who answered the door’s son jason’s stepson,2023-05-05
did you watch the gotg holiday special,2023-05-05
the holiday special,2023-05-05
i understood the reference,2023-05-06
heads up never ever watch nope 2022,2023-05-07
gorilla you mean chimpanzee right,2023-05-18
same i just thought of the disfigurement unnecessary scene tbh,2023-05-28
"it also kinda mirrors the high evolutionary‘s „lesson“


peter can‘t force gamora to be something she‘s not that are pretty much his words when they say goodbye nice parallel",2023-05-05
yes i agree in the end they both ended up with a family of their own,2023-05-05
"people were like but that gamora is just like the one we know before she met quill but  that 

quill spend over half a decade adventuring together with the old gamora the new one did not its just impossible to work out",2023-05-05
"yeah and they even pointed out how she recognized the beauty in their relationship but they still went on their own way because she’s different person

like a genuinely good breakup you can recognize the good times but agree that it’s best to keep moving forward",2023-05-07
it is the right ending but so many writers chicken out there are nuances to writing choices that ai cant replicate imo,2023-05-05
im also glad they didnt force quill and nebula either,2023-05-06
"the whole movie was about them all finding their own way theyd been the guardians so long they all just played their portion of the part they all needed to have their own separate next chapter 

also holy  guys i think i finally understand groot",2023-05-06
i agree plus when mj and peter get back together it won’t feel as formulaic since gamora and peter had essentially the same problem,2023-05-05
late to the discussion but for the 4 years since endgame i knew james gunn could only do justice to the characters by flipping the expectation of them reuniting on its head gamoras screed against peter in the middle of the movie was perfect they went all the way with reinforcing gamora is her own person without going too heavy handed by saying something like im not a prize,2023-05-17
don’t get me started,2023-05-05
" forcing them back together would’ve felt like a cop out in a way

i disagree having them fall in love with each other again feels like what the movie was building towards having gamora end up with sly stallone and the ravagers in the end felt like the cop out",2023-05-05
i 100 agree i think she and quill developed to a place where they appreciated each other but i never felt as though she loved quill romantically the way that he felt about her this is definitely the right ending for the both of them,2023-05-05
"and disrespectful to the original love story yes they’re technically the same person but not in so many ways that really count

quills gamora was murdereddied this is a different gamora thats a better more heartbreaking story imo

i just wish original gamoras send off in infinity war hadn’t been quite so rushed",2023-05-06
i didn’t get that at all i feel like that same exact growth arc happened here obviously not as strong as the connection built in the first movie but it really couldn’t ever be the same for multiple reasons i think gamora’s comment at the end was her kind of saying that she gets what “she” and peter and had together,2023-05-05
 they werent even a thing in the 2nd movie either it was more secretive but they werent ready to show it yet,2023-05-05
honestly i felt that in the first movie she actually warmed up to him pretty fast all it really takes it for him to share some music,2023-05-06
"i think the movie likes to play around with the idea that drax is an idiot but actually the smartest in the room about certain things 

when he talks about gamora being dead i don’t think he’s doing it out of anger to comfort quill in a ‘she’s dead to us’ manner i think he’s pointing out that yes their gamora is dead this one is from an alternative universe and quill and the others were kind of unwilling to fully accept that i think it was the movie’s way of warning us that things wouldn’t go back to normal because ultimately these are entirely different people now and we can’t pretend gamora isn’t still really dead",2023-05-05
i get that but still theres a certain romance in the idea of two people being destined for each other like joel and clementine falling in over again after having their memories wiped in eternal sunshine,2023-05-05
not completely but partly just the reasons for them falling in love werent there,2023-05-05
yeah just like twins are twins theyre not the same person,2023-05-08
not a completely different person just gamora before the gotg movies,2023-05-09
she just forgot,2023-05-05
"they did almost all get their looks like its their death scene 

drax with getting hit twice by nathan fillion that looked like it had landed possibly fatal blows 

rocket and his death but not 

peter and his what looked like a space death 

nebula sort of in the beginning until she rebuilt herself 

groot with his head being torn off 

glad they all made it",2023-05-05
i fealt like a heroic death for peter would have actually been happier maybe they’re doing more with the charector but man his ending to me is depressing,2023-05-19
when i saw the golden hand of warlock i first thought it was the green hand or gamora as a callback to that scene from the first movie am i colorblind,2023-05-05
that was one of the main things that irked me too i know in the beginning he was a  and blah blah blah but he didnt have his helmet at all during this movie weird choice,2023-05-05
i hated it like watching an ex be happy with someone else but the ex didn’t leave you she died so you don’t even have the real rejection to fuel you to move on that scene was tough for me liking gamora and quill arc from vol1 and 2,2023-05-19
this 100 i think this movie is the best his character has been i have felt like he’s been this kind of generic lovestruck guy for a while now and he became one of my least favorite mcu characters pratt’s performance in this movie really flipped me around now that he’s moved on i do not mind the idea of continuing on with the character without the other guardians around also really excited at the idea of the new team with rocket leading them,2023-05-05
100 its chris pratt,2023-05-05
i wish they wouldn’t have this was actually worse like bring her back but don’t actually everyone says no one died in this film but to me old gamora really died here in them not bringing her memories back,2023-05-19
imagine learning youre shallow and have  taste all in one reddit thread,2023-05-08
i guarantee you’re uglier than either of them,2023-05-05
small g son,2023-05-06
there is a bit of a difference those little gods are just gods of their respective pantheon they may hold some power of creation but it is just a small fraction of power the higher level abstracts hold and even they are nothing compared to the one above all and yet they rarely do anything,2023-05-05
no i especially like that he says that right when they can see knowhere a city built from the head of a dead celestial right outside their window,2023-05-07
it really was had me rolling my eyes screaming “there is no ” just makes him sound like an angsty teen who recently discovered atheism,2023-08-06
oof  exhibit a why fan input shouldn’t be considered when writing these movies,2023-05-06
that would have literally made me walk out and never watch an mcu movie again,2023-05-06
"who are you

thankfully for the rest of us you aren’t an mcu writer",2023-05-07
 i hope this is a joke,2023-05-07
marvel please hire this man,2023-05-11
yeah in this one she really felt like the glue that held the team together she was horrified when rocket was dying stood up for drax tried to help peter she cares about them all so much and it’s very sweet while also still being funny and getting to be kickass in this one too,2023-05-05
it genuinly feels just off to watch most of the newer marvel movies quantumania and thor 4 are the worst offenders as if the actors dont even want to be there the simpliest things from the way a shot transitions to another as well as where a character needs to stand and look towards is completely messed up because everything needs to be certain way so that the cgi and green screen can be pulled off they look horrendous,2023-05-05
except there were quips and every time nebula or starlord would end the conversation with guys focus we need to save our friend who is actively dying the first time it was a breath of fresh air the 10th time it was more annoying than the actual quips especially when starlord or nebula were the ones to start the joke in the first place you cant have your cake and eat it too,2023-05-07
haha yeah maybe that’s another reason why i liked her so much in this one definitely felt like some bickering me and my older sister get into,2023-05-05
wife they got married a few months back,2023-05-05
wife,2023-05-05
yea i remember way back after guardians 1 there were rumors that feige was considering having gunn run the mcu way down the line its so funny to me how that disney exec got duped into firing gunn and handed one of the best people at doing this to their direct competitor,2023-05-05
is wb can stay the  out of his way,2023-05-10
the bus scene in shangchi was pretty awesome though,2023-05-28
one thing i liked about it is once they were all together they really just kicked everyones ,2023-05-08
yep instantly reminded me of that really underrated game lol,2023-05-08
no way is that really the case i feel like theres been a  before i guess nick furys line at the end of infinity war cut out before the ,2023-05-05
"i especially find it funny because in the start of the movie when the song creep is playing they cut the fbom in that song i was singing along and then clearly heard “very” instead of “” and just immediately thought “ah yes it’s a kids movie”


imagine my surprise when the car scene came",2023-05-05
that had me rolling using it on low stakes annoyance was  perfect,2023-05-08
wasnt there an fbomb in iron man 2 during the congress presentation scene,2023-05-05
it was great but i personally love when movies save that one “” for a really serious scene so it hits that much harder like if peter used it when he was raging at the high evolutionary for hurting his friend that  would have hit so hard,2023-05-08
wasn’t there a  she hulk,2023-05-05
happy cake day,2023-05-09
and now theres gonna be many ,2023-05-05
didnt the punisher have one in daredevil,2023-05-20
when did he say it i cant recall what scene it was in,2023-05-05
i heard there was going to be an fbomb i imagined it was gonna be used at a climatic moment but i’m so glad it was used over something as  as opening a door,2023-05-05
"they tested the waters with she hulk saying “captain america f“ and getting cut off before blatantly saying “” 

it’s weird to me comic book movies want kids sales that makes sense but these kids seeing these movies are at the age their playing games and watching tv and youtube with swears why is it so bad to use  

like imagine if  was free reign when samuel jackson first appeared or in iron man 2 

“please step outside the  donut”",2023-05-05
"i wonder if it was more or an ad lib line by chris pratt but in the edit they loved it so much that they kept it in

i love that its used so casually not at some climactic or otherwise obvious moment",2023-05-05
its funny that iron man did have one very early on its in the deleted scenes,2023-05-05
when nebula found the kids and said “” it would’ve been much funnier had she pulled a logan roy,2023-05-05
repeating that line in my head was the only way i made it through the rest of the rocket backstory scenes without sobbing,2023-05-05
can someone refresh my memory,2023-05-05
didnt see the movie in english where did they use it,2023-05-05
who said it in vol 3,2023-05-05
perfect opportunity for deadpool to get  off about them taking that special moment from him lol,2023-05-05
"he saw the door and frickin opened it 

only he didnt use frickin",2023-05-05
yeah no kidding haha i saw gunn going full “what are they gonna do fire me” for this movie and it kinda shows in some ways this feels like his least restrained mcu film by far lol,2023-05-05
this is why i desperately want a gunnhelmed howard the duck movie theyve been teasing howard for 3 movies and howard is imo like a more enjoyable deadpool satirical fourth wall breaking but in a less immature way than deadpool,2023-05-10
and probably only just barely beat sam jackson to it given that secret invasion comes out this summer and has a mature rating iirc,2023-05-05
seeing as next year has three mainline rrated projects in daredevil born again blade and deadpool 3 we probably will,2023-05-05
i feel like i heard rocket utter a muffled one when he had his near death experience,2023-05-05
when nebula is trying to get in the car he keeps telling her to push the button she does then says now what he says now open the  door,2023-05-05
get in the  car or open the  door cant remember exactly,2023-05-05
why would they say that right after we finally learned to understand groot speak,2023-05-06
it was a very funny scene,2023-05-06
same reason all pg13 movies have one none of them need to use them,2023-05-22
 doesnt result in r ratings in the same way  does its specifically more than one use of  its a weird puritanical view of movies but it is what it is,2023-06-05
i love that this movie features animal torture humanoids being sliced in half the brutal genocide of a sentient race and a man who gets his entire face ripped off and keeps truckin and youre worried about the f bomb,2023-05-17
how old is your nephew is he homeschooled because if he’s older than five and he goes to any school or social event i can guarantee you he has heard the f word before and probably in a very similar situation of annoyance,2023-05-09
it was the ultimate comic shot,2023-05-05
gave me huge ratchet  clank vibes,2023-05-05
that and rocket running along groot’s extending arm branch while shooting the baddies,2023-05-05
all the guardians got their moment to shine in that sequence but rocket jumping on groot’s back with the iconic shot was my favorite part so good,2023-05-05
reminded me a lot of how the characters fight in the guardians of the galaxy video game,2023-05-05
the beautiful teamwork they have was showcased so well here,2023-05-05
2 has some of the most heart in the mcu but also went a little too full throttle on comedy attempts 1 and 3 both have the right balance,2023-05-05
"i definitely like 2 the least but ive only seen it all the way through once i remember feeling like baby groot was a cute toy cash grab and why is 15 minutes of this movie spent on groot being dumb 

i definitely should watch 2 again but right now im in love with this third entry",2023-05-05
super mario also used it so  well but did kinda mess with me having it in two chris pratt movies a month apart,2023-05-05
"avengers are a interesting one also because if its a trilogy then its avengers aou and iw which doesnt vibe i feel like it is a trilogy in name only

avengers and aou are more of a duology iw and endgme also although i would say cw iw endgame work as a trilogy",2023-05-05
the 3rd spiderman movie is definitely a sequel though  the entire plot revolves around the consequences of peters attempt to undo mysterios exposure of his identity the two other peters were there to help him clean up his mess sure but peter1 was definitely front and center the whole time,2023-05-07
also captain america civil war is a ca movie in name only it’s truly a avengers movie it continues the story from age of ultron as much maybe more than it does winter soldier’s and  infinity warendgame are more “marvel universe” movies conclusions of the entire phases than properly “avengers” movies,2023-05-07
star wars original trilogie also had 3 different directors so thats not really a good point against movies being a trologie,2023-05-06
to someone elses point i think the combo breaker for captain america is that civil war is really avengers 15  not that it wasnt good but yeah as far as at least trilogy in name cap is good,2023-05-05
you forgot that zoe saldana is in both as well,2023-05-05
what was the other one,2023-05-05
interesting vol 2 was the one id have as the best,2023-05-05
lila why did you say that name,2023-05-10
the elevator scene was basically gunn ranting about how  gamoras death and return was so i dont think he would have thought of it at all lol,2023-05-10
thats why i never watch the trailer if i know i am watching the movie,2023-05-05
same there were news articles about it and everything lame,2023-05-10
i think nebula said it when she tried to get in the car when they were on antiearth,2023-05-05
its on marvels yt channel ,2023-05-21
i was hoping that do you realize would go on for longer,2023-08-03
shes so cool in that that game endeared me even more to all the guardians,2023-05-09
yes i loved her im the game,2023-05-07
rocket became a true superhero with a shirtless scene a fridged love interest and not killing the villain as a moral stance after killing a ton of his minions,2023-05-05
"i think the point was they they dont  the helpless 

everyone they killed was also trying to  them and they fought back in kind for example when they are attacked by those worm creatures mantis realises that they dont mean harm but are just scared and she calms them down

so they free the innocent kids and then go back to save rocket from the high evolutionary they tell rocket that he can  the guy who caused him so much pain and murdered his true friends but he decides his time would be better spent freeing the animals 

as he says im a guardian of the galaxy meaning hes a protector not an assassin then in the postcredits sequence the kid asks rocket if he feels bad about killing the animals that are attacking and he basically says no because were fighting for people who cant fight back 

its full circle with him learning to finally realise what being a gotg means as general mattis once said i come in peace i dont want to hurt you and i didn’t bring artillery but i’m pleading with you with tears in my eyes if you  with me i’ll  you all",2023-05-05
no it’s not he was left to idle in his imperfection and digest his failure he didn’t deserve an easy out he deserves to lay a crippled mangled failure on his doomed ship,2023-05-05
they didn’t  people to get to him though the mission was to save the kids and animals if i recall correctly,2023-05-05
hey they may need that guy to be the replacement for kang,2023-05-05
they killed people to save innocent lives,2023-05-05
killing people trying to  you and killing a guy who is lying beaten on the ground are not the same,2023-05-06
they weren’t defenseless in that moment he was literally lying there dying it would have been cold,2023-05-05
im that guy,2023-05-07
bruh did we watch the same  movie,2023-05-05
well he also corrected rockets pronunciation of cant,2023-05-06
his first outburst about rocket being smarter than him was excellent,2023-05-05
loved hearing him snap and scream made him scarier one of the best villains ever because that actor killed it,2023-05-05
credit where its due iwuji made him scary even with the scenery chewing,2023-05-05
he and his two assistants were so good at chewing the scenery while still being a threat was that mateo from superstore playing one of them,2023-05-05
high evolutionary is a better kang,2023-05-05
i like that type of villain just a completely evil  who needs to be defeated,2023-05-05
i got eddie redmayne in jupiter ascending vibes,2023-05-06
its not even a hard rule in the uk the lad just loves the queens english,2023-05-05
coming from a former colony of the british and having grown up in the american system and british system in different countries there’s definitely a sense of notion that british english is more cultured of course the higher evolutionary would prefer the queens english better,2023-05-07
people like to call everything grammer,2023-05-21
he was correcting rocket saying cants rather than the pronunciation,2023-08-05
pretty sure that was intentional definitely a gunn thing to get a character to call the villain a  and get it past censorship in an innocuous way,2023-05-07
pretty much thanos made it painless to get snapped vs your entire life burning around you,2023-08-02
"true but thanos was indiscriminate about it all basically 50 chance you get dusted 

nit like he was out there shooting dogs lol",2023-05-05
no of them felt pain though,2023-05-07
poor floor,2023-05-05
that was so bad in a  up way the directing the camera work the scene itself the music the clawing happening and then just repeating over and over literally traumatising and the fact that when he turned back floor was outside the cage which meant they went to try and help rocket  me up even more,2023-05-05
almost made me sob in the theater… that was just brutal,2023-05-05
yeah that scene broke me,2023-05-05
teef,2023-05-05
still running through my head,2023-05-05
that part was literally gonna give me a panic attack my heart was broken into a million pieces,2023-05-07
i took a pretty strong edible and the flashbacks were so  scary,2023-05-08
"i found all of that to be a going too far like i understood rocket had a tragic past but to beat i the audience over the head with animal cruelty like that is just manipulative filmmaking sure all filmmaking is emotional manipulation on some level but i found myself resenting this particular brand of it my favorite thing about the guardians movies is how they tightrope walk a very specific tone between silly and solemn but there were so many parts of this one that felt more mean spirited than the others and it put me off even though i was so ready to love it there were sections i enjoyed so maybe it will grow on me with a second viewing but my initial feeling is that it was kind of miserable and thats without even delivering on the marketing’s heavy suggestion that the guardians were going to all die on this adventure

i was telling my gf she should either wait to see it at home when we can fast forward or skip it because she doesn’t do well with animals in peril surprisedshe asked if it was really that cruel it made me question if i was crazy or had i really gone to see a guardians movie featuring an amputated bunny with mechanical spider legs and a robot muzzle begging for rocket and a wheelchair walrus with rusty metal eyelids to run away before they were gunned down like what business does this movie have being that dour",2023-05-05
"which scene was this i cant remember exactly it would make sense if i missed it if it was once but repeated 

did my movie theater have difference scenes south korea",2023-05-08
"i like how they finally found a direction for drax to go in

since his introduction ive been critical of his portrayal the leaning into comic relief 

when drax says you really think im  i felt he was talking to fans like me 

mantis giving him a reset and later telling him he was to be a father not a destroyer is a great little arc for drax 

well played mr gunn",2023-05-05
i appreciate not having a joke undercutting all the dramatic moments this time,2023-05-05
everything was getting me in the feels but i didnt really tear up until the very end when peter returns home and sees all the photos of him his mom and his grandpa all on the wall peter ran away but his grandpa never let him go,2023-05-05
also does a good monkey impression,2023-05-07
this was a standout moment for me drax was a father before he was drax the destroyer a fitting end for him to come full circle,2023-05-18
"	this film really hit hard with the emotional moments so well

and then ruined 2 seconds later because marvel just cant let their audience marinate with a sad scene for 5 minutes",2023-05-05
i was full on expecting a reunion between rocket and lylla and his ending was going to be running off with her teefs and floor were of course expected to die but i figured that when rocket escaped lylla would too and something would happen during the escape that causes them to lose each other i was legitimately shocked when she was killed,2023-05-05
"nebula appeared in gotg as a broken character for her to eventually start to care for others and ending up caregiver giving others what she never had is such an amazing arc 

i wouldnt mind seeing more of nebula on screen but theres no real reason for the character to do so  shes whole now",2023-05-05
i was expecting it and i was ecstatic when i saw him i feel you friend,2023-05-05
"oh man the yondu callback with kraglin got me

gets you much harder when you realize that kraglin is jamess brother sean and their father died in 2020 that was as much their father as it was yondu",2023-05-05
"it was the perfect way to bring him back without bringing him back  i lost my friend last year  i still see him in fleeting glances in moments in feelings  

i hope that ill always carry him with me",2023-05-05
happy cake day yondu,2023-05-05
hey that’s awesome  i’ve been vegan for about five years and my wife and i were just talking about how proanimalrights this movie was don’t hesitate to reach out if you ever need support i mean it,2023-05-07
vegan too all i gotta say is don’t feel rushed by anyone to transition to the lifestyle some doe it overnight while others take a while to get there also food is soooo much better than it was 10 years ago my life is now complete,2023-05-11
"good for you on making the connection between that film and what we as a species do to animals 

if you want advice on recipes eating out and navigating being a vegan in general feel free to pm me anytime",2023-05-18
fripp wouldnt let it tho,2023-05-21
i read that in a cary elwes voice,2023-05-05
the whole movie j was so annoyed because i knew i recognized him but it wasnt clicking from where weirdly i finally recognized him as he was groveling before quill pushes him out the window,2023-05-10
and making him a bit of a  teenager via you took him out of the cocoon too soon is a great way to nerf him down a bit,2023-05-05
he also took a backseat and let our loved and established characters finish their arc instead of having him “captain marvel” the problems away,2023-05-05
would love to see him somehow put the soul stone back together in the future especially since thanos said he only reduced them to atoms and didn’t completely erase them,2023-05-05
the ending when warlock saved peter reminded me and made me as happy as it did when leia survived in star wars the last jedi was beautiful,2023-05-05
"oh yeah i get that its not the last time well see him or anyone of the other guardians for that matter 

its just for a character of adam warlocks stature in the comics i would think he deserves his own movie 

i heard rumours that he was initially supposed to serve the role that captain marvel did in endgame along with getting his own movie hence the teaser at the ends of gotg2 which would have made more sense to me given his ties to the soul stone in the comics but they kind of divided his role between vision and captain marvel",2023-05-05
adam’s choppin it up he’ssss choppin it up,2023-05-05
fair point,2023-05-05
"agreed with gunn leaving boseman passing away and johnathan majors  issues and possible recasting of this phases big bad the new phase has slimtono chance at matching the infinity era 

but instead of playing into that and making more stand alone movies and shows like moon knight that arent just tie ins to an ensemble movie theyre going to try and force the magic of the first ten years but  if a movie about stealing cars can turn into a 60000000000 franchise then theres always hope for at least some fun popcorn flicks

the real  going to be if they can avoid  up the fantastic four for the fourth time",2023-05-06
i feel like that was kinda the point though he wasn’t some mastermind evil villain he was a literal mad scientist who didn’t or couldn’t stop even when the people around him told him to,2023-05-10
i think if star lord would of died at the end it would of been a dumb way for him to die,2023-05-05
haha totally forgot he was in it that  had me laughing,2023-05-05
boom goes the dynamite,2023-05-05
if you want an earlier and more upsetting version of a similar story check out the plague dogs by the guy that did watership down,2023-05-05
i have read we3 and it’s one of the saddest comics i’ve read gunn must’ve been influenced by the comic when writing rocket’s backstory,2023-05-05
oh  you just triggered me we3 destroyed me ,2023-05-05
"i’m genuinely curious what he had to go through to get that one line in this movie because you don’t go 15 years and 20 something movies never dropping the fbomb to just suddenly doing it

i know my guy fought for that one and feige and co were probably just like “ it he’s given us one of the best trilogies of the franchise let him say  once”",2023-05-06
tums festival,2023-07-10
yes that bit isnt talked about as much as it should it was so good draxs replies to the guard were great his whole lowenergy yeah sure comments carried a hint of dammit mantis,2023-05-10
amen straight up the first villain i didnt want to keep around for sequels,2023-05-05
in comics primary colors red blue yellow are mostly used for heroes because theyre bold simple bright to contrast them villains usually got secondary color schemes orange green purple purple is also one of the rarest colors in nature at the edge of our visible light spectrum so it seems dark and exotic to us the way outer space would throw in the royalty connotations because of its natural rarity and youve got an easy choice for the color scheme of a space tyrant,2023-05-05
purple is traditionally the color of powerroyalty maybe also there isnt very many purple marvel characters,2023-05-05
"its kind of like wanda and valkyrie or widow

widow was a super assassin for years pre shield valkyrie literally captured people for the grandmaster to use as slaves or fodder in death matches but we never really see that

then theres wanda who has been corrupted by the darkhold in multiverse of madness where we see her killing fodder sorcerers left and right and then ripping through a team of au heroes on screen because we experience that it sticks with the audience rather than it just being something that was mentioned similarly wandavision a year earlier had her possess a small town with them suffering the effects of her possession",2023-05-05
thanos is pretty evil in end game  he even revels in the thought of killing everyone on earth,2023-05-07
i guess he didn’t torture them they just faded into dust,2023-05-06
lowkey love the concept of he seeing the heroes and making twisted “perfect” versions of them that they have to stop because they’re diabolical,2023-05-06
boomer will live,2023-05-17
"thanos was basically the main character in infinity war in his mind he is the hero setting out to collect the stones in order to save the universe he wasnt some power hungry remorseless monster he was humble and even bordering on kind at times genuinely believing he was doing the right thing and even felt pain and sadness through his journey and at the end of his journey he didnt gloat celebrate or cheer he simply sat down and enjoyed the sunset believing he saved the universe it humanizes him and makes him a more sympathetic villain 

the high evolutionary was just a remorseless obnoxious perfectionist with an ego so massive it makes tony stark look like ghandi by comparison the actor absolutely nailed it in making us hate the character",2023-05-05
"killing half of all of the universe

logical",2023-05-05
people will be thinking of something else within a week,2023-05-05
nope they literally end the movie mowing down a bunch of angry sheep things,2023-05-08
i also don’t get why especially after all of that they were freeing the animals and someone goes “i thought we were only saving higher beings” to which quill goes “i thought so too” maybe something i’m reading too much into,2023-05-09
this is exactly what i was thinking also what about the whole part when they’re mowing down the sheep and the girl asks “don’t you feel bad” and rocket is like nooo it’s fine cause we’re protecting people it felt like the movie was saying that animal testing is bad but animal exploitation like eating the frogs and killing animals that cause us issues is okay what a confusing message,2023-05-24
considering the downvotes guess the animal abuse stuff went over people’s heads it’s okay to lock animals in dark cages and  them horrifically if it means we get a burger in the end but if it’s done to create some higher life form in a movie then it’s not okay and we should be sad,2023-05-24
that was one of my favorite movements of the movie for your exact reasoning,2023-05-06
when floor was having a panic attack i almost did too my heart was aching so badly and then when you see her lifeless body dear  this was the saddest  i’ve ever seen in a marvel movie,2023-05-05
but i must admit  rocket grabing gun and killing three people looked cool,2023-05-15
why did they still have robot parts in heaven,2023-05-12
that’s how i took it similar to gamora finally understanding what he’s saying that was supposed to insinuate that the audience has now been around groot long enough to understand him,2023-05-05
yeah it definitely felt like that to me kinda like the audience are officially part of the gang too,2023-05-05
"so he did say it 

but no i get what you meant and thats exactly how i took it",2023-05-05
especially because the guardians didn’t have a big reaction to groot speaking a new sentence i think this is the right take,2023-05-05
when groot and gamora were interacting in the end and she noticed that she responded to him without thinking about it saying that last i am groot you know he was saying ill miss you because of context and demeanor she says ill miss you too in her own way for me when i saw that scene it clicked,2023-05-05
"yes this is now confirmed by james gunn

",2023-05-06
that was my take too we’ve been with him long enough we can understand him now,2023-05-05
gunn confirmed that he is not speaking english the audience finally understands groot,2023-05-07
james gunn confirmed this theory,2023-05-06
yes this is a fact nobody in the scene reacted differently its just that we are now understanding him finally after all these years,2023-05-08
ooooooo that is an awesome theory,2023-05-05
thats what i thought too,2023-05-06
he did actually say that just in his language,2023-05-06
"it would be interesting to see it again slo mo this time and see if his mouth doesn’t make the movements for “i am groot” but we hear the “i love you guys”

anyone been able to notice",2023-05-10
 thats a good moment i love that trilogy,2023-05-05
i swear i heard groot yell no when quill was freezing in space as he was extending his arms which made the i love you in the next scene even more fitting,2023-05-06
thank you at first i found it a bit weird and that no one seemed to react to is so yeah makes perfect sense now,2023-05-05
ohhhhh… that’s why they had him say it i did not get that at the time now i’m kind of sad that such a beautiful moment went right over my head,2023-05-05
yes i think that’s exactly what gunn intended,2023-05-11
its also the positioning of the characters to be fair there was absolutely no reason for modok to want to redeem himself he hated scott and hank i can see him turning on kang after being mistreated by them but out of revenge rather than some sort of selfless sacrifice whereas adam warlock is almost literally a new born taking in the universe for the first time and after being with high evolutionary and ayesha this is undoubtedly the first time hes witnessed that kind of selfless compassion that groot has,2023-05-05
in guardians 3 it also ties into the theme of recognizing individuals worth in contrast to the high evolutionary,2023-05-10
the cringy  line isn’t from gunn……,2023-05-06
i have a hard time thinking that the high evolutionary’s motivations were not at least a little gunn critiquing cancel culture him saying he wants a world without bigotry and injustice but being willing to destroy all of the “flawed” creatures over and over to make that happen is very onthenose,2023-05-09
its less about the line itself and more about the execution of two very similar character arcs,2023-05-05
ugh i forgot about that bit,2023-05-05
seeing globules of  floating around in imax 3d was an experience,2023-05-08
directors who give a  maybe,2023-05-05
well the director still has to have a good vision,2023-05-08
youre right i cants hear without subtitles rip,2023-05-05
he had some lines that were definitely inspired by gollum,2023-05-06
maybe his vocabulistics just aint as good as you and me,2023-05-08
i really thought it was a stealth cuntbomb would fit gunns humor,2023-05-10
100 spoke it like an aussie pronounces it,2023-05-10
i know the planet was blowing up and people were dying but to see that shot of that lady dying as gamora is leaving the ship was a bit disturbing,2023-05-05
this was the first mcu movie that actually felt pg13 as in young children should absolutely not watch this,2023-05-05
add to the fact that she had a terrible father herself in thanos so acknowledging what was a good figure for the children makes her arc a little bit more special that she can see the importance of his character traits,2023-05-05
oops thank you for the correction on that i fixed it,2023-05-05
i love that nebula got to open up a little more and show some emotion by the end,2023-05-05
it didnt really feel like mantis actually defended drax she was still demeaning to him and then made him forget that,2023-05-05
i dont know it think it kind of fits everybody treats drax as a  and sometimes rightfully so but then when push comes to shove he shows he does have use so all in all i think a convoluted arc was not needed its pretty great as is,2023-08-05
"the he has a paint goblin in the sims

the he has an iron golem farm",2023-05-08
if he was buddhist would you care probably not people assume bc he goes to church he’s a bigot but that’s clearly not true and he’s stated that,2023-05-11
"thanos was an absolute monster but hes never shown to be as malicious as the high evolutionary was in this film  were told about his cruelty  especially towards nebula  but its only put on screen one time  again when hes torturing nebula  he is shown to have a certain degree for the concepts of life and happiness even if hes willing to sacrifice trillions of individuals for the betterment of their future descendants

the high evolutionary however is shown to be absolutely malicious toward his own creations  despite his knowledge of art and science there is no grace or dignity to his great works  he  furthermore hes shown to be incompetent  even his greatest successes  the manufacture of entire species and civilizations  are shown to be hopelessly flawed so much that he chooses to obliterate them rather than let them grow",2023-05-06
not sure if you know but the actress for the woman that got shot is his real life wife,2023-05-05
hes already done that with peacemaker,2023-05-07
that’s how all the best mcu movies are imo the guardians trilogy iron man 1 all movies tied loosely together but stand well on their own it really increases their rewatchability for me too when i don’t have to remember a million and one side plots that happened across half a dozen different movies and tv shows to understand what’s happening,2023-05-05
this made quantomania look like like a cw show,2023-05-05
also the story was so interesting it wasn’t the same rehashed  they were moments that were just weird and i felt like i hadn’t seen it before,2023-05-05
it probably is but not obvious yet no way the high evolutionary stays dead too important for too many stories,2023-05-05
i also like that it actually gave all the characters an arc and felt like it really moved the plot along in their own corner of the universe after the last doctor strange and thor i was kind of like… that’s it,2023-05-05
"and to think disney nearly lost their best mcu director because of some tweets he made a decade ago and had already openly apologized for  

i’m so glad they got their heads out of their  and brought him back to finish the guardians trilogy because yeah like you said this is really the first and only amazing mcu trilogy i think a lot of that too is because of how self contained gunn kept them from the greater mcu like sure yeah they mention the infinity stones in this but it’s not like you had cameos from captain marvel or something like that",2023-05-05
the captain america trilogy is incredible tho ,2023-05-05
"i’m going to have to disagree on the better with each installment part guardians 1 is a top 5 mcu all time 

i enjoyed 2 and like 3 more but you really think they are better than the first one",2023-05-05
captain america trilogy,2023-05-05
i haven’t seen this one yet but i was not a huge fan of the second movie i just don’t think i liked the plot about ego but everytime i see the first movie i forget how fun it was,2023-05-05
"second 

spiderman trilogy was good too",2023-05-05
"its got a lot of animal related sadness and really dark but predictable turns  a mature 9 year old could definitely handle it but i think it would be kind of a downer for most of them 
 im glad my son didnt ask to go he would not have handled it well",2023-05-05
it is very violent at times and theres quite a bit of death for a marvel movie its definitely the least childfriendly of the trilogy 9 might be a bit young for this it really uses the pg13 rating to the fullest including marvels first actual fbomb if that matters to you,2023-05-05
"its probably the most viscerally brutal film in the mcu  there are some hard beatings in this movie with a good bit of blood and some of that comes right out of the gate 

there is a lot of animal cruelty explicit and implied  theres a character that to me at least was such a frankenstein mash of things that it upset me  that character has a panic attack while under duress  its not a fun moment 

theres a moment toward the very end of the film that is maybe the most graphically distressing shot in the entire mcu  

there are a few moments where main characters are in serious jeopardy 

having said all that im a horror movie guy and there was nothing that was too much for me  i watch movies with my nephew that might be too much for him

he could watch this one in his sleep
i am also the guy that routinely thanks his dad for taking him to see raiders of the lost ark at the ripe old age of five and that movie ends with two peoples heads melting away and another guys head exploding so

depends on the 9 year old  if shes used to violence if shes watched enough of it then yeah take her  if she is a softie for animals then for the love of all that is holy maybe dont  but maybe do because the best thing about gotg3 is how it pays off all the story beats and achieves catharsis by doing so",2023-05-05
no,2023-05-07
went with friend  her 9 year old daughter she did not handle the animal scenes very well,2023-05-05
no i mean cute fluffy animal deaths and torture,2023-05-09
imagine terminator 2 with more humor,2023-05-10
im really interested to see what his superman movie is going to look like its going to be weird when he doesnt have to answer to the studio because he is the studio,2023-05-05
"been pondering this with all the comments regarding it the pg13 rating and how this movie pushing the limits of it and i think it’s actually the reverse of what everyone has come to expect from this rating  

i reckon in recent years pg13 movies have been diluted in terms of violence and suggestive material obv in order to allow younger kids to come see movies that would otherwise be meant for teens and up  

this is the precise reason that this rating was invented in the first place  pretty sure temple of doom was rated pg and a dude gets his heart ripped out like  mortal kombat  so they invented pg13 with a very specific number to say hey these movies aren’t for young kids

so yeah any kid under 13 might very well be scared or even traumatized by the imagery in this movie  because technically they shouldn’t be there",2023-05-05
i straight up think it was inappropriate to make happy meals of this movie it was so disturbing and violent great film,2023-05-09
that film should not have been pg13 the face scene alone should have made it r arguably all the animal torture too,2023-05-10
i really think this should fall somewhere between pg13 and r but theres no rating for that,2023-05-08
"	two big movies within a month mario being the other both used “no sleep til brooklyn” in an actiony way

and both starring chris pratt coincidence i think not",2023-05-05
i liked that fight but holy  what a jarring cut afterward felt like they had just told them to start running down the hall,2023-05-05
unfortunately imo it being in mario took a lot of the punch out of the needle drop for me at least it probably doesnt help that i watched mario for the third time to  time between work and my gotg showing,2023-05-05
is that why im still awake at 2am,2023-05-05
hemsworth is really good at playing a himbo idiot and i have no problem letting them lean into the actors talent that movie just got too overstuffed there were like 5 or 6 plots going on all at once and it was just too much to carry they could have made a movie about valkyrie trying to rule new asgard or a movie about jane becoming thor or a movie about thor fighting the  butcher but it was too much to smash them all together,2023-05-05
difference is taika really didnt actually give a  about the story or characters of lt or take them very seriously by a lot of accounts his priority was a lot partying with the film being like a fun goofy diversion he gets to inject a bunch of his jokes into all  nilly to let the editor pick the ones that work,2023-05-05
eternals was also very much that and though i personally loved that one a lot of people didnt,2023-05-05
another example of a self contained story,2023-05-05
man i loved love and thunder for better or for worse i would prefer that over some boring  movie with no identity,2023-05-14
"im probably the biggest multiverse of madness fan alive and i will defend that movie with my life id argue the sam raiminess of it is kind of what saved a script that had clearly been rewritten 100 times 


love and thunder just tried to do too much and it ended up being overstuffed they had an interesting villain and a great performance from bale and then just forgot to give him any real screen time because they had to deal with jane valkyrie mjolnir thor new asgard zeus and hercules and hundred other things if they cut 23 subplots that movie could have been pretty good i dont know how much of that was taikas fault and how much of it was just dealing with the fact that it was the 4th movie in the series and they already had too much going on",2023-05-05
thor 4 isn’t taika unchained it’s taika not giving a  it almost feels like a film student trying to affect his style all of his other movies ragnarok included as well as jojo rabbit his movie released closest to lt have this fantastic blend of heartfelt earnestness and comedy based in the situational rather than direct jokes and for some reason love and thunder completely lacks his usual hand my only guess is that something made him write it off because everything else he’s done is leagues better,2023-05-05
the problem with multiverse of madness wasn’t the direction it was the writing the direction was literally the best part,2023-05-05
i maintain that love and thunder would not be as poorly received if there had been maybe just ten more minutes showing gorr doing some actual godbutchering in the first half it would have really balanced the tone and helped the picture overall,2023-05-05
i feel like mom is a decent example of good directorial style bringing an average to below average script above the depths,2023-05-05
"mom had to do a lot of broader mcu stuff which hindered it

i don’t think ragnarok is that great to begin with so thor 4 wasn’t that much of a downgrade imo",2023-05-05
people love different styles i loved raimis take on mom i just like james style a little more lol,2023-05-05
eh im definitely in the camp that feels that mom only worked because it leaned so hard into the raiminess of it all i never expected an mcu movie to feel like evil dead 2 or drag me to  but this pulled it off,2023-05-05
mom didn’t feel all that much like a zany raimi film to me you could feel his influence but it wasn’t that strong imo outside the horror aspects thor 4 yeah that one was too much of taika he over did it,2023-05-05
if anything mom didnt have nearly enough of the director’s quirky thing,2023-05-05
"this is such an insane take

mom felt like raimi was way too muzzled if you ask me",2023-05-06
aw that’s easily my favorite postendgame movie,2023-05-14
yes and that’s why it rules,2023-05-14
i still dont think taika was the problem with that movie because he kinda nailed ragnarok,2023-05-05
eternals multiverse of madness ragnarok love  thunder,2023-05-05
the russo captain americas also,2023-05-05
she was in 5 seconds of a post credit scene and didnt have any impact on the actual movie she felt like kind of an afterthought black widow is a movie that only exists because they needed to introduce florence pughs character there are varying degrees of shoehorning characters and this movie handled it about as well as you could possibly hope for,2023-05-05
they were in a 30 second credit scene wakanda forever completely derailed the movie for 30 minutes to introduce iron heart thats more what im referring to when i say shoehorn a young avenger,2023-05-05
hopefully green lantern is on the docket,2023-05-05
i just hope wb would not mess with gunn and his vision,2023-05-15
"scary movie 3 for me

“now who the  threw that”",2023-05-05
ohhh yeah haha that one is really funny too,2023-05-05
same here,2023-05-09
i’ve heard that line was improvised and they left it in  i am not sure if that is true or not but it was perfect for that scene,2023-05-05
nice  model,2023-05-08
that sounded more like ryan reinolds ,2023-05-07
"a surprising amount of twitter is still latching onto that  because theyre mad at dc for what they perceive as replacing snyder with gunn

dont get me wrong i actually love the snyder movies but i think the type of people who latch on so hard to the things they like that they attack anything different are complete morons",2023-05-05
it wasnt even that a couple people on twitter who said far worse than james ever did  because it wasnt fair roseanne got fired for calling a black woman a monkey but a decade old  joke when the man worked for troma was somehow the same,2023-05-05
" the internet got mad

maga morons got mad because gunn kept mocking their sunkist messiah",2023-05-05
i’m absolutely hyped to see him revive dc,2023-05-05
if they didnt though we wouldnt have gotten peacemaker and therefore iwuji as high evolutionary,2023-05-06
he made tweets 20 years ago prophetic,2023-05-11
did the internet get mad at gunn though  i think disney did it preemptively assuming there would be outrage but i dont think there was any especially since gunn didnt double down on it,2023-05-06
"its because he was making jokes about  

and the hollywood bigwigs at disney didnt realize he was making an absurdly offensive joke they assumed he was saying the quiet part out loud",2023-05-05
context is everything  he said something multiple times before the “controversy” about using shock humor in the past and how he no longer thought it was ok  he wasn’t hiding from it he admitted it was a dumb thing he used to do and he didn’t feel that way anymore  that is how you know someone has truly changed they’re honest about their past and their regrets  he didn’t need disney to tell him to stop joking about molesting little boys he came to that conclusion on his own  i think that’s why people stood behind him,2023-05-10
i heard the exec who fired him didnt even tell anyone else he was going to he just did it imagine he got his  reamed for months over that,2023-05-14
should,2023-05-15
one of horn’s only bad moves in a legendary career,2023-05-14
high evolutionary was better than kang was in loki,2023-05-06
the power level of the new guardians grew exponentially,2023-05-08
apparently in the comics shes marvells daughter,2023-05-05
thank you i wish i had something more poetic to say like i’ve seen from other people grieving but i don’ happened and it  but your comment is really kind and made my day thank you again,2023-05-08
i didn’t like part 2 very much because the ego story and ego himself didn’t really work for me,2023-05-09
ronan from the first film was also like that,2023-05-14
i was shocked how good borat sequel film was,2023-05-05
dont do that to me,2023-05-05
"yes

i say for the entire movie trying to figure out why she felt familiar and this is it exactly  serious bmo vibes",2023-05-11
tbf antman has always been some sort of a palette cleanser after a heavy marvel release,2023-05-05
would have been better if it was 30 minutes shorter not great but better,2023-05-10
lol i saw it last week at ronnies and that definitely got a cheer from out theater the first thing i thought when it showed him walking down the street was “oh yeah that’s for sure st charles” lol,2023-05-05
lol he’d be more shocked to learn the rams moved to st louis in the first place he was abducted well before they left los angeles,2023-05-05
thank you i just saw it again today and instantly was like “ i got the quote wrong,2023-05-06
i dont know how i missed he was the same actor from peacemaker thought he looked very familiar im blaming the lack of hair that confused me,2023-05-05
but cap 3 is basically avengers 28 so its kinda cheating they were good movies but its not fair to gotg who mostly done stuff on their own,2023-05-07
i hardly consider that a true trilogy though in the same vein as guardians or any other true trilogy because it doesnt actually end anything and this may he lame to say but civil war is just barely a captain america movie,2023-05-05
2 was not better than 1,2023-05-05
i just have no desire to rank them against one another because they do beautifully build upon each other and rely on their chronological development ti give us that epic payoff it’s essentially 3 parts of a whole for me because it’s so consistently well done,2023-05-05
i disagree the captain america trilogy and spiderman trilogies holland are up there for me,2023-05-05
i always like seeing henchmen show some backbone even if it usually results in their quick deaths,2023-05-05
all the time when hes patiently explaining he wants to study the brain of 89p13 im like you just want to  the one thing that was smarter than you and put the brain in a jar you sick ,2023-05-05
or does he,2023-05-10
oh it was 100 howard the duck at the poker table hes shown up in previous gotg movies and very briefly in the background of the assemble scene in endgame,2023-05-05
i know exactly what you’re talking about lol saw it with my sister as soon as i tried to talk about what i liked i started crying again it just hits hard man movie is special,2023-05-05
nah marvel will be fine,2023-05-06
the voice actor is the actress who plays hawkeyes wife,2023-05-09
think you’re onto something he is on earth although isn’t that due out next month how would they keep that under wraps during filming,2023-05-07
omfg that’s right the easter egg we still don’t know ,2023-05-07
bro is this your first marvel movie,2023-05-05
it was more of a comedic scene between quill and his grandfather and a reference to the guardians holiday special on disney the rocket scene was the one that had a more continuity vibe to it for future films,2023-05-05
it was super loud tbh i was worried the movie itself would be just as loud because the volume in the trailer was overwhelming enough,2023-05-05
literally its going to liquefy your organs,2023-05-07
i bring high fidelity earplugs to nolan films now just in case,2023-05-07
it’s nolan’s first straight drama since the prestige really unsure what to think about it,2023-05-05
barbie superior,2023-05-05
oppenheimer has always seemed like a strange movie to make but okay i guess well find out feels more like an oscar bait movie than anything,2023-05-05
this is what i heard as well,2023-05-05
i saw it with subtitles and it was definitely phallus,2023-05-05
ok see that would probably make more sense ,2023-05-05
phallus,2023-05-05
i thought i heard phallus lol,2023-05-05
this is correct i’ve seen it referenced in an interview with gunn,2023-05-06
ohhhhhh rocky,2023-05-06
im about to have my first kid draxs ending had me bawling,2023-05-05
"james gunn is what the dceu probably needed 

someone who actually respects the source material and has a vision",2023-05-05
im just saying a dude who can make me tear up and care for a talking racoon and tree is a very good writerdirector as long as he makes superman comic accurate and doesnt write any bplots about batman and lois having a secret kid i think the dcu is in good hands,2023-05-05
doctor manhattan,2023-05-10
it’s perfect because despite rocket willing himself back to physical life with lylla’s support he isn’t truly healed inside his heart until he sees the baby raccoons and accepts his raccoonhood that little “i’m not a raccoon” joke works both in the moment as a little moment of levity and reminder of rocket’s instinctive defensiveness and also as setup for the tears to come when he finally embraces what he is,2023-05-13
i really hate how everyone has these compact nanosuits now,2023-06-10
and nebula calling him starlord when she’s mad too,2023-05-07
i don’t think the zune has as much sentimental value to it and he and rocket are a lot closer now he’s also the only one else that really liked earth music,2023-05-07
that was actually in vol2 he seemingly got it repaired or replaced in the 4 year gap between that and infinity war,2023-05-07
also cops get  wrong all the time this one isnt hard for me to handwave,2023-05-13
could be but at least this movie seems to confirm rocket originated as a regular earth raccoon,2023-05-06
and fur farms,2023-05-06
absolutely certain scenes are gruesome and hard to stomach,2023-05-05
"disney and feige have already been scrambling after quantumania to try and course correct the mcu

they only need to look to this for the template

just because james is gone doesn’t mean anything

give us great films with little to no setups no cameos just a great story and great characters it shouldn’t be hard not for marvel",2023-05-05
imagine its the next big threat  everyone fighting in a suburb and our star lord is eating cereal and thats it,2023-05-05
meh they can just bring him back and give him a new face lots of options,2023-05-05
probably but without explicit confirmation that someone is dead they can pretty much always return in these kinds of movies even a confirmed death can be walked back via any number of explanations like time travel clones alt dimensions rebuilt as a cyborg etc…,2023-05-08
drax carried him onto the ship,2023-05-05
honestly it worked because he didn’t die but that would have been a legitimately frustrating and pointless death,2023-05-05
what happened to his mask isnt that supposed to let him breathe in space,2023-05-05
the followup with warlock was an absolutely hilarious shot which made up for the tease in spades,2023-05-05
and then the post credit scene is just him eating breakfast possibly a very recent reshoot because they had to cut a kang one due to the pending charges ,2023-05-05
seemed pretty obvious to me he wasnt dying there if he stayed behind for a different reason perhaps but the second they showed him staying behind for the zune i knew he was making it out killing him over that wouldnt have added anything meaningful to the story,2023-05-06
i even started crying when he was freezing i was like oh my  hes the one they’re gonna ,2023-05-05
put some respect on the zune sir,2023-05-07
i think rocket dying would have been a huge letdown i feel like his arc was about learning to have a good life after his abuse and killing him off would have been too nihilistic,2023-05-05
i would not be surprised if peter becomes an avenger at some point,2023-05-05
oh yeah i’m not saying i wanted anyone to die or that it was necessary i just mean that killing a character off would’ve been the only way for gunn to give some finality to his creative decisions and i’m surprised he didn’t exercise that right the trailer sure seemed like he would,2023-05-05
that was the biggest plot line in the film ,2023-05-05
some people really are just sick of cape films but this at least just plays outright science fiction,2023-05-10
separated by over two hours of movie almost forgot about it,2023-05-08
i thought he kinda looked like that dude from fantastic beasts ,2023-05-05
yeah he had a solo comic for a bit,2023-05-07
nawwww forreal what do you think they meant by that,2023-05-05
"floor was absolutely heartbreaking

im going to have rocket teefs floor go now on loop in my brain for awhile",2023-05-09
you’re talking about after gotg 3 i’m talking about that he lost guardians after infinity war for 5 years they were dusted he lost his animal family then his guardians family got dusted and he only had nebula,2023-05-07
i feel like youre under estimating them literally none of the guardians react to groot speaking english and the gamora bit was clearly setting up for the end,2023-05-05
i think you’re underestimating james gunn,2023-05-05
short version similar with a couple variants thought it would be more appropriate to send you a message in private ,2023-06-12
all those years as a bounty hunter and not even a papercut,2023-05-06
i didn’t ever question’s gunn’s talent more so the situation around him the mcu has deteriorated since guardians 2 came out and i hadn’t seen it in a while so i honestly went in with lower expectations for vol 3 as i thought it would rub on him a bit i was definitely wrong,2023-05-07
his first time seeing the sky  as a free being  is not uplifting or joyful as he envisioned   as he is not rocketing away with his friends with hope in his heart but alone bloodied bitter and grieving,2023-05-06
difference  in my opinion both needed better dialogue,2023-05-07
" but the justification is im a guardian of the galaxy

that line made no sense it was so forced and cringe gunn missed the mark with the final act of this movie dropped the ball hard hated the ending for some of these characters it was   depressing as  for no reason",2023-05-08
"dont remind me 
damnit here comes the water works",2023-05-09
"his explanation is peter left in a hurry to save rocket and forgot it

isnt it always on him like iron mans suit it just materialises when he taps his temple",2023-05-11
wasnt he wearing his gravity boots instead,2023-05-12
gotcha thank you,2023-05-05
diversity is fine you dimwit lol the guardians are diverse,2023-05-07
yeah but if hes able to bring knowledge or equipment from space hed be massive,2023-05-07
if thats what it was saying then yes i recall floor go now blending together,2023-05-07

haven’t done the disney plus shows 

guardians of the galaxy volume 3 i think just got the characters into a believably better state than when we met them and to see them try to move on evolve work on themselves was a story i appreciated more than setting up the next big bad etc",2023-05-15
it’s odd how the entire furry planet gets vaporized and they never mention it again,2023-05-22
absolutely neuralink just seemed like a better parallel to draw because impassionate scientists shoving tech into the bodies of innocent animals is probably a more visceral image for the average person slaughterhouses should definitely illicit a similar reaction but i think most people who eat meat are too jaded by those stats at this point and thus the impact isnt as strong as it should be,2023-05-11
correct,2023-05-05
it’s during the animal stampede moment you have to look closely and drax is carrying him in his arms,2023-05-08

its trash and i loved gotg1,2023-05-05
ah i did not pick that up and imdb wasnt being helpful thanks,2023-05-05
what i meant is if shes leaving on foot and are on a skull shaped spaceship she is going nowhere i would have understood if they dropped her somewhere but she was still in knowhere where she cant go somewhere without a ship can she even pilot,2023-05-05
"i rewatched the first one last night as well was what prompted me to come here

that scene is just so  well written in the grand scheme of things",2023-05-08
yeah doing that memory erasure thing was messed up but drax has also been cruel to her in the past and mantis has always been the guardian member that takes the most  from others even drax so i think its good she is going on her own path if i was her i wouldnt have chosen to stick with drax either not because drax is a problematic guy but because even wellmeaning friends can stop you from growing and sometimes you just need to figure things out for yourself,2023-05-08
despite the problems it truly seemed like a wellfunctioning society overall too bad the he never saw it as anything else than an elaborate art installation so to speak,2023-05-09

man who cares let that dope eat grass if he wants,2023-05-05
"yes rocketyondu starlordyondu and gammoranebula dynamics were great the villain was a tad weak but still serviceable and fit the theming for the film drax is a bit more jokey in this one which is unfortunate but he still has that amazing show dont tell scene when mantis touches him and starts crying

i like it only slightly less than the first film",2023-05-10
no as soon as they were introduced you knew they were going to die i spend the whole movie waiting for them to die and then they didnt even die that badly,2023-05-05
"if the only way you can expand character is through death you are a bad story teller

compare rockets friends to adams mom theres very little emotional stake in her death because who even are these characters they are just tools to progress the plot we have to chase rocket because weve been told to chase rocket we have no connection wuth them as characters the mom was a glancing character in part 2 and adam is barely a character here

the same is true for rockers friends they are not actual characters the have as much meaning or stake to us as adams mom arguably less the robot ferret is essentially just the dead wife smiling under the bed covers meme for all the extend to which she is an actual person in this film

the only reason they elicit a stronger reaction is because they are cute animals  gunn very clearly avoids giving them any meaningful characterisation because then their deaths would be excessive 

and i get it its marvel its for families to be able to enjoy it cant have any meaningful consequences for characters we actually care about yes apart from tony stark thats why they couldnt  any actual characters off in this why they couldnt even really  off gamora 

but that doesnt make cheap gimmicks like this any less cheap",2023-05-05
wow everything you said here is painfully wrong  you’ve clearly grown out of your fun hat peter pan,2023-05-08
their death scene was clearly supposed to be distressing and not sad,2023-05-07
like every other mcu movie we’re like trained monkeys at this point,2023-05-05
"thanks 

still curious why mods dont list that for any movie anymore",2023-05-05

i kind of hate people  this is after shushing them over and over  when the previews were playing they came in late and started having a loud conversation  oh look at how big this screen is  i went here for a special preview of that jared leto movie  it wasnt good but it was free  do you like marvel or dc  oh the little mermaid might be good but it looks so dark  i couldnt hear a single word because they were shouting like they were in a club trying to hear over this distracting music   i dont mean talking loud  shouting  then throughout the movie chuckling and making comments to each other like theyre trying to impress the other with their wit,2023-05-08
thanks,2023-05-08
movie timeline was a few days if i remember correctly,2023-05-09

"just a horrible movie zero stakes the acting was the most mailedin bs i’ve seen in a while it’s been a few years since i saw a marvel movie in theatres and if this is what marvel movies are now then it will probably be a few years before i see another 

i do not recall another movie that had jokes this forced and persistent across the whole film it’s like they couldn’t let the characters breathe at all also who tf was that yellow dude did they build an entire plot line just to have the deus ex machina moment at the end i can tell that they rewrote the third act like 15 times to get it to where it’s plausible that they gang gets back together for a 4th installment that no one will ask for",2023-05-06
it ties into drax well better than thor 4,2023-05-05
yeah right when i saw them i thought those kids were going to save the guardians,2023-05-07
agree it was so choppy with all the cuts didn’t like how they constantly cut from emotional moment to legit horrorjump scare then to a comedic scene so quickly it took me out of the experience at times,2023-05-05
hm sounds like a 610 or pretty average according to your description,2023-05-05
totally agreed,2023-05-05
yeah i prefer volume 2 to this one tbh this one really couldnt balance the dark stuff and the quippy marvel banter it couldnt find a good balance and the villain was not very well developed either adam warlock was completely wasted,2023-05-14
i totally agree the second was a big letdown the first movie is still the best imo,2023-05-06
vol 2 was terrible,2023-05-05
"glad you enjoyed it i just dont see how its better than the first

this movie struggles to juggle between the dark stuff and the quippy marvel stuff and the villain needs to be more developed",2023-05-06

lol nice,2023-05-20
just minutes ago i went to grab something during my lunch break and my brain thought of that scene again i keep replaying it ugh one of the many that broke my heart and teared up way too devastating for me and i’m glad i’m not alone,2023-05-05
"it was really jarring because i saw it in switzerland with my non american wife 

but the lazy world building wouldnt have bugged me as much if the movie didnt feel like it needed to speed run through the counter earth segment 

like i could feel the editors saying this scene has to end in the next 37 seconds so we can get to the last third of the movie 

it would have been much better had the set pieces been the bio headquarters and then straight on to the high evolutionarys ship 

the guardians would have had more time to talk without them having to shoe horn it in around plot  

as it was the constant dialogue in life and death situations made it seem like the characters dont care about their mortal peril so why should i as the audience

the one scene that worked for dialogue  plot was when they were reducing the shields starlord is doing the battery activation 1 by 1 while talking to nebula on the intercom there is danger but it is also slow enough that you could believe their conversation",2023-05-05
"i actually dont know who that is 

i think it is a case of the flaws with the movie being kind of obvious 

some things are a matter of taste i see in the thread that a lot of people liked the yelling high evolutionary",2023-05-05
yall need to see other movies,2023-05-05
james gunn really didn’t hold back from the intro thinking that groot was dead after being decapitated to shooting drax over again assuming that he was dead to peters final scene floating in space really held you in there throughout the whole movie,2023-05-05
thats what i mean for a film that i thinks a 12 the language used throughout caught me off guard for the rating and the just animal abuse you see like just the bits of the recording we see of rockets implants going in were hauntingly messed up and even with seeing the rest of his batch theres just this creepyness to it all,2023-05-06
the stament nebula made about rocket having it worse than her just seemed unnecessary this isnt the oppression olympics and even if rocket suffered more nebula still clearly has ptsd from her experiences which is nearly always played for laughs i guess its only sad when cute animals suffer,2023-05-13
that might have been improv but her torture has been made light of for at least three movies just seems like its only supposed to be sad when cute animals are suffering,2023-05-15
i’m glad i found some people i agree with this movie absolutely baffled me and i consider vol 12 the best mcu movies by a lot the tonal whiplash was absolutely insane it was completely over bloated with way too much going on and nothing was balanced well i love the production design and direction but for me it came down to editing and writing like you said way too many jarring instances of tonal confusion with nothing flowing at all did not like this one and that absolutely breaks my heart because i really did go in expecting to love it,2023-05-05

any thoughts as to why gunn decided to end it so bitterly was it an f you to marvel ensuring this franchise can’t come back to life in a fourth movie by a diff director,2023-05-07
"yeah he didnt really give them an opportunity to have them stop him he just did it he wasnt some republic serial villian




the guardians saving everyone on hes ship including choosing not to  more guards past the hallway was the best they could do which was fine by me",2023-05-09
mmm anyone killed off screen doesnt stay dead for very long,2023-05-09
peter quill used a dude as a meat shield earlier in the movie drax might’ve killed the innocent alien on the motorcycle not sure what the writers were thinking with that rocket scene the guardians have never had strong morals when it comes to killing,2023-05-09
might come as a note that this is the first guardians movie gunn wrote without 2 others writers marvel assigned for the first 2 alongside with gunn take that as you will…,2023-05-10
i would’ve had an easier time connecting with the movie if rocket and his friends weren’t the only animals portrayed with some sense of humanity in them the guardians had no problems maiming all of the other experiments and i know it was a  or be killed situation they all came out of the same lab the movie specifically had empathy for the four cute cgi creatures and not for the hundreds of other  cgi creatures even though they all had the same tragic beginnings might sound nitpicky but it’s hard for me to connect with characters who are written solely to produce an emotional response and nothing else,2023-05-10
no i wouldn’t say that this movie was extremely heavyhanded rocket and his friends were animated to look like cute cartoon characters when the rest of the experiments were otherwise portrayed as soulless monstrosities it seemed like they were intentionally designed to get an emotional response from the audience rather than to make sense in the context of the universe no one cares that the guardians probably killed a thousand of the same animals who were abused like rocket because the other ones didn’t have cute cgi eyes and cute voice acting,2023-05-10
that is toxic and while the guardians most certainly did not agree on everything and their bickering in the previous movies is a trademark at this point it was played for laughs it was ways down than this and you could understand why they would like each other at the end of the day here they are yelling constantly being mean all the time and insulting each other no amount of hugs is going to tell me this is normal or expected,2023-05-06
"nothing wrong with a consistent tone throughout each chapter of a trilogy and you can have your conclusion without  all over what made the guardians great in the first place  the silly banter and them messing up it is like a guardians antithesis 

and do not get me started on if you do not like it do not rewatch it",2023-05-07
oh should have i also added to my criticisms my absolute bafflement how his first two movies do not match this one in tone and team dynamics would that have spared me from the downvotes because i did mention it in another thread and there i got downvoted to ,2023-05-05

no that was us as an audience understanding him for the first time,2023-05-07
okay that makes sense i guess i felt adam warlock was not particular well explained what makes him special etc,2023-05-07

that doesn’t explain why he insisted on pmuch forcing new gamora to be more like old gamora because he prefers it that way though he’s allowed to be sad however but i just dont get his “confusion” that they are 2 different people,2023-05-05
the point of the movie is that peter is the greatest villain in the mcu even worse than thanos who at least had a motive for why he turned evil,2023-05-06
is the point to gaslight someone,2023-05-05
and just to be clear i liked almost loved the movie but i can definitely admit when an mcu movie is bad or mediocre this is probably the best mcu movie since ragnarok or infinity war though,2023-05-07
"it wouldnt be rekindling for gamora though the gamora quill knew is dead the gamora thats here has a completely different life experience and she was one of the lead guardians they couldnt just keep her out of the story even if shes not the og gamora

personally i thought their final scene was fine he acknowledges that shes a different person than the gamora he loved and she acknowledges that even though she feels nothing for him that way his relationship with the other gamora was likely genuine and good 

also i was fine with the band breaking up in a sense they werent all saying their goodbyes aside from quill and mantis they all still were living in knowhere nebula as city leader and drax as surrogate father they still see each other all the time presumably and the it basically stated it wasnt goodbye for good just for now",2023-05-07
i think gamora’s presence was more about achieving peace and closure vs an arc  not only for quill and the gang but also for herself he’s moved on she’s moved on… she has a new foundfamily and is finally happy like nebula it put a neat bow on that whole story i mean with a new gamora being alive it was kinda needed now one could argue she should have just stayed dead in the first place but…,2023-05-08
"yes i’m aware but he did this right after their friend almost died that would be the time i’d want to be closer to my friend

i don’t mind them disbanding the timing just felt weird imo",2023-05-05

huh thanos killed her parents and half her people then abducted her then went on to take down half of all living things in the universe then an entire army superheroes from across the universe teamed to fight him some people even time traveled to combat his evil and some even sacrificed themselves to undo what thanos did no way she can see thanos as the lesser evil,2023-05-18
i know its early on in the century but that right there was the bluff of the century wsop commentator 2003,2023-05-14
"not that person but it came off as emotionally manipulative

we know how the rocket backstory is going to end but the movie seems to drag out the abuse over multiple long flashbacks like its metascore depends on if i feel sorry for the cute animals we also have to hate the villain so lets have him scream at everyone constantly so we never forget hes an  compare this to ego who just needed to be smug about putting a cancer in quills mom and hes immediately hateable without trying so hard tryhard really is the best criticism i can think of

what i think makes me hate it is that it shouldve been a slam dunk i dont expect quantumania to be great or love  thunder to blow my mind but i really had high hopes for gotg 3 the sequel to one of my absolute favorite mcu movies",2023-05-08
my problem is that they slowly raise their guns behind his back instead of just shooting him a guy who can do crazy  with his gravity powers because plot,2023-05-10
agreed what they had was pretty adequate but even if they didnt show an entire arc for him but rather just like a quick scene or 2 about him failing to do an experiment or being experimented on and becoming bitter or i dunno just something to show how he became this twisted and  up lol but man he acted his face off literally,2023-05-10
"agree with both of you that the gamora quill thing was really 

this was basically gunn doing a taika lets make this story about me when the true powerful story this romance arc that threads thru five movies gets completely shafted

romantic love is culturally relevant and powerful because its foundation is about two people becoming completely selfless for one another usually at the benefit of everyone around them

making a movie about im the main character now is pure egotism",2023-05-08
yeah i also thought the departures were weird too mantis and nebula just kind ofsuddenly decided they had some place to be contrived weird,2023-05-08
" do we really need a clever twist or character curveball in the end of a trilogy and presumably end of the franchise

well yes and no i just wanted some extra depth to the backstory after the first or second flashback i got the point and figured there was going to be another dimension to this instead we have shallow characters that only serve the purpose of looking cute so they can die and sadden rocket further young rocket himself also doesnt do anything interesting either he has no agency and his one decisive moment is a lastditch effort to save the creatures wholl die anyway its not interesting because he has nothing to lose by at least trying to set lila and his friends free

i know that i cant ask for much agency out of a character who is a literal  and thats why i think it was a fundamental misstep to spend so much time on these misery  flashbacks in the first place felt like a cheap dull way to emotionally charge the story imo

 i can’t think of a movie under that scenario where that’s happened

as an aside how to train your dragon 3 is a good example its a subtle twist but hiccups realization that toothless is happier without him adds depth to the story and does away with your typical happilyeverafter cliches",2023-05-08

like i think he gets what emotions are but doesn’t really understand how normal humans perceive them so it always just feels like this weird jumble… 

laugh cry angry giggle now sob now dance 

i’ve never liked his movies and i think this is what i pick up on… like go watch the new dungeons and dragons movie it has the same vibe as marvel and james gunn but the emotions feel more authentic and thought out so the experience feels more genuine",2023-05-07

maybe thats trope in and of itself",2023-05-06

"yeah i know but at no point in this movie i felt the same as when in the first movie groot papa groot dies protecting his friends also the moments on the second movie when yondu who was even a very unlikable character until then sacrifices himself to save his adoptive son peter and the ravager funeral was a tear jerker 

this 3rd movie was meh  just saying",2023-05-06
"all the flashback scenes were too much almost there were some other sad scenes too but i think without those or to have the flashbacks be a little less sad would have been good 

i agree it was unexpected that it was so emotional",2023-05-06
"thank you for sharing i agree with pretty much everything you said i wouldnt consider myself a huge marvel fan either but i have definitely been invested in the franchise as a whole since it started with iron man i feel like after endgame nothing they have released has been particularly noteworthy aside from doctor strange i felt the same as now when no way home came out and everyone was loving that as well while i felt like i was taking crazy pills for thinking it was just ok

i agree that this movie shines with the smaller and more human moments even the villain did nothing for me and the scene where quill was suffocating in space was exactly the same one from the previous movie in that case he was saved by yondus sacrifice while now he was caught by warlock

they say something can be more than the sum of its parts in the case of this movie i feel like the opposite is true if that makes sense",2023-05-07

same here seemed so out of place in that scene,2023-05-07
oh thats right i think i might remember that i just barely remember the gold people from the second one,2023-05-08
that wasnt a dance sequence  the characters were actually dancing and celebrating in story not the same thing as what they do in kids movies,2023-05-05
hard disagree im mary poppins yall,2023-05-09
i too did not enjoy the second one very much it was the absolute peak of marvel jokes undercutting emotional moments it happened so much i couldnt really get into what was going on,2023-05-09
a lot of people hate age of ultron,2023-05-09
its not like he can just go back to earth and get another zune on ebay,2023-05-14
too many jokes unnecessary jokes rocket’s dying for  sake gave me love and thunder vibes,2023-05-19
yeah im not wasting 14 bucks,2023-05-05
eeaao and marcel the shell all 3 of these movies were watched by myself in a theater which likely has something to do with it because i never went to the theater alone prior to 2021 and never cried during a movie regardless i only shed a tear or two during those movies where vol 3 had me a complete mess,2023-05-05
"ill say is much nicer than earth probably no guns definitely not wars since is recent people were bioengineered to be less aggressive and they didnt have costume superheroes destroying everything every 5 years 

also werent the sovereign already perfect i know he mentioned he focused more on visual aesthetics with them but in guardians 2 they seem pretty nice and intelligent and also spaced faring",2023-05-11
i mean nebula got tortured by being taken apart limb from limb in endgame didnt care about the animal people at all rocket scenes were sad but thats pretty overblown and not as bad as the critics were making it out to be,2023-05-05
its definitely not what she wanted  she wanted to die only as a last resort to stop thanos from getting the mind stone  she absolutely did not want to be sacrificed,2023-05-11
 thanos and his army are very explicitly plucked from 2014 in endgame very shortly before gotg 1 takes place,2023-05-05
i could see them banging but they definitely had a brosis teasing relationship,2023-05-05
what is this i asked if anyone of the chars died,2023-05-05
the humor and plot is way too childish though,2023-05-07
nope theyd walked out,2023-05-07
feel like gunn might have had bigger plans for adam before he was fired and then rehired because he probably would’ve done more mcu movies,2023-05-08
i will say tho it’s kinda odd that gamora could understand after only being around him for like 3 days,2023-05-09
nice thanks for the answer,2023-05-10
maybe im just overly sensitive to it whenever i start to hear expository dialogue like that my eyes glaze over and my ears start ringing like saving private ryan,2023-05-10
yea they only mention in passing the important things from the christmas special,2023-05-11
geez he  your sister howard the duck is great unless youre talking about the  old movie,2023-05-11
yes that’s how i read it too,2023-05-29
if gunn is unable to avoid putting in dickjokes put them in the mouth of the supervillain livewire  it would actually be in character  shes a female howard sterntype radio personality,2023-05-07
good point,2023-05-07
"there wasnt too much explicit but rocket and nebulas connection in this film only truly resonates due to the fact that theyre the only two that survived the snap and implicitly bonded between the events of infinity war and endgame

that and the fact that theyre both cybernetic novelties",2023-05-09
after the fourth fake out ending i was definitely gettin a bit antsy,2023-05-07
it was the marketing that made me think that every trailer presented it as someone was dying even james gun hinted for a significant death which turned out to be lyla it was a misdirect,2023-05-05
amazing,2023-05-05
my understanding is that death in space is technically more a suffocation thing,2023-05-09
i get it but this movie goes to extra lengths to show the characters wearing suits and such while trying to describe you another planet,2023-05-09
thanks,2023-05-10
yea but it feels like an eternity ago,2023-05-11
this  someone mentioned that the team doesnt react to groots final comments  leading me to agree that we were now hearing him just like they were,2023-05-05
gravity boots wouldnt do jack against the extreme gravitational forces that the he was exerting,2023-05-15
oh no they think it’s a feature,2023-05-11
they pulled a star trek vi which avoided an r by turning klingon blood purplepink  lots of yellow blood,2023-05-11
lol its just a joke me and my brother found funny the guy peter quill kills at the end battle looks a lot like ned leeds mcu spiderman’s best friend,2023-05-13
"great movienot perfect glomora just had no need to be in  it i give props for the method acting of drugged skinny criminal ravager there wasnt much there plot wise to work with no arc given to her character or development

nebula was the breakout character for me over the entire saga


however im done with mcu ill watch gotg content and deadpool nothing more",2023-05-07
heres my guess  i wanted to hate it  but i liked it nevertheless i think that the executives at marvel are going down the wrong path regardless  i dont think that they are capable of distinguishing what this film did right from other recent films that   so people who believe as i do are downvoting positivity,2023-05-05
"i guess im used to giant marketing pushes but thats probably because i used to watch more super hero movies 

either way it looks rad i might go tonight if you want to come ill look at showtimes after work",2023-05-05
"i don’t think i could’ve fallen asleep if i tried with something exploding and screaming in my face every ten seconds this was a series where the original climax was a dance off it was funny and unique this was just an  cgi mess like everything else marvel makes now 

and james gunn trying to squeeze in disney channel lessons to the last half hour to try and give the characters rushed closure made it even worse rocket was the only one who got a real actual arc over the full movie like drax is a dad because of his dead daughter a plot line they dropped like seven years ago 

peter’s development could’ve been so interesting here his dead girlfriend coming back and being a different person that’s such a deeply painful idea but it gets sidelined for so much other nonsense",2023-05-11
winter soldier is definitely up there ragnarok was definitely the best thor,2023-05-08
ummm endgame,2023-05-05
i really wish rockets backstory was the start of the movie instead being broken up throughout,2023-05-14
"the issue for me is that rocket is crass and unlikeable throughout each film— and he’s even more awful as it goes on and now all of a sudden we’re supposed to like him and care that he’s on death’s door origin stories always irritate me they’ve hinted and outright explained rocket’s time in labs 

but when nebula said “it’s worse that what my father did to me” i just about walked out she literally has had her body parts removed and replaced and rocket has cybernetic implants but he still has his eyes ha ha animal cruelty is bad but to try and make me care about characters that i know are going to die to serve as the narrative as to why rocket is awful… it’s just so forced and contrived is having your friends killed around you after being experimented on justification to be a crass generally irritating monster who thrives on carnage and destruction",2023-05-13
yeah but you look at phase 13 and 85 was an average marvel movie and both guardians 2 and guardians 1 have a higher rating than 3 and i disagree with that to each their own though,2023-05-05
yeah but you look at phase 13 and 85 was an average marvel movie and both guardians 2 and guardians 1 have a higher rating than 3 and i disagree with that to each their own though,2023-05-05
infinity war endgame gotg3 winter soldier thor ragnarok,2023-05-05
that’s just nuts are they even watching the same movie,2023-05-05
"james gunn discussing the music 

",2023-05-05
yup peter is no longer just living in the past hes slowly moving on in this film so having the music reflect and modernize a bit makes sense,2023-05-10
i too saw it at 3pm on thursday in michigan curious to know what city you saw it in lansing here,2023-05-06
for real he is 100 up front about his plan and narcissism,2023-05-05
yea they threw her off that cliff ,2023-05-05
no that’s what happened after quill shoulda got exploded by the vacuum of space,2023-05-08
"yeah i remember volume 2 being very meandering with poor humour this was definitely better 

1 is the best though that movie is just amazing from top to bottom",2023-05-17
"i liked guardians 1 that was above average  i also liked iron man infinity war thor ragnorak and no way home  the first thor quantumania and the ed norton hulk are the next tier of ones i enjoyed  most of the rest are ok  i just really didn’t like the iron man sequels 

i’d put spiderman 12 with tobey maguire and the first two bale batmans are the best superhero movies of all time  maybe superman 12 in the reeves days  xmen days of future past  wonder woman 1",2023-05-10
how else am i going to stay tapped into the crazy,2023-05-08
it was still going but just lower volume i feared it would be too on the nose if it was higher volume,2023-05-05
thanks,2023-05-05
thank you,2023-05-05
so hes male captain marvel,2023-05-06
remember the alien guard who physically resembled a carrot  i get the impression that was in no way related to an earthcarrot  it simply physically resembled one   it even understood that it resembled one and understood it when people mention the resemblance i figured that rocket assumed that his situation was similar,2023-05-06
thats weird  i responded to the question  so did you  but looking at the thread i didnt respond once but twice  the same post of mine was posted twice in response to this question about rocket racoon  and you responded to the same question and you also have the same post twice in this thread,2023-05-06
gotcha thank you,2023-05-06
nah i found it it’s in the meantime by space hog,2023-05-06
thank so much 3,2023-05-06
isn’t that more of a title,2023-05-07
cool thanks ,2023-05-07
it was censored in the film this is the first time someone’s said it unobstructed,2023-05-06
were not infinity stone scientists so its just a thing,2023-05-09
thats how his story ends so depressing wish gunn had done star lord better ugh,2023-05-08
i mean people in non comic book movies have survived worse without much explanation they deliberately left him alive after drax said  him and rocket refusing to so there is no reason to assume he is dead given how little damage he actually took,2023-05-08
so cool,2023-05-09
he also did a nod to 2001 with the shot of the woman running in the hamster wheel,2023-05-17
agreed this movie definitely brought it and it was great to watch it’s definitely one of the better mcu movies that have come out in the past couple of years,2023-05-15
honestly the face wasn’t that bad it looked a lot like red skull,2023-05-22
not completely could have had starlord find his power,2023-05-29
thanks joshannalls  was not sure on black panther and did not rem love thunder afterlife scene,2023-05-22
it was so nice to see the little moments between nebula and rocket the two of them spent 5 years with each other after all of their friends and family died they clearly became close during their 5 years as avengers both guardians 3 and the holiday special do a great job at showcasing that,2023-05-06
it was pretty cool to see nebula get a fleshed out arc although iirc gunn has said for awhile that the third movie would wrap up her arc so not too surprising,2023-05-07
well as lylla said rocket is the main character,2023-05-07
nebula really did have the most character growth,2023-05-07
karen was killing it even before that,2023-05-08
shes been killing it since before then seriously gotg2 nebula was fantastic and got really overlooked,2023-05-08
when she reformed and made that blade i was like ok this chap is  lol,2023-05-08
nebula also learned from her time with tony she gave herself an iron man cannon and a jet harness,2023-05-09
great in jumanji too,2023-05-07
i told my wife before the movie id like a stand alone rocket movie welp,2023-05-07
"been following her since amy pond in doctor who shes basically unrecognizable in this and not just because of makeup her acting makes all the difference

nebula is also almost the polar opposite of amy",2023-05-08
i absolutely loved that opening scene where tony is spending his seemingly last moments with nebula and shes taking care of him very sweet and im glad they gave gillan some interesting emotions to portray throughout her role great character that wouldnt have been all that memorable without her,2023-05-13
nebula seraph mode she used vs adam reminded me a lot of ironman,2023-05-12
nebula and mantis were awesome in this,2023-05-10
i also thought it was a real return to form for chris pratt who i havent enjoyed in anything outside of star lord since parks and rec it was always the best role for him since he gets to be a tough guy and also a wise ,2023-07-13
i really like how drax and mantis have such a good friendship and it’s never hinted at being anything more it’s kinda wholesome,2023-07-13
" can we talk about nebula becoming a leader and owning this movie

also the her final shot of her throwing her arms into the sky with a huge smile and screaming with joy

her 5movie arc was wonderful",2023-09-12
honestly i felt like nebulas ending didnt suit her at all,2023-05-08
mantis as well,2023-05-20
nebulatony stark dynamic was that in endgame,2023-06-13
he definitely has the most literal character growth anyway,2023-05-08
"of course there was

the guy has been studying english for like 125 lifetimes at this point and finally spoke a complete sentence",2023-05-09
i felt he was really the heart of the first two films… when he’s telling mantis about his daughter in the 2nd one and she touches him to feel what he’s feeling… and she just breaks into tears  you james gunn,2023-05-08
"itd would feel that way for me if it wasnt for the growth they had as a community theyre able to talk things openly without feeling cheesy or something

the camera angling and some dialogue choice didnt help though",2023-06-19
"i dunno about that we as an audience saw him get plucked out as a baby raccoon but his brain wasnt altered yet for him to have memory of that early time 

so its him learning what he actually is and where he came from for the first time he was aware of the regular animals being used but clearly never saw his own species cage or connected the dots to what he was despite being intelligent enough to its part of the situation he looked away from til that moment hence actually accepting the raccoon moniker once he sees its actually what he came from

its kind of a big character moment for him every movie rocket expands who he cares about from 1 person old groot to a group of people the guardians  to higher life forms after the time in endgame to living things in general not like hes totally softened hes still not hesitating to shoot anything if they try to come at him or his friends",2023-05-08
"pretty sure it’s going to be the last 


last gunn one at least",2023-06-13
my eyes were rolling for 90 of the writing for this movie  compared to something directed by satoshi kon or makoto shinkai this movie was for kindergarten brain children,2023-05-14
the  gravity boots my  rocket is a true champ,2023-05-08
 i was so tense because i thought they were going to pull a fakeout survival and have rocket ultimately die killing his abuser as his last unfinished business…until one of my favorite moments in the mcu  a group of heroes actually beating the villain up at the same time instead of going one by one and getting wrekt also emphasized how the guardians is and always will be family,2023-05-17
i would have given everything to save floor i have a pet rabbit and i barely kept it together in the theater i despise animal testing so much,2023-05-17
the dr moreau effect lots of moreau in the high evolutionarys character,2023-08-05
yeah seriously what did she think was gonna happen,2023-05-12
she kinda did it instinctively and had no idea what to do afterwards she was very scared to do anything at all,2023-05-17
im not sure if she was a scientistbm but i know she was a recorderror recorder vim like the one peter killed by smahing on the ground was recorder theel,2023-08-28
the saliva sticking to his mouth as hes yelling just feels so visceral like its legitimately good acting there especially when you realize hes literally doing this with a placeholder in front of him and theres no actual raccoon on the table,2023-05-21
didnt mind made more sense than thanos plan in a way his motivation to get rocket made sense his own side creation something that was meant to be nothing something he wanted to discard turned out to be smarter and better than him and beat him or course it would be personal of course it would become obsession for him its completely understandable its not ego ego was ego he is fueled by jealousy and obsession with perfection to him getting rocket is him winning against rocket and proving he was smarter than him all along,2023-05-07
" my big issue with his motivation is that it made him feel like discount thanos

people do bad things because they want to savehelp the world is far from being a thanosspecific trope the road to  is paved with good intentions isnt a saying for nothing",2023-05-08
how could  influenced by thanos when he was building counter earth before thano enacted his plan,2023-05-08
he was so much better than thanos,2023-07-10
"yes hes pretty much a narcissist any achievements by his creations are due to him any problems are because they are unfinished experiments 

its why he was so angry about rocket solving the problem he couldnt fix",2023-05-10
yeah i didnt like thor 4 or ant man 3 but gotg is definitely solid  maybe the mcu is just popular to hate on atm,2023-05-08
his are pretty sinister though like they dont often come across as jokey so much as just creepy like normans on sabbatical honey is objectively awesomefunny but its also creepy as ,2023-05-09
if they want everyone to forget the current movie version they should just insist that his name is pronounced koong,2023-05-07
"he implied that he gave himself upgrades after the rocket incident

i don’t why he is given so much authority i just assumed it was his genius",2023-05-09
he made his own staff and then killed and replaced them when he got better ones,2023-05-09
he’s a gravity machine that can instantly  people and he’s rich also his experiments have a  switch that he can trigger when he wants it’s hard to rebel really,2023-05-11
he isnt powerful just smart and rich,2023-05-10
i mean he blew up a planet and killed billions doing so the stakes were high,2023-05-17
"pff the celestials are hardly gods though especially once you start getting to the really crazy marvel cosmic stuff they are low on that totem pole 

in short there is only one capitalg  known as theoneaboveall above the one above all and hesheit appears to the fantastic four as jack kirby so the high evolutionary is a big dumby but we knew that already",2023-06-19
"exactly the man was not exactly stable and sane

people seem to forget that something being illogical is not the same as it being bad writing",2023-06-10
but why why is he doing it what made him to do this sorry because he wants to is just lazy writing,2023-05-25
oh now im interested,2023-05-08
actually makes it pretty  up how he is all youre not a ravager as if its ok for him to find a place with the ravagers but she cant,2023-05-08
thats the feel i got from it too  still one of my favorite lines in gotg2 as well  he may have been your father boybut he wasnt your daddy,2023-08-21
"i think thats the rule
pg13 allow 1 f bomb",2023-05-09
"im pretty sure they had a second fbomb in one of the songs

no sleep till brooklyn i think",2023-05-16
yes thats the point  shes happy that he accepted her for being a different person and isnt trying to make her his gamora anymore  they can now both move on,2023-05-16
the stars the moon theyve all been blown out you left me in the dark are too morbid lyrics for the feel good melancholy ending they were going for though,2023-05-22
really no hopefully shell be back these actors do this alot,2023-05-09
if theres a movie i really want to avoid spoiler for like endgame ill plug my ears and hum when a trailer comes on idc how i look haha,2023-05-08
" problem is theyre unavoidable in the theater unless youre just the right amount of late

i remember a time not that long ago when the movie started right at the listed time if you wanted to see trailers you went early which you often wanted to do since 1 it was the only way to see them before the internet and 2 if its opening weekend you could bag a good seat 

now i get to the theater 5 minutes after the advertised movie time on my ticket and i still need to watch some behind the scenes video regular commercials that have nothing to do with movies then 20 minutes of trailers ive already watched on youtube no wonder people dont want to waste all day going to the theater anymore",2023-05-15
i put in my ear buds and close my eyes like a crazy nerd,2023-05-10
yep was watching the trailer for the new spider verse film and it gave away too much couldnt look away or not listen,2023-05-07
the dune trailer came on before no time to die and i kept my eyes closed and covered my ears  my wife and son think im nuts,2023-05-11
listen to music on earbuds and read articles on your phone no different from being on the bus,2023-05-22
the the was such a nice surprise love that song made me think of the ending of empire records also loved hearing the mowglis san francisco used to be my jam back in the day,2023-05-14
yeah the the is the best,2023-05-14
"it does leave open the possibility of a relationship though my guess is gunn didnt want to set anything in stone since he isnt going to be making these movies going forward

you could easily write a story with gamora as peters love interest you could also easily write one with nebula because as awkward as that scene was it did open a door that a writer could explore especially given nebulas character arc has been all about her learning to trust people and allowing herself to feel emotions

but you could also just ignore both of those possibilities and write it off as new gamora not being interested and that nebula scene being an awkward one time conversation the ambiguity of it all was really well done",2023-05-08
but this isnt a twin sister its verbatum yourself a few years of different experiances but same bio make up and obviously pre dispositions physically and romantically yes you do need those organic moments but when they fell ontop of eachother before the ending action scene that was more than aknowledgment that was attraction to me,2023-05-16
or just a windbag,2023-05-08
i physically recoiled on that second one,2023-05-10
adam snapped it his powers might be greater than gravityher own weight,2023-05-13
it makes me happy that rocket gave his bestie some upgrades too her new arm is real cool,2023-05-21
that was the first thing that came to my mind too lol,2023-05-08
more like the tx from number 3,2023-05-08
nope those things on her head are legs,2023-05-12
hes the only one of you who doesnt hate himself cut deep,2023-05-15
great metajoke too considering her powers,2023-05-12
isnt she like one of most powerful characters one touch and she can do to you whatever she wants,2023-10-07
i took it as a bit of both hes always had this air of pity around her and thinks shes helpless and  and all that but i think as shown he also just likes protecting people because he likes that being his purpose,2023-05-08
i think it was his dad like nature,2023-05-15
"she always kinda was op 

she put ego a celestial to sleep in vol 2 she also put thanos to sleep in iw 

she also did use her ability quite a bit in the christmas special",2023-05-11
yeah she actually has huge potential with that power but she has not developed much independence and autonomy to use it to the full potential being with guardians has trained her to slowly utilize her power for a more powerful impact such as attack or subdue instead of just peaceful sleep or healing,2023-05-19
i was hoping the guard that let them through the gate was going to be shown walking up with a big gun and then turn and fight the other guards because they were hurting drax,2023-05-08
bakalova brought some really charming energy to cosmo,2023-05-06
cosmo sounds exactly how i imagined my dog would sound if he could talk,2023-05-06
ive got and have had other pet rabbits in the past and i feel like they did a good job with floors personality as well,2023-05-08
dug from up has the same energy squirrel,2023-05-06
"speaking of cosmos lines what the  does she say at the end postcredits scene is her favorite musical artist

fsdfsf does not have a single bad song

what does she say i have rewatched the movie just for this line and i cant make it out",2023-06-22
plus he came through a portal in endgame ,2023-05-15
rip polkadot man,2023-05-08
wasnt she in the first post credit scene as well,2023-05-08
is howard much of a fighter even in his own material i don’t think anything was lost in this appearance they’ve even fleshed out knowhere to the point that i could see a d detective story with him if they really wanted to,2023-05-07
unfortunately it’s a reference to laika a real life dog who got sent to space in the 50’s,2023-05-08
that is his origin in the comics as well,2023-05-09
howard had had enough ,2023-05-10
but i liked how he kept it going just to tease her,2023-05-15
i have a pet bunny victor whos my best friend i had a really hard time holding it and i get teary eyed even now poor little floor i just wanted to protect her ,2023-05-17
kinda felt like a gore nest from doom when you think about it,2023-05-08
of course it was gross thats why you felt bad for the animals like ,2023-05-09
pov youre a colonoscopy scope,2023-05-29
my wife just kept muttering oh gross so gross oh gross that whole scene haha,2023-05-21
your what,2023-05-07
i have no mouth and i must cry,2023-05-09
 i can only remember crying once in a dream but i think it was like this too,2023-05-07
late comment but last night i dreamt about my dreams being ripped away from me and wailed like a baby the film just finished in the cinema and i relate to this comment,2023-05-20
dude i saw this movie last night and when i woke up this morning the first thing i thought of was those  animals it  me up for sure,2023-05-10
i fought so hard to hold tears in as soon as i was alone they just flowed out it was so sad ,2023-05-30
several times,2023-10-03
yeah,2023-05-07
"it really was 

were used to a lot of death in marvel but not torture and its aftermath",2023-05-09
yeah more than ever we need a no animals were harmed in the making of this production that shouldve been in giant bold letters right as the credits started and then again as they ended,2023-07-15
when they threw rocket back in the cage and he was trembling and scared right before he met his friends—i had to look away from the screen i feel so dramatic about it but i feel emotionally traumatized from the animal flashback scenes i just felt like sobbing the whole movie,2023-05-09
yeah it was otherwise alright,2023-05-08
my wife loved it but yea she was pretty much just borderline tears the entire film,2023-05-08
yeah it got me  up especially because the animals were clearly like children i wonder if gunn went too far,2023-05-13
i just wrote my thoughts down below but i get what you’re saying because i felt the exact same way haha i was still crying on the drive home well after the movie was over,2023-05-08
so glad i watched it at home lol,2023-08-04
obviously not to that extent but yeah,2023-06-19
i also don’t know that floor had the same level of smarts as the other she was the drax of the group but no less lovable she deserved better,2023-05-07
"why do people keep saying its a panic attack like i think floor was smart enough to realize they were  or just normal panicking

edit based off the definition i really dont think its a panic attack

panic attack
sudden episode of intense fear or anxiety and physical symptoms based on a perceived threat rather than imminent danger

my experience of them matches the definition

2nd edit rocket also just mentioned the high evolutionary was also going to  them so it seems like an appropriate time to freak out",2023-05-05
i thought she was smarter than teefs,2023-05-10
ugh terrible,2023-05-16
well no because while i love chatgpt it will mostly write what the mainstream thinks and i wrote from my anticapitalistpuritanamerican position,2023-05-08
yea while i had fun the last few marvel outings have felt like set up this was fully baked and satisfying,2023-05-10

ive been burned before but man im so excited for his take on superman i heard hes also going to have the extended batfamily in his batman movies and by how he handled the teamwork and comraderie in tss and gotg its going to be great,2023-05-22

"vision came back to life 

black widow isnt dead we see her as her soul lives on

jane foster exists in valhalla

tony stark is the only one dead",2023-05-18
"out of 32 movies and 9 shows quicksilver was a bad guy in that same movie and just turned to the other aunt may dies in every spiderman series thats like saying bruce waynes parents die in every batman origin story 

black widow isnt really dead she comes back to life in a spirit realm 

this means the only one is maria hill and that was done poorly",2023-08-05
true,2023-05-16
this might sound  but if thats how that works why didnt the high evolutionary use it man just slapped his face with a rubber mask  when they clearly have the technology to restore any injury,2023-05-05
and she was dancing with everyone else face completely fine,2023-05-06
right but yeah it was weird monkeys are wild animals not your friends,2023-05-07
the med pack won’t fix the trauma,2023-05-06
his wife is pretty good at acting like shes been shot in the leg,2023-05-06
lol thats amazing so unexpected i loved it,2023-05-06
she was great too i loved the bit of a really competent security person not falling for the classic close calls wehn she stepped up to gamora i totally thought oh no theyre  shes actually good at her job luckily gamora is unhinged lol,2023-05-24
i thought that was her,2023-05-09
that guy does not move an inch after coming off his bike he was definitely dead,2023-05-06
i disagree the whole point is that they are test subjects for the high evolutionary they don’t have a culture it was literally sculpted to imitate that of earth’s,2023-05-08
"i cared about counter earth because 

1 its literally just earth but they have animal heads you sympathise because its your own planet and culture really 

2 theyre all victims of the high evolutionary",2023-05-17
we spent a pretty good time on counter earth and their inhabitants,2023-06-25
my dude thinks the famous dog detectives name is scrappy doo and somehow i believe thats the biggest crime here,2023-05-19
oh yeah i meant to imply we didn’t know if that monkey was sentient i assume it was not but with them making the disfigurement of our main villain by scratching his punishment kinda felt off to have a woman helping save all the kids and animals get attacked in a similar way,2023-05-05
same i was totally expecting the high evolutionary to just tank the guardians asskicking efforts and have them and rocket beat down and nearly dead only for adam warlock to come screaming in and wreck his  for killing ayesha,2023-08-05
hes just listing his notes they arent all positive,2023-05-17
rocket’s wail was haunting it felt incredibly real,2023-08-07
i hear this but i was so happy to hear spacehog also thought dog days are over was pretty memorable i mostly agree that it was less impactful than 1 and 2 though,2023-05-10
yeah i loved the movie but i think every single song was out of place it was so weird to have this super tense and emotional moment and cut right after to a pop song,2023-05-08
i mean im not very technical at all with this stuff i just really enjoy fun songs in fun movies so im glad im not the only one to notice this rough editingsong selection,2023-05-08
perfectly fitting for scary movie 2 though,2023-06-20
oo that makes sense we never saw anything happening just explosion then the three show up later in the hanger,2023-05-09
wait which animals are they talking about,2023-05-14
"despite feeling death was around the corner they still didnt  anyone

fabulous directing",2023-07-16
i think the common misconception here comes from how little time the story spends exploring what rapidly evolving ant societies look likeare capable of the plot and action is so fast paced theres little time to slow down and reflect on certain details so the ant civilization feels like a deus ex machina,2023-11-12
i have no idea if that’s true not but that has nothing to do wit the character,2023-05-29
definitely not caddyshack 1980 the aristocats 1970 hard days night 1964 the pajama game 1957 and arguably pinnochio 1940 were all before that,2023-05-20
i dont think id ever be emotionally prepared for that lol,2023-05-07
 my  up with a happy ending,2023-05-05
its a very meatloaf ending  two out of three aint bad,2023-05-06
okay yeah ive decided i dont need to read it,2023-05-17
i really liked the character in the film but it did feel like a missed opportunity james gunn said that adam was the hardest thing to work into the movie because he had to include him after the set up in both 1 and 2 but there was no real place for him in the story he basically just had to cram him in,2023-05-17
" adam warlock as mediocre comic relief is so strange

between america chavez and adam warlocks insulting flanderization and the increasingly rudderless direction of not only the franchise overall but the individual movies as well im done with the mcu",2023-05-15
"im lookin around and not seeing grant listed in any credits at all probably because its not an official use of their work or characters its just heavily inspired by it james gunn has mentioned a few times wanting to adapt we3 and i guess this was his moment to get as close to doing so as he felt he could

also small correction morrison came out as nonbinary a few years ago and goes by theythem",2023-05-17
sadly many people suffer this very fate with the “who will your parents be” lottery,2023-05-07
so what millions of animals endure every day,2023-05-11
welcome to being a bred animal its just a miserable existence,2023-05-08
this is the reality of most humans,2023-05-07
how  it must have been that even nebula who was like thanos personal silly putty to come out and say what they did to rocket was worse than what she went through,2023-07-11
what is my purpose,2023-05-21
well hope your vegan then if u mean that…,2023-06-10
when he saves peter at the end it’s basically recreating the creation of adam in the shot kind of clever,2023-05-06
seeing as the he always needed rocket to solve problems he got stuck on my guess is in the next movie rocket will fix whatever is wrongoff with adam and unlock his full power,2023-05-06
the sequence of him going to save his mother was heart wrenching i kind of wish they had him fume with those emotions a bit longer after she died i liked how despite how  like he was he couldn’t save his mother,2023-05-07
i didnt expect them to make him as child like or weak as he was shown compared to the comics but i think it had to be that way to have him join the group at the end at the very least he was a member at one point in the comics,2023-05-10
i love how awkward adam was he was like a pompous vision,2023-05-14
i never read the comics and thought he was homelander at first,2023-05-25
when he tried to fight groot and then passed out at that point i was worried he would just be some lowlevel plot device anytime they needed to add to the conflict but then two scenes later he made sense to me,2023-05-13
i happy too,2023-05-28
tbf adam warlock was literally just born and is technically a baby,2023-05-06
the first thing he actually said in the film was along the lines of “you can’t escape me squirrel”,2023-05-05
k8nda reminds me of shazam,2023-07-28
i think he also knew there was no redeeming or reasoning with these creatures built for battle,2023-05-06
"not only did she die her death seemed to have no real impact on adam i think she was there solely to remind people that the sovereign were even a thing in vol 2

which highlights another issue for me the high evolutionary is ranting and raving about how none of his creations are capable of invention or original thought but the sovereign created adam who is superior to all of their kind

and i guess they could be trying to go with the angle of the high evolutionary created him but that doesnt really gel with the high evolutionarys insistence on personally overseeing the development of his creations",2023-05-07
even getting pulled from the cocoon early hes supposed to be a perfect being  the rest of his people arent really that physically impressive,2023-05-07
that and when later he’s talking to lyla in heaven or whatever about flying and he ask “can i come” ,2023-05-07
those guards that met them at the pyramid were straight up jim henson nightmare fuel i loved it,2023-06-06
you sonuva… ,2023-05-07
takes there aint no thing like me but me and turns it on his head  yes he is unique for his intelligence and abilities but hes still part of a group several in fact hes not alone,2023-05-05
to me it seemed pretty clear that seeing the baby racoons and then the sign was meant for him to finally accept that he was a raccoon he had flashbacks to his baby days maybe when he woke up it wasnt all there but he probably figured he wasnt the only one of his kind then he sees them again looks at the sign and realized he was a raccoon and that there was nothing wrong with being a part of something the same way he had to realize that he wasnt alone anymore at the end of part 2,2023-05-08
yeah  hes way too smart not to know that he used to be a raccoon he just didnt consider himself one now im one of a kind until seeing babies in a cage like he had been,2023-05-10
he did live on earth with the avengers for 5 years so he definitely found out what they were,2023-05-10
yea this makes way more sense than the interpretation some others have on here where he just didn’t realize he was a raccoon until he saw the sign lol,2023-05-26
yes especially since the moment that brings him back was when he tells lyla im not a raccoon,2024-02-16
"they didnt spend 5 years on earth consecutively presumably those 5 years rocket and nebula were the only guardians and were travelling around the galaxy helping civilisations deal with the fallout from thanos like captain marvel did its not known how much time they spent on earth or even their need for a car or to drive places considering they had the guardians ship 
considering though how both are basically cybernetically enhanced and have genius level intellect i dont doubt theyd know how drive something so primative as a car",2023-05-06
"nebula did offer to drive but quill refused 

im guessing with rocket he knew what a raccoon was but didnt consider himself one due to previous trauma when he opened the cage and saw raccoon written on it he decided to embrace it to overcome his trauma",2023-05-06
"nebula offered to drive lol

and that car they drove was old had the old school push button on earth they probably had a bunch of audis courtesy of tony",2023-05-08
that’s one thing i’m dying to see those dynamics must of been really unique  i feel nebula and rhodes got along really well i was surprised she left so easy and rocket had to have made some bonds  i just really wanna see those five years tbh,2023-05-08
to be fair quill has 8 years on earth vs nebulas 5,2023-05-16
more than that when he first met with marvel to discuss potentially doing guardians he said he didn’t know what to do with it until as he was leaving that initial meeting with feige he started thinking about rocket all the way home and then started forming a pitch from there it was all borne from that spark of inspiration with rocket,2023-05-14
eh in this case letting him suffer in the wake of his own evil is just as good revenge imo prolongs the agony for him,2023-05-14
short version rocket saw his old friends everything was peaceful and all were happy to be finally free wo pain and together then he asked if he can come  stay something like this lylla touched him and sayed not yet and that was the moment when somebody was cutting onions ,2023-05-10
and what is your evidence for that besides the sign for the animals at the end of the movie he couldn’t have gotten animals from literally any other planet over the course of decades,2023-05-14
as opposed to the cute ones we got in antman and the wasp,2023-05-06
played by pete davidson per the credits,2023-05-07
i agree this was a very powerful scene in my eyes everyone feels bad for the cute characters just like no one really recognized how tragic rockets story was until young rocket popped up on screen this was a brilliant addition by james to give voice to whoever gets overlooked on a day to day basis,2023-05-08
what do you mean by interval,2023-05-07
what interval,2023-05-07
was it a super short intermission or a long line for the bathroom or does the intermissioninterval actually cut out content,2023-05-09
rocket teefs floor go now ,2023-05-17
im not insecure about my height its good enough i just think hers is hot what does my thoughts on myself have to do with anything,2023-11-27
ego has an entire underground cavern of his children’s skeletons,2023-05-05
and all the guardians arę extremely brutal that whole corridor right scene was really graphic and even earlier they killed lot of guys with cold blood,2023-05-06
"rohan would do no such thing rohan answered when gondor called

",2023-05-07
tbh the guardians are far from the most lighthearted in the mcu gunn’s comedy is definitely the best but the emotional and darker moments in the trilogy hit so much harder than the rest of the mcu,2023-05-09
ronan,2023-05-07
james gunn knows how to do villains even suicide squad ended up having the star   up,2023-05-18
" rohan wiped out the nova corps

unfortunately star ships are no match for cavalry",2023-06-04
excuse me ego just wanted to spread his free love all over the universe,2023-05-11
ronan lol not rohan thats something else,2023-05-14
not even close kang was wiping entire universes wanda was killing anyone and everyone in different universes to get her babies back and remember thanos,2023-05-28
the guardians movies have the most cries of all the marvel movies i wasn’t super sad when groot ate it in the first movie but yondu was a tear jerker and vol 3 had me tearing up a few times,2023-06-04
"high evolutionary… enough said

he  bunny ffs evilest and vilest mf there is thanos would never",2023-08-17
yeah doctor strange 2 felt like they knew what things were scary but failed to turn those scary things into horror meanwhile james gunn leaned as hard as he could into horror for gotg3,2023-05-12
right the lesserknown underground band radiohead,2023-10-08
yeah the turtle and the pig teaming up as evil animals really made it feel like a wink at tmnt i doubt it was wholly unintentional,2023-05-06
the robots are always getting violently dismembered and generally  up it just doesnt register because you know robots if you were to replace them with people or even just made them look more human it might be pretty rough for kids for example optimus literally rips a decepticons face off in the first movie,2023-05-13
same lol honestly as soon as i saw rocket jump on the high evolutionarys face and heard tearing noises i closed my eyes and looked away,2024-04-01
the voice is probably synthesized to some degree ig,2023-07-13
it made me think that and the creature from the thing,2023-05-08
that’s what i was thinking when i saw floor,2023-05-14
im hoping that since gunn seems to prefer deep cuts that well finally get something other than lex or zod as the antagonist i would love to see brainiac kick off the dcu for example,2023-05-08
red skull has well a red skull for a face on the other hand what he had was clearly all muscle tissue,2023-05-08
"what about all the swelling does that just go away

i dont knowmaybe",2023-05-05
to be fair hes 50 celestial they could get away with handwaving far worse injuries if they wanted to,2023-05-06
"i mean realistically people dont freeze like that in space you would suffocate long before you froze to death in space because its a vacuum 

also why groots roots would not have frozen like that theres no medium to transfer the temperature so you just radiate heat until you die its not like being in water or encased in ice",2023-05-07
i accepted that it was the fact that he is halfgod that negated all of that,2023-05-12
the russians and nasa did quite a lot of experiments on this and if i recall correctly human should be able to survive about a minute or so in the vacuum of space and still be able to recover fully from it some of the biggest risks are lungs expanding if you dont exhale the air you have in them if you have open wounds then blood will boil due to lack of pressure which can lead to cardiac arrest and obvious lack of oxygen the cold is less of an issue since theres very little heat transfer in a vacuum youll may get surface frostbite due to sweat boiling causing evaporative cooling but that wont turn you into a block of ice as you see in the movies,2023-05-13
"i mean space doesnt actually do that its vacuum theres nothing for the heat to transfer to the big problem in space is actually overheating and the ice on his face would actually be any and all moisture rapidly boiling off survivors of vacuum chamber accidents report their last sensation being the saliva on their tongue flash boiling as they lost consciousness

the swelling is fairly accurate though in accidental exposure to vacuum and near vacuum conditions the exposed body parts became absolutely engorged with fluids since there was no longer atmospheric pressure to contend with i dont think it would have happened in seconds like that though and id be way more worried about his lungs filling with fluid",2023-05-23
it was pretty funny though so its okay,2023-05-15
just put 2 and 2 together and that the roles of adam and the star lord were reversed heh,2023-07-10
correct me if im wrong but gunn said a few times he didnt like the decisions in those i think so maybe he just ignored it lol,2023-05-06
oh,2023-05-08
im guessing that gunn didnt know they were going to bring the helmet back so he just decided to ignore it and go with his plan,2023-05-05
i cried in all rockets flashbacks,2023-05-08
hes  good his suicide squad was like this too how did he manage to make me care so much for king shark and rat catcher and polka dot man etc im pretty excited to see what he does with the dcu,2023-05-12
that scene teared me apart i had to look away from the screen to not go full on sobbing and make sounds in the theater lol,2023-05-17
"thats really it theres real stakes since none of them are practically invincible 

plus this was a self contained story not a ultra villain save the universe story",2023-05-06
if any marvel character would connect the two it’s deadpool,2023-05-26
honestly they need to leave them separate we need films that aren’t connected to this major universe thing,2023-05-30
quicksilver does show up in  wandavision ,2023-06-26
maybe i misheardbut when he hugs his friend while in heaven,2023-05-14
ah yes thanks for demonstrating what true civility should look like ,2023-05-13
"guardians of the galaxy vol 3 has been branded the ‘best animal rights film of the year’ for its depiction of animal testing

",2023-05-28
i was dreading that rocket would be the only one to really want to escape like hed be at the threshold and begging his friends to follow but they wouldnt be convinced they were in danger and theyd keep the faith in their master that theyd go to a better place only to be killed forcing rocket to go alone,2023-05-17
they were super well done and i respect it but  those scenes made me not like the movie i am glad i saw it but i don’t want to watch it again too horrible,2023-05-10
i cried like a  baby humans are one thing but animals are just innocent,2023-11-15
the interesting thing is that we basically know that there is an afterlife in the mcu and now rocket really knows that his first friends are in a better place and that they still think of him and are waiting for him,2023-05-07
the darkest mcu movies is correct i didnt expect torture nor  in a pg13 rating,2023-05-07
i felt the its just rote learning not capable of an original creative thought line was a little double edged,2023-05-07
" yeah i didnt expect that guardians of the galaxy

i dont see why you wouldnt gotg movies have always had some of the strongest themes in the mcu its not their fault disney only took the quippy comedy aspect to their other movies and not the heart and themes gunn put into these movies",2023-05-10
honestly i feel the whole humor thing is overblown the first movie is about an intergalactic terrorist attempt to commit genocide and the second movie literally had a cavern full of children skeletons,2023-05-25
it is the first step to the right direction honestly the sad moments and desperation is relatable that’s was make infinite way and end game so good,2023-05-28
rocket teefs floor go now they couldnt have gone anywhere anyway but she was so scared she wanted to go  man  you james gunn for making me wanna cry,2023-05-10
came here for this scene discussion rockets scream just destroyed me i thought was going to straight into anger like immediately but that loud cry just sunk me bradley cooper did such a wonderful job,2023-05-11
" felt like a panic attack

this so much this i struggled so much in that scene",2023-05-07
i cried four times im not judging anyone,2023-05-07
ugh these  fratboywannabe young teenager dudes just kept laughing throughout the whole backstory of rocket awful experience,2023-05-12
i couldn’t wait to get home to hug my dog after this movie,2023-05-05
okay i was experiencing the same feeling i called my mom after to talk about it  that movie hit me in the feels,2023-05-06
dude that’s how i was too we raced home and called our pup downstairs so we could all cuddle on the floor for a while,2023-05-06
waited for the movie to end jumped on my bike and peddled back home ran up the stairs to my apartment and ran to find my cat that entire segment killed me especially the crying cat happening in the background,2023-05-24
i just wanted to hold my bunny ,2023-05-17
"it pays to be cute rockets story since the first gotg has been tragic even if not fully embraced until now but i have felt for his character since the beginning on a very deep level 

seeing it on screen made it so hard to watch his first word being hurts with seeing his face broke me the world needs to see heart breaking moments like that because most dont realize how cruel they are to otherwise innocent creatures 

james gunn put a lot of realistic moments in this movie of being on the receiving end of a cruel world and i know it wont change the ones who cause such pain because they cant relate all i can say is it gave peace to someone who has lived so many of those moments and had to numb themselves to it because there has been no escape ever",2023-05-08
thank you i cannot stand this i need to qualify just how unusual it is for a man to show emotion disclaimer  as if its an alien concept to us or something even more bizarre when they feel the need to add in things like their height and their beard to these disclaimers as if its even weirder for such people to have emotions  ,2023-05-15
have you ever considered qualifying it in today’s society is actually helpful as other readers similar to him get exposed to the idea that it is alright to cry,2023-05-25
i just saw it i too started crying as soon as i saw those baby raccoons and subsequently sobbed for the whole film  just come home and hugged my cat still tearful,2023-05-08
"ya it has me sick to my stomach days later i keep thinking about them saying how great it was to have friends and how they were gonna go off into the sky like holy  all i was hoping the whole time was for them to survive

i’m going to wake up months from now and just feel bad about it",2023-05-08
gotg2 really set this up hard by passing the emotional torch to rocket ive heard some complaints that hes the focus of the movie but it was definitely his story to be told at the end of the previous one i was really surprised by how emotional i felt in that opening scene as well,2023-05-10
just saw the movie tonight and same  ,2023-12-28
i was crying about this last night then in this morning shower i started thinking about it and it made me start crying again thats a powerful scene and im not really a crier but man that one got me bad,2023-05-05
if you dont you have no heart,2023-05-06
"bradley cooper doing that scream as rocket was heart wrenching absolutely incredible performance from him 

i would have cried my eyes out if i was home alone i couldnt stop one of my eyes leaking even trying to hold it in",2023-05-06
i started drinking through my straw really slowly just to muffle any noises that might come lol,2023-05-06
"partner and i both feel emotionally overwhelmed by the movie we went out into the city trying to get home and i was not in the mood to deal with people on a commute while processing the movie 

i havent cried over many mcu films but james gunn has the top two spots with vol 3s rocket teefs floor go now and vol 2s he may have been your father but he wasnt your daddy promptly followed by yondu dying 

no way home had me crying good too over may and the realization that peter is entirely alone in the world but i wasnt heaving the way i was today over the reveal that this is probably the final time well see a guardians of the galaxy movie some will pop up in other films but well never get this crew again and thats hard to take gunn went 3 for 3 and nailed the landing every time",2023-05-06
idk if i even made it to the 5 minute mark before the tears started i don’t think i made it through a single flashback without crying,2023-05-05
same here my dog is on my lap cuddling and i’m still sobbing the movies been over for two hours now there were many points during the movie i thought about getting up and leaving,2023-05-06
its the next day and im still tearing up and crying,2023-05-08
im in the same exact boat as you  i had to walk out of the new avatar movie so i dont think ill be able to watch this movie,2023-05-06
i dont think anything will ever tear my guts up the same way jurassic bark did i refuse to ever rewatch that episode but yeah gotg 3 was definitely hard to watch at times too ,2023-05-06
also look up crueltyfreekittycom when you shop for personnal hygene products and go watch okja on netflix,2023-05-17
all the flashback scenes basically did me in and i wasnt expecting it,2023-05-13
you mean like going on a thread where people are being honest about their emotions and making fun of them oh wait… that’s emotional insecurity my bad completely different,2023-05-05
same that scene was tough to get through never really felt that way for any other mcu film,2023-05-06
they had the biggest death signs ever above their heads and the only thing they ever talked about was how great it was to have friends the fact that they were all cgi helped as wellit created some distance,2023-05-12

yeah thats incredibly extreme sure my 15 year old was crying through 80 of the movie but she loved it as much as i who was also crying more than ive ever cried during a movie in my life,2023-05-06

i enjoyed the characters in iweg more than i did in gotg2  gotg2 tried way too hard and most of the jokes didnt land for me tazer face and drax laughing and it just didnt do it for me like the first movie,2023-05-06
i mean was it ever implied that those were one of a kind items,2023-05-06
"this might be a hot take but i disagree with gunn on this one peter has shown through all 3 films to not be good at keeping his temper in check when it involves the people he loves completely ignoring any potential consequences

vol 1 he impulsively tries to assault a guard for grabbing his walkman and gets mad at yondu when he reminds him that he was abducted vol 2 he immediately takes a shot at his dad without hesitation after finding out he caused his moms death vol 3 he gets extremely angry at mantis for suggesting he go back to earth it takes him the entire film to accept that his gamora is gone and almost died trying to get his zune back i can totally buy him hitting thanos in vain after learning that he killed his own daughter and the love of his life",2023-05-05
i’m glad to hear that gunn didn’t like that decision because i hated it quill never otherwise showed that level of stupidity even when angry and they never adequately addressed the unbelievable toll that guilt would take on a person,2023-05-05
"i actually think all of them could invent

the sovreign priestess made adam warlock which the he  up by releasing him too soon 

lyla and the others named themselves like you said

the people of counterearth were doing things like selling drugs etc which the he hated and considered an imperfection even if its a bad thing they were still making choices outside of his design

and the girl at the end in the credits scene was picking a favourite song from the guardians set

the he just couldnt accept it he chases perfection because its impossible and that way he always has an excuse to torture and mutilate and call everything around him flawed",2023-05-25
great point,2023-05-07
turns out the overlooked ones were the geniuses he was looking for  this movie  me up,2023-08-06
"i mean it’s not like daniel craig level  this role


i think he just wants to do other things and maintaining the shape he needs to be in at his age is rough",2023-05-05
yeah but retiring all of the guardians while alive is much better ending and a sendoff to the series and james gunn than having any major char die,2023-05-06
better having him off somewhere running an orphanage than being dead,2023-08-12
the recent guardians of the galaxy video game did a fantastic job addressing draxs backstory im not a big gamer but its the only video game ive ever played that made me cry a lot much of my crying was due to draxs story,2023-05-07
exactly i think a common theme of the trilogy has been not letting trauma define them and i’m glad they stayed true to it,2023-05-05
gunn is a master  knows exactly how to hit emotional notes,2023-05-06
you saying what you said made me realizes because the bond of the group eventually each one has found enough strength to face their traumas and move forward in life again,2023-05-07
its also a nice counterbalance to the fates of the og avengers half of whom died,2023-05-10
while i agree i think i would have liked it more if rocket peter and nebula stayed in the guardians rocket as practically the main character has been shown to have a very good relationship to the others so its weird he ends up split up from them,2023-05-08
this so glad they showed you don’t have to  them off to have a satisfying ending,2023-05-08

that scene literally broke me in the theatre bawling my eyes out and forcing myself not to make any noises from how sad i was then i look up from crying to see teefs and floor dead on the ground i almost never get that emotional from a movie but i was an absolute wreck its all ive thought about since i left the theatre",2023-05-06
seriously i was blubbering,2023-05-06
i didnt even fully hear the “go now” so coming here and discovering thats what she was saying hurts,2023-06-10
i was literally just thinking about how i didn’t mention her at all i loved her too she was so sweet and encouraging ,2023-05-05
i really thought drax was done when he got shot in the chest like twice the way the scene was played was eerie too,2023-05-05
the fact that they set up an entire city of gods and gorr doesnt bother to attack it was so upsetting,2023-05-08

theres something about his portrayal that puts him high on the list of mcu villains i cant quite put my finger on it and i cant rule out recency bias but theres something about how he doesnt want to take over the universe just make his own while operating on unscrupulous principles and being a coldhearted  which i really appreciate,2023-05-06

"im pretty sure the mcu execs are looking at each other and going we should figure out a way to use him instead of this majors guy

man what a discovery this guy is the villains of mcu postthanos was getting kinda dire and this dude just slays it in this movie he feels like an oasis im so glad james gunn got to complete his trilogy,2023-07-11
ratchatcher 2 was there too,2023-05-07
not sure i’d go that far as objectively there are a lot of great movie trilogies out there but for me yeah the guardians trilogy is one of my favorites and definitely the best that has and likely ever will come out of the mcu,2023-05-06
i feel like the second movie was a tad too weak to really make that claim at least to me but literally every other guardians media including the christmas special and the game have been pretty  good so maybe i’m being to harsh,2023-05-08
it is far from being one of the best trilogies it is debatable that whether even it is one of the best superhero trilogies because second film wasnt good and the rest isnt anything special either,2023-05-07
no you cant be one of the best trilogies ever with a garbage second movie,2023-05-13
my theory because they’re kinda the mcu bteam who rarely interact with the main cast and their stories they’re allowed to explore and experiment the gotg movies weren’t treated as plot points of a larger story they were their own thing so they feel more organic you actually don’t need to watch any mcu movies to enjoy the first 2 and the elevator scene in 3 fills in the gaps from iw and endgame,2023-05-26
i think as an avengers movie it was the second best after infinity war but when i rank my favorite mcu films it wouldn’t even be in my top 5,2023-05-06
really tired of this revisionist history here it was a fantastic movie just because it was always going to end that way which made it a bit predictable doesnt mean it wasnt a good movie all the avengers had their stories come to a perfect conclusion with regards to where they started out it wrapped up 3 phases spectacularly it is the pinnacle of what the mcu stands for along with infinity war,2023-05-07
it was good but infinity war was much better,2023-05-21

"yeah true but consistency is key with these movies to work the russo bros had a great thing with cap and the end game stuff 

i’m all for different directors doing their thing but some times it doesn’t work  like the new star wars trilogy which was a mess  should have had jj do all 3 or not at all although saying that should just get gunn to re do them ",2023-05-06

i never said one was better than the other i brought it up because they said it’s the strongest offering in the mcu in a long time like we didn’t just get an award winning film less than a year ago,2023-05-05
"idk about that

gotg3 is a bit funnier but theyre both bloated movies with good actions scenes and some emotional moments

guardians edges it but its like 7910 vs 7610",2023-05-06

theres going to be more of these movies and the only characters were not going to see again are gamora and drax  honestly im not surprised that two of the actors that require the heaviest makeup are the ones that say theyre completely done",2023-05-05
quills grandpa is like 90 the end credits said that he will be back after his grandpa dies theres nothing left on earth for pete anymore so he will go back to rocket and they will fight  playfully about whos the captain with drax gone idk if they will bring back mantis but i hope they do i think that drax gammora and nebula have said their goodbyes as guardians,2023-08-03

"100 bet they brought out the box for him to do a scene with her and realized it would be hilarious to just address the height difference in the movie itself by sliding the box over as if he does this regularly 

most tv shows and movies will use boxes for actors to stand on so they can get faces in the same  classic example was how buffy the vampire slayer had sarah michelle gellar frequently stand on a box to do scenes with david boreanaz so they would both be in the frame another example is using riser shoes allegedly tom cruise would wear lifts to his shoes to appear taller in films robert de niro has used them too

natalie portman also talked about filming challenges with chris hemsworth and how he would stand in a trench in some locations to do kissing scenes",2023-05-06

she looked like that in the post credit scene of guardians two and when adam warlock was still in his cocoon it’s because her fleet was completely destroyed after being robbed of those batteries so she is stressing hard because she knows the consequences could be the genocide of her peeps by the high evolutionary,2023-05-11

‘shrugged with his face’ i like it,2023-05-13
would be cute if the high evolutionary was a trap uwu,2023-08-21
you mean missouri,2023-05-06
it was a reference tho just because the character didnt understand it doesnt mean gunn didnt know what he was doing  we as the audience know  gunn is a traumaville guy and this was absolutely intentional to faceoff references,2023-05-05
that could also be left to the fact back then rocket had no reason to give a  what happened to any of the ravagers considering the way hes seen them,2023-05-06
rocket says something about his face being a mask but i think thats it,2023-05-06
that was at least selfdefense faceless was already incapacitated on the ground so theres no need to execute him,2023-05-20
something very similar is in the badman skits,2023-05-06
the fatal stab was inflicted by gamora though,2023-05-07
"that’s why i love the first deadpool


just openly  murders the antagonist while being told to be the bigger person",2023-05-05
yea i really wanted rocket to  shoot him or at least give a better line about the high evolutionary failing to really rub it in while sparring him,2023-05-05
"it wasn’t really about the people or willingness to  they’ve got that in spades 

it was rocket’s chance at sweet vengeance and he said no i can appreciate your opinion but i do believe there is a distinction there",2023-05-05
i mean the henchmen were actively fighting and threatening them with harm evolutionary lost and was no longer a threat no need to even  him anymore and doing it just puts you beneath him thats the way i saw it,2023-05-05
i thought that was more rocket letting him suffer while his creation literally exploded around him and killed him rocket wasnt going to give him the easy way out after what hed done he exposed the high evolutionary as the imperfect being and left him to be tortured in his folly and pain rather than giving him a merciful death,2023-05-05
killing in an actively hostile situation vs killing in cold blood is the sort of nuance that gotg1 rocket would’ve struggled with,2023-05-06
i mean to be fair the henchmen were trying to  them and prevent them from rescuing the kids whereas the he was laying there defenseless and pulling the trigger would have served no purpose but revenge,2023-05-05
it’s more about not killing a defenseless person it’s not like they were stopping to double tap the bad guys they had knocked out big difference,2023-05-05
"im okay with this hes not against killing if its to protect others and once they started killing that was pretty well established that theyre fine doing that if they have to killing for revenge is something different than protection of oneself or others

edit i see im not the first to have this opinion but it also looks like you understand the thinking as well leaving it up because technically im now in agreement with you haha",2023-05-05
"i think its all about perspective the henchmen are killed instantly their suffering ends but the antagonist is left alive in agonizing pain knowing he will die alone and that everything he has build is being destroyed

death is the easy way out",2023-05-05
i feel like that moment actually avoided that trope fairly well rocket already mauled the dudes face to pulp years ago which is probably absolute torture on a daily basis for someone as narcissistic as the high evolutionary rocket also had just proven that he was drastically smarter and stronger than his own creator id imagine a selftitled  having to live with all those thoughts in his last moments is much worse than just being shot,2023-05-09
i feel like its a case of fighting someone and facing a hapless opponent its an honor thing you can shoot an opposing soldier in the heat of battle but if you shoot them after they have surrendered or if they have been incapacitated by injury its a war crime,2023-05-06
i think the implication is that theres a difference between killing out self defense and out of pure revenge and rage i personally dont think it matters all that much but its something i could see i guess,2023-05-06
i think it was more about humiliating him than anything else,2023-05-06
"they didnt  anyone who was clearly helpless because that would inevitably read as much closer to  than killing a bunch of mooks who were pointing swinging or shooting weapons at them

its amazing that this common trope still causes difficulty",2023-05-06
its mostly that trope but they did immediately leave him to die in an exploding ship right after,2023-05-06
thought they needed the same energy tony had when cap was trying to convince him not to  bucky that it wouldn’t change anything  “i don’t care he killed my mom”,2023-05-07
also crazy that he was just okay with killing so many other creations that were victims like him,2023-05-12
i guess the difference is that the bad guys are attacking them so it’s  vs be killed a weakened enemy on the floor is different,2023-05-07
theres a difference between killing someone in a fight and executing someone thats already beaten is the point i think,2023-05-08
i interpreted it as “i’ve got better stuff to do and you’re not worth killing you’re too pathetic and that’s the best revenge” i wished they were more clear on that aspect,2023-05-09
"the henchmen are fighting its a battle 

but the high evolutionary is lying on the ground beaten hes not threat at the moment

killing him in that instance is  however justified and it shows rocket is a hero the peice of  tortured him belittled him ripped his entire beleif structure away from him and killed his friends 

and rocket let him live he showed mercy",2023-05-09
i felt it was more of it wouldve seemed just like an excessive execution from rocket and to just leave him to the destruction of the ship he knows he is gonna die regardless but he doesnt need to be the one to do it out of anger especially since he was bleeding out and not a threat,2023-05-11
well most of the time yeah but in this instance they were fighting through guards and monsters that were actively trying to  them full stop they trashed the he and he was layed out already just killing him at that point would have been an execution,2023-05-12
they killed the people actively trying to  them after they bested the evolutionary he was no longer a threat theres a difference between self defense and executing someone  i surely hope you can see that,2023-05-10
i think it was more of a expectation thing rocket defined himself as the one who will  the high evolutionary when he went on the ship but resorted to instead go and save animals and children didnt want to let himself be defined by the past in a way it works thematically for me though i did wish that quill would have just shot the he,2023-05-07
"they cant  his character yet imo theres so much more to do with it maybe he will appear in mount wundagore somehow with wanda i think they are connected and she will rebuild it in exchange for him doing something for her

i do think they shouldve given some explanation in the movie but its implied that he would die in the crash",2023-05-05
kinda sets raccoon up to be the new captain of the guardians,2023-05-06
yeah i was really hoping the movie would subvert that trope and have rocket blast him at the last second,2023-05-07
at the risk of coming off as a psycho there is honor in death and killing all the henchmen actively posed a threat and thus they died as they lived but the high evolutionary at that point posed no threat he was sad pathetic little man that has already been beaten its far more impactful and subsequently crueler to just leave him to live with his mistakes crumbling around him hes no longer worth the thought or the bullet it would take the give him the quick and easy,2023-05-08
i thought he just wanted him to suffer on the floor,2023-05-14
the henchman died fighting while he was defeated and at their mercy at that point it would have been a coldblooded execution they should have shown them carrying him off the ship though,2023-05-21
theres a huge difference between killing someone coming at you with a weapon versus a coup de grace against a defenseless foe,2023-05-05
im reminded of finn being all stormtroopers are brainwashed drones to die stormtroopersin about 4 seconds,2023-05-05
yeah especially that last  in that hallway ripped the head off metal body just a stepping stone i felt sorry for the cyborgs the humans i had no problems with their deaths they chose to obey,2023-05-05
thank  i’m seeing this take somewhere else,2023-05-05
exactly don’t know why people fail to see this in a danger situation your survival instinct can make you  someone it’s still morally wrong but there’s a huge difference between that and finishing off someone who is already neutralised and can’t by any means harm you he had a chance to decide if he wanted to  the he and choose not to in the fight against the henchmen he had no time to make such a choice because his own life was at risk,2023-05-05
"yeah

killing someone and murdering someone is not the same thing",2023-05-05
quill even runs by those 3 henchmen and says you can  me but im your only way out of here and they let him go because hes not a threat either and i assume they want to live ,2023-05-05
" the high evolutionary was a bad guy but he was hardly a threat he wasn’t trying to conquer anything

he just got done committing genocide literally moments before",2023-05-05
while that would have been hilarious only problem is they had killed a bunch of people by that point,2023-06-19
he was using the gravity boots from earlier in the film to be immune to the high evolutionarys gravity control tech,2023-05-05
its been almost a week since ive seen it so my memory is even worse im going to take your word for it,2023-05-05
look at him hes all tuckered out poor little guy,2023-05-06
was it really though his arc was more about running away from his past rather than wanting revenge he was more than happy to pretend like none of this ever happened he didnt tell anyone about it him shooting that  through the head wouldve been him shutting off that chapter for good leaving him on the ship to die didnt have the same impact,2023-05-06
maybe but i think it wouldve been more impactful like a way of telling this guy  in the end i am better than you,2023-05-11
hes in midsommar as well,2023-05-05
oh thats what were doing just listing things actors have been in if only there was a website that could do this,2023-05-07
mine was him playing a whiny cousin in one of the narnia movies seeing him in detroit later was quite the shock great actor,2023-05-05
the scene where he tries to apologize to keatons character only to be asked for drugs is probably my favorite bit of acting ive seen from him,2023-05-08
yesss son of rambow was great i havent seen him perform poorly in anything bandersnatch being my favorite performance loved him in this i wish we got more of him,2023-05-06

and that im not a raccoon before he returns to his body is perfection,2023-05-06
i wish we could have seen teefs and floor in that final scene with lylla too honestly their deaths were more heartbreaking than hers in my opinion mainly because they had a chance to escape if rocket wasnt so heartbroken by lylla and reacted the way he did you could almost say i feel incomplete not seeing all of them happy together in the end my only memory of them now is them dead on the floor the absolute worst possible outcome idk just feels like they missed the chance to really wrap that part up maybe its cause im still just so sad,2023-05-06
and i’m crying again thank you,2023-05-20
probably because they never blamed him and he blamed himself all that time and felt unworthy he was in such a rush to tell her “i got everyone killed” ,2023-05-07

same here pal lost my childhood pet cat of 16 years back on saint patrick’s day and this movie just reopened a lot of wounds that i thought were “healed”,2023-05-06
yeah when rocket was shaking in fear it reminded me so much of sam our family pup he was always trembling with such anxiety until he warmed up a couple of times,2023-05-12
even that was hard to watch,2023-05-05
i didnt expect an infant mutant ninja turtle or expect it to get  incinerated,2023-05-07
i actually had the opposite experience  i thought the early screeningsreviews pushed how disturbing it was a bit more than it was for me like yeah it was tragic and rough but i expected more legitimate torture scenes or something glad that wasn’t in there much though,2023-05-06
yeah this is also the only one of the movies that doesnt have some kind of awesome drinking party scene that and all the communitybuilding with knowhere the movie is really trying to show how all of the characters have matured they got their 2nd chances and they may not be fixed all the way but theyre better,2023-05-07
no joke i’ve made fun of vegans for years but tonight i finally see their point,2023-05-05

holy  good pull ive always been scared to read that lol,2023-05-05
read that years ago when it came out and always wanted a movie,2023-05-06
it’s funnier if the otter somehow found jesus tho,2023-05-08
i guess  youd think theyd at least be rewarded with actual limbs and still able to talk  kind of a  afterlife  lol,2023-05-07
whats different is its not someone trying to rule the world and  everyone goblin had this sadistic pleasure in beating and tormenting peter it was pure hatred on personal level it resembles the relationship between batman and the joker i agree with you on that,2023-05-05
"the genius part was removing the mask willem dafoe is such a good actor has such a unique face and knows how to use it 

when peter is punching him and hes just got that massive smile on his face is amazing",2023-05-06
he was the best part of nwh by a distance,2023-05-07
i’ve seen every mcu movie multiple times but until i read “ikaris” i thought “who the  is kro”,2023-05-10

yeah its really hilarious that people treat that line as a badass moment and not just another example of walt crediting himself with jesses actions while berating his wife,2023-05-08
when rocket woke up and asked where nebula was ,2023-05-05
yh groot felt abit left out here surprised they never showed how rocket and groot met,2023-05-05
"during the movie there were moments when i would start to think the same about wanting more rocketgroot moments but as soon as i would there would be small things to satisfy that other than when groot went with quill as backup he was there for all of rockets important moments the hug with rocketquill the first to turn with rocket to head to the high evolutionary had rocket fight on his shoulder in the hallway just like in the first movie and then of course being the only original guardian to join rocket with the new team

their relationship being strong was subtle but thinking on it more that made sense considering this version of groot has spent just as much time with the other guardians as with rocket but they still had a bond",2023-05-05
" by contrast we didn’t get enough recognition of rocket and groot’s relationship in my opinion

well james gunn said it is not the same groot as from gotg 1 more of his child not that rocket shouldnt care for groot its just not his buddy from his gangster era so the relationship is different",2023-05-06
"groot felt sorely underused perhaps not underused but undercharacterized  
guardians 1 he was a standout the gentle giant and like a moral force curving rockets explosive creativity yet since gotg1 groot has never been the same

i know he is a different groot and not the same regrown but we got baby groot pretty much only for gags teenage groot again mainly for just gags and now we have big staypuft groot and he doesnt feel like a character just a vessel a vessel for guns a vessel for making more jokes because of his perceived limited vocabulary yes it made him actually talking in english at the end just feel flat to me  


groot has just lost all characterization and is more of a background element and an afterthought in this film where he originally was a strong hearted component of the group",2023-05-05
i was fully expecting to see a young rocket meeting young groot scene after rocket escaped on that ship lol,2023-05-05
this new groot is as close to rocket as he is with everyone elsethey raised him he doesnt have the memories of movie 1 groot,2023-05-10
rockets first words out of the coma was wheres gamora,2023-05-05
that’s what i was thinking,2023-05-09
aye though i feel like they paid it the proper respect when groot saved warlock the “everyone deserves a second chance” it shows groot is firmly out of his teenager phase and he’s a guardian like rocket given the choice rocket made with he a few minutes before,2023-08-04
if you told me that the angry blue woman from gotg1 would have some of the best mcu development and be a major player in infinity war and endgame i would have been surprised,2023-05-05
nebula,2023-05-05
aw man you gotta go to those packed imax screenings at night energy for a movie like this is similar to a sports event,2023-05-06
i cried during rocket singing to creep knowing his backstory from the telltale games,2023-05-06
same here i knew from the moment we met laylla teefs and floor they weren’t long for this world probably the animal lover in me but even with that first scene that had baby rocket that transitioned out into that radiohead song… i feel like i just cried for 25 hours straight,2023-05-08
same ,2023-05-28
yeah that was intense honestly the entire cast were on their a game with this one all of their performances were incredible like the scene where peter is screaming while rocket is dying that was intense too and they had a lot of really deep and nuanced character moments for everyone from gamora to nebula and drax even cosmo,2023-05-05

comment so good im upvoting it twice,2023-05-05
"it has been a long time since ive seen something as cathartic as when the entire  team just starts beating the ever loving  out of him

rocket or anyone should have killed him",2023-05-07
dont forget sean gunn who does the motion capture for rocket i was fascinated with all of the little movements in the opening scene adjusting pants and  there are live action actorsdirectors who miss out on those little touches of realism,2023-05-07
pretty sure cooper says in interviews that he legit only voices rocket,2023-05-18
they will just not … yet,2023-05-08
i didn’t count rocket because he actually did die if only for a moment hah,2023-05-06
well his dad does say we are groot at the end of guardians 1 so it stands to reason they could learn at least a couple new words,2023-05-30
and drink a space corona,2023-05-06
i was hoping this lol,2023-05-07
he needed to be able to say something as if he was saying “i am groot” and what you suggested is too long for that,2023-05-16
he had to finally earn that paycheck,2023-05-10
i played dark knight for my high school students this week i forgot how brutal he looked in it,2023-05-05
this was way worse than harvey dent imo younger me would have been traumatized lol,2023-05-06
james gunn got to have his cake and eat it too with this movie for sure really showed his troma roots here lloyd kaufman would be proud my favorite troma gag is the prisoner that mantis sets free that looks like a deformed thumb  it didnt need to be there and it didnt need to look like a demon from your nightmares but james gunn gonna james gunn lol ,2023-07-11
how exactly was this movie gory gory is evil dead rise this is just violent and slightly disturbing but nothing a pg13 movie hasnt done,2023-05-05
hallway fight climax and then quicktime event boss fight,2023-05-06
if you play the video game they have group finishers exactly like this for boss fights i was smiling my  off when they did it in the movie,2023-05-07
i liked it because it showed how strong each of them is and then as a team too hes a strong villain and they wrecked him,2023-05-07
ah yes  the famous jojo method of making the villain evil and it works everytime,2023-05-05

i like how tvtropes said its impossible for high evolutionary to walk past a dog without kicking it,2023-05-14
70s comic code joker used to do it a lot  sure he didnt  batgirl  and took pictures of her or he didnt  robin but he kicked the dog and thats how you know hes the bad guy,2023-05-06
kick the dog  tv tropes,2023-05-13
probably still alive we didnt see a body and he plays heavily in a number of comics stories,2023-05-05
chukwudi iwuji did a really good job at being highenergy and scary as  at the same time he really nailed that wideeyed rage in his big yelling scenes,2023-05-05
honestly he was a better kang than kang i kinda want them to retcon the high evolutionary to be a kang variant i know it wouldn’t make sense but  it,2023-05-05
i dont remember if werewolf by night was before or after mom but i recommend checking that one out especially on a dark and stormy night,2023-05-05
he was so needlessly evil and cruel even that pronunciation correction that someone mentioned or how he held those creatures he had big great ship whole corporation that made medical equipment and had sterile environment and he still used dirty cages and dark rooms for his living creations,2023-05-06
yeah but he might just be the worst villain since malekith,2023-05-06
somehow i forgot that from the trailers and forgot he handed him a bunch of guns in the car i was pleasantly surprised by the reveal,2023-05-05
i somehow managed to go in totally blind and it was totally worth it,2023-05-05
they got me with the space intercoms talk that would have been funny if i didnt see it in the trailers i still enjoyed it,2023-05-05
"i always avoid the trailers but then i go see another movie and there they are

and when its on a big epic screen like that i just dont have the willpower to look away",2023-05-06
best decision i ever made was to swear off trailers,2023-05-06
i avoided every trailer then they showed a guardians trailer just before the movie itself started like what was the point im already here to watch that movie,2023-05-08
"hard to avoid them when they show them before other movies it was really frustrating 

now that you mention it i remember the extra arms shooting scene but i forgot about it in time for the movie",2023-05-07
avoid trailers gang sup fam,2023-05-08
as someone who didn’t watch the trailer my sister and i noticed how groot wasn’t inspected for weapons only quill was nebula was obvious before quill and groot boarded the ship coz groot’s a 100 tree imagine our surprise when he started shooting all them guns,2023-05-14
thank you i don’t watch trailers for movies i really wanna see guardians oppenheimer barbie etc,2023-05-07
how did you know this was in the trailers…,2023-05-08
"honestly with recent mcu movies ranging from okay shang chi overrated nostalgia bomb nwh to meh bp2 ds2 thor lat to bad quantum i’ve taken to watching the trailers to decide how  it’s going to be 

really wish i hadn’t watched so many for this one i had the “floor” scene and the “gtfi” scene spoiled by the trailers 

i absolutely loved this movie all the guardians movies have been great",2023-05-06
"i wasnt sure if theyd cut a bit out of the middle for the trailer between the kid rolling the ball and drax launched it in her face but nope thats the whole scene and i burst out laughing

its one of those things that you could see a hundred times and itll never not be funny",2023-05-05
if i avoided trailers i would have never seen ragnarok,2023-05-05
"don’t watch trailers of movies you’re going to see for sure 

but movies you’re on the fence sure go ahead",2023-05-09
see this is the response i can agree with so many people are being like “just don’t watch the trailers then ” like it’s that simple and easy i like trailers and don’t feel like closing my eyes and covering my ears every time i come across one like going to theaters for example although even with that said it can be hard to even see the trailer just once without having to try and avoid it,2023-05-06
i know its become something of a circlejerk in this sub but i recommend not watching trailers at the very least no trailers for a movie you know you are going to see regardless on the spectrum of making the movie better vs making the movie worse watching the trailer will almost certainly fall closer to the latter,2023-05-05
not the same but after i watched vol 3 i was thinking to myself that it would have been awesome to watch quantumania and not have known the titles of future movies not sure why it came to mind today though,2023-05-05
nah i’m good i enjoy the majority trailers and i think they benefit me by seeing them first just some show to much i’ll take the risk though,2023-05-06
if it was specifically for the trailer then it wouldn’t have been in the movie movies shot before what’s going in the trailer is even thought of it was a gag like dozens of other gags in the movie,2023-05-06
but what if i don’t have to ,2023-05-07
they offer others plenty,2023-05-07
rip furry convention planet,2023-05-05
one of the few things i didn’t like about the movie is how quickly they moved on from the millions if not billions of people on that planet being obliterated especially since we spent some time with the people there it was kind of an odd thing to “very sad anyway” away,2023-05-05
i was hoping gamora would come out and save a few of them at least in the immediate vicinity like the family who helped them,2023-05-05
we barely saw it get destroyed it felt quite strange how the destruction of that place was so brushed off or how absolutely dumb bringing knowhere inhabited by quite a few noncombat people into a fight was,2023-05-06
agreed i was sure that was the point but then the explosions kept going and they were leaving it was wild,2023-05-05
counter earth felt like wasted potential gonna be honest it just felt like an excuse for gunn to use prosthetics and do an 80s homage while we see them acting like humans they barely do anything for the plot besides fodder for slaughter not even a big dramatic  theyre being killed moment or the guardians reacting just lots of explosions,2023-05-24
i actually called it when i realized that they made all the inhabitants more animal than human like with the exception of the bat family who were the only ones to have consequential interactions with the guardians everyone was basically just an animal in a polo shirt compare to rockets friends who were substantially more anthropomorphized in their mannerisms and expressions,2023-05-23
yes and no he wasnt a household name but was well liked by many comic book readers,2023-05-09
he was the main avengers villain for a pretty long stretch in the 80s and 90s avengers forever and the kang dynasty are both runs with himhis older self immortus as the main villain,2023-05-11
"the writing for majors kang was extremely underwhelming he felt like monster of the week material to me when i saw quantumania 

it was my first marvel movie in theaters in like 5 years and honestly it was so lackluster and off putting i never wanted to see another new marvel movie period

gotg3 will probably be my last one felt like a good place to end it theres no more storylines that i have any interest in as a casual watcher",2023-05-08
nah it was fun lot of apparent editing of deleted scenes though and a deus ex machina,2023-05-24
he is implied to be that same one at an earlier point this time he lost which let all the other kangs run free,2023-07-16
same here i felt conflicted every scene because i was so offput by her but knew she was just an innocent soul it was hard to sort through,2023-05-05
same here so sweet but jesus it was hard watching their scenes with their legs just limply moving around ,2023-05-05
sids toys vibes the combo of cute and horrifying,2023-05-08
he must have really hated bunnies for him to mutilate her more extensively like that,2023-05-08
you’d think lylla would at least get her arms back in the afterlife though lol,2023-05-07
"it’s sad to think about that too even in the afterlife they only have each other that was the only kindness they had ever known do they even know what the sky looks like

almost makes you wish rocket would die so he could introduce them to some new nice nonjudgmental friends from his afterlife og groot and gamora anyone and they could all ride around together in one big happy spaceship family",2023-05-09
i mean this is the franchise that made everyone fall in love with a  sentient tree in the first movie,2023-05-21
same it was really hard i just wanted to hold my bun the whole time and i tear up thinking about floor,2023-05-17
"honestly i was terrified of a much worse fate

this wasnt any better mind you but i got really scared when he demanded they be incinerated",2023-05-05
james gunn pitched “let’s shoot the mentally handicapped walrus” and no one stopped him ,2023-05-07
i thought it was gonna be even more tragic where their  switch gets activated when they rocket freed them from their cages and thought they were gonna “escape” and rocket’s was disabled when they were prepping him to take his brain as a way for the high evolutionary to let rocket know he outsmarted rocket and have known what his plan was ,2023-05-07
i gotta say my jaw hit the floor on that one,2023-05-05
and of course they would choose the cutest animals ever like seriously otters,2023-05-06
oh my  me too they did such a good job with floors personality it fits a talking rabbit so well,2023-05-08
i have one too victor hes my best friend same horrible  animal testing,2023-05-17
i was expecting a lylla and rocket reunion tbh,2023-05-05
it goes so far for explaining how he was at the start of guardians 1 and his protectiveness over groot,2023-05-08
gunn didnt get you at yondus funeral the last time around his movies are just the best,2023-05-10
maybe in a what if we can see that happen,2023-05-08
high evolutionary was waiting for them no matter how fast they came out they were dead,2023-05-06
not necessarily a retcon for all we know rocket was arrested or something or knew some people who heard him talk about lylla without knowing who she actually is although that same scene refers to him by his serial number so the kyln might have just had access to the high evolutionarys file who knows,2023-05-05
that hallway fight was probably my favorite fight scene in the mcu,2023-05-05
i was thinking while watching “ gunn has really come into his own as an action director”,2023-05-05
that was probably my favorite part in the movie,2023-05-05
he honestly has the chest codes because some of these scenes are similar to ones done digitally last year in the videogame with adam warlock,2023-05-06
"if i had a nickel for a every movie released within 30 days of eachother featuring chris pratt playing the song no sleep til brookyln and has an extended longshot fight sequence

id have two nickels",2023-05-08
felt like an homage to kingsman church scene,2023-05-08
which i imagine is many lol i doubt most people knew that a christmas special would actually do some key staging for the film i was imagining people’s reactions to peter and mantis referring to each other as siblings when they hadn’t seen the special probably were pretty confused lol,2023-05-06
i love that song its my go to in any place with a jukebox,2023-05-05
plus it fits the real life james gunn arc   canceled creep to running the dceu universe and not having to be marvels lapdog,2023-05-06
while i like pentatonix i hate this it doesnt fit well for acapella,2023-05-22
too many drawn out fakeout deaths the one with peter felt really cheap i do like that they all survived though it felt very earned rather than a cop out,2023-05-05
"adam warlock being a literal plot device seriously my golden boi only shows up when the plot needs to move forward they even had a chance to develop him a bit more after his mom died and they didnt after hyping him up at the end of vol 2 it was a bit disappointing

the first half of the movie had some really bad pacing between the funny and dramatic moments the biggest standouts was during their infiltration of the brain station thing one minute they are rolling everyone then drax and mantis almost die only to be saved by peter rizzing the pink girl 

rocket saying he cant  the high evolutionary because hes a guardian ignoring all the henchmen that they just killed who like him were also probably there against their will as test subjects and leaving him to die in the explosion anyways this is just my opinion but it wouldve been more impactful if he had killed him to avenge his friends who the high evolutionary didnt even acknowledge as living beings",2023-05-05
not the person above you but for me orgocorp felt a bit too rick  mortylike whether or not thats bad is a matter of preference of course i also thought it was weird that the high evolutionary decided to blow up the planet after his war pig had obtained rocket but before the war pig made it onto the ship thats like sitting in the getaway car at a heist hearing that your fellow thieves inside the vault managed to get their hands on a bag of money and then blowing up the bank,2023-05-07
another mcu director got to complete his trilogy as well this year with peyton reed closing his antman trilogy but it doesnt feel as impactful and memorable as the gotg movies the antman movies are funny for sure but to me it feels inconsequential and forgettable and it happened because quantumania served mostly as a springboard for the future of the mcu and this movie felt like an isolated movie separate from the mcu and a proper closure to the guardians im so glad this movie released when it did because maaaan watching these mcu movies and tv shows was starting to feel like a chore,2023-07-11
it sometimes works and sometimes doesnt but more often it works if they let the director work the script and movie ryan coogler wrote and directed both bp movies and they were really good gunn obviously did all the guardians and then taika did thor 3 and 4 i think the only other one that had relatively little intervention might have been eternals cause that was entirely a chloe zhao styled movie,2023-05-21
gamora was always supposed to die infinity war ended up working perfectly into gunn’s plans,2023-05-05
he is getting better at action concepts,2023-05-06
that’s a very high evolutionary thing for you to say to  your failed experiment and start again with a new toy it’s clear who your mcu spirit animal is,2023-05-14
you’re allowed to enjoy things  i say if they make you happy then keep watching ‘em life’s too short,2023-05-05
the thing the mcu figured out back with winter soldier is that they don’t have to just be superhero films they can be other genre types with superhero laid on top but what’s come after endgame has been amateurish at basic storytelling so it’s felt more childlike,2023-05-05
its just a tribute to chadwick boseman that movie is absolutely pregnant with his absence and all i can think about is how sad it is that chadwick boseman is dead then i remember theyre having a funeral for a comic book character and i just feel confused theres no emotional connection with the actual story,2023-05-10
it could maybe be guessed based on that movie but we don’t actually learn anything concrete,2023-05-09
there’s a holiday special on disney introduces cosmo mantis is sister   mantis can actually fight and stuff current looking groot kevin bacon and guardians are the owners or something of knowhere,2023-05-13
and aliens in general have been known to the world since the invasion in avengers 2013,2023-05-08
ty i did not,2023-05-05
nope spoilers when the monkey first turns round in the cold open my  thats chilling,2023-07-11
i already want to see the movie again lol every character was incredibly fleshed out and no single one felt two dimensional even as awful as the high evolutionary was he still was a multi faceted person he even agrees with quill when he said “no perfect society has octopus men selling  on a street corner” it’s one thing i feel gunn did so much better than others in the mcu he does a great job of fleshing out everyone not just the main heroes,2023-05-05
gamora finding her new family and quill finally decided to meet his grandpa was bitter sweet at the end,2023-05-05
everyone ended up with family drax the dad was my favorite,2023-05-05
exactly it wasn’t meant to be and even though they didn’t end up together the experiences they shared together helped them grow as people it made 2014 gamora a kinder person and it helped peter mature and realize that chapter of his life has ended and he had to move on,2023-05-05
i think a lot of people just dont remember that gotg and gotg2 were set so far before infinity war and for them quill and gamora knew each other for at most a year maybe two,2023-05-07
im honestly a little miffed that morena baccarin is coming back for dp3  i loved her performance in the first 2 deadpool movies but i think she should stay dead to keep the stakes of wades chosen profession,2023-05-05
"nah theres no way altgamora and peter could have ever had a normal relationship with that baggage  there would always be some insecurity about the differences between her and the original gamora and with peter having sort of an advantage of knowing more about her than she knows about him  

the buildup in the movie was more about them being able to respect each other so they can make peace with what happened and what is gone  peter can understand that she is a person with a different history and different experiences than his gamora and that 50 of the relationship isnt there   she can make peace with the fact that her other self chose well

i liked the end where we see that the family bond she had developed with the guardians in the original timeline happened all over for her with a different team in this one",2023-05-05
depends though having a character die should mean something resurrecting them moreso its almost obligated that she walks a different path at least thats the grrm writing style philosophy i think makes death impactful,2023-05-05
hmm thats an interesting take i took it to just really drive home that the guardians are just all deeply broken people who can only find their comfort in the rest of the crew but thats just me,2023-05-05
it also preserves the weight of her death gamora as we knew her as peter loved is truly dead,2023-05-05
ya that’s what really gets me i think because everyone thought she would come back it’s almost like real gamoras death is just now hitting me,2023-05-19
" i think gamora’s comment at the end was her kind of saying that she gets what “she” and peter and had together

absolutely she now understands why some alternate timelineuniverse her fell in love with him it still was not her",2023-05-05
i thought gamora was going to fly out and save quill like he did for her in the first movie,2023-05-06
i think part of it is he’s already the quill that grew up in gotg1 and matured so while he’s still kind of a goof he’s way more the peter other her fell for than the one she put up with,2023-05-06
right just have them kiss again,2023-05-05
" joel and clementine

for a second there i thought you were talking about a telltale walking dead x last of us crossover",2023-05-05
honestly it pretty much is the same person we saw in the beginning of gotg 1 the moment thanos time travels in endgame is basically when he sends gamora to get the infinity stone quill has what she is missing is all the development we saw in the movies but she is the same person so she could get there eventually,2023-05-05
no she died this is a gamora plucked out of the timestream from a point before she ever met the guardians,2023-05-05
i totally thought nebula was going to be sacrificing herself when she piloted the high evolutionarys ship at the end,2023-05-05
i don’t know how peter survived that he lost all his powers correct or is he still part celestial,2023-05-05
"ive been thinking about this for the past few hours now and i want to say this must of been a creative decision from a few different people  

basically the scene is too on the nose like the scene from vol1 that it was for sure a call back  however there is two conflicts with having gamora saving him maybe 3   one is that its not really in character for the new gamora to save peter like that so early after this small adventure  it would feel out of place rushed  the second is that its also just too tropey  campy  even for guardians to just do the same scene again  if it was the original gamora i would be fine with it but the new one  im not with it either

the third is the strongest argument and that it was a disney decision to make it adam warlock because hes the new character of the movie semibig name along with the cast and now part of the actual new guardians of the galaxy  they didnt do much with him in the movie which was fine i guess so they needed him to do something in the finale

plus gotta have that famous  pointing painting reference joke because adam warlock is basically a demigod in a few timelines",2023-05-05
 taste a lot of people think chris  pratt is handsome you’re the crazy one,2023-05-08

when the guardians cry out for peter as they think he’s dead… every single scream broke me,2023-05-05
"generally gunn did a good job portraying all of the guardians as very powerful 

and mantis is outright creepy her deleting that insult from drax was heavy",2023-05-05
i love that they made us remember that she’s actually an empath it was present in other movies but not that much,2023-05-05
"i remember during the endgame fight mantis awkwardly walking around in the mayhem and i always hated that here they finally found a way for mantis to effectively use her powers and outside of combat even 

whispering to cosmo you are so strong that was a great moment",2023-05-05
i love the part where peter put a stop to nebula and gamora berating mantis after she accidentally threw their space suits out of the ship that’s some true brotherly love right there,2023-05-05
mantis is kicknames takeass,2023-05-05
the one thing that felt weird to me about mantis was her having the ability to super jump in that organic space station fight scene like they never set that up previously strange had to portal her onto thanos head in infinity war,2023-05-05
and her slapstick humor the entire movie was hilarious she takes in every moment like floating in space and bam faceplant,2023-05-08
i always loved mantis because she was a sweet comic relief but seeing her in this film really shifted her into another light she was so badass and her abilities really make her the heart of the team the last scene where she was walking awaypriceless,2023-05-08
the way she fought was pretty cool finally showed the martial arts skills she has in the comics,2023-05-11
the problem wasnt the quips it was the lack of substance,2023-05-08
right the way it would devolve to childish retorts lmaooo,2023-05-05
this will sound crazy on its face but they aren’t really competitors at this stage they aren’t working together but when one does well it’s good for the other,2023-05-06
there have been a few teases but they’ve never fully committed spiderman said “what the fffff” at the end of far from home as did aunt may in homecoming i think star lord also drops a “what the ffff” in one of the gotg movies and yes there’s nick fury saying “mother ffff” during the infinity war post credit scene other than that they’ve never dropped any ,2023-05-05
"groot did say welcome to the  guardians of the galaxy at one point

but in his own language

kinda surprised it didnt end up being a reference of that",2023-05-05

the first two spiderman movies ended right before it too,2023-05-05
groot said the f word,2023-05-05
theres a blinkandyoullmissit uncensored  very welledited into one of marcstevens rants in moon knight,2023-05-10
technically its said in ironman 2 when tony stark basically tells the  us senate they cant have the ironman suit the senator says  you  but since its on mcucspan its censored out of the broadcast,2023-05-20
the acoustic version of the song used actually does have very in lieu of an fbomb ive long been annoyed by that,2023-05-06
it’s bleeped,2023-05-05
no they never committed “captain america fuuuuuu”,2023-05-05
thank you,2023-05-09
lol they’ll quadruple their “” count in the first minute of deadpool,2023-05-05

pretty sure there’s not but i’m open to being proven wrong,2023-05-20
get in the  car or open the  door cant remember exactly,2023-05-05
nebula can’t get into the car on counterearth peter is instructing her how to press the button on the handle,2023-05-05
it was such a realworld frustration moment too which helped it a lot those are the situations when people actually cuss lol,2023-05-05
yeah i heard about it too and immediately when i heard creep by radiohead assumed it was going to be a throwaway use of it while rocket sang along but no it could’ve have been a better use of the word i couldn’t stop laughing for a while after that,2023-05-05
i mean peter also said “what the ffffff” in the first gotg then aunt may almost said it at the end of spiderman homecoming and i think once more it was almost said in spiderman far from home,2023-05-05
that’s exactly what happened gunn was asked about it at the red carpet world premiere last week,2023-05-05
when peter and nebula are on counter earth getting in the car peter says in frustration to nebula “get in the  car”,2023-05-05
marvel actually released it on their yt channel granted they censor it in the video for reasons,2023-05-20
in the scene where peter and nebula were taking the counter earth families car peter said “open the  door”,2023-05-05
peter did,2023-05-05
deadpool is definitely going to reference the fact that gunn straight up copied the near death experience scene where the dead love interest tells him he cant come through yet,2023-05-05
i expected it to be in deadpool and a running joke throughout the movie he would abruptly stop people from saying it saying they’ve only got one and it has to be perfect and later on stubbing his toe or something and unintentionally letting it out,2023-05-05
wait did they say daredevil was going for r,2023-05-05
i will be shocked if we see blade next year,2023-05-05
deadpool i feel is a safe bet,2023-05-05
 that scene was terrific i didn’t even notice the f bomb but i was laughing for sure ,2023-05-05

"1 and 3 are among my personal favourites in the mcu and its really not a big list but 2 id gladly not rewatch the heart didnt really hit me and the overt comedy was way too much particularly with a lot of it not landing

different to something like ragnarok where i also thought they overdid the comedy to the detriment of the heart but it all landed for me so i was left in a weird spot where i cant help but say its a brilliant comedy but i wasnt emotionally invested",2023-05-05
i didnt like 2 much the first time i saw it but it grew on me to a startling degree on my second viewing,2023-05-08
it’s well worth a rewatch i liked it a lot more watching it again this week than i originally did,2023-05-05
i like it more than 1,2023-07-30
like how country roads appeared in kingsman 2 and logan lucky in 2017 with channing tatum,2023-05-05
avengers movies are always capstone projects they serve as sequels to all that came before it,2023-05-05

i watch the first trailer or two then stop watching because they dont hold back at all when its near release date,2023-05-05
do you skip trailers at the theater its near impossible for me to do since i sit through trailers in the theater all the time or do you like close your eyes and cover your ears if a trailer is for a movie that you want to watch,2023-05-06
venom was ridiculous with its trailer they used scene from credits in it im quite sure that if i havent seen trailer in cinema earlier i would enjoy that movie more but there were all fun scenes used and scenes from almost every part of the movie whats the point in watching movie after watching summary like that,2023-05-07
exactly i literally sit in the cinema and hold my ears closed through some of the trailers,2023-05-10
quill said it to nebula as she was struggling with the door handle,2023-05-05

"lol didnt that one  dude with rockets info on his head was basically begging for his life only for starlord and groot to divebomb him to oblivion

lol he couldve just gotten shot but instead he got the rko from the heavens",2023-05-05
" as he says im a guardian of the galaxy meaning hes a protector not an assassin

it wouldnt be assassination he was being attacked by him seconds before also the guy is worse than space  committed planetary genocide moments before said hed do it again and still has the means to",2023-05-05
tbf mattis has also said you go to afghanistan you got guys who slap women around for five years because they didnt wear a veil you know guys like that aint got no manhood left so its a  of a lot of fun to shoot them  its a hoot but i get your point,2023-06-19
did you even hear his speeches and motivation  this setback is just going to make him more unstable  he is certainly not going to see the errors of his ways and turn into a force for good,2023-05-09
yeah and a lot of hybridbeast guards that probably had no sense of right and wrong,2023-05-09
he was beaten multiple times and still kept trying to  rocket his entire body is also a super weapon capable of totally wrecking adam warlock  he also literally just committed mass genocide said he was going to again and has the means still,2023-05-06
peter used another helpless dude as an airbag earlier in the movie,2023-05-07
i hope they don’t bring him back again after this film he played the role extremely well made the character extremely hateable and ultimately if he comes back it’ll pretty much undo rocket’s character arc,2023-05-08
yep was him getting stabbed in the chest that you couldn’t see him getting stabbed satisfying for you,2023-05-05
ive been wondering how he became smarter than him my assumption is that he was already a smart raccoon beforehand considering how curious he was when the hand was about to grab him the experiment made his intelligence greatly enhanced because of the experiment,2023-05-05
"he should listen to yoda

yoda we are what they grow beyond

high evolutionary yes that is the point of my experiments

i loved that even his bridge crew unanimously decided it was time to take him out he was unhinged,2023-05-05
i was skeptical thinking he was going to play the same character as in peacemaker bit im so happy to have been wrong  he was brilliant,2023-05-05
when a villain screams so hard that spit starts coming out of his mouth you know hes not to be trifled with ,2023-07-11
wow i really thought he was one of the worst acted villains in an mcu movie as did the people i went with still thought the movie was solid but surprised to see the opposite here,2023-05-05
he did less of that in the first part of the movie i liked him collected more than when started losing it a bit,2023-08-12
yup lol,2023-05-05
kang was so hyped up to be scary and powerful really was a letdown seeing how easily he was defeated,2023-05-07
bad news thats a good thing for this kinda film ,2023-05-06
hah yeah totally i was thinking the same thing not necessarily a bad thing… not sure why you were downvoted,2023-05-10
got bad news about the queen son,2023-05-18
im going to assume that spelling was intentional ,2023-05-22
that is pronunciation though or at least a specific accent,2023-08-05
i meant the high evolutionary got him to but yeah definitely a sneaky way to throw that in there,2023-05-07
also quick death no torture,2023-05-06
for a slight moment when i saw high evolutionarys computer person had rabbit teeth and robot back arms i was like “floor floor please tell me you’re alive”,2023-05-05

different strokes for different folks personally i never felt it was doing something for the sole purpose of making you sad it was all to inform rockets character so i didn’t feel it was too manipulative,2023-05-05
"previous marvel 

violent  of parents children and eventually half the universe child abuse and human trafficking immense civilian casualties alcoholism and ptsd spousal abuse torture mind control 

derek86 this is fine 

guardians 3 animals in peril 

derek86 this is just mean and unheard of emotional manipulation how dare they",2023-05-05
"grow a backbone please all filmmaking is manipulative why do you think they have music thank  creators don’t listen to complaints like this otherwise we’d be subject to sterile and safe art for the rest of our lives

over all of the guardian appearances they made a point that rocket had a traumatic past that he doesn’t want to talk about it’s not because his hotel didn’t clean their bed sheets it’s because he’s very clearly a genetically modified raccoon android this isn’t something they shoehorned in at the end

they’ve dismantled and reassembled nebula they’ve spoken previously about how every time she lost to gamora they upgraded her drax’s family including his young daughter were killed by thanos quill was kidnapped the day his mother died the whole point is that this is a group of trauma survivors and rocket always had the most traumatic story",2023-05-05

"just a slight correction

	later telling him he was to be a father

he was always a father  thanos killed his wife and daughter and i’m pretty sure that’s what mantis tells him  he’s always been a dad despite his daughter being gone that’s why he was able to calm the children",2023-05-05

"i know im super late here but i only just watched and that stood out to me   


drax is a weapon by circumstance but he is a father by nature",2023-07-07
agree they made him a comic relief not just for audience but for people around him too and it makes him so much better,2023-05-15
im surprised you feel that way tbh i thought this movie had more sad moments than just about any marvel movie and they really let them sit with you rockets backstory was basically all sad with only tiny moments of levity,2023-05-05
" and then ruined 2 seconds later because marvel just cant let their audience marinate with a sad scene for 5 minute

i dont think we watched the same film because the only scene i remember being cut in with humour was when peter was talking to gamora in the space suits

other than that most sad scenes let you sit with it in some cases an uncomfortably long time such as rocket screaming after lylla dies",2023-05-05
that makes sense considering batista is supposedly done with drax those two characters have completed their arcs and are together in the city no need to really revisit either of them,2023-05-05
"i want to see her show up partway through another film when a character needs to go to knowhere for information  
like the collector in guardians 1  an important and plot relevant character but only appearing for a scene or two  

it would be nice to have someone like adam warlock pop in in a future film to ask for some advice",2023-05-05
ah yeah i remember james gunn posting something on social media about his dad passing away i didn’t make that connection though but that would make a lot of sense for both brothers,2023-05-05
i was wondering why give so much screen time to a fun but ultimately extraneous character in an already packed cast but that explains it perfectly im glad they had that,2023-05-08
you will,2023-05-05
appreciate it,2023-05-05
ha,2023-05-07
exact same it was driving me crazy,2023-05-13

the torture exploitation and pointless killing of animals is the wrongdoing",2023-05-09

no youre not it was a weird statement and really undermined the animal experimentation part of it,2023-05-09

modok was clearly a humourous subversion adam warlocks redemption was played straight,2023-05-24
i get the impression that it couldnt have happened by the movies own logic  i thought what little we saw of him after he was mauled by rocket meant that he wasnt as mauled as he was  like there should have been more blood on the floor  maybe they wanted to make it more bloody but they were stopped from doing so by the company  they could have avoided that by having more scenery obscuring the aftermath,2023-05-05

if you’ve watches his suicide squad or peacemaker i think that shows where the new dccu is heading and i am here for it gunn won me over in 2014 with gotg and he is easily my favorite director to have worked with the mcu i’ll watch anything he makes because he pours his soul into his work and it always pays off,2023-05-05
my guess superman gets all the heart and soul of gunn’s films that sincerity that set him apart from others in the cbm scene and he channels all his natural crassness and humor through its villain who is probably lobo,2023-05-05

he has been posting about his passion to finish guardians 3 since 2018 saying rocket’s story is one that he’s been looking forward to tell

yeah but they could have skipped on the face peeling and just show some ,2023-05-05
yup first one that comes to my mind is jurassic park being pg13 my parents took me to see that as a young kid… which was probably a mistake but to your point that’s what the rating should be for,2023-05-10
yeah 100 agree with you that’s the thing with marvel tho is 99 of them are completely safe and honestly an extremely soft pg13 only really catching the rating for the occasional cursing so when you have gotg 3 and it’s a true pg13 it feels extreme compared to everything else disney has churned out in the past we need to get back to making pg13 actually not for kids nowadays it genuinely seems everything is either pg13 or r there’s no pg no g anymore it’s weird,2023-05-09
that would be the worlds most mild r rated movie ever haha,2023-05-10
"honestly i’ve been thinking about the movie a lot since i saw it thursday and tbh i think pg13 has just been watered down to the point where it feels more like pg most of the time so when a movie comes out that actually is a true pg13 it feels extreme like if this had been rated r it would’ve been an extremely mild r 

i think part of it too is that too many people assume that anything marvel is kid friendly which is also a fault of disney themselves as they actively market these movies to children so when a pg13 marvel movie actually is not appropriate for kids under 13 it feels out of place",2023-05-08

while hemsworth can play a himbo idiot the best iteration of thor is one where he can actively be taken seriously by everyone around him in every movie except love and thunder when thor talks to people he sounds like a cognitive and mature adult even in parts of endgame when he was at his most broken and manchildish

love and thunder largely suffers from thor being a himbo since it makes a lot  of conflict with him involved an actual joke fight on new asgard being jealous of the new thor having his hammer meeting about the damage having been done to the city suddenly not a great leader in any capacity meeting with the other gods literally made a  object it wasnt anywhere near that bad in ragnarok either

nonetheless taikas hands were all over it and i feel like a little more oversight could have cleaned up some of the bigger issues korg screaming goats the overabundance of comedy etc

i agree that the focus should have been more on the godbutcher but lady thors inclusion wasnt this huge detractor from it the impact was nulled by thors character responding to things like a child",2023-05-05
exactly my point letting a director take the ball and roll with it can result in things like this,2023-05-05
i found that the worst parts of eternals were when it stepped away from being a zhao movie and just became marbel movie 27 that felt a lot rarer in this one which really did just feel like gunn making his own movie,2023-05-05
eternals would have been way cooler as an hour long tv series i enjoyed a lot of the concepts but it felt too full hard with that big of a cast,2023-05-08
i feel the same way feels good to know theres at least one other person who loves mom,2023-05-05
im there with you on raimi going full raimi zany is what made the movie worth watching and thor was really two decent movies with very different tones smashed together,2023-05-05
"im probably the biggest multiverse of madness fan alive and i will defend that movie with my life id argue the sam raiminess of it is kind of what saved a script that had clearly been rewritten 100 times

amen the best parts of the movie were the parts where they let him loose and its obvious that was mostly held to stylistic flourishes on top of a simultaneously overworked and undercooked script",2023-05-05
yeah multiverse of madness isnt the greatest mcu movie but it at least stands out for being something different than whats become the norm with these eternals love  thunder and quantumania all felt like kind of nothing new to me mom is enjoyable in its uniqueness,2023-05-05
based sam raimi brought real style fun and creativity to an okay script the movie shines because of him,2023-05-06
raimi and co have basically said outright that they didn’t get a lot of time to polish mom’s script and there was some relatively 11th hour restructuring of it,2023-05-05
multiverse was great i’m legitimately surprised people don’t like it was sam raimi doing sam raimi and i was there for it,2023-05-05
"we just fundamentally disagree on mom so i’m not sure there’s any productive conversation to be had there

i personally love taika’s stuff usually but i feel like he was too off the reigns with thor 4 totally agree with your complaints but even if they had been fixed i think there’s be a fair amount of criticism for the overstuffing of taika humor korg as a weird framing device the goats screaming etc… a bunch of the humor that was too overdone is very much a consistent thing through his projects even outside of the mcu and i feel like he missed the mark that time",2023-05-05
"agreed


mom was great particularly because it was like a horror film set in the mcu rather than a comic movie


love and thunder just leaned to heavily into the quirky taika schtick i usually like his stuff but it seemed out of place and forced as ",2023-05-05
i feel the way you do about mom about lot also mom as well,2023-05-05
"rewrites or reshoots or editing or something got lost in traskation

but is basic character motivation his fault he’s gotta shape some of that story",2023-05-06
"i don’t think ragnarok is that great to begin with so thoe 4 wasn’t that much of a downgrade imo

i disagree with this but its all subjective right",2023-05-05
i have to disagree i feel like we pretty much got the same the same thing i would say the russo brothers handled thor a lot better,2023-05-06
no taika given too much reign was definitely the problem he didn’t write ragnarok he wrote love and thunder,2023-05-07
i would add ragnarok but the rest were definitely made form the same marvel assembly line most come from eternals was just allowed to be shot different,2023-05-05
i think eternals had some studio interference from what ive read it was kind of a troubled production because nomadland kind of blew up and became the oscar frontrunner in the middle of production and zhou wanted that to grant her a lot more freedom than she ultimately got,2023-05-05
no those are as assembly line as marvel gets,2023-05-05
everything the russos have made since endgame has been severely critically panned they kinda  when left to their own devices,2023-05-20
i don’t think it’s that big of a deal in the long run i’m just saying i couldn’t help but scratch my head at the inclusion it was not set up at all,2023-05-05
complete with action figure,2023-05-06
there’s an hbo max green lantern show yeah,2023-05-05
scary movie 1  2 were rated r it’s no coincidence that they got bad when they went to pg13,2023-05-05
it was you can see knoxville lose his ,2023-05-05
if cavill wasnt getting replaced 80 of that  would be gone its just a giant tantrum,2023-05-05
i also love the snyder movies but gunn is gonna do dc justice it’s also funny that they try to hype some rivalry between the two when they are longtime friends lol gunn literally wrote snyder’s first film  dawn of the dead,2023-05-05
snyder had to be replaced and it being gunn is a huge gift the snyder movies are complete and utter garbage justice league is the only movie i’ve ever walked out off to this day,2023-05-05
those are the same type of people who are like but ghostbusters are boys wahhhh,2023-05-05
true that,2023-05-14
yea the new team is stacked,2023-05-10
came here to say the same thing  wishing you some happy moments over the next few days weeks and months your kitty had a great life and loved you they’re here with you and we’re so lucky you were in their life,2023-05-11
i never saw the original since all the people quoting it were obnoxious and i dont think i was quite aware of what the movie was but i was intrigued by what i saw about subsequent moviefilm and i freaking loved it bakalova was so  funny too im glad i saw it,2023-05-05
yeah but that’s the whole point  quantumania was not that it was not in any way an antman movie it was just a generic mcu entry that served only to further the plot,2023-05-05
quill would be like how’s ozzie smith going,2023-05-05
james gunn after only filming a few weeks of scenes for peacemaker told chukwudi iwuji he wanted him for guardians of the galaxy 3 for high evolutionary that was how impressed gunn was with him,2023-05-05
just because of 2 i think captain america might have a better overall trilogy but its really hard for me to decide,2023-05-05
guardians 1 is better paced and structure 2 character works is amazing tho i felt guardians 3 was a great mix of the two,2023-05-06
it was but thats just a matter of opinion,2023-05-05
"while i agree in part with the cap trilogy id say as spiderman films the holland trilogy didnt have him really be the character until the 3rd film prior films were more about his fascination and fixation with tony stark which to me is something i cant forgive

itd be gotg 1a cap 1b just because all the gotg films are self contained for the most part while cap was trying to incorporate other story lines involving other avenger characters",2023-05-05
all the spiderman and captain america films are good don’t get me wrong however they are far from self contained it does the movies a disservice overall imo when you are required to have watched all mcu movies that lead up to it to even understand the how and the why for the way things are,2023-05-05
no he made it very clear that rocket was basically the final key in his next batch of test subjects none of his creations in his eyes had the ability to invent only memorize and reproduce,2023-05-05
just reading your comment above about what you liked made me choke up again,2023-05-05
you might be thinking of secret invasion instead of secret war,2023-05-07
"no lol i just know some of the more “final”
mcu films skip a post credit scene this felt like the end of a story so i didn’t see them having a post credit scene",2023-05-05
cool okay not much missed then at least,2023-05-05
prestige is a  banger though,2023-05-05
the prestige isnt really a straight drama tho it’s sci fi period piece dunkirk is nolan’s most recent straight drama,2023-05-05
his end had me crying too only because he was so staunchly against dancing the entire trilogy only for it to end with him dancing alone with his new family,2023-05-05
i became a father between the last time we saw these characters and this to have parenthood in all its potential beauty and potential awfulness be the core of every character’s arc in this film absolutely obliterated me,2023-05-13
…and can balance that with competent directing  storytelling,2023-05-05
thats not exactly what james gunn does though with source material all the time a lot of the guardians and suicide squad characters he picked are not close to their source material ,2023-05-05
this man made us care for zlister teams heroes and villains  i’m so excited to see what gunn can cook up for the distinguished competition,2023-05-05
he yelled at rocket for taking it but was too  to do anything about it,2023-05-09
the animals wanted to see the sky  factory farmed animals never get to absolutely heartbreaking consider going plant based on days when you have the ability of you aren’t already,2023-05-11
and the fact that none of them got to escape and see the sky absolutely broke me those poor innocent souls,2023-05-05
100 and no  quips every 2 minutes like in quantumania actual ai generated script,2023-05-05
i think drax was carrying adam,2023-05-07
yeah i actually totally missed that,2023-05-05
 ,2023-05-07
"i thought it was gonna be quill handing off his music to the next guy like his mom did before she passed thats why it was so important for him to save it then rocket would listen to the music and hed cry and wed all cry and itd just be a whole  bawlfest

but nope space jesus lol",2023-05-05
peter kind of forgot about his spacemask that he used in literally every over movie,2023-05-05
what happened to that blue disc thingy that yondu puts on peter in 2 why dont they all carry a backup one,2023-05-05
"it got destroyed in 2 just kinda came back in the avengers movies but gunn didnt like that they did that so he didnt keep it

i guess we can assume it was hard to come by and just broke in the time since",2023-05-09
i seriously doubt gunn was ever going to have kang show up or even be mentioned he’s said time and time again that this is a selfcontained story… it doesn’t service gotg3 at all to have the big bad of the next films show up in the post credits,2023-05-05
nah kang was never in any version of this film,2023-05-05
" due to the pending charges

wait what pending charges",2023-05-05
not a recent reshoot that scene was shot over a year ago,2023-05-06
then gunn twisted the knife even more by having his face swell up i thought that was a double tap for a second there like a yep hes definitely dead audience moment,2023-05-08
well also what’s a bigger fu to his abuser than not just living a life but being lauded as an actual hero by the entire galaxy…and being the leader of them people are going to look at rocket raccoon for safety and guidance all while the he wherever he might be is stewing on the fact that he was wrong — the worst thing a villain like him can be,2023-05-06
yeah same here  i dont know that ill ever be able to watch this one again,2023-05-09
oh i see i misread the comment buddy has gone through some  its nice to see him happy these days,2023-05-07
did any of them react to we are groot,2023-05-05
" the mcu has deteriorated since guardians 2 came out

that seems a little harshhomecoming no way home infinity war endgame shangchi and ragnorok all since vol 2 and all good films",2023-05-07
its probably more like a device hidden under his hair it makes the scene dramatic so whatever,2023-05-11
his father was literally a planet,2023-05-08
 yea ,2023-05-15
same in fact its my single favorite mcu movie period  typical hivemind discourse above you,2023-05-06
thats a terrible take,2023-05-06
yeah it’s a shame there’s no spaceships on knowhere,2023-05-05
knowhere obviously has other spaceships parked and she pilots the bowie in the holiday special so shes a capable pilot,2023-07-03
i agree she should find her own way i also dont question her not needing drax to protect her she shouldnt have problems with her new crew not sure where she is going to keep them though,2023-05-08
ohhh i was wooshed i assumed they were trying to make some vague political reference xd,2023-05-11
lol true,2023-05-05
you missed the part where rocket thought his creator actually values him and want him to be part of the utopia hes building but in actual fact hes just a specimen to be discarded at the end and he only wanted rockets brain literally,2023-05-07
if you think rocket was expanded on only through death then you were not paying attention to the movie,2023-05-05
"haha following me now eh

great use of the culturally relevant peter pan really clever and biting",2023-05-08
"thats right

in the hotel",2023-05-07
any 8 year old could handle this,2023-05-07
well iirc by the time the others got involved they were just combo atttacking him and he never really had time to react,2023-05-08
guess well find out eventually,2023-05-08
yah idk kinda weird that she can understand him so quickly either way loved it,2023-05-09
phylavell is the daughter of marvell and she has powers similar to captain marvel,2023-07-10
dude all of the marvel movies have that  terrible humor nowadays i hate it,2023-05-07
"totally agree i get most of these first couple day comments are by the marvel fan boys so they’re gonna be mostly positive but man i really disliked this movie

20 minutes too long pacing was disjointed and all over the place weak soundtrack

and i thought these movies were supposed to be funny  there wasn’t one moment where my packed theatre laughed out loud together prior movies had several  a few random chuckles here and there but almost all the jokes and comedic moments fell flat",2023-05-06
thor 4 had the same forced cringey humor not excited for any future marvel films after this mess,2023-05-10
yep my feelings too while i thought it was a good movie i feel like james gunn has emotional pacing problems is how i described it after seeing it like i get the feeling james gunn’s up bringing was wild and intense and the way his family shared emotions was all over the place because that’s just the vibe i get from his movies…,2023-05-07
gotg2 was one of the worst mcu films and i say that as someone who puts gotg1 in top 5,2023-05-05
i feel like im tripping like did people watch the same film i did 1 was good 2 was trash 3 was meh but far superior to 2,2023-05-05
not at all,2023-05-05
"i don’t know if it was necessarily better than the first but personally i’d say it’s pretty  close the two things you mentioned are things that i thought were handled pretty  well actually 

compared to vol 2 especially i thought the balance between serious moments and quips was pretty good the dark moments were truly dark and devastating and none of them were undercut with a lame joke characters like drax and mantis who i thought were bordering on obnoxious in vol 2 were toned down they were more relatable while still having some good jokes

the villain wasn’t super deep but i thought his motives were interesting and he was truly fun to watch as opposed to ronan from the first movie who was very dull generic and had no connection to the main characters",2023-06-01
or people just like the movie why do you feel the need to antagonise people who just enjoy a movie just because you didnt like it why do you need people on the internet to validate your opinion on this movie to be satisfied,2023-05-07
i’m reading these comments and crying all over again definitely not alone ,2023-05-05
"i dont think that the filmmakers understand time  like in the scene where rocket and robopriest is listening to music together i might be wrong but i thought that it was ancient human music  not fictional spacealien music  yet he said the music was from 5000 years ago  

it sounded old but 1000 years ago or 2000 not 5000 years ago  as if it was taking place in mysticalfuturespace land 3000 years in the future  which is the setting of the guardians comic book but not the movie  the movie took place in a galaxy far far away but at the same time as the other movies  not the future

edited in  i think it is fictional space alien music after all  called mo ergaste forn by the films background music writer",2023-05-05
the language didnt bother me that much but the animal abuse needed more warnings,2023-05-06
yeah it was a strange inclusion but there’s ways that could justify nebulas statement i think it’s also supposed to show how rocket and nebula are a lot closer after endgame so she’s more sympathetic to him,2023-05-13
"i had a sense of overindulgence that i feel contributed to the bloat too many slow walks too many music sequences that’s a core part of the trilogy’s dna but like 20 less would have felt better that’s how i felt 

and surprisingly dark in ways like you said that felt jarring against some of the lighter stuff some great moments but plenty of beats that just didn’t land for me and i was surprised how unsettled and uncomfortable i felt in a marvel movie of all things 

maybe it’ll feel different on rewatch or when im not a little high but yeah was expecting a tighter film",2023-05-05
"i definitely still enjoyed it overall but i wish they’d done different with the editing 

like i couldn’t even relax and sit in the moment when rocket found the baby raccoons because i just knew there was gonna be some weird  jump scare to mess up the tone of a really tender moment  and i was right i wish this movie allowed more breathing room between the different tones the scenes didn’t “flow” cohesively together 

i think gotg1 and 2 are much more well rounded movies but this one has a lot of emotional heavy moments",2023-05-05
"i’m not sure honestly if i had to guess i’d say he wanted to tell his story about rocket but that story wasn’t really a good conclusion for the guardians as a whole so he shoe horned in the team breaking up to make this seem like an ending without that kind of out of nowhere break up though nothing about this movie really comes off as a “finale” 

as to why this had to be the end for the guardians films i’m not sure i get that this series is kind of gunn’s baby but we saw in infinity war and endgame how well these characters can be portrayed by other writersfilmmakers i hope gunn wasn’t trying to prevent others from using these characters again because it would feel like a waste to never see any of the guardians besides star lord again",2023-05-07
hes dead stabbed in the gut hes not moving plus da  would marvel do with him they hardly bring any villain back anyways,2023-05-09
yeah exactly it felt like gunn really wanted rocket to say the line “because i’m a freaking guardian of the galaxy” and couldn’t find a good way to do it so he forced that scene,2023-05-09
finally someone who agree with me  this is the weakest movie of the trilogy the guardians of the galaxy are supposed to be more goofy and they are first of all a family i dont like the idea of them being separeted,2023-05-06
"how is ronan worse hes a standard war criminal on a path of destruction to feed his need for revenge

high evolutionary committed planetary genocide because he was reminded that an octopus sold 

he is the most irredeemable and unrelatable villain to date he was a monster who didnt even have a face anymore literally which was symbolic with how he is simply wearing a mask to hide his true nature 

ronan is mid he is better than thanos",2023-05-08
i think gunn just ignored that since he wasn’t a part of the mcu at the time,2023-05-07
"i saw interviews where waititi said he did that but the final cut of love  thunder doesn’t support it

i love almost all of taika’s films but i think he knows love  thunder was a bit of a mess",2023-05-12
clearly,2023-05-06
did i just get transported to seventh grade who tf still says butt rock lol,2023-05-09
well after what happened with covid in a world where we have space ships and ai i cant say anything about the supposed level that people should have,2023-05-10
yeah you right people always react perfectly rationally when they lose someone that they loved,2023-05-05
you’ve never been deeply in love before that’s why it’s so hard for him to accept it,2023-05-05
"	gaslight

and were done here",2023-05-05
haha sounds like a fun job,2023-05-08
i just think the movie needed to do more to explain the whole gamora and quill thing when her timeline people got blipped why didnt she just stick with nebula and guardians when did she leave them and how did she end up leading the ravagers just sort of confused about how she got to that point my issues with the way gamora and quills reaction to her were handled are plentiful and likely far too much to dig into in this comment but overall i see your point and ill try to think on it some more im still left feeling pretty sad by the ending of the movie and im not super happy about it the final feeling the guardians of the galaxy trilogy leaves me with is sadness which is not what i hoped for,2023-05-07
lol i guess but we all react differently and i can understand facing down mortality and wanting to fix things before ior my grandpa pass,2023-05-05
"i would argue they do it slowly because they were unsure if they were alone slowly confirms they were in agreement but most importantly the guards also did it and not knowing their position would make it foolish to maybe be the only one to do it

i mean they are trying to threaten him to save their lives kinda makes it moot if you get killed by a guard the moment after you shoot him",2023-05-19
relevant username,2023-05-10
"it does make sense  it was kind of like watching a dd campaign the side quests were unexpected and fun but the boss battle associated with one player’s backstory was always an obvious conclusion but unlike a dd campaign the boss battle never really had any tension

the way i saw it there were fragments that had something really special that would have probably been hard to sell to execs and the wider punchy punchy huggy huggy muahahaha atmosphere was a dilution to satisfy commercial interests would be interesting to get an inside scoop from james gunn to see which ideas were completely his i could be completely off base but i assume the situation with marvel and other franchises is similar to the format for exploitation films if you read about old b movie horror like 1940s you’ll find loads of stories of directors and writers trying to do something artistic or different val lewton in particular and getting hampered by producers laying down the law about simple stories audience expectation and getting their money’s worth it’s typical for film in general obviously but i’m sure there’s a uniform list of requirements any marvel movie needs to hit to be cleared for release presumably gunn did his best to fulfil that brief hence the sum being worth less than the parts

cheers for the reply my girlfriend loved the movie and i needed to vent hahaha",2023-05-10
"because he said them long before he worked there disney was aware at the time of his hire and gunn himself said he emotionally was in a bad place his divorce i think  entertaining himself with dark deliberately over the line humor 

we bring up the right because they are the ones who dug this  up and hypocritically tried to cancel gunn with it gunn is remorseful about the tweets they never  will be",2023-05-19
because they were obviously unfunny jokes that someone familiar with literally anything gunn did previous to gotg would absolutely be unsurprised by,2023-05-08
i think it woukd have worked better if the high evolutionarys end was about rocket wanting him to suffer,2023-05-05
i mean sure but they were literally trying to  them they didnt have much of a choice,2023-05-05
hmmm i forgot that bit would’ve had more payoff if she hadn’t,2023-05-07
clearly not as everyone was wearing plot armor this go round even starlord magically returned from blown out ice face because of script,2023-05-07
you just made me remember he has a mask yes where tf was it,2023-05-07
oh i see,2023-05-07
because she was sacrificed for an infinity stone to find someone worthy to wield it it shows that an infinity stone cant overwrite the effect of another even within fiction there are rules for how things operate otherwise it would just be chaos and everything goes they established how the stones work within this universe she cant be brought back because the stones took her everyone else was just removed and put on hold different circumstances,2023-05-08
how could they made it be her with what happened in endgame without it be explained in a ridiculous mumbojumbo,2023-05-08
i wouldn’t mind that actually just that one is more gamora based tho,2023-05-24
id say that saving come and get your love for the midcredits scene was the better choice,2023-05-07
and it was kind of aggressively delivered which took away some of the charm i think they were going for i would have had chris pratt deliver it more in an annoyed and defeated way not in a like angrymad way,2023-05-07
you legit just described the same thing what,2023-05-05
i dont believe that this person is mary poppins at all ,2023-05-09
and those people are wrong,2023-05-10
felt like their wasnt many jokes at all compared to gotg2 whiplash of dramacomedy,2023-05-24
well rocket himself was less interesting i miss his snarky personnality and even some of the emotional moments were cringe,2023-05-19
nah wait for streaming anything under 70 in metacritic is not worth the money unless is misunderstood like joseph kahn detention from 2011,2023-05-07
pirate it if ya must,2023-05-17
"step one  pay for a film subscription service like amcs one or moviepass so that you arent paying 14 bucks you are paying more like 2 buck per film  amcs like 22 bucks a month for 12 movies

step two  suffer  most films made since 2016   

step three  you dont want to reward studos making the same mistakes time after time and you dont want the amc app to know that you patronize the films from a studio you no longer trust   your subscription service to get tickets to the one film thats actually good this month but walk into a showing of gotg 3 instead of the film showing at the same time you have tickets for",2023-05-05
i loved it great watch just pirate it that’s what i did,2023-10-15
yeah those movies would do it the only movie i saw in a completely empty theater was the christopher robin movie that was an experience,2023-05-05
sovereign were dumb as rocks that was their problem,2023-05-12
probably not perfect for him because he values art creativity and ingenuity,2023-05-12
doubtful we saw some dude bash another dude with a pipe right after an octopus sold some crack to some kids counter earth was a failure because he is a failure and can’t actually invent anything,2023-05-13
" ill say is much nicer than earth

you somehow missed the point entirely",2023-07-07
fair enough those are quite different in retrospect,2023-05-11
yes but youre aware that endgame takes place 5 years after infinity war which is when gamora died youre missing endgame in your calculation the gamora that is in the current timeline is the one from 5 years ago before thanos even had 1 infinity stone which is the power stone and even that was obtained by thanos close to the end of thor ragnarok after guardians 2,2023-05-05
"you asked if anyone died  but i believe that you actually meant that as referring to the main characters  a whole lot of characters died but their deaths were meaningless and not depressing since the audience doesnt get to really know them or even see their deaths  like the people on the other side of the exploding planet  i linked to a tvtropes article about that phenomenon in other works of fiction  but in spoilers below ill actually answer if drax peter mantis rocket racoon or magil died  but checking the spoiler would ruin it for you

no no main characters die in this installment",2023-05-05
that is my theory too,2023-05-08
maybe theres something to the fact that groot was already so attached to her that made it easier,2023-05-09
til theres a christmas special the marvel machine really needs to slow down,2023-05-12
and thats why,2023-05-11
rocket dies just kidding he got resuscitated  but starlord dies in space   just kidding he gets rescued,2023-05-07

eli5 answer is that its an alternate reality gammorah its not the gammorah he knew personally,2023-05-11
it seemed based on the internal logic of the movie that the gravity boots just negated gravity and made its own it worked for zero g keeping them on the floor and to turn off gravity so rocket could walk on the ceiling in the beginning you could also argue he was shocked that rocket was able to even negate his powers for a little and that let him get shot and unable to fight well,2023-05-16
"it didnt amount to anything in the end all it did was further enforce that the high evolutionary is just an 

it recontextualizes rockets character and ties into the themes of the movie it also does wayyy more then make the villian an

its fine you dont like the movie but im not sure why you feel the need to not let others have an opinion on the movie",2023-05-07
hm this movie was actually colour graded and had beautiful colour and depth that all the other movies in the mcu lack this movie took heavy swings and was dark and disturbing at times imo its an actual movie not just an mcu popcorn flick this was actually taking heavy swings even the cinematography was better this is the best film in the entire mcu in my opinion if basing it on its filmmaking merits and the risks it is taking,2023-05-13
nope this was better,2023-05-05
rocket was also disassembled it was implied he was like frankensteined together with  back alley equipment i took it as nebula went through something similar but thanos had super advanced equipment and replaced her parts with proper cybernetic rather than haphazardly adding machinery and body parts,2023-05-13

technically yes but in the movie he is never referred to by name in the comics he was originally a human named herbert edgar wyndham,2023-05-07

it’s not in it long but it’s about valhalla for thor lt,2023-07-04
yeah her being overcome with emotion while on the evolutionarys ship but hearing through the comms that rocket survived and was awake was really nice and contrasted with her pricklyness throughout the movie,2023-05-07
the scene where she got emotional finding out rocket survived choked me up  and it was just a split second,2023-05-08
im happy with how they humanized nebula and made her more expressive and generally likeable since vol 2 shes supposed to be a perfect soldier who thinks calculated and sadistically but also has obvious issues from thanos abusing her i mean the way she covered her mouth and started crying after hearing rocket was alive was amazing but also tear jerking it was great to see her care and have such a close connection to rocket and the group,2023-05-22
the fact that they had similar upbringings  experiments done on them really hit home  made their friendshippartnership so much better  she didnt have to really say anything during the scenes when she was watching what rocket went through you could just feel both the sadness  anger from her,2023-08-21
best companion on doctor who imo,2023-05-08
yup i noticed how they were really trying to humanize her and make her more likeable in that film really got me to like her and excited to see her in other films,2023-05-22
well yes many of us have followed her career since amy pond but i wasnt talking about killing it in her career im talking about nebulas arc nebula has been killing it as i said since tony stark its an appreciation post for nebula as one of the best mcu characters not a karen gillan fan post,2023-05-08
right at the very end there was a point where nebula laughed and i swear you could hear the inverness first and only time ive noticed any hint of her actual accent in the marvel movies,2023-05-11

he didnt though its been confirmed by the director that he is saying i am groot but we as an audience have spent enough time with him that we could finally understand him just like gamora at the end of the film,2023-05-09
i think its also about shame,2023-05-10

he would have won the face off too,2023-08-12

i hate it as well and you know marvel has had war criminals genocidal maniacs terrorists and literal godkillers as villains in their films and none of them really elicited much hatred from me personally but i absolutely hated the high evolutionary animal testing animal abuse and animal cruelty is one of the worst things in the world and one of the things that just hurts my heart to think aboutand the fact that this villain had that as his defining traityeah dude had to get wrecked,2023-08-05

what i don’t get is whyhow he hasn’t been searching for rocket all the time ,2023-05-13
to add to this with thanos he actually believed in his plan  he actually believed that what he was doing was good and that he was in the right  the high evolutionary on the other hand was more of a psychopathic ocd perfectionist who seemed to just want an excuse to cover for his experiments  also sometimes villains just don’t need a huge backstory like that they’re just better off being evil just because  their job in this movie was to make the high evolutionary completely despicable and they definitely did that,2023-05-08
thanos was doing his purge thing on a planetbyplanet basis before the snap its why he was so feared throughout the cosmos the high evolutionary could have heard his advertised goal of balancing civilizations on planets and thought hmi can do that but better,2023-05-08
exactly i just saw it last night and was discussing with my wife why he was so memorable as a villain it feels like many of the other villains have delusions of grandeur or are suffering from a tragic event in their past and have gone off the rails understandable but not necessarily relatable per se but the high evolutionist is all about narcissism and almost everyone has encountered a narcissist in a way that had a tangible impact on their lives the performance of the character was just stellar as well incredible villain and performance,2023-06-09

its not lazy writing in my book theres so many real world people who simply want to play in a sandbox people have no qualms demolition their cities in video games with meteors and tsunamis is it hard to believe that the next step up would be someone so sociopathic that they can do the same with real people

also pretty sure that building a perfect society was also the nazis goal so clearly theres a substantial number of real life people who would do exactly this",2023-06-04

doesnt seem that way in the mcu i think some people she can make them do what she wants but not everyone she could barely keep thanos restrained in infinity war,2023-10-07
i never saw it as pity i interpreted it as mantis reminds drax of his daughter thats why hes so close and protective of her drax acts like the goofy dad whos more of a friend than a parent but nonetheless will defend his daughter when necessary drax wanting to go with mantis was his paternal instincts kicking in the movie rectifies that drax isnt just a dumb eccentric brute hes also a dad,2023-05-09

were desensitized to death in marvel you mean this was a great movie and very clever to shake up the rules a bit the movies has been a bit samey they needed this,2023-05-09

yeah reality is  cruel,2023-05-28
when baby rocket was put back and his head was all stitched up and he said it hurts i was doomed i couldn’t look at the screen anytime a flashback scene came on but then i felt ok and watched the scene where they die and rocket loses it i still have a headache from crying and trying not to hyperventilate,2023-05-09
that was the worst for me too like horrifying and traumatizing i saw it four days ago and still woke up and cried this morning just thinking about him shaking telling lylla “hurts” and it feels good to know she gave him that little rag to ease his pain and soothe him but  that one messed me up big time,2023-05-09
i just got out of seeing the movie there and while rocket was lying there crying i thought there was another animal whimpering until i realised that it was a little kid just absolutely sobbing somewhere in the rows behind me,2023-05-14
dont worry they werent real animals its okay,2023-08-04

genuinely just seems like a plot hole to me dude can and has started multiple civilizations and can jumpstart a creatures evolution in an instant but he cant heal his  up face he absolutely has access to that kind of technology just seemed like an edgy design choice that would allow them to reveal that gnarly mug at the end before he exploded,2023-05-05

yep the gist of it is these folks are us just as animal hybrids and their planet is more 80s like in their timeline quill felt right at home there as did much of the audience  it was their childhood or at least the idealized suburban dream as seen in myriad movies and tv shows from our youth until they hit the city of course and the depravity there further shows our similarities it was like a  up spielbergian fever dream lol,2023-08-04

"yeah makes sense he feels like an afterthought in the movie after the opening scene there are so many other characters to deal with 
he never really had a purpose in the mcu after captain marvel kind of stole his spot as the godlike cosmic character to battle thanos it would be hard for anyone to turn him around as a character now and make him the serious character he should be maybe if they do something with eros and pip and all those weird cosmic characters but i don’t get a sense the eternals was liked enough for that",2023-05-17
"i saw this out of curiosity but i really haven’t enjoyed much since endgame dr strange 2 was fun i never read anything with chavez so it didn’t bother me some of the shows have been fun 

what will always  me about gotg is that they had some incredible material to work with from the 2008 series the abnett and lanning run is great scifi gunn turned every character besides rocket into idiots 

feige is just counting the money at this point he can’t possibly care anymore",2023-05-15
"this isnt true and hes specifically said otherwise

i said that if i had been doing now what i was doing back in the 1990s i would be viewed as nonbinary or gender  suddenly it was taken up by the fan press and i was awarded the label theythem i never asked for it i come from a generation where that just doesnt matter even being labelled at all is anathema to me i cant live in a box im going to let down anyone who sticks a label on me it will drop off quite naturally",2023-06-04

a lot at play here too peter is half human but also his father is a supreme being and adam the sovereign are made to be supreme beings,2023-05-07
and adam was actually on the right meaning he was  in the context of the original painting,2023-05-07
caught that really outstanding film on every level,2023-05-07
even more clever is that the adam shown in the film up to this moment wasnt quite like the adam of the comics  a godly hero by defying physics to reach peter hes performing his first act of heroism aligning him with his comic incarnation in other words that scene quite literally was the creation of adam,2023-05-14
its been done hundreds of times though,2023-05-18
sorry to nitpick but i needed more frozen steam coming out of his nose you could even use it for cinematic effect slowly rotating there is an old nasa book on the subject,2023-06-14

"	liked how despite how  like he was he couldn’t save his mother

sort of like quill",2023-05-21
i think the only reason he was in this movie is because gunn teased him in vol 2 and had to deliver,2023-05-07
"i enjoyed him being a bit of a parallel of rocket both are created by the he to be a perfect specimen and both of them manage to realize the truth of how big a scumbag the he is then choose their own destiny having a young warlock watch his mother murdered by the he works well to tie the current story to the flashbacks beyond the save rocket angle

 the story couldve stayed pretty similar without him but i always like when super hero movies introduce different factions of characters with different motives beyond good guys and bad guys just to throw a wrench into a straightforward story knowing he could show up and  someone up at any moment was an extra point of tension and gave us that sweet scene of gamora in the shop on counterearth",2023-05-15
"he was totally pointless and felt like something feige or disney wanted introduced but i assume theyre getting him ready for the next round 

although i was worried they were gonna have him come in and fight the bad guy but thank  they didnt and let rocket get his moment",2023-05-07
yup definitely an obligation character,2023-05-08
definitely a set up for the next guardians movie with rocket now in charge i feel like he was in this movie how mantis was in guardians vol 2 just sort of a peripheral character but then gets a fleshed out arc and story in the following movies,2023-07-11
they do both exude a similar manchild energy,2023-05-25
"her death seemed to have no real impact on adam

hes literally days or something old hes barely developed personal attachments",2023-05-07
"the high evolutionary is ranting and raving about how none of his creations are capable of invention or original thought but the sovereign created adam who is superior to all of their kind

i thought the he created him also he didnt want rocket because none of his creations were inventive but because rocket was smarter than him it was purely personal thats why his crew turned on him",2023-05-08
i managed to hold it together decently well most of the movie but holy  the heaven scene and “can i come” absolutely sent me over the edge reminded me of the scene in i think deadpool 2 where he almost dies and meets his gf again and just wants to be with her but she says he has to go back for his friends gut wrenching,2023-05-15
the part where he calls himself rocket raccoon is a part where i found myself crying unexpectedly  a superhero finally getting his superhero name  which is a whole separate thread in this series with starlord,2023-05-06
he definitely knew he wasnt the only one of his kind since he lived on earth with the avengers for five years more than enough time to find out what raccoons were,2023-05-10
to be fair thor was also on earth for a long time and never figured out the difference between a rabbit and a raccoon so its not a stretch to think that justnever came up lol,2023-05-11
also these were 80s cars with the separate button 2022 nebula probably only ever came across cars where you just pull the handle which is what she was doing put a 15 year old in front of that door handle today and i bet the interaction will be exactly the same,2023-05-08
in gotg 1 he asks whats a raccoon after quill calls him one when they arrive at the prison so he presumably had never heard the word before,2023-05-06
thank you,2023-05-10
the point of that experiment was to make a version of earth  as in our earth peter quills home planet this is explicitly stated  with all the problems with it fixed why would  using animals that werent from earth,2023-05-14

no it wasn’ was just the actress’ voice,2023-07-13
i always think back to the last son of krypton from tas brainiac makes a lot of sense to be a primary villain,2023-05-21
lets hope for the best,2023-05-08
saw the swelling mind instantly went to total recall the arnold one,2023-05-05
people are really forgetting that one half of this man has celestial genes hes more than capable of healing some minor  injuries,2023-05-07
instantly reduced swelling is tight,2023-05-07
that was my only gripe since that swelling would mean his cells are already damaged due to the freezing even if he werent dead he would have some lasting damage and probably be paralyzed for the rest of his life,2023-05-06
they introduced a device that can fix any injury like 5 minutes into the movie,2023-05-15
just slap a medpak on it,2023-05-22
he lost those powers at the end of the 2nd movie,2023-05-06
i believe water boiling off could cause freezing on the surface it would take a long time to freeze via radiation though,2023-05-08
this is a very good comment,2023-07-17
someone asked him on twitter about it getting broken in gotg2 and he said it did but then somehow he had a new one in iw and theres been a couple other comments hes made and even the elevator scene in the movie where hes kind of subtly throwing shade he replied to someone else in another tweet kind of handwaving it away saying quill left it on knowhere which works well enough as an explanation for me in a rush to save rocket and forgot to grab it out of a footlocker or something,2023-05-11
i mean its not like a useless trinket hes a dude in outer space he should really have a space helmet,2023-05-06
i cried even thinking about his flashbacks during the rest of the movie  james gunn in the best way,2023-05-09
i really noticed how their uniforms and clothes all got messed up in each fight and they kept getting new stuff which then got all messed up seeing everyone at the end covered in scorch marks and burns really helped add to the idea they had spent the last day or so fighting desperately across the galaxy to save their friend,2023-05-07
deax seems like hes basically invincible hes gotten eaten and lazered a bunch of times and shrugs it off eventually,2023-05-08
either way horrifically sad lol,2023-05-17
"when lylla died i fer sure thought that all the experiments except for rocket had remote death switches in them that go off when they exit their cage rocket was an exception because of his brain while all the other failures would die the instant they leave their cages i thought lylla was gonna have to convince rocket to leave them as she slowly died because he wouldnt have timetools to defuse their bombs before the morning so hed have to abandon them there to die and only save himself

i thought this for like 3 seconds until the camera panned to the high evolutionary holding the gun and i instantly became releaved i wouldnt have to see that still incredibly sad what happened but i think rocket choosing to leave them wouldve been sadder for me",2023-08-15
"yeah i’m not sure i’ll be able to watch again either but it was a great movie 

high evolutionary is a better big bad than kang tbh",2023-05-10
the only way i can watch this movie is to skip the experiment scenes i was crying throughout the film id l8ke to see it again but not those scenes they were too painful,2023-05-25
they have souls,2023-05-07
thanks for saying this it will help me sleep,2023-05-18
how do we know theres an afterlife im forgetting is it due to the soul stone or valhalla,2023-05-28
the jewish experience is all through marvel if you look mengelethe crazy scientist is a real life boogeyman represented in marvel in roles like the lizard doc ock and the high evolutionary,2023-05-07
rocket’s unbridled rage and floor repeatedly screaming “rocket teefs floor go now” has to be amongst the top 3 most emotionally resonant scenes of the entire mcu,2023-05-11
rockets pure roar of a cry was so  real and heartfelt i actually did cry it reminded me of toni collette in hereditary pure raw emotion without filtering to make it look attractive just shockingly upset,2023-05-11
" they couldnt have gone anywhere anyway but she was so scared she wanted to go 

i saw it for a second time and noticed something else about that part when floor is screaming rocket teefs floor go now shes still in the cage but when rocket turns around and sees his last two friends dead teefs is still in his cage but floors body is lying out in the open which means when the shooting started she tried to run away just when i thought that scene couldnt destroy me anymore man",2023-05-14
even just reading those five words is bringing tears to my eyes,2023-08-03
i think i cried 67 times started early and then the leaky eyes stayed with me  i went through all my popcorn napkins using them on my tears it was crazy  i have a very tender heart for animals so i was a goner,2023-05-10
sociopaths in the making,2023-05-13
came home and hugged our rabbit right after ,2023-05-07
i got home to my bird having an asthma attack and boy it took me out ,2023-05-07
i just got back from watching it and the first thing i did when i walked in the door was hug my cats and give them some treats,2023-05-07
i cried so much went through all my popcorn napkins i think i cried half a dozen times so much emotion  i had a feeling rocket was going to die so from very early scenes i was getting my pregrieving going   rocket as a little baby in that terrible place ugh killed me,2023-05-10
i also biked home and listened to awesome mix vol 3 the whole way i went to a thursday showing and my birthday was friday the first minute of my 21st birthday was the minute that rocket was dead,2023-05-24
we are the same person so devastatingly sad,2023-05-09
" just come home and hugged my cat still tearful

for me it was my dog but honestly same hes a rescue who came from an abusive household also whos also a breeder and apparently wellknown in that shelter for dumping older breeding dogs when hes done with them and cant sell them at a premium like he can with the puppies and it took him a while to unlearn the worst of some of his trauma and even still after almost 4 years living with me has some lingering quirks to this day i cant take off my belt around him or he starts vibrating in terror basically everything with the high evolutionary just made me feel like that could have been my boy",2023-05-14
its a good idea after the death of a parent i hope you can get back to a place where you can cry at movies without having it hang over you a whole day,2023-05-08
a coworker asked me about the movie today and i immediately starting tearing up it’s been three days,2023-05-09
ive been crying after it too i had a hard time sleeping last night,2023-05-06
him and pratt going full tilt when they thought they lost rocket had me going and rocket seeing his friends in heaven though why the  are the cages there they deserve to have endless sky ,2023-05-07
all of the voice actors were so good they really brought those animals to live in a handful of moments,2023-05-07
i rewatched the first two guardians movies before i went to see vol 3 and theyre all emotionally wrecking the we are groot in vol 1 gets me every time too,2023-05-08
i have a message for your dog  youre a good dog,2023-05-06
after watching a movie where one of the characters super powers is to feelim okay with who i am and with feeling deeply,2023-05-05
as someone who was also bothered by that scene in avatar this is worse,2023-05-06
 the whaling scene had me seething to,2023-05-17
"agreed 

“this character is going through something so dismally horrible but you know what  the character survived it my situation is not as bad i can get through this too”  neil gaiman on the importance of making media that could be scary or sad for children

also 18 is excessive a high school senior needs to be able to handle an upsetting comic book movie",2023-05-05
but your 15 year olds brain is not developed yet your 15 year olds brain is very very different than your brain if it affected you to that degree to cry more than you have ever cried at a movie in your life imagine how much it will affect someone whose brain has 10 years of development left to go someone whose neural pathways are still forming and brain is still physically growing and changing thats my thinking anyways,2023-05-07
agreed see had kids that had to be 6 or 7 in ours,2023-05-14
grandma probably dont mess with grandma,2023-05-07
“ it pete it’s just my pacemaker”,2023-05-29
i hadnt thought of that,2023-05-08
well peter didn’t know that but from peter’s perspective there’s no way ego learned about earth without meeting a few other civilizations where he presumably would’ve learned about medpacks so even when peter incorrectly saw ego as a good person why wouldn’t he question ego not using medpacks to save his mom,2023-05-08
"people have heard of the legendary outlaw starlord

fixed that for you",2023-05-09
i agree with taser face and drax not really working in guardians 2 but for me the emotional core of 2 was a lot stronger and baby groot worked for me every scene he was in,2023-05-07
i really think gotg2 haters should rewatch the movie and at least view it from a character writing stand point,2023-05-09
its not really spelled out clearly but that tazerface running joke is as much about rocket being utterly terrified  yondu calls him out on it later  for some split second moments you can see it on his face  i admit i found it hilarious the sovereign laughing at his name was his last moment though,2023-05-12
100 spot on,2023-05-10
gotg 2 is the worst movie featuring the guardians the humour is james gunn sniffing his own farts,2023-05-06
the mask thing was worn by someone in agents of shield too,2023-05-07
yup i’ve been saying this for a while  it’s the very first thing we learn about his character his mom scolds him for fighting a bunch of boys for squishing a frog he didn’t care about the consequences he fought them and lost anyway bc what they did was wrong it’s surprisingly consistent,2023-05-05
well also strange was absolutely silent when peter started hitting thanos so they can just say it had to happen for them to win,2023-05-05
"i think his issue is it made quill look  and irresponsible and just generally they made the guardians all look a bit naive and like a joke at the expense of their characters own integrity

thats how i feel about it anyway",2023-05-06
"the thing is while all of those examples reinforce his impulsive nature  theres also examples of his selfless nature and being able to do the responsible thing when the time calls for it hes the one trying to get the team to save the galaxy in the first film despite them being so utterly outmatched by ronan when the fate of the galaxy is on the line again gamora asks peter to  her if it ever comes to that and he mustered the strength to do it


the idea of thanos killing gamora to begin with was never an impossibility in peters mind he was firmly established as the worst person in the galaxy just from gamora telling him how she even met the guy the same cant be said for peters father who straight up murders his mother and yes that was a galaxythreatening scenario but the consequences for peters immediate response to  rather than maybe plan something out cost him the life of yondu 


iw serves to just reinforce his rashness tenfold it feels like the script was written in a way where the loss had to be on one of the heroes so lets look at who we can pin the blame on  lets go with those lesser known people",2023-05-05
i agree i just wish in that iw scene instead of gun whipping thanos he starts blasting instead  makes his rage seem more intense and be an actual effort towards killing the guy instead of being incompetent  as seen in the movies we know he goes for the ,2023-05-06
i can agree with most of this but cmon nowhe pistol whipped the most powerful being in the universe rather than just shooting him in the face,2023-05-05
he’s impulsive but those are all also very different situations like i might be impulsive and punch someone for saying something  up but if someone is holding a gun and says something  up i’m probably going to react differently ego was trying to get peter to  all his friends and the rest of the universe which quill was already hesitant to go along with despite the hypnotism thing shooting ego doesn’t possibly  half the universe if anything it helps save the universe,2023-05-05
"hard agree i thought that was actually a great use of one of peters clear character flaws i think it was very good usage of the traits gunn had put on screen 

i can certainly understand why he might not like it but it was good characterization",2023-05-08
i mean he reacted the same way in vol 2 after finding out that ego killed his mom,2023-05-05
wow i never thought of it that deeply but you are so right that makes the character so very complex,2023-09-17
high evolutionary never actually wanted to create a perfect world he wanted to feel like a  to have all these amazing civilisations but still under his control and inferior to him thats why he was so mad about rocket being smarter than him because he never actually wanted his creations to surpass him its all about the ego,2023-11-20
oh  great point,2023-10-10
being in his mid 50s i wouldnt blame him for wanting to take a step back from the constant gym grind in his younger years of wrestling im sure it was a necessity because of the nature of the beast but staying that big is a lifestyle which im sure is exhausting,2023-05-06
bautista has definitely said he was frustrated with the direction they took his character making him comic relief instead of focusing on his tragic backstory,2023-05-06
not only is staying in that shape rough at his age it also limits the kind of roles he is going to be casted for,2023-05-11
it seems more like future guardians lineup will be rocket groot kraglin adam and phyla nebula drax mantis and gamora are probably retired,2023-05-06
"no i think either could have worked its how its done that counts everyone surviving can seem a bit on the nose but gunn did a good job here by showing an enemy that was biting off a bit more than he can chew

he was just dangerous enough to give the guardians a hard time but not dangerous enough to  them and gunn showed that pretty well with his script the ending became more about trying to save everyone on the ship on time and less about fighting the high evolutionary and when the moment came to actually tangle it was done in seconds 

this story fitted well with the everyone surviving arc had a much more dangerous enemy been the antagonist it might have been a bit weird",2023-05-08
that game was amazing just overall highly recommend everyone try it out,2023-05-08
"this makes so much sense overcoming trauma and living with it 

glad they all lived i was kinda done with heroic deaths anyway",2023-05-05
thats an amazing way of seeing the theme of the trilogy hadnt thought of that and it makes it very inspirational as a whole props ,2023-05-06
tamarins do you mean tragedies or is there a definition i dont know,2023-05-05
this and last of us all about trauma,2023-05-06
tony starks death didnt move me but  the animal scenes here did was crying too,2023-05-06
i was  sobbing and barely able to hold myself together the rest of the movie thinking back to that scene i don’t think any other scene in this franchise has  me up to this degree,2023-05-06
"oh man… that part was scary but i knew drax wouldn’t die yet because he was in some scenes from the trailers that hadn’t happened yet like the “just one” bit 

when those three abilisks came out for drax mantis and nebula i had a horrible suspicion that we were about to see him sacrifice himself somehow to save his friends but thankfully that didn’t happen 

it was surprising but nice to not have any more guardians die this time around… gamora’s death in infinity war was hard enough to take",2023-05-05
they did the same thing for drax quill and rocket lol not sure if someone else as well,2023-05-05
"red skull didnt die though 

and them being unsnapped negates their death for me",2023-05-05
"its infinity war regardless of what happens after

no that isnt how it works",2023-05-06
it looked like he came in the room  there i think the idea of his creation being smarter than him especially one so small and gross was really hard for him,2023-05-05
yup thats when you knew rocket was donezo since the resentment  level was rising,2023-05-05
ha like he just realized he was the bad guy almost,2023-05-06
was that at the very end of the episode,2023-05-05
no youre right,2023-05-05
especially since gods are a thing in the mcu it can be understandable if he didnt encounter any his whole life but still,2023-05-08
im stoked to see how james gunn handles lex luthor  gonna be wild,2023-05-06
that one was pretty forced ego couldve just painlessly killed her with a car accident didnt need to torture her to death,2023-05-07
please recommend these movies you’re watching lol,2023-05-07
he was unpredictable both in his emoting and his movement  like he actually seemed caring with young rocket at points and then completely flips and shows he doesnt care about life  and he does it with his whole body somehow,2023-05-06
there was a scene where nebula said this is even worse then what thanos did to me while watching what the high evolutionary did to rocket so i think that tells you there who was more abusive,2023-05-07
the girl at the fleshy planet thing was gunns wife girlfriend and she’s been in a lot of dc stuff as well the blond one not the purple one,2023-05-07
ezra miller was in guardians 3 is that what you’re saying what part particularly,2023-05-07
he is in rome to talk to gianna dantonio in her room during her big party,2023-05-05
"chukwudi iwuji character mr akoni was forced to give up a lot of his territories to the sister gianna dantonio in rome which made him unhappy with what happened showing off how deadly gianna was and also setting the stage for how we shouldnt feel too bad about her dying since she had her men threaten the children of mr akonis men who gave up his territories this was shortly before the bath suicidedeath scene 

he reappeared near the end for a few more seconds raising a glass to the brother santino at his coronation in the museum before disappearing from the franchise forever once john starts doing what he does best",2023-05-05
bro between him and gamora there were some oscar level acting scenes in the movie,2023-05-06
their armor nova blasts were pretty similar…,2023-05-07
no i think it deserves the credit as one of the best trilogies i mean think about it the lotr star wars batman trilogy toy story are all highly regarded but there are incredible trilogies that dont just get better but progress the characters in a way that satisfies the viewers because youre watching growth this trilogy does that and generally gets better each movie and its not 1 singular linear story based on books its based on comic books with soo much writing that its not possible claim a main version of the character this trilogy has earned some respect,2023-05-07
you should really rewatch guardians 2 from a character development perspective i do not understand the hate that movie gets,2023-05-08
"just because someone has a different opinion that doesnt make it revisionist history

it reminded me of return of the king which i also thought was much worse than the film before it",2023-05-09
"oh come off it some people legitimately never liked that movie

i’m a lifelong marvel fan even premcu and i never liked either iw or eg they’re both extremely bloated and have  pacing",2023-05-15
it isnt revisionist history people are saying that since it was aired it wasnt good film because writing directing pacing cinematography were poor,2023-05-07
i consider them one film in that regard it’s the best,2023-05-26
and they both are wannabe dictators there are differences but they felt too similar,2023-05-05
,2023-05-06
multiverse though so anything can happen,2023-05-20
majors portrayal is great for what it is but chukwudi iwujis portrayal is a little stronger and more convincing as a coldhearted villain rather than a grandiose overlord,2023-05-06
i was honestly confused wether it was supposed to be a recast kang using a different title,2023-05-07
i remember him from 30 rock and i always thought he was hilarious hes great in schmigadoon i really hope theres a season 3,2023-05-07
oh i did not know that my bad,2023-05-05
"i find it interesting the amount of  he gets in comparison to actors like ezra miller and even moreso brad pitt who no one seems to care about assaulting women

i wonder why",2023-05-06
and they have cameos in vol 2 but it’s possible to be on good terms with parents and still have issues it’s hard to ignore in this trilogy,2023-05-26
"  should have had jj do all 3 or not at all

they barely talked jj into doing one movie and he only came back for the 3rd to try and course correct when the 2nd went sour he didnt want to try and helm another franchise reboot",2023-05-07
this is an mcu film under disney — the first to do so,2023-05-05
ok…,2023-05-06
its just language words,2023-05-07
"i don’t personally think wf was a strong offering at all though i know a lot of people liked it the costume design won awards but i don’t remember seeing it win anything more significant 

i’m not here to trash that movie but for me gotg3 was the most enjoyable mcu movie since endgame and it isn’t even close",2023-05-05
wakanda forever was ok there were some standout scenes but the movie as a whole wasn’t that great guardians 3 is the best movie marvel movie since no way home,2023-05-07
i know they have said they are done but also they havent had the dump truck of money show up yet of disney decides they want then either,2023-05-05
vin diesel is tired of having to wear all that wood so im not surprised either,2023-05-09
gamera actress is done with the mcu  i heard that drax actor was getting tired of playing him but not gamoras,2023-05-06
actually an interesting point it makes it easier for one of them to just drop into another project if someone wants them too without it feeling like they could just take over the story,2023-05-13
i hope we get at least one more ideally at least two trying not to be greedy with gamorasaldana so that her and quill can get back together and have there happy ending,2023-05-10
i thought their platonic dynamic worked really well,2023-05-05
they have a very brothersister relationship it would be very uncomfortable to see them get involved romantically like walkoutofthetheater uncomfortable,2023-05-06
she has nice dark eyes,2023-05-08
yondu really didnt really treat his own team well cause stallones team seems to have a more familylike atmosphere especially when gamora comes back to them,2023-05-06
i stand corrected guess i was thinking more of a honor among thieves but its more complicated than that,2023-05-06
yeah i don’t understand it either lol but it all ended up okay so ig that’s all that matters,2023-05-06
"it wasnt that unrealistic actually your body expands like that in space but it returns to normal relatively quick when you get back into normal pressure hes got plenty of experience in space and surely knows to exhale before entering vacuum so his lungs may not be too damaged plus like others said the guy isnt exactly a normal human he held an infinity stone longer than this space walk 

found this article on it ",2023-07-07
"he was in a much better position than justin in event horizon

as far as vacuum harm reduction goes",2023-07-10
rdj wore them through every mcu appearance its why he basically wears bell bottoms in any tony stark scene especially with paltrow,2023-05-08
thats one of things that i liked about waititis ragnarok beforehand ruffalo also wore shoes that lifted him up but waititi got rid of that for his first thor movie this resulted in hemsworth just towering over ruffalo which works completely for the characters of bruce and thor bruce is a meek little mortal he should look tiny next to a spacegod and in the movie he does which in turn made thor look all the more massive,2023-05-08
or they planned for this,2023-10-10
same,2023-05-05
"when everything started exploding  it was the first thing he thought of to go after to save he is a child that still has trouble with logic but he loved his mother

i was worried drax would interject with something  like metaphor,2023-05-05
didnt drax do just that though,2023-05-06
it pleases me to no end that someone else read it that way also,2023-05-05
i did too ,2023-05-05
good old  kyle,2023-05-07
yeah thats on earth  ,2023-05-06
which is more likely that gunn knowing the character he has defined in the past decade wrote it as quill talking about a literal faceoff as seen in films like footloose and road house the films and characters that quill constantly references or that hes buried some deep level reference to a 90s film never before even hinted at in the franchise,2023-05-05
he says that literally in response to drax saying that his face came off,2023-05-06
i overfed these men,2023-05-06
didnt rocket also shoot him in the chest,2023-05-11
 “why would you do that”,2023-05-05
which wouldn’t have been ooc for rocket,2023-05-26
my take on it was that it was more of a showing of forgiveness letting go of the hate so he can move on the past is what haunted him so even though he didn’t  him directly it showed that he can move on if he did  him it’s possible he can carry that hate on forever like a vicious cycle of abuse,2023-05-13
so i guess you’re saying the vengeance was rocket showing he that he was above him yeah i could see that,2023-05-05
"i think i would have accepted it more if he didn’t personally finish him off but let one of the other guardians or gamora end him that way you still get the him taking the higher road but still having the consistency of the guardians killing people on the way to the big bad guy

“i’m not gonna  you but i don’t have to save you” type thing",2023-05-08
i guess idk shooting a guy that just blew up a planet because he didn’t like it doesn’t put you beneath him in my opinion but you’re right the henchmen we’re trying to  them,2023-05-05
yep they gave plenty of chances to lot of henchmen but to those who decided to still fight they were merciless although they still used some stunning weapons not that it meant anything when ship exploded p,2023-05-06
yeah we’ve had that debate at dd several times killing an unarmed defenseless bad guy is extremely different from killing someone in justified combat,2023-05-06
i will say i was just watching gotg1 and groot killed a guy that was surrendering a guy who hadn’t just blown up a planet in the last 30 mins too and everyone was cool with it so i guess that’s growth that they don’t do that anymore,2023-05-06
cough optimus,2023-05-20
from the stabbing the shooting and the deliberately leaving him there defenseless and wounded on an exploding ship what they did was functionally an execution and a cruel one at that would’ve been the merciful route just to have killed him outright instead they chose to let him suffer until the end no need to rationalize sparing antagonists as signification of some reified moral superiority because that platitude rarely holds under any scrutiny,2023-05-11
i’d be cool with him being kept alive if done well but i just think rocket suddenly and momentarily thinking killing was bad with one of the most purely evil guys he’s faced is weak,2023-05-05
can’t a movie ever just be selfcontained,2023-05-05
"he is dead its made pretty clear and he was always intended as a oneoff villian for the guardians hes not coming back 

elizabeth olsen has said shes not coming back to the mcu or the wanda character for the foreseeable future",2023-05-07
yeah like that one dude who got rkod from 5000 ft in the air via starlord and groot with wings he shouldve begged harder,2023-05-05
killing someone coming at you that has experienced the exact same type of trauma that you have the movie asks us to cry when we see what the high evolutionary does to rocket and co but expects us to cheer when those same creations are mown down in beautifully realised glory it’s a bit of a mess thematically,2023-05-05
ya but they bodied that one scientist  the one they jumped out of the ship with but they let his boss live he genocided a planet of innocent people imagine not killing  or stalin because “we don’t wanna stoop to their level” like come on ,2023-05-24
i’m saying he wasn’t expansionary he blew up a planet he created obviously that’s evil but it’s not like he was threatening earth or knowhere,2023-05-05
oh duh that seems so obvious now thanks for pointing that out,2023-05-05
once again showing his supreme intelligence over this would be creator,2023-05-07
id say the difference is that rocket needed to get to a place where his choices werent defined by his trauma anymore running or seeking revenge gave power to those that hurt him but choosing save those animals on the ship broke him free from that the high evolutionary was simply an obstacle to him at that point,2023-05-08
he’s in detroit as well,2023-05-05
hes really good in dopesick,2023-05-11
hes worth catching in why didnt they ask evans,2023-05-17

so funny such a great cut to him holding up his hand too lol,2023-05-18
i would argue vin diesel got the best gig in the mcu,2023-05-06
totally although he earned it his voice acting as rocket is some of his best work props to him the gunns and marvels cgi dept because he is one of the most compelling characters in the mcu and also the most consistently impressive cgi creation theyve ever done,2023-05-08
not only that but he’s playing one of the most wellwritten characters in the entire franchise i cannot imagine he thought rocket would be this iconic going into gotg1,2023-05-09
he still has to put in effort though for line delivery and he did a great job,2023-05-11
and gave a better performance than half of them too you could see in diesel at the end trying to do checks notes voice acting,2023-05-13
and on top of it id argue hes one of the more beloved characters in the mcu especially when you move outside of the core 3 avengers hes certainly my favorite,2023-05-20
they were there admittedly very briefly but they were,2023-05-06
i don’t think his reaction caused them to be killed the he was going to  them too probably in front of rocket as well so he had to take the he out to prevent that although he attacked him because he was overwhelmed by what just happened the 3 guards were already on their way and if the he was still up then rocket wouldn’t have had a weapon to exit the room but no matter how it went down he obviously felt responsible,2023-05-07

 what,2023-05-06
seriously  it had some of the most gorgeous shots ive seen in a mcu movie  even them jumping out of the spaceship in their multicolored space suits and bouncing along the planet was really pretty  the cgi done here also felt a lot more cohesive than thor 3 which felt more like everyone was just wearing a costume,2023-05-08
i mean the fleshy spaceport was disgusting i could barely watch that and the animal torturemodification was also gross and awful,2023-05-08

yeah that always made sense as a goblin trait to me people keep questioning why he decided to abuse this random peter from another universe but that being all part of the insane persona seemed right,2023-05-06
 bless whoever is burdened with playing goblin in the next inevitable iteration of that character because they’re going to be compared to willem dafoe’s perfect performance in nwh,2023-05-07
yeah ikaris was definitely the main villain calling kro the villain of eternals is like calling adam warlock the villain of this film,2023-05-11
yeesss hahahh,2023-05-24
kudos to james for playing so well of everything that happened since infinity war,2023-05-05
ya right before that quill was asking what happened to drax and mantis but didnt mention nebula,2023-05-07
i only saw it once but i thought the point of that was he was saying that the code they spend half the movie getting was on the back wall i legit just didnt catch it but if thats the case it also ties into nebulas arc where she gets mad at everyone for being  but also makes mistakes along the way thats the equivalent of someone giving you their epipen and explaining everything but then you get mad at someone for feeding them peanuts and completely forget you have the pen,2023-05-13
"i did enjoy peter and groots team up however they paired some characters up well in this film

kraglin and cosmo are another good one",2023-05-05
maybe because iirc gunn doesnt consider him the same groot as the one who died in 1,2023-05-05
"one great groot moment was the “i love you” i was like “oh  groot learned more words” but then my friend pointed out that he hasn’t we the audience were just being let into the family that the guardians are for a second and understood him 

this movie was great",2023-05-09
i think groot fits right in its been very clear what groot and rockets relationship has been like from all the previous movies and i feel like groot in this movie was again at a different stage in his life where in this movie his role is to be emotionally mature and get stuff done in the last movie he was a kid and in this hes back to being his original stoic adult self,2023-05-13
appreciated but you only have to see their respective reactions to groot turning to dust in infinity war to know they were close,2023-05-07
i think it’s because he isn’t really an adult yet in the first movie he was a full grown adult and at the end of this movie he’s back to being an adult,2023-05-06
i’d like to think he’s perfectly comfortable as a supporting structure for the team like the roots or trunk of a tree metaphor,2023-05-08
you mean nebula,2023-05-05
completely agree what a terrific surprise it’s been,2023-05-08

"how was the telltale game 

worth checking out if ai enjoyed the movies and the recent gotg gamee",2023-05-21
oh  i was so annoyed with gamoras character for the first part of this film but saldana just  kills it she plays the selfish idiot gamora who just blindly transmits coordinates to whoevers on the other end of her comm so  well then everything else about everything she does down to the little hop into her pants after getting off the toilet her  expressions really show her warming to peter and the guardians but its not really in your face and obvious its so subtle and natural shes incredible,2023-05-10
"i think one of the reasons is how the characters present themselves

even if he is a monster thanos never thought of himself as one everything he did he did with purpose even if that purpose was misguided and evil 

but the high evolutionary knows he is cruel and presents himself as such there isnt some endgame for him its just mad science all the way down and he knows it",2023-05-07
haha yup,2023-05-05
"in the old days the voice actors would be filmed and the animators would study how they looked to at least get inspired for how to animate the characters i dont know if gotg did that for vol 1  

for volume 2 theres a video clip where cooper is wearing somehelmet thing with what looks like a camera is filming his direct face 

i dont know about vol 3 or the infinity movies and its possible that gunn director might have tools to even further tweak the performance so definitely a team effort for the cgi characters voice motion capture animator director",2023-05-18

i mean explicitly marvel and part of it is yes i am going to see them regardless however they have been so unbelievably bad at ruining their own movies with the full trailer the second trailer the final trailer etc just the teaser is all i need to have a loose idea of what is in play,2023-05-09
i distinctly remember closing my eyes when the mad max trailers were coming out there is always a point in a trailer where they spoil everything in the movie and i try not to pay attention at that point trailers are too long,2023-05-07

that was so funny because there actually was a furry convention in the city i went to see the movie my friend and i watched a horde of furries go by our restaurant before we went to see the film that was such an odd coincidence,2023-05-06
imagine youre a supposed super genius and your best feats are earth with furries and gravity boots but with extra steps no wonder he was jealous of rocket,2023-05-13
that’s why it had to go,2023-05-06
it is a bit ironic considering they’re called the guardians of the galaxy saving the planet could’ve been incorporated into the climax by having the villain initiate the planet’s destruction once they were in space rather than while they were still on the planet then the guardians have to fight their way through the ship to stop it maybe have a moment where rocket is the one to piece together some kind of  switch to save the planet he once believed was going to be his home,2023-05-05

the finale of loki had me on the edge of my seat hanging from every word out of majors mouth not so with quantumania i really felt like kang wouldve been hyped up way more by not revealing so much about him or letting us see him throw tantrums

when he was enigmatic and eccentric in loki it carried a penetrating sense of menace to it quantumania gave none of that",2023-05-28
" gotg3 will probably be my last one felt like a good place to end it theres no more storylines that i have any interest in as a casual watcher

that scene w peter made me so mad because of the flashback of his mistake w gotg 1 in the jailbreak and calling back to the end of gotg 2 w yondu it also made me realize where tf his rocket boots went,2023-05-05
to be fair even though it was super cliché and on the nose that was basically the birth of what adam warlock will become,2023-05-05
lot of the mass deaths in this film felt hollow you barely know the animal people before they get blown up and the assistant with the data in his head just suddenly conks out before hitting the ground,2023-05-24
i’m honestly just surprised that peter as half  can’t survive in open space,2023-07-30
"i’m surprised more people aren’t complaining about adam i really enjoyed the movie a lot but if i had to name one major issue i had with it it’d be how they handled adam warlock who if they stay true to his character will become a huge role in the mcu so to have him introduced as a glorified plot device and make him look like a mama’s boy who’s always getting his  kicked except the start felt like a really weird way to introduce such a pivotal character to the universe even if he does grow

it honestly kinda felt like james felt obligated to follow up on that post credits scene despite not really going in that direction any longer",2023-05-06
i desperately wanted rocket to light him up,2023-05-13
yeah this movie has too many slow scenes that are just for the music or embarrassing emotional outbursts,2023-05-24
if war pig hadnt been killed by adam it would have been able to fly to the ship and enter before it reached the atmosphere thats how it was able to reach the guardians ship so quickly,2023-05-10

edit which i think is fine and the movie is pretty good it was a great send off for the guardians crew

what im getting at is that ive enjoyed the mcu but things are starting to get old this was a nice little send off for my devoted personal attachment quill separating from gamora and hanging out with his grandpa felt like a spiritual conclusion to me the relationship was good but its done",2023-05-05

kind of wish aleta ogord was there with stakar ogord but guess with michelle yeoh being recast for ying nan in shang chi or maybe she had a scheduling conflict nice to see they brought most of the og ravagers back though also missing ving rhames as charlie27 i think,2023-05-05
gamora and peter would’ve been dating for around four years by the time she’s killed in iw certainly not a slouch of a relationship,2023-05-09
tbf she was already alive by the end of the second film anyway,2023-05-05
i agree with you up to a point i feel like the movie established as relationship though where i would have expected gamora to stick with the guardians as her new family that she went back to the ravagers felt cheap,2023-05-05
no i agree it makes the death all that more impactful and real like this film makes infinity war all the more poignant in hindsight i just cant deny that there was a part of me that wanted the saccharine disney ending for the two of them,2023-05-05
i like to think its marvel communicating to us that they know its cheap to just keep resurrecting people and throwing them back in like nothing ever happened especially with this multiverse saga  hopefully it helps people feel more comfortable that we will never see tony steve natasha etc again,2023-05-05
sure but i feel like the whole course of the picture redid the arc of guardians 1 of gamora coming to find her family with our main characters to have her go back to the ravagers at the end felt like it placed more weight on what happened between movies than what we saw in this movie,2023-05-05
the scene where gamora finally understood groot was slightly strange how did she catch on so quickly but very heartwrenching her other teammates miss their first gamora too groot regrew up with her she was so motherly towards him in vol 2 and i think he was remembering that his “nice working with you” was such a poignant goodbye… i don’t think peter was the only one who was still having trouble letting the old gamora go,2023-05-05
yeah it was all so quick too and they didnt have enough time to spend on the aftermath in the avengers films im glad they took the time to process it here,2023-05-19
no,2023-05-06
same,2023-05-06
that’s not true gamora 1s driving force to redeem herself stems from thanos still being alive gamora 2 on the other hand has that motivation taken away from her at that same point so she headed down a different path,2023-05-06
thats what bugs me about everyone saying shes a completely different person she may not have been the same gamora from infinity war but she should essentially be the same gamora from gotg1 not that gotg1 gamora was falling all over peter but she wasnt this cold,2023-05-05
it was a joke,2023-05-05

dont forget furys motherffffff right before getting snapped to dust in the infinity war postcredits scene,2023-05-05

deadpool 3 is already confirmed to be rated r why would it only have one fbomb,2023-05-05
not a chance that’s right,2023-05-05
according to vincent d’onofrio it will still be r,2023-05-05

after the  marvel has been putting out lately guardians 2 is now like an upper tier mcu film lol,2023-05-13
i think there was some push by the john denver estate for movies that year because it also showed up in alien covenant and okja in 2017 as well,2023-05-05
is that the one where they were surfing in space that was actually pretty cool,2023-05-05
awesome scene ,2023-05-05
it was thor ragnarok for me when hela caught and crushed mjolnir why would you put that in the  trailer,2023-05-05
i do lol i got up and left when the oppenheimer trailer came out and then i was like wait it’s based on a true story sometimes they are hard to avoid like the spiderverse trailer before mario i think just went on and on showing so much,2023-05-06
i always have airpods pro’s and listen to music and close my eyes,2023-05-07
i  a lot so i always force myself to go  during the trailers in hopes i won’t have to midmovie i usually miss a trailer or two because of it so that’s one way to avoid them,2023-05-07
i usually go with friends and just focus on discussing current events recent dd sessions or just the weather very helpful and distracting,2023-05-07
quinn,2023-05-06
same here thought i thought the scene where they met in the afterlife was a little too much of a kiss but definitely can be read either way,2023-05-05
theyre a thing in the comics so mcu couldve gone all the way,2023-05-06
"starlord we know is suuuuper emotional when it comes to his family

he totally deserved it tho,2023-05-06
and drowned just to be sure,2023-05-09
i dont think he has the means anymore the guardians destroy his ship with all of his equipment on it free all of his experiments and test subjects and then leave him to die on his exploding ship,2023-05-05
not to mention the cargo hold full of kids and animals to be used for his next level of experiments  they didnt even take him to space jail or a tribunal or nothing   just  eh we win  laters,2023-05-09
his ship exploded he’s dead,2023-05-14
"woke marvel had a scene with a glam man beheading a pig

raccoons are usually smarter than rabbits not sure about otters and walruses not impossible to think that the hi improved their intelligence all by a factor of 100 so the rabbit got to the level of a  human and the otter got to an average human and rocket got to the smartest human alive,2023-05-07
im honestly surprised the answer wasnt simply because he got warm nurturing from his cage companions he was the newest of the 4 so he presumably had the better tech but i assumed he was also the only creation to have a family of sorts i legit thought they were going to explain it that way towards the end though im actually glad they didnt makes rocket just inexplicably unique,2023-05-15
they were idiots you shoot first and then you arrange the mutiny,2023-05-06
what about the marketing of this movie made you think those characters would be remotely similar at all,2023-05-05
what did you notice was poor about it,2023-05-05
he freaked me out a little i think i really bought into him when i was really ready not to,2023-05-05
i think they were a  mole rat person,2023-05-05
i thought the same thing i thought that was floor put through the evolution tube thing but i guess floor had that thing over it’s mouth i was kinda thinking it was floor and she would recognize rocket and help him take down the evolutionator or whatever his name was,2023-05-06
you’re rabbit was probably what’s all this then umm ok sure i’ll keep eating,2023-06-14
not sure i get your point there’s plenty of stuff that happens every day that doesn’t automatically make for a good movie,2023-05-05
i mean it literally introduced those characters for the sole purpose of making us sad all they talked about was being friends and someday being free surely you saw from a mile away that they were just there to get killed if this was the first film and we didn’t already understand rocket’s through excellent characterization i’d agree with you like did you come into the third movie and discover that rocket had a traumatic past where he was experimented on or did you already have all the information you needed to make him a 3dimensional character 2 movies ago and this one just beat you over the head with how traumatic his back story was rocket’s characterization has made be tear up in the first 2 movies this just made me roll my eyes and want to yell “i get it” i’d much rather have seen a movie where he was an active participant and had character development versus being a mcguffin and subject of a bunch of flashbacks that tell us what we already knew,2023-05-06
"everything you mentioned was either subtextual or just presented better by the narrative in their respective movies i was also fine with it when i knew rocket had been taken apart and put back together as what he was 

my issue is a good chunk of a movie’s runtime jamming it down my throat with the cutest friendliest sidekicks i know from the getgo were only introduced to do something  up to so i’ll know the bad guy is bad it’s just done so heavy handed if a quarter of vol 2’s runtime was extended flashbacks of ego getting alien women pregnant then murdering their children on screen so we knew he was villainous after we already knew he was the villain yeah i’d have thought that was lame too",2023-05-05
"i literally mentioned that all filmmaking is manipulative but it’s off putting when it’s done so clumsily you can see it being crammed down your throat red hanging himself in shawshank is playing with my emotions sure jackson hanging himself in a star us born and having his dog pawing at the garage in the next shot is tragedy  

movies don’t need to be sterile i’ve seen uncomfortable stuff and some of the most challenging is when it’s based on a true story so you can’t shed it as not real but what’s in vol 2 just felt juvenile doing  up stuff to animals is such low hanging fruit that it has to be done well specifically animating animals to give them kids voices and bigger shinier eyes and have them almost exclusively talk about how great friends are and how nice it will be to be free when we know from the first frame of the movie they are just trauma fodder is manipulation you can see a mile away 

we’ve known since the first one that rocket had a traumatic past that he tried to hide but obviously carried with him in ways even he wasn’t aware of  there is zero nuance or trust in the audience when an adorable otter with its arms ripped off and replaced with robot limbs getting shot in front of him as she literally talks about being his friend the instant he freed her just so we really know rocket has trauma which had already been illustrated through excellent characterization and narrative",2023-05-05
that’s such a weird take if you’ve never been close enough to someone to know they wouldn’t like a movie just say that,2023-05-06
" this is real life

no real life is real life and guardians of the galaxy is scifi fantasy they can intersect in any way the creators want and it can be really good but it reflecting reality is absolutely not an automatic argument for quality i wouldnt want vol 4 to be about peter getting radiation poisoning from being in space too long or something",2023-05-11
thank you i thought so i saw that scene but cant remember any dialogue in it i think i was too distracted because i was crying,2023-05-08
gold hahaaha,2023-05-07
gold hahaa,2023-05-07
absolutely rockets entire backstory was brutal to the point they had nebula say what they did was worse than what thanos did to her and but that point we believe it that’s definitely letting the audience marinate in how tragic rockets story is,2023-05-05
people have been reeeeing at marvel for years that it wasnt dark and broody like the dceu its funny that a guardians movie was the vehicle for a darker turn,2023-05-05
"right star lord was at deaths door gets saved and then proceeds to ask did that look cool

but sure we watched a different film",2023-05-07
always nice to have them alive for whenever they need them though,2023-05-20
take a couple updoots yondu happy cake day your brief appearance in the movie made me happy,2023-05-05
"his line when he killed that raveger then saw the small animal sad and he says something like i dont like how this makes me feel made me pretty confident hed be a saving force later comics wise hes definitely super op but this way allowed him to be apart of the movie without having to backstory an already powerful person with full agency 

he was just a kid that could  everyone but just cared about his mom",2023-05-06
which worked perfectly as a theme as all the animals were doing what the he told them without question even if it led to their death,2023-05-07
ive been developing for 23 years now and im still not done,2023-05-05
you said lol at the end of your comment which implies that its crazy for marvel to be saying he is young when he has been in the cocoon for so long we are down voting your attitude not the fact you stated,2023-05-05
lmaoo nah this is funny,2023-05-05
he has the vaguest power set  arm blasts that could destroy anything super strength and super flight  the supermancaptain marvel problem all over again,2023-05-06
i went “really adam isn’t even going to fly out there and try to save… oh ok”,2023-05-29
so would you not recommend this film to people who cried like babies after reading we3 ,2023-05-05
that kind of makes me wonder where they would have potentially had it within endgame,2023-05-12
pratt talked about it on kimmel,2023-05-06
also kang in the comics and in quantumania,2023-05-09
,2023-05-05
i would say mowing down sheep instead of corralling them is pretty pointless killing and brutal  they are animals natural to the environment there building a fence is better than a total eradication of an animal species,2023-05-09
but they werent doing animal testing with no point they were doing animal testing with the intent of making life better,2023-06-05
remains to be seen,2023-05-05
"i think without the scene where we hear him talk it could have remained ambiguous

she initially accused the guardians of pretending that they knew what groot was saying and filling in the words and by this logic she could have reached that stage of familiarity with groot at the end to fill in the words herself too

but having the audience finally hear groot speak after the journey with him implies that gamora also went through that journey and can now hear what he says for real",2023-05-06
she did at the end it surprised her to have understood what he said out of the blue,2023-05-07
i love you too dude,2023-05-05
"in case you missed it it was confirmed by gunn that was the audience also being able to understand groot

",2023-07-10
nothing goes over my head id catch it,2023-05-14
at the same time his story did end in such a way that i could see him being brought back in an eventual the unbelievable gwen poole project with the skin of his face now more closely resembling a corpse like the classic modok,2023-05-05
there was a lot of that in that movie,2023-05-06
i was admittedly confused by the face reveal halfway home i realized it was because rocket had previously “mauled” him but…it still felt odd i didn’t get the impression of rocket doing that much horrifying damage in the attack scene perhaps i’m mistaken but dang  dude looked like he went up against a shark or bear rather than a raccoon,2023-05-08
ah yeah you’re right it was a couple even sadder for some reason ,2023-05-05
keep one eye open,2023-05-06
"thanos at least understands the concept of morality and has his own moral compass even if it’s very much an evil one thanos even has some level of empathy “i know what’s like to be right and still lose all the same…”

high evolutionary has no moral compass or empathy whatsoever and his lack of understanding the emotional life of living beings is his biggest failing and why his experiments never work

rocket and his friends are able to self actualize name themselves have dreams and conceptualize a future for themselves high evolutionary’s other experiments don’t have this much which is why they can only do rote memorization rather than have conceptualization and intuition and problem solving

his inability to see rocket and his friends as successful experiments towards what he was looking for because they didn’t fit his image of perfection was his undoing in the end",2023-05-14
oh wow i didnt even catch that,2023-05-05
james gunn made it too if anything stays its probably gonna be suicide squad 2 and peacemaker canon,2023-05-07
i really hope not john cena is great in the role,2023-05-08
i still unironically think its one of the best superhero movies ever made,2023-05-05
you mean the movie that’s so connected to a new hope that it’s literally based off its opening crawl,2023-05-05
well we wouldn’t have gotten anything had gunn not come back i’m glad the actors stood up for him gunn deserved it,2023-05-05
i think the entire gog cast was in agreement to threaten to quit if gunn wasnt brought back bautista was just the only one who went public about it,2023-05-08
justice league or army of the dead,2023-05-05
yep yeah that whole situation was  it’s a shame it happened at all and delayed gotg 3 but i’m glad things were resolved and tbh that whole debacle set gunn up to now helm the dccu i’m not sure he would’ve been offered the position had the situation with disney not transpired,2023-05-05

op said first amazing trilogy in the mcu,2023-05-05
yeah i noticed the comedy shift in this one the moment where mantis was touching the space monster things could have easily been played for comedy in a worse version of this script i’m glad they allowed it to be serious and touching,2023-05-05
a movie is more than just being surprised by something  watching the story unfold and how it is told  the craftsmanship and artistry…those are the reasons why i watch movies  i don’t care about spoilers  i know some people do but i don’t get the relatively new trend of people saying a movie is ruined if they learn what happens,2023-05-05
yes it is,2023-05-06
same i’m really excited for the future of dc now peacemaker was phenomenal cena surprised the  out of me too,2023-05-10
…and he can definitely do heart and soul,2023-05-05
"honestly as much a lex has been done over half a million times on screen i would pay good money to see gunns take on him

i think its important that for supes fiest outing he has a character foil that helps him find what he stands for lobo can come in the next film as a way to match his power level but i think if they are going to do a series of films its important they put supes head to head with lex first and then let lex outsource his dirty work in the later films",2023-05-07
i’m still sad that henry got  over on a decent superman movie i trust james though so i’m along for the ride,2023-05-06
i think the fact that they made him the head of dc means they mostly trust him enough to do his own thing im sure the higher ups at wb are going to have to approve of everything before he releases it but it would take a lot for them to try to get him to change something,2023-05-05
what are the exposed muscles of the cheeks but the  of the face,2023-05-08
i guess to each their own but i didnt get that sort of intentionality behind the cut if that was the joke they failed to sell it to me,2023-05-05
the problem is that it was janes movie not thors and to be clear i like jane and i thought portman was really good in the movie it just kind of relegated thor to being the side charactercomic relief in his own movie thor had already pretty much completed his character arc in endgame and he didnt really have anywhere to go which makes it hard to write him as a serious character,2023-05-05
speaking of the goats glad they didnt appear again after chris pratt said taika left the goats for gunn to have to use in the next gotg film though love and thunder showed the goats stayed with thor the small interview chris pratt was a bit worrisome of them appearing again so soon,2023-05-05
he was everywhere on the press tour so proud of it too that’s what gets me,2023-05-06
ive said this to various friends before eternals would benefit from being a six episode tv series,2023-06-10

"who else but raimi would have a character possess his own corpse

im still shocked he was allowed to do that",2023-06-10

the direction is the only redeeming quality of mom  the script is awful hard to redeem it completely,2023-08-13
"but the rest were definitely made form the same marvel assembly line most come from eternals was just allowed to be shot different 

huh besides iron man and maybe this latest movie how are the others not the classic marvel assembly line product",2023-05-05

oh nice hope they give it a proper budgetwork with the right people cheap cg might be rough for such a thing,2023-05-05
scary movie 3 was a masterpiece though,2023-05-14
are you referring to the whedon version of justice league,2023-05-05
you mean the version of justice league that was drastically changed from snyders version to the point where it created the largest most notorious fan campaign for a directors cut that was radically different,2023-05-06
that’s really kind thank you,2023-05-11

yeah spider man is pretty average i love tom holland as peter and theres some really solid casting but at the end of the day the movies felt more like they existed to support the mcu than they did to be a trilogy like you can watch all the guardians movies without watching the rest of the mcu and have it still make sense the spider man movies feel incomplete unless youre invested in the rest of the mcu and you have a bit of existing knowledge of the other spider man movies,2023-05-13

it’s about the equivalent of the avengers eating shawarma post credit scene  i’m sure there will be a youtube cam leak of it in the next day or so,2023-05-05
i agree but it’s been so long since he did it i wonder what oppenheimer will be like considering it seems to be a normal drama more normal than prestige,2023-05-05
"truthfully i haven’t seen it does it not lean more into the war side of things correct me if i’m wrong

the way i see it the prestige is nolan’s most recent low scale movie everything after that has been pretty high scale i just wonder how  adapt after all this time",2023-05-05
"it’s easier to take a character nobody knows like the guardians or peacemaker and then do whatever you want with them” says gunn “people in every single country in the world know the story of superman” it’s one reason he turned down a superman film in 2018 — he didn’t have a take now he says he does

in regards to lesser known characters i hope he builds out supermans extended cast not just lois and jimmy and the kents steve lombard and ron troupe cat grant bibbo dan turpin and maggie sawyer etc thats what was great about superman books in the late 80s early 90s and what i liked about the animated series give him a lot of specific people he cares about that arent just leaguers,2023-05-08
that rockets first words in his little baby voice was hurts is so  grim gunn made a bleak  movie,2023-05-05
"yeah it was adam we see adam trying to power up then he passes out so drax carries him off the ship

edit according to james gunn i am wrong  

indeed it was the high evolutionary i guess adam had already regained conciousness by then",2023-05-07
isn’t that… exactly what happened he leaves a note to rocket saying he went back to get it for him,2023-05-05
"this is what happens they played dog days are over by florence and the machine

it also symbolizes guardians moving forward since its a 2000s song",2023-05-05
gunn wanted the mask and boots done after vol2 it was marvel that got it back on the other films so gunn just took an excuse out of his  to not use in gotg3 like he wanted to,2023-05-28
that too lol,2023-05-05
"also peter got snapped and endgame and this movie are set in the same year so if it broke he didnt have much time to replace it or find backups

he was also devastated post endgame so he probably just didnt care about the mask",2023-05-20
when he made the first movie no one believed it would actually work and he made it happen he deserved to be able to tell his own trilogy and not have to shorthorn in the mcu beyond the infinity stone,2023-05-05
and the movie is so much better for it,2023-05-05

"then you were not paying attention

its marvel its not like a real movie its very superficial",2023-05-08
"what else nebula telling us what he went through was worse than what thanos did to her doesnt really count as meaningful character development

theres a reason why hes presented as reasonably happy with friends until their deaths

why he sees said friend in his near death experience

the deaths are what lead him to attack mask guy to escape and ultimately to seek him out  him and free other animals from similar fate

you dont have to like it but thats the movie dont know what you were watching

edit nevermind that the supposed fundamental characters who have shaped him are never even remotely alluded to at any other point in any other movie before now

at least the torture is referenced in gotg 1 and we see his scars repeatedly but these characters were just whipped up to elicit more emotion because aw he killed the cute animal friends

lazy lazy garbage",2023-05-06

"while we’re busy  each other off here i’m going to keep going the action was not good or entertaining the same way it was in earlier films the weird furry world was just straight up bizarre and uncomfortable the rocket plot flashback plot was really  weird like why are we establishing a backstory in third movie in the series it was entirely unnecessary but it seems like they knew people would be there to see rocket and i’ll bet they had some kind of poll testing that showed kids identified with rocket the most so they installed a kronenberg pixar movie in the middle of it 

agreed on the sound track the cgi was definitely not up to par i think this whole film is a victim of scope creep so they ended up with a polltested built for trailer weak movie that frankly is completely unlike the previous films in the series",2023-05-06
i guess thats like your opinion man  i think vol 2 is better than the first,2023-05-06
"yes you are  i wanted to hate it  yet it seems like it wasnt perfect but better than 2 although that could be the opening weekend feelings kicking in  i thought i was immune though  

i didnt even want to be a booster for this film after number 2  i would rather not support the modern mcu financially  and i havent  i actually bought tickets to are you there  its me mario instead  then walked into this film  it was convenient timing that i was at the theater at that time",2023-05-05

i’m just saying from a disney mcu standard it’s not being considered in the top half of their movies sure mcu sets the bar high and this has been well received but i’m saying it’s on par with some of the best entries in the mcu and critics are not saying that,2023-05-05
oh i thought i heard die lowered just cut out by the next line but maybe i was wrong,2023-05-05
the word “die” being used is in no way shape or form going to make a difference between a movie getting a pg13 or an r,2023-05-05
i’m trying to say it didn’t look like an actual disfigured face it was more cartoony then how it would actually work,2023-05-22
also the fact that one of the first things he said when waking up was wheres nebs,2023-05-08
and mantis looking over  she didnt need her empath powers to realize what nebula had been going through emotionally at that point,2023-05-08
when gamora shouted “i’m family” and she yelled “so is he” you could feel how much her foundfamily meant to her,2023-08-27
she even said it was worse than what thanos did to her,2023-08-27
technically the ponds are the best companion amy is my favorite by far but she wouldnt be the same without the last centurion backing her up,2023-05-08
well you specifically said karen gillan,2023-05-08
no the opening scene of avengers endgame where tony is on the ship with just nebula having survived and hes barely alive and she puts a blanket on him as he finishes his last recording and seemingly is about to die it was a tender moment we hadnt really seen of her yet but perfectly sets off who she becomes in gotg3 not someone devoid of emotion just reserved,2023-06-13
why does no one understand this lol it’s amazing,2023-05-12
this is the “official discussion” thread seems strange to receive so many down votes for a little bit of dissidence,2023-05-15
or maybe he wanted to modify everyone else except his own due to his superiority complex,2023-05-14
he had to be ready to meet starlord in a face off,2023-07-12
"the point was he could have easily fixed his own face but he was so deluded that what he was doing was a gift to the universe that he doesnt spend any time on himself 

he mentions that after he got attacked by rocket he gave himself gravity powers by  spending one second on myself ",2023-08-12
hes been outsmarting the he for awhile now just had to grow up so it was physically a fair fight,2023-05-13
i do wish they gave more fight time to he tho the warlock fight adam is absolutely wrecking every guardian but he gets his  handed to him and they make a big deal to show he being stronger than adam warlock so its weird,2023-07-18
it be so emotionally powerful is why people love it not in spite of it,2023-05-27
its not just a movie trope she knew exactly how powerful he was there was no reason she shouldve thought pointing a gun at him would accomolish anything,2023-05-14
he has a scene early in the movie where hes complaining about how they thought rocket was dead,2023-05-14
he may have been but probably because his latest creation needed the thing inside rocket brain,2023-05-13
it would have been so   if he was just alibaba thanos instead of having his own goals,2023-05-08
fo me the first gotg movie is one of the best in the whole mcu,2023-05-23
"holy   youre right  i cant believe theres 4 thor movies already  but yeah love and thunder  

gonna fix my comment thanks",2023-05-15
"yeah the guy owns an intergalactic corporation that makes the best genetic and cybernetic implants in the universe

hes basically tony stark without a shred of decency and 10000 more egotism",2023-05-25
still makes for an effective showcase of his villainy when peter confronts him about the drug deal instead of making excuses he just goes youre right torches the whole thing,2023-08-05
same with creep,2023-05-21
bruh just finished the movie and thought that part was  up how are you supposed to get over someone who died when they’re right there in front of you,2023-05-25
my secret weapon is having a very bad memory,2023-05-10
assigned seats are a relatively recent thing im talking about the before times,2023-07-20
"theres a scene where gamora basically says the person youre describing isnt me it sounds a lot more like her

and then peter and nebula have a very awkward moment between the two of them where he looks at her for a bit she gets mad at him and asks what hes looking at her for and to knock it off

theres more to the scene which i wont ruin for you but there is definite tension between the two of them and karen gillan said she thinks that nebula has this crush on him but she doesnt really know how to process it or anything since emotions are hard for her for obvious reasons james gunn also said that that he agrees with that assessment",2023-05-20
a true bro sis,2023-08-17
yeah i think thats a good point actually i actually hesitated to use the word pity because it didnt fit but i cant think of the perfect word to describe what you just did maybe it is just best described as his paternal instincts,2023-05-09
bro thats all i could think about because i  loved bmo so much,2023-06-17
guardians children and others like rocket everyone 3,2023-05-19
i had to check the va i was sure it was bmo with a russian accent,2023-05-16
i also checked to see if it was the va of bmo its not,2023-07-11
nice such a great choice good dog cosmo,2023-07-10
did you ever get a chance to check,2023-06-28
i think id remember if someone called milton was with us,2023-05-16
ive never read the comics so until they called her cosmo the second time i just kept calling her laika in my head,2023-05-17
what do you mean she lived happily ever after with cosmo,2023-05-14
hypoxia isn’t the worst way to go out it’s actually rather peaceful the presence of carbon dioxide makes it horrific though,2023-05-14
absolutely ridiculous but still a ton of fun and its like what 40 minutes,2023-05-09
a movie gave a rabbit robot spider legs and a  bane mask and i  teared up when it died amazing,2023-05-14
"my wife couldn’t take those scenes and we ended up leaving just before that scene good thing too that scene would’ve wrecked her for weeks had to go see the movie by myself later 

i think gunn knew he had to make a truly abhorrent villain to stand out well done",2023-05-26
thats true i hope marvel continue to let the directors and writers do their thing and not interfere with the movie so they dont all feel the same id suffered from marvel fatigue before this movie and havent seen the last few but im thinking of going back and watching some of them now,2023-05-10
they annihilated a copypaste of earth and all its inhabitants this movie was ruthless and succeed completely at making me hate the main vilain and be totally be impressed by rocket choice to not give a f,2023-08-13
the statue,2023-09-05
same the hurts and him shaking just keeps popping into my head and i want to cry all over again,2023-05-09
im a 32 year old dude and i was barely holding myself together to be fair my best buddy is my pet rabbit so yeah  that was rough,2023-05-17
its really disturbing and   up they were pretty much children and seeing their bodies like that was just a bit much for me ngl,2023-05-13
pugs and pit bulls yeah,2023-08-07
teefs was drax for sure floor was definitely the mantis or even groot her little panic attack wrecked me,2023-05-10
"ive had one before though i know people can experience them in different ways im just curious why it seems to be a common perception of what was going on over just plain freaking out floor never really struck me as being overly anxious

or at least the main difference for myself between freaking out and a panic attack is when the reaction doesnt match the situation like when ive had one i know i shouldnt be reacting to a situation like this but i cant help it",2023-05-05
she has died in the comics several times,2023-08-21
i can roll with that that seems like something he would do,2023-05-05
he made a med pack that wouldnt cure himself,2023-05-11
plot hole or plot device but the medkits also didnt heal rockets scars or hide any of the various cybernetic enhancements idk,2023-05-05
"character decisions usually aren’t plot holes there are lots of ways to explain why the he didn’t heal his face

it’s possible that all his treatments to prolong his life come at the cost of not being able to be operated on with normal technology

another explanation is that he was choosing to leave his face like that until he killed rocket as a constant reminder of his goal

or he might have enjoyed wearing the mask either as a symbol of unattainable perfection or as a means of intimidating his staff

definitely isn’t a plot hole in any case pick whichever interpretation you prefer although you can argue that the film should’ve explained it which is a valid criticism even if i disagree",2023-05-06
in his work he never actually tried to fix anything he throws away each previous iteration and starts anew so i think it’s entirely in character that he would simply create a new superior face than to fix the broken one,2023-05-07
"thats not what a plot hole is there are innumerable possible explanations and it doesnt fundamentally break the logic or physics of the world

not everything thats unexplained is a plot hole the term has become completely meaningless",2023-05-07
those children some of them had mirrored  marks scars maybe he was experimenting on regenerative technology but scars where still being left behind,2023-05-07
i got the feeling that the medpacks were a quick and dirty method of healing like it would keep you from actively dying but its gonna leave scars and severe wounds are still going to require quality medical attention later on the wound that rocket inflicted on he though gnarly and satisfying was mostly a matter of plastic surgery his method was probably the best he had in terms of resemblance and functionality,2023-05-12
"i think maybe there was a scene explaining it that was cut he definitely got some sort of treatments in the flashbacks that hurt him and made him weak before his face gets  up 

in the comics he changed his genome to be the pinnacle of evolution so maybe he was also uplifting himself all the time and treating his  injuries might have interfered with that",2023-05-11
he did “fix” his face with that mask it was sufficient for him,2023-05-13
oh man saving private ryan was  hilarious,2023-05-27
what does this even mean since it’s a movie they’ll have directions to move or stay still after the stunt,2023-05-07
scooby doo bruh,2023-05-19
since when was a sponge considered sentient,2023-05-08
"point out where in his comment he says he appreciates that ayesha died

hes referring to the high evolutionaries quick death in the third act",2023-05-17
"do you realize were floating in space 

love that song and it was so appropriate",2023-05-14
again were good thanks,2023-05-15
if you look up at the conversation ive already addressed this exact quote thanks for the input,2023-06-05
so full of ,2023-06-10
it wasn’t subtle,2023-05-09
how did adam defy physics in that scene i thought he could fly through space so i figured it was him doing his thing,2023-06-10
about as subtle as zack snyder s jesus imagery for superman,2023-05-09
really you were worried about that,2023-05-15
i think they’re referring to the line early on about how the he pulled him from his cocoon too early that would seem to imply he’s not at his full strength,2023-05-07
"in the comics they can’t really be destroyed they come back on their own 

they are part of the universe and always exist",2023-05-07
and by that point in the story hes just trying to get rocket no matter what so until hes blown up in the ship theres no time for him to talk about his feelings or anything,2023-05-15
i always thought rockets name was inspired by the beatles song rocky raccoon and at least wikipedia says its true  i also believe lucas named chewbacca after chewing tobacco,2023-05-20
also felt like a direct thank you to rockets comic book creator bill mantlo from james gunn,2023-08-05
he was an owner of knowhere briefly and is therefor a landlord in space a star lord if you will,2023-08-12
thor is also a himbo,2023-05-11
if you go to google and look up what species is rocket you will find out that he is what’s called a halfworlder,2023-05-14
they’re saving that for the beetlejuice remake,2023-05-29
ah dang i see thank you,2023-05-07
almost never return of the king in imax and the discussion 70mm showing of hateful eight are the only two movies ive ever experienced an intermission in,2023-05-08
ive never been to a film with an intermission,2023-05-12
i know of one cinema in britain that does it an  comes up through the floor and is played,2023-06-04
"pfff sounds like a scam to sell more food and drinks that would totally wreck the pacing of the movie since hollywood movies arent written to accommodate for an intermission

between movies

this would be better worded as in the middle of movies between movies implies that there are 2 movies with a break in between them i dont mean any offense im just guessing that youre learning english and thought you might appreciate the feedback if thats not the case then sorry ignore me",2023-05-24
its incredibly dark and yet also a bit funny that ego apparently has the power to woosh brain cancer someone,2023-05-05
even worse it was “you might make me feel not alone in this world and not do my evil plan… boom cancer”,2023-05-06
i think i “love” you here’s some cancer,2023-05-06
we literally saw him in one movie ur comparing him to thanos who’s been in the mcu for years,2023-08-05
it’s unfortunate that ds2 ended up being  there was a ton of potential that just got wasted at least guardians 3 actually went there with the horror elements,2023-05-13
it was hard to tell but i think so too it moved its head around like a bird,2023-05-07
there’s no way that wasn’t intentional same with groot’s head on legs and the thing,2023-05-29
didnt he lose his celestial abilities after ego died,2023-05-07
"is everyone ignoring the fact that multiple ships had their windshield shattered and exposed to the vacuum of space with no ill effects

dont think space was taken too seriously whatsoever in this movie sort of took me out tbh and im no stickler for movie logic but thats one of you know the most basic things about open space",2023-05-11
the swelling is from internal gasses boiling off due to lack of pressure when the pressure returns the gas should reincorporate although i don’t know what you’d look like afterward,2023-05-08
"people dont freeze like that in space the swelling was more realistic because the molecules in his blood would be turning to gas much like the bends but people have survived way worse bends than that for way longer than that same thing happens when you ascend from deep sea diving its caused by pressure changes 

theres no medium in space to transfer the cold so you would suffocate long before your radiated enough heat to freeze 

odds are he would most likely survive with few maybe some nerve damage in his face despite what you see in tv humans absolutely could spend a 30 seconds in the vacuum of space and be basically no worse off other than it would be painful",2023-05-07
"my only understanding is that adam passed some of his powers to him to heal

x200b

though its left so vague",2023-05-06
magic healing packs,2023-05-06
he is half  and they have magic medpak who cure anything,2023-05-12
he lost connection to egos powers but he likely has his own that he just isn’t able to cultivate yet ego wouldn’t need him if he didn’t have his own power to contribute,2023-05-07
he lost the powers but i thought he had to be near ego to activate them in the first place and he was still able to hold the power stone for a while without dying in the first movie i don’t think he lost whatever formidability allowed him to do that,2023-05-07
he lost his powers but when he was previously resistant to the vacuum of space was he using powers or was it just his physiology provided some resistance,2023-05-21
i mean humans have survived being in a vacuum before suffocation is your only serious short term danger temperature is the second but youd get serious frostbiteburns way before you actually start to die,2023-05-21
"somehow had a new one in iw

something tells me he didnt like that decision 

but on the other hand the helmetboots add to peter as a superhero they make him more competent and if hes squaring off against thanos i get why the russos would want star lord to have all of his powersgadgets",2023-05-12
plus he has a super tech genius raccoon friend who could probably repair it using scraps in the junk drawer,2023-05-06
was minorly annoyed that warlock legit pulverized his face in the opening scene and he’s perfectly fine on the ship right after,2023-05-20
he takes the cake up there with hela ego and thanos imo,2023-05-26
love  thunder valhalla moon knight field of reeds the soul stone eternius the whole progression of legitimate gods,2023-05-28
id say the fascist experience as well dont forget the japanese experimental units of ww2 just completely callous and uncaring experimentation and torture of people they didnt even consider human,2023-05-07
"necroreply but this is something ive really noticed between dc and marvel comics

dc is all about hope and ideals marvel is all about trauma and oppresion

although funnily enough both spiderman and batman probably their two most popular characters atm go pretty against the grain for their respective comics peter parker is just a good guy who doing the right thing despite the rest of the marvel universe being  and batman is always trying not to fall over that fine line due to his parental damage",2023-05-25
had this feeling throughout,2023-05-07
i found myself thinking i never thought id feel bad over a cgi experimented bunny something about how helpless she sounds hits home to me,2023-05-11
what were your other 2,2023-05-19
the voice acting directing and especially the cgi artists involved with that gave one of the best performances of the year,2023-05-31
she was fighting her bunny instincts of running away ,2023-05-14
oh i hate you so much bro ,2023-05-14
necro but she was wandering towards the opening and out of her crate during the scene before the shooting started,2023-06-19
i used my sleeve a couple of times petanimal lovers are in for a rough time with this movie,2023-05-10
 relax bud teens are the worst but we were all teens at some point being a  16 year old doesnt make someone a sociopath,2023-05-14
me too floor reminded my of one of my bunnies ,2023-05-08
im on my way home from watching it and im going to do the same thing when i see my cats,2023-05-07
baby rocket was tough knowing his friends were never gonna see the sky was worse but his friend dying in his arms shattered me was like seeing ppl during the holocaust get experimented on by doctors gave me schindlers list vibes,2023-05-10
make it three started crying at baby rocket and basically never stopped i always cray at animal scenes in movies so the whole thing got me literally used all my popcorn napkins for tears  i feel exhausted,2023-05-10
i’m still thinking about it 6 days later  your dog sounds wonderful poor little guy as do you and really mirrors poor rockets journey  what has struck me on reflection is both how hard and challenging watching his back story is but how much that mirrors pet ownership  understanding that an animal is capable of boundless love no matter their trauma and when you love them you don’t just get the good times and fun really loving another creature means seeing it through to the bitter crushing end as difficult as it might be  and now i’m tearful again,2023-05-14
i think we need james gunn to send us “we survived “rocket teefs floor” shirts,2023-05-07

"ae houseman many many years ago wrote a poem called “terence this is  stuff” regarding his friends complaining about some of his poetry being dismal or sober here is a good stanza from it

is not so brisk a brew as ale  
out of a stem that scored the hand  
i wrung it in a weary land

but take it if the smack is sour  
the better for the embittered hour  
it should do good to heart and head  
when your soul is in my souls stead

lol for real if a teenager told their friends they couldnt handle a guardians of the galaxy movie theyd be bullied for being a massive wuss into the locker you go theyd say and theyd be right to do it,2023-05-05

"“you were the one who wanted to win and i just wanted a sister”

nebula became my favorite mcu character with that line alone she was so good in this too",2023-05-07
"idk draxs moment with mantis where she reveals his sadness and pain he hides on the inside is the greatest drax moment for me

its the reason why mantis never looks down on drax and form such a core relationship with him in the first place 

i say gotg 2 for me define the emotional core of drax for me in that film

taserface on the other hand is just a meme lol",2023-05-09
i honestly wasnt even aware that gotg2 was hated i thought it was fantastic,2023-05-29
no,2023-05-09
probably influenced by james joyce,2023-05-09
"yeah that scene where the guy gets his face ripped off or a bunch of animals dying

definitely made for kids  yep uh huh 

humor isnt bad in films but when the humor doesnt land or isnt funny like in gotg2 its a slog to sit through",2023-05-09
"making it perfectly reasonable to the draw the conclusion that either 

a starlord had extra and that’s what he was using in infinity war and endgame

b starlord got a new one between vol 2 and infinity war",2023-05-07
he fights to protect life its kind of crazy that he would let his anger allow thanos to break free,2023-05-12
"in retrospect i think even if they had managed to take it off that wouldnt have worked long term mantis and everyone would eventually have to let go anyways and none of them were equipped to use the gauntlet 

thanos even without the stones is extremely difficult to take down and even then it would only be a temporary setback eventually he would take the stones back and use it only this time theres a good chance half the avengers are killed and if they permanently lost tony thanos wins",2023-05-05
" it had to happen for them 

for iron man and capt america to get all the glory",2023-05-21
i think the issue with their depiction in infinity war stems from what is imo the worst part of vol 2 i love this trilogy as a whole but vol 2 is one of my least favorite mcu movies on its own whether it be gunn’s own doing or studio meddling everyone in vol 2 were caricatures of themselves and the humor ruined a lot of the serious beats of the film for me  infinity war always seemed like the russos just took that and ran with it,2023-05-06
shoot him in the face bro mantis was on his shoulders,2023-05-08
"in vol 2 he was going for the  and you may say he couldnt  ego anyways because hes a celestial but remember that by that point peter had only seen the human version of ego and had no way of knowing that his human form would work different than an actual human body and regenerate by this point they knew so little about ego that it would be easy to speculate that his consciousness resided on that humanlike vessel he was definitely trying to  him 

in iw instead he just punches thanos like an idiot because the plot needed a way to get thanos out of trouble",2023-05-11
except he actually beat ego so that was the right call,2023-05-06
i sub to a youtube channel called celtic warrior workouts it’s wwe wrestler sheamus showing workouts from other athletes but mostly other wrestlers he has an episode with dave bautista and dave says he actually doesn’t like being big since switching to acting,2023-05-06
"being in his mid 50s

is he going to die o",2023-05-09
agreed  the rock is pretty close to the same age but he loves the gym life and juicing,2023-05-22
i mean his torso is covered up most the holiday special and this one you can tell that he put that in his contract lol,2023-05-14
i hated how they made him so goofy in gotg 2 but thankfully they seemed to shift the goofiness to mantis and let him be similar to the humor from gotg 1,2023-05-06
"he was cheated on getting any kind of revenge on thanos in endgame 

they at least couldve acknowledged it with a joke",2023-05-06
which is sad because ive loved nebula becoming integrated with them since endgame yes technically vol 2 but mostly endgame when she connected with tony stark and worked with the avengers things really started to click with me when nebula had that line to rocket about the idiot in the landing zone antman and his tacos,2023-05-06
i think it means separating so they can individually appear in different marvel projects without needing to hire the entire team,2023-05-07
nebula is in charge of the guardians headquarters so shes closer by than the others,2023-05-12
gameplay was so and so but the writing was truly spectacular every member of the guardians is better written in the game drax quill and gamora in particular benefit from the long form of the game drax is a competent strategist and negotiator quills importance as glue that holds the team together and his actual leadership cant be overstated and gamora is actually believable as a master assassin shes also much more likeable,2023-05-18
starlord dying because he went back to grab his ipod would be in character though,2023-05-07
whoops typo meant to say trauma,2023-05-05
"facts tonys death was a different kind of sad he willingly sacrificed himself for the overall good of everyone around him he died and everything was better afterwards 

its a completely different story in this movie none of these animals chose this life they spent all their time in a cage tortured experimented on disregarded as being a part of a new perfect world only ever finding solace in each other by being together only for them to get caught in the crossfire of rockets traumatizing breakdown which in turn leads to even more heartbreak and devastation in rockets life i dont think theres anything in the marvel cinematic universe that comes close to being as sad and heartbreaking as rockets backstory was",2023-05-06
absolutely this movie really brought the franchise to a darker reality than it ever has before it’s definitely a backstory thats gonna stick with you and certainly one of the most devastating,2023-05-06
and that is why i stopped watching trailers can take all the suspense out of scenes if you remember a scene the character is in that hasn’t happened yet,2023-05-10
he pretended to want to study 89p13s brains for creativity he desperately wanted to  the one thing that was smarter than him and put the brain in a jar,2023-05-05
"it looked like he came in the room  there 

theres a brief throwaway line by one of his assistants about how he came out of treatment i think early to find out what was going on 

he probably has relied on regular superboxofhealing visits to stay fit over the years",2023-05-05
i thought it was pretty clear he went on a drinking binge at the idea of one of his creations outsmarting him which just fed into what rocket said high evolutionary was never really interested in perfection,2023-05-06
how dare you call rocket gross,2023-05-05
i know there was some line from his mentats or whatever  like sire the treatment isnt complete you must return to the lab but it read more to me like he went and got  after realizing one of his repulsive failed experiments was better than him,2023-05-10
"i took it as he didnt expect a scene to actually make him hate the villain of the movie lol

like everyone knows hes the villain and you kind of just watch and wait for him to lose at the end but then you get a scene like that just makes you hate the character and actively root against him lol",2023-05-06
yeah shortly before shiv realises tom betrayed them,2023-05-05
true but at the same time it just goes to show you just how vile ego truly is all that he ever cared about was progeny capable of having his powers with their mothers simply being afterthoughts something to be discarded once they have served their purpose attachment is the last thing ego wants after all,2023-05-08
"but at the same time ego is ego

ego makes people into monsters

its the just because i can mentality that comes with a power trip",2023-05-08
see bondrewd from made in abyss,2023-05-07
"whatever thanos did to nebula he atleast cared for her a tiny bit somewhere in his heart 

not as much as gamora bit still 

both ego and high evolutionary saw peter and rocket as only tools for implementing their plan",2023-05-07

jennifer holland and i only just noticed her on a second viewing,2023-05-07
nah they filmed his peacemaker cameo on the guardians set,2023-05-07
thanks i couldnt recall seeing him but i only ever saw it once,2023-05-05
also reappeared for a few seconds near the end raising a glass to santino dantonio the brother and main villain,2023-05-05
and mantis ,2023-05-06
gamora going off on quill trying to force her to be something for him was like zoe saldana thinking back to a time in her life there because i felt that hard,2023-05-06
you have to take into account its not just the trilogy the infinity duology did a lot of character development for them too,2023-05-12
no it doesnt deserve the credit as one of the best trilogies at all it was just generic superhero movies with juvenile humor and it didnt get better each movie because second film was bad because of gunns style it will age like milk in the future it wont be even remembered unlike great triologies like lotr,2023-05-07
actually most of those elements were praised by critics and fans especially cinematography,2023-05-09
"i thought their personalities were pretty different other than their uncontrollable temper and were both acted pretty well with what they were given 

sadly everything else about them was too similar similar power set motivation even clothes i’m not familiar with he in the comics so i’m not sure what he looks like or does  but it’s just unfortunate that these last two mcu movies just so happens to have villains that are so similar to one another",2023-05-06
the scene where he’s sitting in the back of the bus after the prison escape and there’s a focus on him just staring at the camera is burned into my mind,2023-05-07
ezra miller has been through the courts already and at this point theyre just being kept under lock and key because dc has like half a billion dollars already invested in the flash movie,2023-05-07
if you’ve ever read his sort of fake autobiographical novel “the toy collector” it would not shock you,2023-06-25
"he shouldn’t have taken it on then i liked force awakens but he completely ignores george’s original story idea and just went on to remake new hope 

i’m still annoyed johnson took it in despite not even liking star wars baffles me that it was even entertained let alone allowed full production and the worst thing about it was he could have made a really cool version looper was such a cool sci fi movie",2023-05-07
does deadpool or dp2 not fall under the disney mcu umbrella genuine question i’m not terribly familiar with the ins and outs but the movies are mcu cannon and have a ton of f bombs,2023-05-15
,2023-05-06
half of wf was an award winning movie  it felt very bipolar  the parts that had to tie in with the rest of the mcu felt really weak  but then you saw other parts where cooglers touch really shone through,2023-05-06
wf was incredible what are you talking about nobody was saying this when it came out,2023-05-07
exactly  its not like harrison ford didnt say he was done with star wars and indiana jones in the past before reprising both roles,2023-05-05
"theyre done like chris evans is done which means taking a very long break 

i predict chris evans will do a captain america the 1970s tv show before 2030",2023-05-06
he has endless family obligations,2023-05-26
"zoe says shes done playing gamora for good but that she hopes another actress gets to take on the role in the future

shes going to go spend the next 10 years making blue alien cat movies  thats mocap so no makeup",2023-05-06
the makeup probably but i would take 7 more of these instead,2023-05-06
if i remember correctly they said there’s gonna be a big time jump in between avatars 34 so it’s possible she won’t even be in avatar 4 and onwards since 23 were shot backtoback that means that if that ends up being the case she’s also done with avatar too,2023-05-07
"nah i think you missed the point of them not getting back together

the attraction she had for peter was sparked by the very specific interactions they had in the first 2 movies interactions that this version of gamora will never have   it can never be the same because shell always have the elephant in the room of peter expecting her to fall in love with him again based on a relationship she never experienced or participated in  it would never be an equal relationship of two people who have had all the same experiences together and there would always be a sense of insecurity  if they ever had a fight or disagreement and theres an implication that its because of an unfair expectation by peter based on his past with the original gamora that just would be hella awkward

they arent soul mates times not immutable etc  they dont need to be together  this gamora went from 2014 prior to meeting quill to now having spent 3 years with the ravagers  and now quill wants her to continue a relationship with a guy she doesnt know in place of a different person   imagine some person you dont know telling you that you had been dating for 45 years and pressuring you to continue that relationship",2023-05-10
yea but who could resist those eyes,2023-05-06
"i really loved nebulas line about it because it did a great job showing that he wasnt actually crushing on her but just traumatized and lonely

stop looking at me like a lost puppy looking for somewhere soft to lie down",2023-05-08
yeah in the second movie you find out that yondu’s ravagers aren’t really ‘ravagers’ as they’re been exiled for breaking the rules that’s why they’re all scumbags who would turn on yondu and space anyone that would stand by him in a heartbeat,2023-05-07
on twitter gunn said he doesnt have the mask cause they were in a hurry and he left it in his room  explanation imo,2023-05-08
lol,2024-01-10
"i went to see a collection of props and costumes from the mcu movies and they had rdjs racing suit from iron man 2

i never realized how tiny he is",2023-05-09

left his  in a ship that exploded though,2023-08-05
"again i am familiar with “watership down” also “dumbo” “charlotte’s web” “secret of nimh” “old yeller” and whatever other kids’ movie y’all want to bring up i’m 59 years old i’ve seen all of the classics 

what is the point are you trying to say that i shouldn’t be upset by gotg3 because traumatizing kids’ films exist those others have brief moments of pain gotg3 kept coming back to it 

also i had put down my beloved cat shortly before i saw it so i hope you’ll understand why i was not receptive to multiple scenes of animal abuse",2023-08-25
im not a fan of undercutting serious moments with humor typically either but this honestly fits so well i wouldn’t doubt if it was in a draftalternate take of that scene,2023-05-15
"nah drax told rocket to  him but otherwise didnt say anything

edit spelling mistake",2023-05-06
"thats the humor the entire time its not him referencing the movie that comes at the end with gunn doing it  

down voting me over a hot take on a marvel movie is probably the saddest someones life will ever be",2023-05-05
dr fishy no,2023-05-07
 how does this still make me laugh even in written form,2023-05-10
not fatally it seems,2023-06-12
that kid was abused you can tell you can always tell,2023-05-14
well yeah thats the way every movie justifies why the protagonists decide against killing the main villain at the final hour doesnt mean its really the right choice especially in this case where this guys death means theres one less genocidal torturous influence on the world especially when they are fine killing those following him and the poor beings hes experimented and mutilated,2023-05-28
"he believed himself to be the pinnacle of perfection and smartest being in the room

rocket showed him in his final moments not only was he smarter than him he was better in every single way",2023-05-05
and those henchmen worked for guy who killed planets multiple times he admitted to do this not first time so they saw it and knew who they are working for in that medical company they tried not to  anyone,2023-05-06
"true not much to do about that though they had to prioritize saving everybody else first and there just wasnt enough time

i figure the high evolutionary survived though because the villain always does you know",2023-05-06
if youre talking about the security officer tbf he just got yeeted wasnt really clear if that was fatal,2023-06-19
nah,2023-05-11
"coldblooded  is pretty much always evil the he was laying on the ground wounded and defenseless

plus obviously he was going to die when the ship exploded in a few minutes so it’s not like rocket was letting him live he was just saying that he’s no longer consumed by anger and doesn’t need to personally  the he to have closure

your interpretation is really shallow in my opinion but maybe i’m missing something can you explain why exactly you think rocket should have murdered the he instead of letting him die a few minutes later",2023-05-06
i dont think it was rocket thinking killing was bad but moreso hed get more justice out of it by letting him live cant interrogate dead people,2023-05-05
yeah but not a marvel movie and especially the third in a trilogy  hard to have a one off here,2023-05-05
"like fr tho

i think being a scientist that actively kidnaps and tortures people then goes on to genocide their living creations deserves a bullet to the head

nothing about doing in morality or legality the world just doesnt need you in it",2023-05-13
borderline fascistic thinking “ohh they are only mass killing those people well at least it isn’t us the people that matter”,2023-05-11
guess you missed the parts where he said he was going to do it again missed that he had a whole organic space station too,2023-05-05
watching detroit you realize why he was considered for the role of pennywise,2023-05-07
directed by kathryn bigelow and starring john boyega  how did this fly under my radar  thanks for mentioning this movie,2023-05-14
hes in the bear as well,2023-10-10
that was his name well he almost deserved it,2023-05-06
he made that movie so  funny,2023-05-06
same absolutely loved that movie when it came out,2023-05-06
who threw that at me,2023-05-11
figuring out a way to convey the right emotion with a variation of i am groot probably gets a little frustrating at some point  considering how many times he says it throughout the mcu movies and how each has been completely different,2023-05-06
mf has to say the lines thousands of times for each movie idk…,2023-05-06
always wondered how much he got paid for his one line and saying “i love you”,2023-05-15
"people should check out behind the scenes of him acting his  off in a recording booth playing rocket dude didn’t half  it

maybe i just missed it from all the tears ,2023-05-06
velma for me,2023-05-16
"a great film to watch is earthlings gog3 gave me similar vibes  

really advocates for animals a voice to the voiceless the only different in gog is that they could speak but the innocence and ability to feel pain fear and suffering in a sentient way is still true in real life",2023-05-12

,2023-05-05
i mean he tried to get rid of the insane persona that seems like a good enough reason as any for said persona to  him up,2023-05-07
i mean imagine living to heaths performance as the joker but somehow joaquin phoenix knocked it out of the park but still they are very different jokers,2023-05-13
especially since most of the rest of the mcu output since endgame is largely skipping over the fact that it happened at all and not addressing the yawning rifts that an event like that would actually drive through the middle of basically every culture and society for multiple generations,2023-05-08
james clearly rewatched all the movies and the fan criticisms when writing this film,2023-05-17
"he just assumed she died since she was outside drax and mantis were supposed to be on the ship

when he realizes it was nebula on comms his expression was fitting",2023-05-07
her communicator code not the lock code,2023-05-16
cosmo and kraglin beefing for most of the movie because cosmo couldnt stand not being a good dog was gradea comedy,2023-05-06
here groot you know what to do with these,2023-05-06
while this is true its been confirmed that groot called rocket dad while he was being dusted i loved the movie and understand its pretty stuffed but my biggest flaw with it was there was little in the way of rocketgroot connection,2023-05-05
you’re right it’s not it’s still “groot” but this is a whole new groot with new memories so they’re probably not as close,2023-05-05
i was going to add that gamaora was already dead but since the other person was saying they bonded it was obvious they just typed the wrong name so it didnt seem necessary,2023-05-05
agreed i hate every single thing except normal reactions like laughter over the top  just makes the movie worse,2023-05-12
yeah its not bad,2023-05-21
i truly think this movie showcased some of the absolute best acting the mcu has to offer particularly cooper being able to channel that much raw emotion into a character that doesn’t even have his body or face that scream was  visceral and i felt that in my bones which is a lot to be said for what on screen is a  raccoon,2023-05-15
i just saw an interview with him about it but he’s never on set and only voices after the fact i imagine they do broad strokes movement of rocket and maybe tweak based on his performance idk,2023-05-18
"nope groot 1 canonically dies at the end of guardians of the galaxy 1 and the groot we see afterwards is a planted seed from the og groots remains basically groot 2

gunn and raimi have been two gems that i’ve really enjoyed this go around saw both movies in theaters by myself in the middle of the day and i left both on a real high totally different movies but loved them just the same,2023-05-07
and now my dog needs operation,2023-05-05
hello why you kick my dog,2023-05-06
shes lying shes lying to you you  guy,2023-05-08

or they save the cat which then goes on to torture the dog as cats do,2023-05-06
you get jamie lannister,2023-08-07
look we need him to deage magneto and i would really like to let reed richards have a go at wrecking his ego then the high evolutionary has my permission to die,2023-05-06
it is a great short film  a wonderful throwback to the universal monsters of yesteryear,2023-05-05
yep it’s a good one only 56 minutes too so you won’t be wasting too much time if you don’t care for it but i think you’ll dig it,2023-05-05
its a fun romp its also directed by michael giacchino the oscar winning composer its quite fun and a short 45 minutes ish,2023-05-20
im just confused how he got through wall pigs weapon scanning mechanism,2023-06-19
at least it was for whats probably gonna be a mediocre movie it looked so bland and product placementy,2023-06-04
that shot has been in the regal sign up for our subscription thing promo for months now,2023-05-10
man you take peoples comments like this as complaining maybe you need some time off if it bothers you that much,2023-05-07
they destroyed beastars ,2023-05-06
oh my ,2023-05-05
to be fair it was kinda realistic it was clearly meant to be sudden unexpected and unstoppable event big gotcha moment from bad guy they are guardians but they are not almighty and there wasnt really any big but anyway moment it was constant fight for their life to save their friends and later to save those kids and even knowhere only after final win and goodbyes there was release and dance and happiness that looked like happiness from relief,2023-05-06
nothing really peter drew a picture of the hes assistant to try and find the head piece and the mother looked out the window and pointed at the pyramid base then peter asked if that was their car out front and the dad looked nervous to give him the car,2023-05-15
they could have not risked a city full of noncombatants for the guardians lives glad they did just saying  id be moving immediately,2023-05-08
i’m super late to the thread but yes thank you people were raving about his acting ability and how terrifying he was in loki and then again in quantumania but i thought he was just ok nothing special like i guess he was the best part of quantumania but that’s such a low bar that it’s basically a meaningless statement he just sounds like he’s trying to put on a scary intimidating authoritative voicetone rather than actually naturally having that kind of voicetone which makes him seem like a weak and insecure man who is pretending to be the big bad not buying it,2023-08-06
yeah its like one of those really  stuffed animals you mightve had as a kid but loved anyway,2023-05-07
yeah thats why i felt kinda bad about the joke they had with the disfigured creature as they were rescuing the kids its the same  a living being who has been tortured and mutilated but is just happy to be saved but theyre kinda treated with disdain and disgust as a joke,2023-05-28
not sure i see any connection,2023-05-08
that and they probably showed up in a form that would be familiar to rocket and thus bring comfort,2023-05-08
i believe the afterlife appears as you interpret it to be so it can honestly be anything and tailored to the person,2023-05-21
not again,2023-05-06
and then the film just ends,2023-05-06
gunn thanks k dog also we’re going to have a sweet rabbit having a panic attack while they die too,2023-05-08
dont leave our walrus friend out of that equation,2023-05-06
that would honestly be made of win,2023-05-10
"what song do you think would be appropriate for that scene

let the bodies hit the floor blinded by the light",2023-05-09
thank you oldboy,2023-05-24
"yeah he really made the most out of his time with that series you can see the evolution of his fight scenes from the jailbreat in gotg 1 the opening fight of gotg 2 evolving into the final group fight in peacemaker and gotg 3 hallway scene

dc must be feeling pretty good about their future after this weekend",2023-05-07
and his space helmet,2023-05-05
i also wondered about that until i remembered they all left knowhere in a hurry to save rocket,2023-05-07
also at that point warlock had been his only name after the gotg saved him to give him a second chance he saved peter recreating the famous creation of adam painting pretty funny considering his name is adam warlock,2023-05-07
i dont know enough about the comics to say anything but someone mentioned that he has a more supermanlike personality in the comics and was disappointed when i compared him to prince charming from shrek 2,2023-05-06
"i don’t understand the downvotes you’re getting lol if you’re allowed to enjoy something you’re also allowed to grow out of it i didn’t mean to make it sound negative i just thought you meant like you were worried people would judge you

i’m still enjoying the movies but i can see where you’re coming from there were quite a few moments during quantumania where i thought it was tiring to try to keep up the mcu has gotten a little tiring ever since introducing the shows because it feels like homework",2023-05-05
"worth noting the character is a core member in the comics i think it was in guardians 1 as a nod to the comics but they decided cosmo was worth including in 3

3 as a whole was a lot more comics inspired in terms of the uniforms and knowhwre being the official base",2023-05-15
right yeah she escapes after the explosion with the power stone,2023-05-15
fair but given the overall silliness of the end credit scenes in that movie it could have been handwaved as a joke,2023-05-05
realistically it’s just james gunn being smart enough to know how to play the hand he was dealt and making it hit even harder,2023-05-05
i get your thoughts but for me im glad they went with variant gamoras family not being the guardians it really hits home how our connection to people has a lot to do with the timing and circumstances with how we meet interact no matter how hard the guardians tried and how much gamora understood what her other self meant to them she still didnt have the key shared experiences with them to organically feel the same way as her variant did for them,2023-05-05
you make a decent point they did seem to rekindle their chemistry as the film went on something did feel alittle off with them being back together so quickly though may be something thats revisited,2023-05-05
yeah i didnt want them to be together again like it was some destiny,2023-05-13
i think she just read his body language he looked felt happy and grateful towards her,2023-05-07
" the scene where gamora finally understood groot was slightly strange how did she catch on so quickly

i know im a month late but how i understand it is that how groot communicates isnt a language its sound connected to something mental  if you are connected to groot you get the full message but if you arent hes saying i am groot  

so when gamora was suddenly in his friends she instantly gained understanding

which is also why we all understood his i love you guys from groot at the end  we were all finally in groots connection",2023-06-19
my personal headcannon he has spores that you need to be exposed to for an extended time that imparts a limited telepathy,2023-06-25
but that is what i am saying of course it is no longer exactly the same person but it was the same person at that time point and people always seem to ignore that she should be able to have that same development theoretically as her values or personality should still be the same,2023-05-06
thats a really interesting point,2023-05-06
she might be the same gamora from gotg1 during endgame but years have already passed since then so she wouldnt be the same gamora anymore as her development is from being part of the ravagers,2023-05-05
not really gamora at the beginning of 1 to the end of 1 went through much different things than this new one did even the littlest of things can send someone on completely different paths from something else,2023-05-05
well this movie was really only 2 days and she was warming by the end so it seems spot on to me it feels like they still have a chance like it took peter a while the first time give the man more than 2 days with her everyone is like dramatically saying it’s over for me it seemed like there was a genuine spark again towards the end,2023-05-19
okay i undid my downvote nm then,2023-05-05
what happened to peter helmet and jet boots,2023-05-07
just a guy with an opinion  guess thats too much for you to handle,2023-05-07
all because he wanted to get rocket’s music player so reckless but also so sweet,2023-05-05
thats the thing with gunn you never know he has no problem with killing his darlings and they stay dead too,2023-05-08
"100 this

we were all silent you could hear people saying yes yes then grow silent as his branches froze and broke a single no

honestly i wept like a baby during a good portion of this movie but i loved it so much",2023-05-06
forget…,2023-05-07
i call it mantiss mindblowers,2023-05-07
honestly thought that would come back and the guard would jump in and save drax,2023-05-10
"i can see that becoming a meme

“oh are we still doing phrasing mantis i love the number 69”",2023-05-05
yeah i think they did that in the holday special too it felt weird to me there too i dont hate it just establish that as her power set from the start,2023-05-05
fair point it was just never established that mantis had jumping powers until the holiday special,2023-05-05
effing cowards,2023-05-05
lol i totally forgot about that that had me rolling when i first saw it,2023-05-05
but its okay he didnt know how that machine worked,2023-05-05
pretty sure he flips off thanos in infinity war as well while jumping through one of dr stranges portals,2023-05-05
mj does it in spiderman homecoming as well,2023-05-06
i do believe there were a few underthebreath ones in daredevil and moon knight but this would be the first use of the word in full in an actual film yes,2023-05-05
yeah but that’s the standard “radio edit” of the song that’s been played for 30 years though  although obviously it wasn’t the normal album version of the song,2023-05-07
it’s the same as it is on the volume 3 soundtrack the lyric says “very” instead of “”,2023-05-06
not the mcu,2023-05-05
only for it to be stolen by someone else and then deadpool gets upset lol,2023-06-06
edgy,2023-05-08
probably cause the acoustic version is i think from a live radio broadcast,2023-05-07
i think this was just gunn going full “do it and ask for forgiveness not permission” because this feels like the mcu movie that closest toes the line between pg13 and r some of the violence and the closeup of the high evolutionarys mutilated face really felt extremely excessive and hardcore for a pg13 movie,2023-05-05
"my mistake it was actually chris pratt that was interviewed about it but he does confirm the f word was indeed unscripted

clip ",2023-05-05
they could still make it a gag to try to keep the movie pg13 at first only to accidentally slip up,2023-05-07
i know that now but not before,2023-05-05
hes probably wrong,2023-05-05
any word on the other two i doubt daredevil would have any fbombs the netflix show had none,2023-05-05
and free fire the year before,2023-05-06
civil war for me why the  would you spoil spiderman  you already have an avengers level cast,2023-05-07
i didnt mind that reveal but they really dropped the ball by revealing that the hulk was in the film though i understand theyd want mark buffalo doing the press tour,2023-05-07
it was more a comfort kiss to me eskimo kiss to show affection,2023-05-08
we know at minimum he still has a gigantic organic space station and he probably has research sites all over the place since he has some standing civilizations left still as well the sovereign society is just one of them,2023-05-05
"i felt he was very onenote both in characterization and acting i think the actor is likely good as hes good in peacemaker just not my favorite in this he basically is screaming in rage in every scene hes in i think the villain is another im evil for the sake of being evil which i usually have trouble with as well 

i thought the bad guys just experimenting on children and animals was cheap tbh just an explicitly bad guy thing to do and plainly emotionally manipulative

however i overall did like the movie i thought the guardians themselves did a really good job as did adam warlock and its cool to see how well they work off each other pom klementieff dave bautista and zoe saldana i thought were superb and added a lot of weight to their storylines i liked the ending of gamora and quill going their separate ways i thought that was a really smart way of finishing up their storyline

i also thought the humor was great and the action was often incomprehensible though the hallway no sleep til brooklyn scene was one of the best mcu action scenes so it evens out overall good movie but i just thought some parts were lacking",2023-05-05
my point is it’s real life incorporated in the movie so not sure how it’s manipulating you it’s literally rockets backstory if you can’t handle that it’s fine but i appreciate how the story was told even if sad,2023-05-05
i think given the past 2 movies it had to be sad if we didn’t fully understand the weight of what rocket was carrying around or the backstory didn’t make you feel emotional it would’ve cheapened what we’ve come to know about rocket this far like for 2 movies we know that rocket came from somewhere awful and it led him to be this broken character that needed to heal when we met him if the takeaway in this movie was “that wasn’t so bad” or “i don’t understand why that was so bad” then rockets journey up until now would’ve felt unearned,2023-05-06
how could his story not have been traumatic anyone taking you splitting you apart performing unnecessary surgeries on you is wrong and traumatic how do they explain his back story in another way,2023-05-11
"but they don’t even show you 

the most graphic scene is completely implied you don’t see anything nebula just says “this is worse than what thanos did to me” 

funny enough this is easily the best marvel villain since thanos he was  up when he was getting mauled i was like  yeah",2023-05-05
i mean they seem to be performing incredibly invasive surgery directly to their neurologicalnervous system with the tech to keep them alive and conscious not passing out from the pain but with zero regard for alleviating the pain even after it’s done that is a level of torture that would be very difficult to surpass,2023-05-05
"which didnt undercut the moment at all considering through out the entire film people kept asking did that look cool

also good job ignoring every single other dramatic moment 

we may have not watched different films but your media literacy is  shambles",2023-05-07
yeah i loved what they did with his character they were never going to be able to adapt a true to comics adam warlock but i’m really happy with how they portrayed him and gave him a great character arc in just a few short scenes i also love that he adopted that lil animal,2023-05-06
i think he means it as in its literally not a teenager,2023-05-05
not crazy but  explanation,2023-05-05
thanos saying  when he realizes who scarlet witch is,2023-05-12
"it is logical in the sense that there are steps you can follow to how he got that decision its still ultimately a bad decision like a staircase that might lead you off a cliff but you can follow it

in the same way that its logical that we harvest animals but its outcome is still full of horrific suffering",2023-05-05
if theyre calling in the guardians i doubt you could could corral them like sheep ,2023-05-12
better by the high evolutionarys metrics alone,2023-06-05
i think rocket maimed he’s real face so he had to remove it and stitch on that replacement face,2023-05-08
"yeah that was disturbing i was also a bit sad ayesha died too with how adam saw it being helpless to prevent it 

was kind of hoping gamora would rescue a few of them nearby or some of them would have climbed aboard",2023-05-05
harcourt was sort of becoming the agent coulson of the dceu and maybe going forward too still since she first appeared in the suicide squad 2021 then after that was peacemaker black adam and shazam 2 fury of the gods,2023-05-05
i still think dc  up by not casting him as shazam selling a shazam vs black adam as a rock vs cena movie would have worked so well,2023-05-12
exactly shoves in vader and c3po and r2 for no reason too,2023-05-06
"the first cap movie isn’t that good though the second one is amazing and the third one is really an avengers movie 

doesn’t feel like a trilogy and even so the first one knocks it down from ‘amazing’ status",2023-05-07
i mean wb has been the worst about studio interference lately i hope it doesnt continue into gunns creative reign but wb has been kind of a trash studio in general lately,2023-05-05
notwithstanding i can understand it framing to be janes movie but seeing how there were no future projectsplans with her on account of her dying and seeing how thor is a larger part of the conflict and has a stronger connection to the villain being a  and all making him take it a little more seriously especially considering that the foe is literally killing gods would have strengthened the film substantially it wouldnt have fixed the bloat but it would have given it more weight undoubtedly,2023-05-05
they’re also maybe not coincidentally by far the darkest two mcu movies that don’t end with half the population disappearing,2023-05-07
"not sure if i understand exactly what you are asking but for the most part the mcu is the brainchild of a committee feige primarily that is how they keep the universe uniform but there are a handful of movies where the team had no idea what to do those were entrusted to a director and their vision  

the first iron man the original avengers ragnarok black panther and the gotg trilogy obviously marvel had input but for the most part these movies were the brainchild of the directors",2023-05-05
that isnt a try again thats a fact they are the peak of marvels assembly line production it isnt a judgement on quality but the russos are the poster children for directors for hire,2023-05-05
"tom clancy movies

in the most surface level way possible lol winter soldier and civil war look so gray dull and unimaginative like straight from an episode of a low budget tv show

it kind of sucks because there is lot to love in the winter soldier could genuinely be a masterpiece if it was stylistically more unique",2023-05-05
hope so too jg said it will be in the vein of true detective so that gives me some confidence i’m sure the budget will be typical hbo,2023-05-06
the snyder one is also trash,2023-05-07
yes i am but correct me if i wrong didn’t snyder direct most of the movie and whedon only took over in post production i also couldn’t get into the snyder cut at all and thought it was the same ,2023-05-05
snyders “version” with the directors cut was also bad same with bvs so i don’t get the snyder defending,2023-05-06
it wasnt so much that the fanbase was annoying its that people just randomly saying my wife in a weird accent doesnt exactly scream funny to me,2023-05-05
i see what youre saying but i also really loved civil war so its two incredible movies and one pretty good one for both trilogies i will say i definitely enjoyed captain america 1 more than gotg2,2023-05-06
"it does but to it’s credit they explain what exactly happened to gamora when at the orgoscope in the elevator so audiences who wouldn’t have seen the avengers movies wouldn’t be lost 

and by self contained i mean it features characters only from the guardians franchise it’s not like spiderman who heavily featured iron man and doctor strange or captain america who brought in black widow and civil war was basically an avengers movie haha",2023-05-06
didnt wakanda forever only have the one mid credit scene i only saw it the once,2023-05-05
probably for superman it might be different like he said recently but for gotg and the suicide squad that isnt exactly indictive of being respectful to the source material each of the other directors previously had their own vision for superman that they believed would be respectful to the source so lets see if gunn will pull it off,2023-05-05
ugh i want to cry just thinking about that scene too i didn’t expect this movie to be so dark at times,2023-05-05
that was a note from yondu to peter,2023-05-05
not exactly peter didnt die like his mom did,2023-05-05
i get that he still passed on the music but i thought they were going to mirror his mother passing away and leaving a part of herself with peter in the form of music,2023-05-05
yup this was originally the first phase 4 film before all the gunn stuff happened and the script went unchanged since 2018,2023-05-05
"yeah i think its a fun contrast to the life he left a few days ago he was saving a ship full of aliens and animals from a maniacal super villain and now hes eating cereal and complaining about mowing the lawn 

i think it makes it clear that hed be a good caring grandson but that  also get restless which is why starlord will return",2023-05-05
it also tied in the holiday special  unless im missing something that seemed to be the only easter egg from the scene  i could easily be wrong,2023-05-05
the final scene for homecoming is captain america mocking the audience for patience theyre not always serious,2023-05-06
"i wouldnt call any of them bad to me bad cbms are fantastic four15 catwoman dark phoenix or morbus 

sure since endgame most the mcu has been average to slightly below average",2023-05-07
"you are significantly downplaying it the whole point of the backstory is the high evolutionary dedicated his life to making the perfect version of humity one that can think for themselves create incredible pieces of art free of bigotry violence and hate

and he does that with rocket but since he cant get past rockets outer appearance his mangled body he turns rocket into the very thing he hates humanity for its a great tragic story that ties all the plot points and themes together

it blows my mind you ignored all that subtext and narrow it down to animal cruelty it sounds like you were just looking for a reason to hate the movie",2023-05-07
"nevermind that the supposed fundamental characters who have shaped him are never even remotely alluded to at any other point in any other movie before now

its been made pretty clear over the course of 3 movies that rocket made it a point to never talk about his past or what happened to him its such a traumatic event to him that even reliving it reminds him of the pain hes been escaping he doesnt want to relive it its why hes always pushed everyone way and tried to not get close to anyone because the furst family he ever was close to was violently and cruelly taken away from him hes tried to run from his pain ever since and never really process or deal with it 

the closest we get to him opening up is when hes  on knowhere in the first film and says i didnt ask to get made i didnt ask to be torn apart and put back together over and over and turned into some littlemonster he hates himself and sees himself as a freak because thats what he told him he was and ever since hes put on a false bravado to make sure he feels anything but 

its normal emotional trauma coping some people go through awful horrible experiences and they never want to talk to live through them again and just bury it and ignore it

the only reason hes happy with his friends is because they are all they have and they are under the false pretense that they are going to the new world together 

also lyla is literally name dropped in the 1st movie",2023-05-07
"yes and it worked super well the first time apropos to your life so far

 you know theres a top post on reddit about a girl touching a djs set equipment and she keeps repeating that phrase get over yourself when she gets called out  was that you im so happy to meet a celebrity",2023-05-08

"yes but aside from mr quill taking a sabbatical there felt like no reason to break up the team  he could have made rocket the actingleader of the guardians till he came back  instead he made rocket the leader period  and mantis left the team also  as did drax  why

well okay because draxs actor wanted to quit playing the character  but why inuniverse",2023-05-07
except thats just standard motivation 6 and can be the back story for a dozen other marvel villains no one can be the he who creates the planets he genocides not just shows up and uses the power stone because he hates a treaty he has been committing genocides for potentially 300 years and is regarded as a godlike character in sectors of the galaxy,2023-05-09
fair enough i also tend to hate discussion on forums as well,2023-05-06

and because you threw out a ridiculous buzzword quill wasnt gaslighting",2023-05-05
oh right,2023-05-07
"well she just happened to come with thanos when he jumped through time it doesnt really need more explanation than that why keep her because they like the character i guess and it is a way of helping quill move on

they also did open the possibility of them ending up together after quill saves her from warlock she saw his appeal and she considered it for a moment before leaving at the end so the possibility is there and what do fans love more for their headcanon than having a possibility exist",2023-05-08
"none of that means critics didn’t like it…

80 of them did lol",2023-05-05
perhaps but ratings are a summation of a bunch of factors like that and it could be the straw that breaks the camels back  can you think of a more plausible reason for it to cutoff right before there,2023-05-05
he also saw on the screen that she was trying to communicate with the ship,2023-06-10
speaking of i really hope we see mantis and her pet chtulhus again i feel like she had the secondmost growth in the movie after peter,2023-05-09
theres a theory that the first film we are groot is the guardians and us actually starting to understand him,2023-05-13
you’re not contributing to the discussion you’re looking for a reaction,2023-05-15
i don’t think he would’ve given himself gravity powers or a mask if that was the case  it’s probably more that like doom he can’t accept any imperfections and chooses to cover it up instead of be reminded of his failures,2023-05-14

yes he was mad at i think ayesha for having known rocket was alive for years and not telling him,2023-05-30

im a 33 year old man and i feel a bit traumatized lol there were some younger people in the theater too i hope theyre feeling ok the energy of those scenes was just on point a very bleak existence at the mercy of a psychopath and the hope and friendship that grew between batch 89 then it all falling apart in a very hectic emotional scene,2023-06-11
shang chi and the latest spiderman are the other great ones postthanos these 3 pretty much salvaged this phase of marvel for me,2023-07-15

i still dont know what you mean but that last sentence just made your point more confusing",2023-05-05
in main continuity she only died once and that was near immediately undone,2023-08-22
it does your comment made me put that together lol,2023-05-05
"he didnt know about the  switch which tbh is about as dumb as the high evolutionary the guy that made the  orgoscope somehow doesnt have biological command of his own bodys appearance to the tune of fixing his face 

or its a nice commentary on his ultimate impotence that his idea of fixing his face was all surface and no truth",2023-05-11
hole,2023-05-09
my personal opinion is that hes a coward he thinks of himself as a  and is so willing to turn the knife on everyone else but refuses to have it done to himself,2023-05-08
he could have a really  lover who thinks its hot,2023-05-06

yeah it was hamfisted as  really surprised to see it getting praise here,2023-05-28
i’ve had bricks to the face that were more subtle and nuanced,2023-05-15
you see that thing on his forehead that’s supposed to be the soul stone unless they’re completely changing his character to be whole the guy needs his infinity stone but i don’t see how they do that,2023-05-07
thanos said the were reduced to atoms so technically they are still around,2023-05-07
i meant in the mcu  he was really called rocket raccoon in the comics but in the mcu he hated being called a raccoon and always insisted that they dont know what kind of animal he was created from  this movie comes full circle and wraps up his real superhero name for the mcu since he names himself rocket raccoon accepts that he was a raccoon before being uplifted by he,2023-05-21
yes thats from the comics but in the comics the halfworld is still where they were made by enhancing ordinary animals not where they naturally come from and rocket is still clearly made from an earth raccoon,2023-05-14

tell me about it thats messed up beyound measure ego could have picked literally any method of offing meredith and yet chose to do it through the most painful fashion possible,2023-05-08
even worse he probably didnt really feel that way and did the same thing to each of his kids so theyd be alone not that theres any specific hint toward that but i read everything he said to peter as rehearsed manipulation hes done a hundred times over,2023-05-16
"ooooo i think i love you

its entirely possible he still has some form of celestial power",2023-05-07
he loses his abilities but i wouldn’t think he’d lose the genetic stuff,2023-05-07
i think him and ego had to be together to grows those seeds or whatever ego wanted to do but he’s still half celestiali think i read somewhere a while back that ego isn’t a celestial anymore but he’s still pretty formidable i don’t think he lost whatever traits that allowed him to hold the power stone in the first movie,2023-05-07
lost his powers but hes still extra durable genetically,2023-05-11
would’ve been great if he had them while fighting thanos even a halfcelestial is more than a match for the mad titan,2023-05-26
well since egos planet got destroyed he can’t control that anymore but i think he kept his durability as seen in gotg 1 when quill survived an infinity stone,2023-05-11
its more movies and tv shows often exaggerate how quickly space would   the freezing thing isnt really accurate though since theres nothing for the heat to be conducted to,2023-05-12
its actually easier to survive in vacuum than most people think the first problem is breathing if you expel all your air from your lungs you should be ok until you need more oxygen if you dont expel the air your lungs will explodeimplodeiforgetwhich the temperature isnt really the big issue the radiation from the sunstars is the biggest problem your skin will be burned pretty badly without protection from the sun after 10 seconds or so im going by what ive read so i could be slightly off with some of these facts but i think theyre accurate,2023-05-14
this drove me nuts but then if you watch closely when the glass is breached some sort of magical electric shield activates to seal the windshield area just like the giant one the kids etc had to get through at the end then i wondered how far back in the mcu they started doing that and we didn’t notice lol,2023-05-20
yeah the amount of times there were breaches but no issues wouldnt have stood out as much if they hadnt had a detailed scene of interlocking the ship with knowhere and making sure there were no gaps,2023-05-17
old nasa book ns 3006 bioastronautics cares a lot about what happens when you fall out i haven’t read it for ages but you have sorta 10 seconds to keep working like put an emergency helmet on if you fail to help yourself you have over a minute to get rescued tears and sweat will freeze your blood now boils at room temperature the steam rushes out of your nose and doesn’t stop since there is a lot of water in your body this gives your upper lip frostbite the boiling throughout the body stops blood from pumping the main thing killing you it also causes swelling but skin is great and holds you together well after you are rescued it pretty much all goes away main after effect is a whole body hickey old sci fi now calls you a “vacuum breather”,2023-06-15
me too but i just try to reconcile it with the technology they might have that hole they show in the enemy ship where the kids leave had a force field automatically come up where the vacuum of space was the ships could have the same thing forcefield pops up where theres a hole,2023-08-09
and this is assuming medpac technology won’t fix it all instantly,2023-05-07
"see that event horizon scene 

you know the one",2023-05-07
you’re right about people not freezing i think it’s possible the water sublimating off your skin might form a surface layer of ice though,2023-05-08
medpacks that instantly heal anything,2023-05-07
its been established thats hes stronger than human because hes half celestial,2023-06-30
he was also at the bargaining stage he knew peter wanted to  him its not hard to believe he would lie to save himself,2023-05-07
" something tells me he didnt like that decision

he was definitely unhappy with that and a few other decisions made as well funnily enough though it is weirdly comic accurate in a meta way theres little turf wars and a lack of coordination between desks all the time and sometimes big crossover events come along and make a change to the status quo that writers just suddenly have to deal with halfway through their run the best ones find a way to take those curveballs and work with it and i do think gunn managed to deal well with infinity warendgame clearly tampering with his original plans for gotg

but yeah i do understand why the makers of iw would decide to have peter have all his gear and honestly its such a minor continuity snarl that i never even really picked up on it until it was pointed out to me",2023-05-13

is this a supernatural reference,2023-10-12
nebula becoming such a core part of not just the gotg but the mcu was such an incredibly interesting and welcome surprise never in a million years would i have guessed it while watching gotg2 like up to iw gamora was one of the most important as a key to the main plot and the infinity stone but as soon as endgame began the script flipped and nebula became an absolutely pivotal  the entire mcu,2023-05-29
ive had the cinema fans standard lovemeh relationship with the mcu since i saw iron man on opening day in 2008 and guardians 2 is the one mcu movie that i would describe as underrated its got standard sequel bloat and split up the gang based on scheduling issues but it actually generally works in its favor,2023-06-15
i can stand silly memes in these movies when they have a super strong emotional core i liked guardians 2 the best of the trilogy it felt almost swesb to me the way the characters all split up and peters dad stuff and getting magic powers but thats not important they all had a little pairing and kinda got torn into one way or another in order to grow lots of silly moments but it didnt take away from the serious stuff for me,2023-05-16
 alright it’s a pretty good movie in that regard ,2023-05-09
yeah vol2 plays during 2014 infinity war during 2018 its pretty weird that they couldnt buy a new set,2023-05-08
he fights to protect life including that of gamora it’s not out of line for his character to feel fury for the death of a family member and momentarily being blinded by that anger,2023-06-05
a point demonstrated in endgame iron man thor and captain america got their  handed to them by thanos with zero stones the rag tag group of heroes fighting him on titan didn’t stand a chance,2023-05-06
i think doctor strange couldve just decapitated thanos with a portal while he was put to sleep by mantis,2023-05-06
i agree not a big fan of vol 2 either,2023-05-06
"i think the point still stands 
thanos admits to killing the love of his life hes definitely shooting him somewhere instead ofjust hitting him",2023-05-08
peter had every reason to assume that ego couldn’t be killed like that if he was thinking rationally he would have behaved differently the point is that peter is prone to reacting irrationally when someone he loves is killed,2023-05-11
they beat thanos,2023-05-06
i believe he has lost weight being big even when its muscle takes a toll on your heart and it gets worse and worse with age he was massive when he was a wwe main roster guy now hesbig without being abnormally so i guess,2023-05-07
it would be really interesting to see bautista start to drop weight for a  role and then see where that takes him im sure he might find it hard at first to get roles where hes not known for size and intimidation but hes a very capable actor and id like to see him be able to diversify,2023-05-06
being that size is a pain in the  tbh its probably  on your joints as well,2023-05-07
the makeup chafes his ,2023-05-29
"agreed but he also gets one of the most emotional moments in the mcu so far in gotg2 linked right to his tragic backstory 

when he briefly reminisces about his daughter and outwardly doesnt change expression at all but mantis touches him and immediately bursts into tears upon feeling what hes feeling  

made me realise they could portray him as the biggest idiot alive but to me drax will now always be that dude whos basically been driven insane by the  of his wife and daughter and  years later  is still emotionallymentally crippled by that pain",2023-05-08
the moment that mantis tells drax that he was born to be a dad instead of a destroyer was so heartfelt i thought it made up for a lot of the tonally inconsistent character beats from vol 2 hes just a big fella that wants to dance goofily and crack dad jokes,2023-05-09
"yea they made it a little better if i erase everything from the second movie except the scene where mantis touches drax and feels the memories of his daughter and the sadness from the loss of his family it makes his arc a bit more tolerable

still i would have loved to explore his character more

edit mantis",2023-05-06
metaphor analogy i was losing it ,2023-05-07
its not his fault hes   lol,2023-05-22
i really wanted drax to get a few licks in on thanos i only remember him stabbing some random creature in the back and that was about it  mantis appeared more in the endgame fight,2023-05-08
nebula said that to rhodey who had great chemistry with both her and rocket throughout endgame,2023-05-07
"2 things with nebula i really liked it gotg3

first her and peters awkward acknowledgement that they may actually kinda like each other they both deserve to be happy and realizing they may be right for each other was really sweet and i was all for it

secondly seeing where nebula started out and now becoming the mom of the guardians dealing with all these dysfunctional kiddos karen gillan killed it this round",2023-05-17
shes still the head of knowhere so shell always be around in some capacity,2023-05-20
his zune lol i had to,2023-05-07
ya he was calling drax an idiot the entire movie and then he died over a zune like the biggest  idiot in the galaxy ,2023-07-16
ah gotcha thank you wasnt sure a small forest dwelling south american monkey was relevant lol,2023-05-05
"he was a grown man with a family who had made terrible mistakes this was his chance to atone and choose to do something heroic to define himself and solidify himself  in the end he is ironman not tony the arms dealer the instigator of civil war the creator of ultron but ironman he’d done a lot of good but also caused a lot of death and suffering he immortalized himself as his best self in the end 

these creatures were innocent survivors desperately trying to exist in a deeply cruel world keeping their goodness and hope and love alive despite their horrible conditions choosing the light in deep deep darkness and just as they might get a taste of freedom and beauty their lives were cruelly stripped away from them it was so much meaner there wasn’t any heroism or angle from which they deserved it it was just one final cruelty after a life of cruelty",2023-05-06
he legit wanted it to fulfill his vision but clearly he was also going mad because rocket was smarter,2023-05-11
he also completely ignored the fact that one of his creations caused their own evolution  he kept going on and on about rocket being the only one who could invent after finding out the high priestess literally created adam warlock,2023-05-20
no he wanted to use the brain,2023-05-06
thiiiisss also i liked his intensity but i feel he kindof overdid it at the end,2023-05-06
true but it seemed like they were making excuses for him you dont tell the little ones daddy is ,2023-05-05
he just didnt like things the way they are ,2023-05-07
thank you i thought so but wasnt certain,2023-05-05
all of that makes a quick death more logical to me remember the whole pile of failed peter bodies they didnt get months of torture with cancerous tumors they got deddddd,2023-05-08
"it wouldve been a stronger choice if he had given her cancer through  or something some situation where he knew time with him would give a human cancer but he just didnt tell her because he didnt care and wanted a kid like an std he still gets to be selfish and it makes more sense

doesnt make it better for the script as it would require more explanation but it still remains very illogical that he would give the woman he loved torture and death instead of quick death",2023-05-08
ego was bad but the high evolutionary literally turned those animals inside out and built them back together over and over again and abused them etc so i think we both know whos the worse daddy lol,2024-02-14
i thought that was her i wasnt sure without sebastian on her shoulder,2023-05-08
i recognized the voice but couldn’t place it,2023-05-09
"i didnt notice it until i rewatched the movie a few weeks ago

its probably because jw2 was one of his first movies and most people werent aware of his existence until peacemaker myself included",2023-05-05
i love love love how good gunn is at giving everyone their moments to shine and props to chris pratt for being an ensemble player and sharing the scenery this movie is dominated by rocket nebula and mantis,2023-05-06
honestlyi feel bautista gave his best performance in this movie all the line deliveries were perfect and the dude had me in tears at the end ,2023-05-07
yessir,2023-05-06
the second film was better than the first one imo,2023-05-08
its literally one of the highest rated movies ever i dont know where some people get their information lol,2023-05-14
"he completely ignored george’s original story idea because he was told to because disney was wary of doing anything connected to lucas after the response the prequels got

and he had to come up with a new story from scratch under a very rushed schedule to meet a deadline",2023-05-14
no — deadpool 3 will be produced as one due to disney having bought 20th century fox in the time since the second deadpool film came out using the plot element of the multiverse but the first two deadpool films were produced as spinoffs of the 2000 xmen film series not the mcu,2023-05-15
the only part of the movie that tied in with the rest was ironheart and she was integral to the plot,2023-05-07
it only has a 67 on imdb,2023-05-07
what neither of those series made additional films star wars stopped after the prequels and everyone knows indiana jones wrapped every up in the last crusade,2023-05-17
"its been my secret hope that rdj and chris evans come back as villainous versions that have to be fought something along the lines of the timeline where thanos disappears from in avengers endgame gets  up so the avengers of that world do what they do best avenge only its the main mcu world theyre getting vengeance on

i know its more likely theyll be just a small part of avengers secret wars but still i can wish cant i",2023-05-08
there was 6yrs between gotg 2 and 3 plus infinity war and endgame maybe a 3yr break and saldana comes back for starlord abd gamora getting babk together give them there happy ending at least one more movie maybe two,2023-05-10
fr i like avatar 1 and 2 but man these guardians films 1  3 especially are so good,2023-05-06
wasnt the idea for one of the avatar movies for neytiri to go to earth if thats the case shell be in them for a while,2023-05-07
you’re right i can’t imagine the mental  that went through quill’s head,2023-05-26
"the attraction she had for peter was sparked by the very specific interactions they had in the first 2 movies interactions that this version of gamora will never have

x200b

this gamora went from 2014 prior to meeting quill to now having spent 3 years with the ravagers and now quill wants her to continue a relationship with a guy she doesnt know in place of a different person imagine some person you dont know telling you that you had been dating for 45 years and pressuring you to continue that relationship

thats pretty much what happened with her and nebula though pre guardians nebula hated gamora and the sisterly bond the two had forged by infinity war happened entirely with alternate timeline gamora none of that stopped the current version from happily jumping into that bond however

they even had her gained knowledge of this factthat they were close now be the thing that tipped her over to the side of the avengers in endgame thats over the gained knowledge that thanos does something terrible to her

point being that its less about her needing to have had the experiences that served as the foundation for a particular relationship and more about whether its something she wants if everything she heard about what her relationship with peter was like sounded like the kind of relationship shed always yearned for shed have probably given it a shot

x200b

it can never be the same because shell always have the elephant in the room of peter expecting her to fall in love with him again based on a relationship she never experienced or participated in it would never be an equal relationship of two people who have had all the same experiences together and there would always be a sense of insecurity if they ever had a fight or disagreement and theres an implication that its because of an unfair expectation by peter based on his past with the original gamora that just would be hella awkward

all of these are maturity issues not problems inherent to a secondtry relationship where one party has no memory of the previous go and i dont think you can even necessarily make the argument that either of them have been depicted as lacking the maturity to avoid the problems you list if peter can get over his need for current timeline gamora to be his gamora over the course of the movie he can get over it over it in a relationship",2023-06-07
he pickeda pretty set,2023-05-06
"i took it as a very yeah sure here explanation tho not 

more of a yeah i wanted the mask and boots to be done for after vol 2 i dont know why the  they gave peter a new ones in iw im just gonna ignore it lol

gunn has already said that he doesnt agree with some stuff marvel did with the guardians in iw and eg thats probably one of those things that annoyed him",2023-05-09
 that is a  explanation at least it’s an explanation tho ig,2023-05-08
"completely tracks for the goofiness of the character and the fact they were rushing to save rocket  plus it just doesn’t super matter he’s half  that sequence was epic warlock was there and the redemption moment tracks 

i dunno not a problem for me",2023-05-27
yeah its kind of funny because there is a line im2 from nick fury where he berates tony for rhodey taking the silver suit the little brother walked in there kicked your  and take your suit so to call out rhodes being a small guy while your leading man is the same size is kind of ironic,2023-05-09
lol my bad,2023-05-06
no he’s on knowhere apparently if you look closely drax carried him out of the ship my earlier comment was wrong,2023-08-05
drax literally said his face came off,2023-05-07
"why are people struggling to understand that a meta joke doesn’t need the characters to be in on it

for quill it’s kind of cute for the audience it means more duh",2023-05-06
because collegehumour batman is the best parody series ever made,2023-05-15
yeah i guess if he gonna die in a couple minutes regardless then  him and he doesnt get an honorable death,2023-05-06
"its kind of cool how both times rocket beat him it was in a different way

the first time he just assumed that rocket was essentially domesticated and wasnt capable of feral rage when pushed too far in reality anyone is when pushed hard enough

the second time he assumed that he could outsmart him and he didnt",2023-05-20
would have been nice for one of the other guardians to just blast the  once rocket took the moral high ground though nebula or gammora would have been a good candidate,2023-07-15
hes a guy who has genocided multiple races killed and tortured millions if he somehow escaped he would do it all again he will never be convinced hes wrong so yeah i think killing him to be sure he doesnt have that chance is totally justified and fine,2023-05-08
did they take him off the ship also interrogate him about what,2023-05-05
the third in the trilogy would make the most sense for it to be contained gunn is gone many of the actors are either going to take a break or move on this arc for the guardians is over,2023-05-05
i love you guys,2023-05-06
and in multiple languages,2023-05-06
he did all the overdubs in all the different languages too,2023-05-10
i think the “i love you” was a freebie they happened to record on his last session,2023-05-26
"they were like kinda blurry but they were there behind lyla and the camera briefly focused on them but definitely the light kind of made them a tad hard to see so if you were teary eyed as well its easy to miss 

but they were there with her ",2023-05-07
fair enough,2023-05-06
my teeth hit the floor throughout the whole scene,2023-05-05
"this is the part that disappoints me the most about the overall plot sure im not terribly interested in this multiverse deal but why the  does it seem like it only matters to like a handful of people that the snap happened they dont even usually call it that they call it the blip which is way less cool 

in some ways it mirrors real life what with how were just back to normal after the global event that was covid but i feel like the real world is more different after covid than than mcu is after the blip why is it such a background story where only some people are dealing with trauma they really should have focused on that element more than setting up all this kang stuff tell smaller stories give new characters more breathing room just do something other than dr mom or quantumania",2023-05-10
true,2023-05-16
even soviet treat me better then the poker table lose their  lol,2023-05-07
that scene when groot pulls all the guns was fantastic,2023-05-06
they’re saving that for the solo “groot” film that shows groots early life and time on his planet before all of groots people get wiped out s,2023-05-05
i imagine he also considers quill his dad im not sure the rocket groot relationship is any stronger or more special than the peter groot relationship,2023-05-05
opening night end game crowd was the best way to watch that movie saw it a few weeks later and cap hammer scene just wasn’t the same without the cheering,2023-07-17
the original post mentioned emotes which i usually associate with  expressions but this thread reminded me that rockets emotional performance isnt just his face and is crafted by a number of hands the link i posted shows coopers face getting recorded for vol 2 so even if cooper is not on set there was possibly an attempt in at least that movie to use some of coopers  performance or maybe not they could have completely ignored coopers  footage entirely in the end but it seems like rockets performance voice face and body movement is a team effort,2023-05-18
so like when adam warlock shoots rocket but then attempts to save flerb or whatever his name is,2023-05-06
reminds me of the time i saved a scorpion i still miss my frog ,2023-05-07
he would definitely see mutants as perfect maybe even had a hand in their creation in this world,2023-05-08
war pig didnt scan groot she only scanned peter probably just assumed that the wood tree creature didnt have clothes or pockets for holstering weapons and decided he wasnt a threat,2023-06-23
it did it would probably be something id watch on streaming if i was bored,2023-06-04
zootopia too,2023-05-08
holy ,2023-05-08
you got that right despite all of the imperfections it was still a somewhat functioning society by all accounts and he destroyed it anyway without hesitation from their perspective it must have been a horrifying lovecraft cosmic horror situation,2023-05-08
thank you,2023-05-15
"they could have not risked a city full of noncombatants for the guardians lives

i dont think they would use knowhere if it was only about their lives they needed it to save all the kids and others",2023-05-08
they brought nowhere cause they needed enough space to rescue a civilization worth of children,2023-05-13
the scene from antman 1 where cassie just exclaims hes so  i love him basically its such a greatweird feeling,2023-05-21
this was horrifying to me but on the upside even though it is a grotesque pile of skin it seemed to have a pretty chipper disposition that’ll take it far in life lol,2023-08-26
anya was afraid of bunnies and hated them,2023-05-08

narrator  oh boy",2023-05-06
the more i think about it it’s just guardians with a different lineup what i think we can take away from this is that space and robin hood are both awesome,2023-05-10
no song its daredevil,2023-05-11
yea are we ignoring he somehow survived open space ,2023-05-15
while the rest of your point still stands his name has been adam since the gotg2 post credit scene where he is teased,2023-05-07
,2023-05-06
the mcu has been going on for 15 years now and it hasn’t matured with its audience,2023-05-06
rumours are that theyre going to use the ending of deadpool 2 to bring in the tva because deadpool is  with the timeline,2023-05-05
nah they’re keeping the ending of dp2 as canon the third movie has time travel shenanigans,2023-05-08
"ya  ya 

i also came away with the same thing gamora just isnt a guardian anymore and doesnt love quill and never has

its brutal quill has only known full blown loss and gamora doesnt know  is happening but at the end of the day pete still has his family and gained a sister and gamora got hers

its  for the audience because we want them to be together but they arent and at least they both have people",2023-05-05
"dude yes i totally understand that how this version of gamora came to fall in more with the ravagers i love it in a certain way pertaining to the realism of that universe but i still cant help but ship past gamora with present quill 

i feel like the film itself led that on thee was on scene where quill did something and gamora gave him a longing look",2023-05-05
" may be something thats revisited

sadly i dont know if any of this  will be revisited as gunn has moved on the the dc universe",2023-05-05
most likely it wont be zoe has said shes done with gamora,2023-05-05
or it just goes to show how life altering events can change people,2023-05-07
i mean does the doctor strange that destroyed two universes have the potential to become the doctor strange we know just because two characters share a history it doesn’t mean they’re the same person,2023-05-08
but the experiences and memories are what make who we are at least 50 so even if she could have the same development she didnt have so she turned into a different person you cant replicate the same thing because the characters are different and the wya she see things are different from her gotg 1 mindset,2023-05-08
"wait what  which one was your opinion the  dialogue or that people calling you corny were losers  

cause neither are really an opinion",2023-05-07
perfect call back to the prison colony which is kinda why i thought he was dead this time,2023-05-05
 this is making me want to see this again james did such a great job writing this one all of the guardians felt so so fleshed out and even the little moments in the movie show so much more about them,2023-05-05
peters helmet and rocket boots were a part of his tech kit and missing would have been really handy in the end,2023-05-05
i think the closest we saw was also mantis bouncing around in the background during the planning to defeat thanos on titan but maybe the planet had a lighter gravity or she was bouncing on something since we dont see really what she was jumping on,2023-05-05
not sure if there were any in moon knight so i wont comment on that but daredevil at the time was not part of the mcu,2023-05-05
i know but deadpool is part of the xmen series and wolverine said it first,2023-05-05
and the blatantly blowing to smithereens entire innocent families point blank on top of the whole planet going kablooey as well,2023-05-05
im willing to bet gunn got away with a lot more post firingbacklashrehiring than he would have otherwise  its probably likely we got a better darker movie because of that,2023-05-05
lol thats amazing thanks,2023-05-05
he might be but he’s been actively filming it for weeks he knows what content this show has and he deems it r,2023-05-05
"vincent d’onofrio claimed dd would still be tvma recently and blade being r is kind of an open secret when the crew changed the film got pushed because ali wasn’t happy with it the rating changed to better fit the character the hollywood reporter even accidentally included its change to r with the delaycrew change announcement before removing it probably when marvel wanted to reveal that themselves 

both will probably have fbombs in them tho not to the degree of deadpool",2023-05-05
yeah especially because the movie treats it like a big surprise,2023-05-07
true i forgot that he owned the organic station either way i think hes dead though,2023-05-05
"he visited earth and found his skin made him looked down on and presumably beaten which is why he was so adamant on his society having peace however since hes essentially a  to these people the idea that a failed experiment is somehow smarter than him destroyed him further   


i wouldnt say he was pure evil nothing else to it there was a trend in what triggered him further hes not redeemable but thats okay not everyone needs to be as long as hes the  his own story which he is hes ",2023-05-05
"maybe there’s a misunderstanding of what i mean

you know how sometimes movies or shows joke when a cop or soldier or whatever dies and he was a day from retirement it’s because it was an overused trick at one point that specific detail was pretty original and gutted the audience but it became a cheap shortcut to the point that were all aware of the trope even if we’ve never seen any actual media that used that story beat earnestly 

it’s the same reason we roll our eyes when a disney character has lost at least one parent it’s manipulative because it’s an obvious shortcut to pull the audience’s heart strings every movie is manipulative in nature it’s how they get us to feel real emotions over fake circumstances but it can be done with subtlety 

so far rockets backstory has only been hinted at but it’s been very effective as a character he’s made me choke up or full on cry in each movie in another comment someone kind of my my point for me when they said that the scene of implied cruelty to rocket was the most graphic violence can’t be implied and graphic what they were expressing is that the implied cruelty was the most effective that’s essentially what i’m trying to say about the tragedy of rockets flashbacks creating 3 adorable new characters who are introduced just in time to talk about how great it is to have friends and what they’ll do when they’re free gee i wonder if they’ll get gunned down as soon as they’re loose it’s heavy handed and could have been done in a way more effective way than beating us over the head with a sad shortcut we see coming a mile away",2023-05-05
definitely my issue isn’t that it’s sad it’s that all of the guardians pathos has been handled so well and so precisely and subtly then this just hits you with a sledgehammer do you feel like you understand drax’s trauma pretty well like are you totally in the dark about what his deal is would you need a guardians 4 that spends half the runtime showing his wife and daughter taking about how great it is to be alive and how much they can’t wait to all grow together as a family when you know from frame one of the movie they’re not going to make it in trying so hard to pull at my heartstrings with rockets past it actually cheapened it for me because i’ve seen it handled way better through his own actions than through the grimy details like this,2023-05-06
"my issue isnt that his past was traumatic its that it was written in a way that was transparently designed to overtly and obviously manipulate the audiences emotions were introduced to rockets cute animal friends who are created to suffer talk about literally how great it is to have friends share how wonderful it will be to be free of their cages and then die in front of him the other movies have handled his past trauma with such scrupulousness then this one comes in with a bulldozer 

and why are we even spending this much time on rockets backstory in the trilogy capper i didnt know every grimy detail but i knew enough to know his deal why are we looking backward this far in the last guardians movie ive known his story was traumatic through his characterization for 2 movies i would have been equally  if in the final film of the trilogy drax was asleep for 23 of the runtime and we got a bunch of miserable flashbacks with the readymade sadness of his daughter dying in a bid to pull at our heartstrings extended scenes of her talking about how she cant wait to grow up and how shes sho happy drax is her dad we dont need it because we already get it and we certainly dont need it laid on that thick not at the end of the story 

 what i wanted was the one last ride premise we were promised instead of a rocket raccoon bottle episode beating me over the head with sap establishing why rocket was the way he was at the start of his arc 2 movies ago",2023-05-11
"yeah i didn’t say my issue what that it’s graphic it’s just narratively heavy handed

edit the scene you mention the most graphic scene being implied is an oxymoron btw was more effective and nuanced than all the flashbacks because it had emotional weight to the other characters and thus us the audience versus dialing the misery to 11 to tug at our heart strings with new adorable characters who were just but there to be tragedy ",2023-05-05
i know what that last part is like surgeons  sometimes i havent seen the movie yet cant because im bedridden but ive heard nothing but good things all day about it so im excited to see it and its been a while since ive been excited to see a marvel movie,2023-05-05
and will poulter was perfect casting he was able to do powerful and intimidating while still being able to be him in were the millers from 2013,2023-05-06
the thing is thanos plan was anything but logical to everyone who understands exponential growth,2023-05-07
i mean the guardians could corral them by killing them they are literally doing the same thing the high evolutionary did by saying these beings dont deserve to die it was a dumb way to end a movie that was about animal cruelty,2023-05-14
i mean thats all animal testing if you have taken medication its been tested on animals,2023-06-14
"what don’t you like about the first one

and even though the avengers are in 3 it’s still centered around cap and bucky",2023-05-07
i dont think interfering in movies is really their problem theyve been trying to fix their streaming service and thats led to them scrapping movies at various stages of completion and greenlighting some properties just for the sake of pushing ip i havent actually heard too much about them actively interfering in a directors creative process on the movies theyve actually bothered to release,2023-05-05
"i can understand it framing to be janes movie but seeing how there were no future projectsplans with her on account of her dying and seeing how thor is a larger part of the conflict and has a stronger connection to the villain being a  and all making him take it a little more seriously especially considering that the foe is literally killing gods would have strengthened the film substantially

this is thinking in terms of a franchise and not in terms of the individual movie jane had a real character arc and thor didnt jane became a  in this movie and she should have had just as much of a connection to the villain as thor her dying at the end makes the movie stronger if shes the real protagonist not weaker 

also she did show up in valhalla at the end so i wouldnt say its impossible that she comes back in some future movie with multiverse shenanigans or something",2023-05-05
i guess i just dont understand how eternals and lt is any less marvel assembled than gotg2,2023-05-05
every director in marvel is a director for hire,2023-05-05
i dont like the synder dceu movies but his cut of the film that we had was definitely an huge improvement over the wheedon one we got in theaters problem was though it still wasnt very good for its own reasons and was an absolute chore to get through,2023-05-07
tell me you havent seen it without telling me you havent seen it,2023-05-07
"over half the footage in the theatrical is whedon footage and obviously whedon reedited the scenes snyder filmed completely changing their tone as well so you could attribute something like 34th of the theatrical cut to whedon

the directors cut was hugely different and being 4 hours would contain something like 75 new footage with the existing footage also feeling different because of whedons editing in the theatrical cut making it feel something like 85 new",2023-05-05
it also wasn’t “radically different” it was radically longer but the basic plot was the same and just as nonsensical as it was in the theatrical cut,2023-05-07
y’all got me  up again rn i got work in a couple hours,2023-05-05
no it wasnt,2023-05-05
post credit scenes are rarely part of the script though,2023-05-05
it did you went on tilt  i’m printing out your rant and framing it,2023-05-08
"yeah i didn’t really buy the reasoning for any of the characters leaving the team honestly like you mentioned peter was just taking some time off there was no reason to permanently hand over leadership to rocket he had also never shown any particular fondness for earth or his grandpa prior to and even during this film his desire to go back and visit his grandpa seems to come entirely from mantis telling him he should 

mantis as well had never shown any indication of wanting to leave and kind of flies in the face of the christmas special which went out of it’s way to show how important the team and peter were to her her reasoning for wanting to leave also didn’t make much sense she wanted “find herself” and make her own decisions but that was something she already basically did when she left ego to join the guardians her freedom was never restricted as part of the guardians 

drax and nebula leaving also doesn’t make a ton of sense since the guardians were already headquartered on knowhere so they could have done their new jobs and still been a part of the team in some capacity  nebula was already taking care of  on knowhere even at the start of the movie while still being a guardian also aren’t kraglin and cosmo some kind of leaders on knowhere yet they are still on the team so clearly there is no conflict 

all in all the team breaking up just felt super forced and didn’t really make sense for any of the characters it feels like something that was shoehorned in to make this seem like ending honestly cut out the abrupt breakup scene and you’d never guess this film was supposed to be the conclusion to a trilogy",2023-05-08
the reason was james gunn is done and some of the actors as well,2023-05-07
ok then my opinion is standard motivation 6 is worst then he looks like you’re having a hard time figuring out what i’m trying to say here i think that ronan the accuser is far more cruel and evil then the high evolutionary i think the high evolutionary feels worse because he had a personal connection to a guardian i personally think he is a more entertaining character but ronan the accuser has done more things worse then he,2023-05-09

"that’s fair thanks for explaining 

i wish they’d gotten together the quillgomorrah relationship in my opinion is the most convincing and enjoyable romance in the mcu",2023-05-08
even though i’m being downvoted for making my point on here guardians 3 is considered the 19th best marvel movie by critics based on rt that would consider it a low tier mcu movie i disagree with that sentiment,2023-05-07
absolutely an obvious one being that they felt that managing the pacing of the scene was more important than extending that sequence of the edit for the sole purpose of hearing an additional word particularly if that word is not necessarily central to their reasoning for using the song to begin with,2023-05-05
when she was walking away with her three babies i was like sequel   mantis and her menagerie on adventures    cos i realized during this movie shes an amazing kick  fighter   i always just focused on her empath ways,2023-08-13
yea i don’t agree i had a good laugh just not at the parts the movie intended pacing between the action jokes and animal torture flashbacks were not done well movie was 45 min too long actor who played the main villain did well seemed like every other actor was just phoning it in drax had maybe at best 12 good jokes written for him,2023-05-16
yeah if he truly thought of himself as the ultimate unblemished being he wouldn’t hide his face i honestly think it adds to the character because it attest to while he ultimately thinks he’s a  he can’t restore the one thing that was taken from him by the one being that he made that was better than him,2023-05-15

wow great point gunn did a lot with this material and was able to stretch rockets origin story over the entire trilogy a phrase that sticks with me was the heaven sequence where lylla says to rocket something like it was your story all along  in hindsight it feels true,2023-05-21
correct,2023-07-10
which i think is a great element of character for him he doesnt understand pain or suffering and cant connect to humans at all so theyre all expendable to him to an immortal planet whats the difference between living another 40 years a heart attack or having painful aggressive cancer not much,2023-05-08
"im afraid that im not sure of 

a cancer there is no cure for",2023-05-20
"it never really made sense to me yeah i need a second celestial to tap into literally the same power source im already using and who has no power of his own i plug two lamps into this battery so the battery gets twice as big

makes more sense that hes got his own power and ego wanted to control him",2023-05-09
possibly but they glossed over it quite quickly his face went from supremely deformed and swollen back to normal with zero explanation even if it was from his residual celestial abilities,2023-05-11
if anything a big issue in space is how to cool down since spaceships and living beings keep generating heat,2023-05-12
thanks i have to check with my physics team about the freezing,2023-06-15
are you sure during the ship combat scenes i thought i was specifically looking out for some sort of shield or something that would handwave it but i didnt see anything i dont remember the shield activating besides the kidsscene,2023-05-20
baby bear,2023-05-11
theres excusing a lapse in movie logic then theres blatantly inventing headcannon that isnt present in anything the audience sees,2023-05-11
thats more or less how it works in the comics,2023-05-28
yeah the group put me off at first haha i was like what the heck am i looking at here teefs and lyla especially but they grew on me,2023-05-14
that bunny and the groot head gave me big the thing vibes,2023-05-20
i just now got to watching it and only noticed because a small part of me was still holding out hope that her and teefs were not about to get gunned down as well and since lyla was shot for escaping her cage i was internally screaming watching floor slowly stepping out of hers lol,2023-06-19
i loved her so much and was big sad when her and teefs didn’t even get to leave the cages really,2023-05-07
thank you for being so kind,2023-05-07
calling out yeah lol spending any amount of your energy to call out that stuff is some cave troll type action lol,2023-05-05
you seem like your probably a dangerous human being,2023-05-05
not to mention that kids love these kind of movies anyway dark shows like black mirror the walking dead game of thrones etc were all extremely popular among high school kids even today one of the most popular authors amongst teenagers is still horror writer stephen king the idea that we need to protect teens from a marvel movie isnt just misguided but deeply out of touch with not to mention deeply condescending to the average teen,2023-05-05
"hey you are now part of a small group on reddit that likes gotg vol 2 the most

it developed a lot of the characters for me which is something i enjoy a lot from a sequel movie you can see how deeply gamora cares for the team and quil we get nebulas revelation of pain about only wanting a sister we have yondu and rocket raccoon who feel miserable about the way they are peter who finds about his mother and father and finally understands he has a family in the guardians and lastly drax who is probably the most self assured character who is infectiously happy while he keeps all his pain to himself

i think its still my favourite of the 3 films but all of them ranked very closely for me",2023-05-17
"i rewatched 2 a few days ago and was surprised how much more i enjoyed it compared to in 2017 

the empire comparisons are apt tbh the whole stuff with egos planet gave me huge cloud city vibes",2023-05-20
"no but for real its a big character study for this group and i love it they all have their own little pairing and go off and wear each other down 

its a shame some people cant get over the humor that can be admittedly overstuffed at times or at the wrong times and i dont mean that condescendingly they have the right to not like it but there really is a fantastic movie just under that light shroud of occasional bad jokes and i feel bad that theyre not able to experience the same thing",2023-05-16
"youre looking too far into things

take care",2023-05-10
lol bruh thats weak sauce,2023-05-10
i mean they were pretty  close if thor wasnt in his   thor stage it would have helped a bit i definitely think prime thor with both hammers should have been able to take eg thanos down,2023-05-06
that particular move would involve also cutting off at least mantis legs,2023-05-11
i can almost forgive the iw version of the characters because i’ve always viewed it as seeing the characters through the perspective of the avengers just like the characters in gotg we think the guardians are oafs until they grow on us same goes for in iw because once eg comes around what remains of the guardians are treated a bit more normal,2023-05-06
"i agree probably wasnt trying to fully  him but at least he was trying to fatally wound him or that version of him he is prone to react poorly in that kind of situation but punching thanos at that moment would be like trying to punch a guy with a bomb attached to his body in a place full of people irl i think that given the stakes he would be more prone to

1 hit him fatally 
2 help take of the gauntlet while on a rage like shooting his arm or trying to cut it off or something like that

i agree he would react violently and irrationally but hitting him in the face at those stakes is just kinda  

also he doesnt just burst into anger like on vol 2 he interacts with thanos and listens to tony trying to convince him to keep it cool by that point he decides to do it anyways",2023-05-11
a different thanos yeah,2023-05-13
i remember hearing someone say “whether it’s all muscle or all  it’s not healthy being 350 lbs”,2023-05-07
do you mean you erase everything related to drax or everything in general cause while drax is the weakest member of gotg2 that movie nails it everywhere else,2023-05-08
mantis,2023-05-07
that whole scene and chris pratt dropping the first mcu f bomb got the entire theater laughing out loud,2023-05-23
what’s up regular size man,2023-05-07
 the head of knowhere,2023-08-05
 i wouldn’t want to let one of those things define me either tbh,2023-05-05
it really is a deep painful reminder that no matter how good you are no matter how unfair it is not everyone gets a happy ending ,2023-05-06
i really wish that when we saw them in heaven they would have been in their original forms without the cybernetic additions they deserved to be free of that,2023-05-07
"i assume they did so with his tech 

biggest issue with the movie was their handling of warlock being a buffoon i like where they ended up taking him though at least",2023-05-29
i mean i took it as him going off the rails that he kept being i outsmarted by “lower lifeforms”,2023-05-06
believe me the little ones learn fast when daddy is ,2023-05-06
and now imagine how the destruction of counterearth felt and looked like from the perspective of its inhabitants here was a  who provided them with a home and yet one day he decides to destroy it all without them knowing why definitely has those lovecraft cosmic horror vibes when you put it into perspective,2023-05-08
how can u notice u were boiling the jeans,2023-05-06
second film wasnt just weak it was just bad there is nothing stealler about first and third one which was cliche and predictable finale gotg films are generic superhero movies nothing more a century later people wont even know it existed because it isnt anything speacial it is just fans are overrating it too much even putting gotg and lotr in same paragraph is just funny,2023-05-07
"who the  uses imdb scoring lmfaoo

the movie has an a on cinemascore which is much more reliable same rating as gotg3 mind you",2023-05-07
i remember a time when it was the prequels tried to pretend didn’t exist,2023-05-27
star wars made prequals  everyone knows there hasnt been a new star wars since 1983,2023-07-16
i would hate to see them be villains i want my heroes to stay heroes lol,2023-05-16
drax carried out the warlock dude,2023-08-05
he exclaimed that because it happened not as a callback,2023-05-15
not really interfering with the moment though,2023-05-08
not sure but unless gunn specifically comes out and says it i do know he was a guest judge a few times on face off show on the scify network i think  i stopped watching that and probably should get back into it,2023-05-06
"yeah big agree on this one he would have been the easiest trigger to pull the idea of killing for revenge and unarmed and wounded etc comes from a place of some form of moral supioriority we do this but we dont do this 

i think these things are truely contextual and killing a genocidal torturer kidnapper and supremicist with vast resources and intelligence someone who truely with all his heart pumped evil into the world with every breathe

yeah im not leaving that up to chance psychological and moral conquences be damned",2023-05-13
"let me paste a portion of the comment you just replied to

 plus obviously he was going to die when the ship exploded in a few minutes so it’s not like rocket was letting him live

and theres actually a really interesting moral question here if the he created all those people that lived in counterearth and they lived happily for decades is it not better that they lived and died than never lived at all thats outside of the scope of the immediate discussion and im not going to get into that with you but its an interesting thing to think about",2023-05-08
they left him on it as it was being destroyed,2023-05-07
it kinda was contained as much as it could be in terms of the mcu tho they werent going to throw away the previous two arcs that needed some finishing to some degree,2023-05-05
i guess that moment was us the audience finally understanding groot like how gamora was able to at the end,2023-05-06
can’t wait for the dub of that scene where he just says “family” and maybe a car comes crashing in from behind,2023-05-07
yeah that’s why i said thousands of times,2023-05-10
call me picky but i guess i could have just used a little more i am happy that they end up being there to see at the end i just hate that the last words we hear from them are panicked and afraid floor especially ,2023-05-07
no idea it really does seem horribly squandered and it made nearly every supposed loss in infinity war feel very cheap,2023-05-10
"well news networks and such wouldn’t know the finer details of thanos snapping his finger and using magical stones to wipe half the population out they just know everyone blipped 

agreed though the snap is way cooler",2023-05-12
"because in the grand scheme of things it was something that no matter how they did it it would haunt every subsequent movie in the marvelverse future writers shouldnt be subjected to adhering to some weird fantasy plot device that happened years ago but has to be mentioned just because of the absolute ridiculousness of it so that its tied nicely into the greater multiverse backdrop of each and every movie thats made in the future 

but this is really just the same problem since the inception of the comicform storytelling in a cinematic continuity early on it was cool because it was really clean and airtight and there was thorough planning behind it and it had never been done this way before so there was a novel coolness to it as well there was only like 3 heroes with their solo movies the big crossover teamup then guardians 

but now its truly an incomprehensible mess to anyone who hasnt been following and tbh its probably just as confusing to plenty of people who have managed to catch the bulk of these movies most of the movies exist as stepping stones halfbaked stories with no regard for character or writing or themes that only exist as chess pieces in the greater plan or to fit as a piece of the puzzle or phase priority is everything and their priority is in franchising not making a good movie but stringing along as many as possible for the unforeseeable future

theres no real authenticity to the stories being told james gunn is the last real director to work with marvel and maybe the only one i love sam raimi but holy  was doctor strange 2 just so hollow edgar wrights antman couldve been something special but they didnt see eye to eye with how the greater universe would be handled in his movie so that was never going to happen there have been a few good directors so im not being 100 literal here but the point im obviously making is the quality of their contribution only suffers by being a product of the biggest commercial endeavor of the 21st century 

this movie was great however james gunn doesnt miss",2023-09-19
the silhouette of all the guns coming out through the smoke was peak cinema,2023-08-05
sadly i was spoiled of that fight beginning due to the preview while being at the theater,2023-05-06
he did have a disney thing i keep forgetting to go back to,2023-05-05
rocket was the one who planted him and my guess is he was the one taking the most care of him at first also while everyone was sad that the original groot died rocket was understandably the only one who seemed totally broken by it i imagine a lot of that affection was projected onto this groot,2023-05-05
ill allow it end game was an epic buildup of over ten years of movies understandable cheering,2023-07-17
if i recall correctly he doesnt see them as explicitly perfect but a good next step hence deaging magneto and working with the future mr sinister when the high evolutionary was still human back in the 1800s,2023-05-08
no problem,2023-05-15
oh  of course there is a moment in the mcu just like that,2023-05-21
i see never watched buffy btw,2023-05-08
i was joking but yeah,2023-05-11
not unusual to survive open space from what ive read movies arent really accurate thats not to say you could just hangout out there but supposedly its not instant death either,2023-05-16
its consistent with the gotg2 where yondu saves him its not realistic but its consistent with the preestablished rules of the universe,2023-05-21
hes dad is was a ,2023-07-13
"in the mcu at least it just seems like quills curse love to an extraordinary degree but always have your love ripped away his mom his dad his partner himself 

its just so cruel sometimes just give him a break ",2023-05-05
id agree it led the audience on it tracks though where alt gamora is warming to him and thinking about what was and what her other self saw,2023-05-05
i doubt it even more that zoe has said shes done playing gamora,2023-05-05
"i really thought that was going to be when thor showed up

that is an opinion ",2023-05-07
then you kinda remember that hes half space  so space isnt a big deal that said he was missing his mask and boots in this one,2023-05-21
i really liked the character bits that they explored but i personally didn’t like how the rocket flashbacks were forced in they should have been done in a way where it’s hard to distinguish them between the present timeline where it flows easily here they transition to and from flashbacks using a flash effect and it looks cheesy to me,2023-05-05
i was wondering about that what happened to his  hes a space cowboy with poor mans ironman tech tf happened,2023-05-05
i mean it absolutely was but that is not relevant now — here is the moon knight scene at the very beginning partially obscured by a bell chime but still audible,2023-05-05
ok but thats irrelevant in a discussion about how this is the first mcu movie that said it the xmen movies are not part of the mcu,2023-05-05
i also think he just didn’t give a  as much with trying to appease disney’s board by altering his vision for the movie like what were they gonna do fire him again last time that happened he got the gig of a lifetime with dc haha,2023-05-05
a lot of movies and shows film things to the r level but also do alternative takes and it ends up tamer in the edit,2023-05-05
thanks for the info tvma is mature audience right im not familiar with the rating systems in the us,2023-05-05
that’s cool we’re finally getting something that isn’t pg13 i just hope the writing is good,2023-05-05
"my sister somehow avoided all the marketing for ragnarok all the way past it’s theatrical release so i showed it to her at home and when hulk popped up she was like “wait a minute… hulk is in this movie” 

that was pretty cool",2023-05-07
" either way i think hes dead though

zero chance he is dead",2023-05-09
"if drax was the focal point of the movie then yeah i think the details would be necessary i think they’d have to make you care about drax’s wife and daughter as individuals and about the relationships and make you fully understand the level of his hurt so that we can be in drax’s shoes with him 

i just saw sisu and i liked it it was a good movie but only hearing that the dude lost his wife and kid didn’t make it real enough i honestly forgot until now that that was a thing that happened and i think the movie knows that because it doesn’t try to make you understand his loss that’s just a quick part of the backstory to make things happen if the story was about him getting vengeance on the guy that did it and all they did was tell you that he lost his family it would’ve had no emotional impact at least imo",2023-05-06
it’s the eyebrows,2023-05-06
he’s also great in dopesick but that show was super depressing,2023-05-07
"true but most people instinctually dont

what is interesting is how someone so intelligent would end up with such flawed logic

i believe as someone famous said who i dont remember there are no logical decisions only emotional ones he explains it well but basically its yeah even with all information available you are always free to make a bad decision

my personal headcanon

	is the little gamora that we see at the end is not gamora at all its just taking the form that thanos would be most vulnerable towards
	is that the ultimate plan was total annihilation the half of everyone thing was just a means to an end
	and that ultimately this was a personification of death whos ultimate will was the death of the universe with thanos as its willing servant",2023-05-07
"my  bro are you aware of the concept of pests we  animals all the time for the sake of protecting the ecosystem these were incredibly violent sci fi and fictional animals that for all we know could be the most satan like creatures to ever exist i dont think you know what corralling is you ever attacked by a lion you think youre just gonna corral it

killing those creatures to protect the villagers isnt animal cruelty at all",2023-05-15

"i cant see that in any capacity she died and joined heimdall in the afterlife as far as we know the newest big bad is a big time travel guy no real rhyme or reason to shoehorn a return

jane does have a character arc but its literally just im dying it doesnt tie to the villain in any significant way heck it doesnt even tie to her become the new thor in any way she doesnt really develop any more than thor does in looking for his purpose after everything thats happened with thor the movie can be looked at more as an epilogue with him becoming a father to an even greater hero and being a  that showed kindness to the godbutcher where no other  would

janes clearly the hook that was supposed to get people into the movie ill agree with that however her appearance doesnt counteract the fact that thor is significantly dumbed down in the movie even if its because he no longer had a purpose to serve the way he treats a threat to the gods is significantly goofier than the way he treated previous threats to the gods dark elves hela and the guy who was a threat to the universe",2023-05-05
"gotg is the unicorn of the mcu because that was ikes idea he is the one who thought inhumans can be our xmen gotg can be our star wars so that is the one idea feige gave him but if you recall the intention was never for them to crossover with the avengers they really didnt care about it but they hired james gunn liked his pitch and let him do his thing    

every movie has input from marvels creative team but for the most part the gotg trilogy is james gunn i think the input is mostly making sure it doesnt interfere with their larger plans",2023-05-05
so this is a semantics thing because you clearly did not understand my point,2023-05-05
exactly  wheadon cut was unwatchable  snyder cut was a one star movie that i sat through for some reason desperately hoping it would be good at some point,2023-05-07
lol i watched all four agonizing hours of that disaster  i saw it and wish i hadn’t,2023-05-07
"i mean batman vs superman was utter  as well

so even if it wasnt snyders justice league his other films were horrible",2023-05-05
eh but it’s not like whedon got to come in and just redo everything he was handcuffed by what snyder already built snyder movies have been pretty bad especially when it comes to super heroes all style and no substance,2023-05-06
" he directors cut was hugely different and being 4 hours

the fact that synders cut was 4 hours is what keeps me from giving him any major props for his cut being better than whedons  there is no way in  that movie would have kept a 4 hour runtime if was the intial film sent to theaters",2023-05-07
that’s weird snyder is still the credited director on the movie then,2023-05-05
i dont get the snyder league defenders i watched the entire thing and my reviewsummary of snyder in general was when he gets unlimited control over a movie he makes something mediocre other directors generally make something amazing snyder got all he wanted for his version and it was still just mid,2023-05-07
i believe gunn includes his for example he wrote and pitched peacemaker while working on tss which had a post credit scene of peacemaker surviving so i’m guessing that scene was always there and he decided to go for peacemaker when dc was smooth sailing,2023-05-05
"it wasnt that though it was just your annoying personality that made me have to put you in your place unfortunately youre not as capable as you may imagine

it was always an immature gatekeepy term and most the music he uses wouldnt even be considered butt rock,2023-05-13
did we watch the same movie she flat out told him many times she is a different gamora and he finally gets it by the end,2023-05-06
they might quill needed to have some character growth and self discovery frankly he really does need it gamora can use some as well and maybe she will see his appeal more after spending time with the ravagers though she does seem to like her time with them,2023-05-08
"that’s great

it still doesn’t mean that critics didn’t like it 

you’re not being downvoted for “your opinion” you’re being downvoted for making an objectively false statement and continuing to double down on it lol",2023-05-07
" absolutely an obvious one being that they felt that managing the pacing of the scene was more important than extending that sequence of the edit for the sole purpose of hearing an additional word particularly if that word is not necessarily central to their reasoning for using the song to begin with

if youve ever heard the song youd know that this is definitely not the case and it cuts off before delivering the line that ties the whole chorus before it together  it even fits the movie better thematically if they had left the whole line",2023-05-05

"yeah after the way the mcu took so many legitimate relics and items of powers and just combined them with infinity gems i’ve often speculated on what items of power could be adapted or repurposed to fill in for others and maintain continuity as new characters and scenarios arise for example after the space stonetesseract i’ve often wondered if they could ever include a real cosmic cube in all of its omnipotent reality warping glory 
as for adam i wonder what could even be used as a substitute could it possibly be explained as a piece of the m’kraan crystal maybe the ka stone or a norn stone crimson gem a fragment of the heart of the universe with limited power or maybe something more similar to an actual cosmic cube or a cosmically imbued object like the cosmic control rod of annihillus or even something more simple like the solar gem that powers vision in the comics
it could even be something new a small crystalline matrix that functions like a battery with the ability to store limitless energy tie it in to the universal church of truth make it absorb and utilize faith energy from any and all who believe in adam it then converts the faith energylike the belief fonts in the templeships and the armor used hy the priests into a form of energy that can be absorbed and utilized by adams body to greatly enhance his already formidable abilities as well as grant new ones such as his ability to wield quantum sorcery this could even lead an internal and external conflict adams power grows and so does the church’s following and power the church seeks to use adam and the growing faith and power for questionable purposes adam becomes conflicted he mistrusts the church but enjoys the power his quantum abilities continue to grow eventually his inner turmoil and conflict combined with his staggering power in quantum magic causes a split separating adam into quantum possibilities of himself existing in a sort of superposition the golden shining adam warlock known to all and the new and dark power hungry magus",2023-05-08

yeah the first time i saw it i was kind of just too busy mentally going this doesnt feel nice and the second time i knew it was coming and kind of busy trying to brace myself for it so i think both times i probably didnt pick up on 100 of the small touches i really liked the movie but i definitely also had to immediately come home and hug my dog,2023-06-19
dude yeah all throughout high school game of thrones dexter breaking bad the walking dead were the things everyone talked about kids most often times love this kind of stuff i wouldn’t show this guardians to like a 6 year old but i really think a teenager would be fine to watch it,2023-05-05
"yeah im at 213 at the moment but only because 3 was much darker than i expected and feels much harder to rewatch its still really well done i think i went in feeling sad knowing it would be the last one anyway and then the movie just kept getting sadder i also didnt have any standout songs in 3 soundtracks for 1 and 2 were much better to me good ending though i think my biggest mistake was seeing it a week late it was still a pretty full theater but opening night crowds are always gonna be a better experience less laughter at the sortoffunny things just lets the dark stuff loom more

with 2 i like that they split up into 2 groups and then even further broke down to pairs minus groot where everyone is challenged and forced to reflectgrow really solid character study stuff

i understand people getting upset about the new characterization of drax in 2 but with gamora and nebulas stoic and glum attitudes draxs goofiness is honestly a nice change of pace even if its out of left field i feel like mantis kept that grounded with her read of him

other than that people complain about jokes undercutting serious moments which i agree was a big issue that took me out of the moment a few times but i was still able to feel the important emotional beats and the missed ones dont sour the whole thing for me

glad to be part of this objectively right club lol",2023-05-17
i’m part of that club fatherson dynamics always get to me in movies and peter’s was no exception guardians 2 is probably in my top 5 marvel movies and definitely my favorite gotg,2023-05-19
"its also my favorite of the three though all are excellent

i like that it does the add more characters and split up the cast that had great chemistry and actually uses it to the movies advantage from a structural standpoint i appreciate that its able to take advantage of the welldeveloped character relationships from the first movie and cut them down to stillintelligible shorthand while taking a character that had clear but reductive development in the first movie and making him more prominent yandu and using the savings from leaning on the first movie to not make the new characters seem like afterthoughts

also the mr blue sky scene that opens the movie stands as the most inventive and delightful action set piece the mcu ever had and the come a little bit closer sequence with yondu rocket and root is the best distillation of the cheerfully  up gotg sensibility in any of movies",2023-06-15
yeah exactly there are jokes in all three that can annoy me but the character writing is always excellent and two especially has some overlooked moments,2023-05-17

i thought they integrated it in the movie well and it was paced pretty well it always felt like it was what he was thinking about while he was unconscious i feel like i remember a lot of the transitions would happen after a scene where he was on the table it’s clear he had so much turmoil about his history think back to how yondu called him out in vol 2 and how they mentioned he still doesn’t talk about his past after he got hurt he needed to process this trauma to get him to the point of overcoming it at the end and have his completed arc",2023-05-05

i love that line too but i don’t think that everything the song has to offer lives or dies by that one phrase and you’re operating under the assumption that the only reason to use it would be to hammer home that particular lyric there are plenty of other songs in the movie that are being placed where they are for aestheticatmospheric reasons and they’re not necessarily going out of their way to make sure all relevant lyrical material is emphasized during those moments you’re just assuming it’s required of this one because that song in particular means something to you",2023-05-05

"i think the resolution of vol 3 really highlights how each character has a very clear character development arc from start to end some more pronounced than others

weirdly enough all 3 guardian movies balance the jokes and serious tones very well personally i think vol 2 was the most shakey with this balance but 3 kept it very well balanced

and i agree biggest disappointment for me was the music after radio head creep cover played i wasnt hooked on any of the songs that came after that conversation between drax mantis and nebula solidified the issues i might have had with overly goofy drax groots arc probably went in reversed with senior groot first then new baby groot im okay with groot not getting much characterization hes always just been a solid root of the guardians family

vol 1 was a simply story that established the characters really well vol 2 gave each of them proper development and nuance to each character vol 3 caps their arc nicely with a satisfying ending for all of them i think vol 2 is high for me because i just enjoyed the movie that much both with the laughs and emotions this is probably the best trilogy for me in the mcu",2023-05-17
"glad to know more of us in fairness i can understand why people have issues with vol 2 it gets kinda messy and is not a clean tight narrative like vol 1

but man the emotional beats in vol 2 are just too good for me every member of the team gets emotional development except groot but hes a child how clear cut peter was in eviscerating ego when he revealed he put the tumour just gave me so much satisfaction

the lotr films are really lacking in any sort of real character development and drag on and on  because of this kind of cringe claims  mcu fans became a joke

the gotg films might be much more entertaining than lotr for teenagers i guess because it is full of juvenile and edgy humor

im not gonna takeaway youre enjoyment of those movies though art is subjective and we shouldnt make others feel bad for what they enjoy but i absolutely hated bvs",2023-05-07
except it was literally the name martha that made him stop superman specifically using that name stopped batman from killing him thats why the scene is so incredibly awful and meme worthy besides it doesn’t change anything who cares if superman has a mom joker penguin two face riddler his entire rogues gallery have mothers too and superman is a significantly larger threat than any of them bvs is a horrible movie with awful writing and directing,2023-05-05
just because whedon shot it doesn’t mean he isn’t already handcuffed by the universe that snyder created and also needing to work with a script that was already set and under a much shorter timeline it’s different to come in with a fresh project rather than to fix someone else’s mess,2023-05-06

there are movies that are worthy of a 4 hour runtime  a zach synder comic book movie isnt one of them  it is just unrealistic to believe either wb or any movie theater would go for that length,2023-05-07
it was actually a choice by snyder he was automatically credited unless he asked not to be due to dga rules if he didnt want to be credited and have whedon credited they could have worked something out but it likely would have cost him his percentage and he wouldnt have been allowed to talk trash about the film afterwards,2023-05-06

a lot of creative people simply have poor skillsknowledge of various fields of science and it shows in their writing its not just mcu movies and its not just movies either lots of scifi books and movies have this problem where the author chooses to incorporate ideas concerning some field of science fails to research and understand the particular field deep enough so they fail to comprehend how the idea they have come up with is a dumb idea and an idea that the actually competent character would understand to be a dumb idea

its not just mathematics or biology either military science is a big one as well in which lots of writers fail to educate themselves well enough to write plausible combat scenes or martial arts lots of writers have no idea about how sword combat works in reality but they write sword fighting scenes nonetheless making hema practicioners roll their eyes

thanos is a highly intelligent and resourceful being highly competent in engineering and biology it is highly unrealistic to me that he would not have researched how population growth works when devising his plan it quite literally would have taken him like 5 minutes to understand how his plan wouldnt achieve what he set out to achieve

because he thought superman was mocking him for failing to save his own mother

who cares if superman has a mom

that has nothing to do with it its that he loves his mom and is using his dying breath to try to save her life thats what shows that he isnt this totally alien monster that he has genuine humanity to him and it reminds bruce of himself crying out for his mother when he was a child in that moment bruce sees the batman as representative of the man that killed his mother because hes about to be responsible for the death of supermans mother when he should be saving her",2023-05-06

"i am not saying that you are this is not an issue about quality or taste the difference is the creative process one is the brainchild of a director the other is a committee marvel has a system and for the most part they make their movies based on their system that isnt a bad or good thing it is what it is   

there are a handful of times where that committee hits a wall and they will hand the creative reigns over to the director examples of this are iron man the avengers the gotg trilogy black panther and thor ragnarok  

now that doesnt mean the russos had zero creative input in the movies they made or that marvel didnt chime in on gotg but the difference is that james gunn is making a james gunn movie that is produced by marvel and the russos are making a marvel movie",2023-05-05

because thats what happened

your argument is this its not that theyve got the same name its that realising superman has a mom reminds bruce of his humanity blah blah yadda yadda

this is correct of course youre right that its deeper than mommy name same friend

but

but

the event that gets bats to realise this is still what we all heard in the cinema which is the utterance of martha and its absolutely an unnatural thing for someone to say in that moment the moment is deeper yes but its still a clumsy poorly handled moment because thats what zack snyder is most famous for

"the actors did fine my issue isnt with them i think what they did was way too on the nose and the actual execution of it script wise was really poorly done 

the performances werent bad the writing of it was just really tacky and just badly pulled off there probably couldve been a bunch of better more emotionally resonate ways of going for what they did but they went a choice that felt very out of place and at a surface level can be taken out of context in a way that looks dumb oh so now he saved her because their mothers have the sane name how random

the idea they had was great bruce realizing superman is just another person like him and not a monster to fear mother and all and him connecting to clark that way to get past his xenophobia is a really good idea but it just wasnt done properly 

it was a movie that had great ideas but just constantly with the bad choice for its execution the minute the movie started and batman was killing people with a gun was when i realized snyder genuinely doesnt understand these characters i get they wanted a batman who has somewhat lost his way but this was beyond that same with lex that was absolutely the worst possible direction they couldve went with that character lex is an giant arrogant  who is a perfectionist and considers himself to be the best in both ohysical shape and intelligence and superman simply existing to challenge that is what drives lex to the villiany we know him for and even then hes still a very cool and collected individual a bizarre and socially inept zuckerburg knock off is  beyond  its equally as bad as the version of doom my favorite marvel character in f4ntastic 

snyder is someone who either needs source material already written 300 watchmen to direct or just do something wholly original thats not an adaptation i really enjoyed suckerpunch too btw but that film even had its issues

i dont hate snyder hes one of my favorite directors behind the camera but he needs someone to really reel him in with his ideas hes like vince mcmahon with wrestling with a good team to say no to weird ideas and filter what hes going for hes great but on his own creatively its usually a giant mess with bizarre decisions 

ill give credit where its due though watchmen is my favorite book of all time and i was fine with his decision to cut the squid from the film having to explain that in the film the way the book does wouldve required an entire hour added to the film the ending he went with still has the same meaning and effect on the universe of the story just the how is slightly altered that being said i dont think he realized that were not supposed to think rorschach is a cool badass when hes a homeless psychotic bigot right wing extremist something i think the hbo show understood a lot better but it was still very well done the stuff with dr manhattan is absolutely his best work adapting anything to screen",2023-05-07

the minute the movie started and batman was killing people with a gun was when i realized snyder genuinely doesnt understand these characters

the point was to show how the death of robin and those in metropolis brought batman to a low point this wasnt supposed to be the batman we know this was supposed to be basically what if something happened that turned batman into an antihero or even villain the martha moment and supermans death are moments that fundamentally change batman back to being the hero we know and love

sure lets rework it then

	to call someone  here is to insult them deeply it doesnt mean a simple lack of intelligence or education
	for you to call all writers  because they dont always adhere to 100 real world accuracy is actually quite  in itself considering their first directive is to emotionally inspire and visually entertain not mirror someone elses profession
	i dont know your culture but here we dont worship the iq we worship will the will to work the will to fight
	i might be confrontational but you leave a bad taste in my mouth in the way you insult artists
	there are many reasons to attack and criticize hollywood works but to say the writers are too unintelligent is in your words  as 
	and disrespectful as 
	and im happy that youre a computer science engineer and im glad youre logical but some things are not just derivatives of a and b and c
	some of these writers are harvard graduates the simpsons or veterans oliver stone or whatever else i can promise you none of them are incapable of understanding 

	so i guess from both cultural perspectives i want to say you might be  as  cause you dont even realize how ignorant you are

	and i said you were intelligent but i would like to see you create something that other people would actually care about maybe then you can criticize a group of people you know nothing about",2023-05-08

and just to nitpick

they totally address your point in the movie

gamora calls out in multiple ways that thanos plan is flawed but thats why hes the mad titan

and thats why he was so willing to move from half of all life to total annihilation

because he wasnt a college professor trying to solve keynesian economics hes a  genocidal maniac

do you not understand that hes a representation of those wrongly in power who do not care about logical or intelligent things or even moral things but only the pursuit of what they want

 sure its a cultural difference then we wouldnt call what ive said an insult here
 theres a myriad ways to be intelligent there are lots of different cognitive abilitites that are being used when applying various skills you can be really  at maths but great at language letting you be a skillful writer who is still terrible at maths its a brain complexity thing every person maybe except for identical twins has a unique brain that sets an upper limit on specific skills i myself am  awful at drawing for example but great at problem solving and abstract thinking im still stuck on the drawing level of stick figures and i tried to be better its simply just so happens that the part of my brain that processes stuff for drawing is very inefficient for the same amount of effort my drawing ability is way lower than most of other people as far as drawing is concerned im too  to draw well
 i dont see how respect is relevant we are not samurais in feudal japan preparing to duel because of some slight on a daimyos honor im also not being disrespectful towards you why are you being offended on other peoples behalf
 sure never said that all things are logical
 see my point above about intelligence going to harvard is irrelevant they couldve gone to harvard for creative writing that does not make them not incapable or highly inefficient of understanding other stuff
