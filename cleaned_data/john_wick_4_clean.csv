"for such a long movie i though it was incredibly paced it got a little exhausting leading up to the final confrontation but then you were rewarded with the one two punch of the dog peeing on the main goon and the best exchange of the movie

"sometimes john wick worldbuilding is like 

there exists an old tradition of duels against the high table  to challenge you must need the blessing of a crime family but if you are labelled excommunicado you must first receive a new crest symbolizing your loyalty to said family 

and sometimes john wick worldbuilding is like 

his name is caine because he has a cane",2023-03-24
"seeing this in dolby was incredible that theater was shaking 

also i wasn’t bummed or sad when john wick died i was honestly just relieved this man finally got his peace",2023-03-24

when it comes to these john wick films they shouldnt be remembered for the amazingly choreographed action scenes or quality storytelling but instead the consistent inability of civilians to react at all to the violence going on around them,2023-03-24
that top down dragon’s breath sequence was an alltimer,2023-03-24
"no but seriously

john wick staying super quiet while caine is holding a gun in front of him was a phenomenal break in the action

berlin was brutal

place de létoile being such a mess of a fight is what john wick was made for crazy brutal fight scenes get hit by a car bit by a dog shot by john wick  this was a wild ride 


the marquis was one of the best vilain in this franchise nobody kinda steal the show emotionally

caine was just plain surprising let me guess 5 of a kind was a funny line but man donnie yen is just so physically present in all those scenes that i preferred his actions scenes above all else 
very fun movie",2023-03-24

"an almost 3hr wild ride

 killing the elder felt like a leftover plotline from the 3rd movie
 didnt expect charon to get killed so fast after lance reddicks death 
 japan sequence was honestly amazing the nunchucks takedowns were so fun 
 rina sawayama had a great debut i am more interested in her character than the ballerina spinoff
 2nd act is probably the weakest as it had to lay a lot of exposition
 arc de triomphe sequence on foot was exhilarating the extended overhead shot of the kills in abandoned house felt like a video game
 audience were shocked and winced when john wick rolled down the stairs all the way to start and audience was pumped when he teamed up with donnie yen
 night time cinematography is perfect in this
 final duel was intense as  and the final shot by john wick was immensely satisfying 


a insanely satisfying conclusion with 10 action setpieces",2023-03-24
"the soundtrack is soo good 

we got the og led spirals song from the first movie in a sequence that will go down in history

and then we got genesis from justice on the stairs fight

i’m sad that there isn’t more appreciation for  scott adkins beating up john wick,2023-03-24
donnie yen’s character was a treat to watch on screen the combination of martial arts and gunplay was so fluid it allowed donnie to use his background and expertise while still feeling like he belongs in the john wick universe him being blind was the cherry on top,2023-03-24
"bill skarsgaard even ties his tie like a  

there might be more action in the last act of this movie than in the previous 3 movies thats how insane it was the overhead shootout with the dragons breath rounds was chef’s kiss donnie yen was such a natural addition to this universe and i really enjoyed shamier anderson’s character as well keanu reeves proves he’s as gifted a physical actor as there ever was just a fantastic action flick",2023-03-24

"few things i was thinking of during the movie in no particular order

 “it’s been an honor my friend” 
 tracker’s dog  on the dude’s head got insane laughter in my theater
 the characterization really blew me away a lot of these characters could have been oneoff scenes but they played into the story a ton and i loved it and seeing their dynamics
 the action holy   on paper it should be exhausting but it never once got tiring was never too short or stretched thin it was the perfect length the aerial shots the nunchucks all of it beautiful
 that “” from donnie yen was quite amazing

all in all i really loved this and it’s the best one in the franchise imo can’t wait for mission impossible to give us more great action this year",2023-03-24
scott adkins was  awesome  near jumped out of my seat when he did that roundhouse kick on wick lol,2023-03-24

those arrow kills were freakin narly,2023-03-24
"this is basically three climaxes in a good way each of the action sequences  osaka berlin paris  could top off another action film but they all feel different for their moments in this one movie osaka has two armies going at each other with elements not seen anywhere else in the series look at keanu making nunchucking look easy the music gives berlin an otherworldly atmosphere and the lighting is amazing and paris just goes ballstothewall with the bombast john shooting bad guys while driving fistfights in traffic incendiary rounds someone changing sides just because john saved his dog  yes this movie was great and while it felt long it definitely wasnt overlong

random thoughts

 charon dying was bad enough but after lance reddicks passing rest in peace both of you
 i saw this in dolby atmos the movie doesnt have bass it has bass
 winston tightening his fist is one of his most emotional moments in the franchise
 i wish we saw more of akira i liked her fighting style but her feud with caine doesnt really mean anything since its her last line in the movie did some googling apparently shes stalking caine in the postcredits scene which i didnt stick around for neat for the next movie less so for this movie
 speaking of caine i like the way his blindness does hinder him in some ways when he fights john in osaka there are several times where he aims at johns head and misses simply because he cant see that johns ducking i also feel like he doesnt use the environment as much as john john might slam his enemies into railings lampposts or walls but caine largely uses his own skills and at the same time doorbells awesome
 i actually like that after mr nobody gets smart with the marquis he gets his hand stabbed to a table why do wiseasses never get slapped andor shot by the bad guys for mouthing off and it gives nobody a chance to put his money where his mouth is
 if youre in a club and see john just leave immediately
 the radio station wuxia
 alongside mission impossible  dead reckoning part 1 jesus thats a mouthful this is one of two movies to release in 2023 to have a car chase with all the doors ripped off the car to clearly display its the actor doing their own driving
 i feel like the traffic fight and people getting thrown into cars is the filmmakers way of taking the  out of john getting hit by cars so often
 john doing donuts around mooks and just unloading into them made me cackle like nothing else
 until those overhead long shots with the dragons breath rounds holy 
 i want to see mr nobody team up with sofia as elite assassins with attack doggos only for them to not vibe at all and split ways almost immediately
 falling down four flights of stairs in one shot 
 john dying at the end is weirdly satisfying its like theres no other way this could have ended and makes the entire series into this impressively melancholic tragedy",2023-03-24
"as of right now that entire action sequence in the arc de triomphe is the one to beat this year that whole section was spectacular

one criticism i did have was that this is probably keanu’s worst performance as john the way he delivered lines felt like an alien speaking english for the first time very odd but his physical performance in the action sequences was great as always

anyway i really liked the movie it’s easily the best of the john wick sequels

also loved the warriors homage with the lady at the radio station",2023-03-24

"this movie was a  vision just got out of a dolby screening

1	donnie yen…what a  badass the blindness felt real even though it would be crazy in the real world to assume he could do any of this 
2	the osaka fight…fantastic seeing new fighting styles and weapons lots of blades and bowarrows 
3	clancy brown  that’s all always great in everything 
4	lance reddick  what a badass gone too soon both in the series and in life rip 
5	that  overhead view fight in paros  stunning a revelation something new truly felt like watching a video game in the best possible way why staying very grounded 

i’m intrigued to see where they go after this is there a 5 is it just spinoffs will lionsgate finally be the studio to let a main franchise series die check back in in a couple of years i suppose",2023-03-24

"the stair scene with the explosive rounds c’mon dude i was in a delirious state of laughter from just sheer awe when the camera started to float up i mean it was just sheer brilliance and what a perfect moment for “john wick mode” to kick in 

chad stahelski ascended to the heavens as a director with this film keanu has been there as an action star but after this he too ascended double ascended

"take any 1 hour segment from terminator 2 from aliens from die hard from any hollywood action movie in the last 5060 years that you’d put in the usual “greatest action movies” list 

the final hour of this movie rivals those 

for many this would be the defining action franchise of the generation i’m so  glad these movies exist i don’t think i’m in some tiny minority when i look at older films from the 80s and 90s and feel “they don’t make ‘em like they used to” whether or not that feeling is rooted in reality or not is irrelevant it’s just a feeling one gets from watching a certain kind of movie that you know will never be replicated again there may be better movies but it wouldn’t be this kind of movie in this kind of way to me that’s what “they don’t make ‘em like they used to” means

20 years from now many will look back on the john wick movies and this movie in particular as a certified “they don’t make ‘em like they used to” relic",2023-03-24

they reused the nightclub music from the first film and it was glorious,2023-03-24
"that was the most thrilling action film ive seen since the raid 2 that single take action scene is one of the best action filled scene i have ever seen it was just beautifully done

its like they took everything of what worked before and injected steroids we even had the same iconic soundtrack from wick 1 the club scene the additions to the cast were stellar and the cinematography was top level

my entire theater was laughing but not in a bad way like in this is awesome kinda of deal and as corny as it is when it was done a lot of clapping

that  was awesome

im firmly in the john aint dead camp his dog looking at the distance john got the same wound he gave to caine and what better to way to completely cut ties with your former life if everyone thinks you died

but i get thats left ambiguous for a reason

what a great franchise couldnt say enough of it",2023-03-24
"in my humble opinion one of the greatest action movies ever made the action the cinematography the music everything was on point this movie 

unlike the desert sequence in jw3 there is not a single part of this film i would remove also donnie yen played a blind fighter so incredibly well 

i think the single take shootout in the building after arc de triomphe is one of the greatest action set pieces ive ever seen i had a massive cheesy grin on my face the whole time only interrupted by grimaces at the sheer brutality of those dragon breath rounds 

what a film",2023-03-24
"my favorite out of the 4 it was excessive in the best way possible i almost dont even want them to make a 5th because i kind of just want it to end on a high note

i cant believe donnie and keanu are almost 60

"early front runner for best action movie of the year i loved the top down segment it was very hotline miami esque rina sawayama was a real standout as akira i think i knew a song or two of hers passively edit ive had whos gonna save you now in my main playlist for who knows how long but this will certainly be her spotlight introduction for a lot of people donnie yen was also fantastic i can’t believe ip man and neo have a duel while pennywise watches

the timing was incredibly unfortunate in regards to lance reddick and his role here i saw a screening a few days prior to his passing so i’m unaware if they added anything in post for him i hope they did",2023-03-24
the civilians just going about their days while all this  is going on around them is one of my favorite parts of the john wick universe it’s always been a thing but this movie amps it up so much the clubgoers literally watched john axe a dude in the head and just kept partying must’ve been some top notch ecstasy at that club,2023-03-24
the stunt team on this film is incredible and i hope everyone of them gets so much love because the stunts in this film are just incredible,2023-03-24
"i was really worried going in just based on the run time and the fact that these have gotten sillier with each entry that this would finally cause it to buckle under the weight of its world building in fact its the opposite this is the most cohesive the world of wick has ever felt and  it it just may be the best one so far altogether 

i loved everything about this and really think id put it at the top of the 4 followed by the og3 and 2 everything i disliked about 2 and 3 still exists here but the way it is handled just worked so much better imo

donnie  yen man what a  

i think id be comfortable giving this a perfect 1010 as far as action epics go its basically the best ive seen since fury road wow",2023-03-24
how about the homage to the warriors the radio dj was awesome,2023-03-24
as much as i wanna believe john wick is still alive he has nothing going on now that he is officially relieved from the high table he was already retired in the first place unless they bring up some   rule that would supersede what was already done like oh because the way the duel was done means it will not count also you guys did it on a leap year where st patricks day fell on a friday with a full moon during election year and toyotathon was on so we cant count it,2023-03-24
i swear this movie has given me the biggest dopamine rush i’ve ever had i don’t think crack itself would make me feel the way this movie made me feel an absolute 1010 for me and easily my favorite in the series love the john wick series so much and keanu so much more ,2023-03-24
honestly tho how dope would it be to be at a techno rave and see john wick killing in the middle of the dance floor like how much more hype can a party in a world of underground assassins get,2023-03-24
with every new john wick movie they always find ways of keeping the action sequences fresh and original very much enjoyed the donnie yen sequencesmoves thought the whole “warriors” thing with the dj was neat with the songs changing with each fight scene paris was sweet she has good taste putting on justice,2023-03-24
"i just seen it so it could be recency bias but that easily the best concluding the story in a satisfying way but holy  those set pieces the overhead long take with dragons breath was spectacular honestly all of paris was incredible the stairway fight the car chase fighting at the arc de triomphe

 have to see this again",2023-03-24
i love how the armored high table assassins came back from john wick 3 but with a different look in new york they looked like a normal swat team but in osaka they looked like militarised samurai those kind of subtle differences make the world feel more unique,2023-03-24

of course the action was on point that top down sequence though my goodness 

winston to john towards the end duel “just have fun out there” got a huge laugh from all of us in our showing

so i assume ballerina is next love these films man i’ll keep going if they keep making ‘em

i think this is my second favorite now but gotta let some time pass and watch again before knowing for sure 1423 for me i think 

oh my “i am klaus” how could i forget about that so random and hilarious huge laugh on that one too

"im going to try and get through this review without being too hyperbolic but if youd allow me one gushing superlative i think between this series and mission impossible and the batman we are in an era of elite action and i think i just saw the best action film of that era 

im really high on this series i remember seeing the first one opening night having no idea how good it was going to be or what would be born of it and looking back now and rewatching them all like i did this week its hard not to be just totally impressed not only by the many ways theyve found to expand this lore and keep the fights fresh and fun but also at the singular idea that was so clear in chad andor keanus head from the first movie and the way each movie has evolved and been slightly different but also exactly what ive wanted from them 

this movie just  rocks as does this whole series while i appreciated parabellums focus on action and loose narrative strength this movie seems to find a great balance between character and build up and action whereas parabellum starts with 20 minutes of pure action after the initial and quick horse fight there is basically a 20 minute wait before we see a fight here and when it comes it comes huge with the osaka continental fight this movie is less about constant action and more about building up big set piece fights with proper dualogue and weight and it works so well this three hours flew by and i cant wait to see it again 

john wick 3 was a lot about the commerce of relationships when john had nowhere to turn he turned to those that couldnt turn him away these movies dont hold our hands they dont always explain the backstory to us in classic wick fashion a lot is conveyed with few words but in this movie we see just how deep some of those loyalties go and to an extent what it is about wick that garners such loyalty he is as cold of a killer as youll find but he somehow still finds ways to do the right thing 

worth noting im about to get into major spoilers 

this is really well shown by the end of this movie the conundrum of wick has always been how do you keep topping them how far will they go how much can you defy the table and still live if theyre so powerful and in the respect of all those questions i absolutely loved how this series wrapped up im not saying its impossible to bring wick back but if this is truly how his story ends i think its a fantastic end not only did he find a way to free his old friend and save yens daughter but he was killed without the table imposing any will on him and by his very deserving friend it was in an act of self sacrificing kindness it just felt so right 

and can we talk about donnie yen what an incredible addition to this universe i loved all the new characters but yens physicality was unmatched he moved like he was conducting a symphony and played the character like no one else could have i loved how he wasnt some daredevil esque super powered person he was clearly very blind and still a force of death also loved how this movie was comprised of three assassins all with different angles all representing the ways you could serve or defy the table 

i havent even gotten to the really good stuff the tightly choreographed and high quality action i mean theres just too many great moments and fights to name the osaka raid was an amazing sequence the kingpin ive been calling the poker guy kingpin sequence the arc de triumph car combat the dragon breath shotgun like holy  for the fourth installment of a series that has minimum an hour of action per film they still arent out of gas my entire theater was hooting and hollering at the balls out and hilarious physical combat 

i dont think im crazy to say this is a 1010 and even if you can find something to dislike in this movie this is one of the most consistent and well delivered trilogiesquadrilogies that exist i have no idea what theyll do from here on out but theyve built the foundation for an amazing universe and i just hope chad stahelski keeps directing a lot more even if hes done with this ip

edit i usually dont do this but i saw this a second time on sunday and wrote this on letterboxd that nicely sums up my thoughts on why this series is so great and why its culminated into a 1010 for me",2023-03-24
why did john decide to visit the osaka continental i don’t think he got anything out of the visit and all it did was bring destruction to another establishment managed by a good friend of his i find it hard to believe that after all the trouble that john brought on winston and the ny continental he thought it would be okay to show his face at another friends hotel john had sought refuge in the bowery safely before so why not go back there although the action scenes were entertaining and it was great to see hiroyuki sanada kicking some  were those the only reasons for this story arc to exist in the movie,2023-03-24
man i absolutely loved the movie felt very proud as an asian  to see rina sawayama kicking  in such a gorgeous ensemble i freaking loved the characters of donnie yen and hiroyuki sanada they had so much character and you felt for them despite them being introduced in this fourth installment alone this is quite particular but i love that they have the actors representing their native ethnicity  donnie yen speaks in cantonese which i understood hiroyuki and rina in japanese and if you guys remember yayan ruhian and cecep arif rahman in indonesian in jw3 just small details like this are awesome and i love the representation cinematography was amazing and stuck out even more in this sequel the scenes in tokyo and paris were stunning i just went to berlin last summer and love that they had an action scene in one of their clubs i got rejected from one the most famous in berlin  berghain  and i heard some people had died inside and that drugs were huge the scene of charon passing really hit me with lance reddick passing last week rip ,2023-03-24

"one thing i noticed that i hasnt seen anyone else mention

when winston asks john what he wants on his gravestone he replieds john loving husband but later the gravestone reads john wick loving husband this ties into what the french guy was saying earlier that john the loving husband is long gone and john wick the remorseless killer is all thats left maybe they faked his death and now the john wick of old is dead but a new redeemed john is still alive maybe they knew people would still come after him so they faked his death to keep him safe idk just something i noticed",2023-03-24

i wish we saw more of that bruising in the later movies this one had his face get clubbed by klaus and the next scene he looked perfectly fine",2023-03-25

"i think the ending was perfect
by defeating the marquis john essentially deafeated the high table as he was chosen by the table as a collective to stop wick
so now he has no one else to beat instead of just having him battle another agency or group of some kind having his story end by him beating the foremost authority in the crime world brought his story to a complete end
he got out and this time he doesnt owe anybody anything like he did in chapter 2
he is free and he won against the very system that made him he beat the high table
plus dragging his story would have been worse
atleast now the 4 movies are perfect for his arc
whatever comes next we now have a complete story for him",2023-03-24

"this movie has me extremely conflicted especially when i see so much love for it in the comments and i dont fully feel the same
  

  
theres just so much i want to talk about thisll be a very long post but i just have to express it all if you will comment or downvote try to read it all beforehand
  

  
where to begin for starters i liked all three movies before this one 1 and 2 seemed like the most focused and while 3 seemed to go off the rails a little it still managed to keep the vibe and brand of action that made 1 and 2 so good
  

  
now some people found issue with three particular scenes in those 3 movies but im here to talk about two of them in particular
  

  
the scene in jw2 where he gets sidehit by a car and gets thrown across the room and the ending of jw3 where he falls from a building and falls hard some people thought those scenes were ridiculous in terms of what damage wick can take and theyre right to an extent but suspending disbelief for two little scenes is fine by me
  

  
so here comes the first issue i have with john wick 4 you have to suspend disbelief massively throughout the whole movie not only in terms of the action but also with the very bad cgi on display in the last act of this movie
  

  
in terms of the action it feels like the creatives behind the movie saw the complaints and decided to double down almost out of spite john gets ran over by a car at full speed like 56 times and he falls from the secondthird floor of a building again going as far as to fall side ways against a car below and hit the floor
  

  
that is just too far john gets  up the whole film sometimes in very big ways and he brushes it off immediately this did not happen in the past movies not to this extent he doesnt even have a bruise on his face throughout the whole movie its ridiculous
  

  
it sucks to say this because i liked a lot of the action too the hotline miami style scene in the abandoned building in paris with the camera above was incredible the way donnie yen fights as a blind man is some of the best ive seen for his type of character so cool and so charming the meticulous reloading and gun action is still kinda there but its just not enough
  

  
in terms of the cgi it pains me to say its really really bad in the paris act it seems like they threw out realism and bad cgi due to budget just to make a cool scene and thats some generic action movie thought process again this is not like the other movies where realism and meticulousness was key for the movie to work
  

  
i get you cant cut transit or make a scene like that in the real arc de triomphe but it was ridiculous drivers inside of cars disappearing cars still driving minutes after a shootout has started to take place cgi blood all over cgi dummies cars motorcycles it just didnt even try to look the least bit real and thats not why i got into the john wick franchise
  

  
but it doesnt just stop there the whole final scene of the movie is ridiculous theyre absolutely standing in front of a green screen and its obvious having the tracker character sitting with his dog out of frame was so weird too like hes supposed to be there but isnt its clear they filmed them separately for some reason i just could not pay proper attention because of how fake everything around them looked
  

  
and another complaint theres some weird comedic moments here that were barely if at all present in the past movies the big  guys face being so goofy after he dies the way that the marques body guard dies hes supposedly shot with a shotgun point blank and we see his face without even a large bullet hole and then the dog  on him and everyone in my theatre laughed even before that john falling down the stairs was framed as comedic people around me laughed its like the people in charge dont want to take this movie seriously either
  

  
and the movie was too long the japan action set piece went on way too long by the last portion its like enemies kept on showing up and things just wouldnt end the coolness of john wick 1 was how easily john could dispatch the people after him in this movie everyone for the most part is wearing armor or special suits that make it so they get shot 100 times and dont die until theyre properly killed which would be okay if the fighting didnt drag out for so incredibly long
  

  
the nightclub scene was kinda cool but pointless i get they stumbled over their own rules and what john does in the first movies but its all so convoluted and ends up feeling like nothing really matters
  

  
i thought in this movie john would take on those at the high table or whatnot but since this is now a franchise with spin offs they cant just end it all now but then it makes the events and the ending of the movie feel so pointless
  

  
why does john go to japan he literally gets a ton of people killed why does the blind man  the japanese continental owner if he spares his daughter why not just fake he escaped whats the point of john winning and liberating himself in such a specific way if hes gonna die afterward and if hes alive why are we faking his death hes got nothing to hide for hes out of the game now finally technically no one would be going after him since bill skarsgards character is dead and therefore the 30 million bounty is null
  

  
who is the tracker character exactly where does he come from how did he get the information he has does he only want money for the sake of it or does he have bigger motivations when he initially saves john hes like were both in this now and i get he had aspirations for the biggest payout possible but like why make a deal of sorts his deal applied to everyone he asks for a 30 million raise but that just means anyone could  john and get that money i get he initially wanted the money for information but then he starts bartering and keeps trying to  wick for money his motivations are just weird for me
  

  
why does wilson just let john pass outbleed out on the stairs after he just said hed help him get home there is literally no one around as hes dying
  

  
the marquis was an interesting character but his lack of action scenes and pathetic death just made him a waste so the high table sent him to  wick or something with all their support behind him if thats the case why is the high table so chill about wick winning and getting away with everything it almost felt like clancy browns character was glad john won for some reason

the ending just makes everything pointless what was the point of lance reddicks character dying and the continental being blown up if its all going back to normal in the end what was all that killing for the high table is still active and nothing has changed so its not like john made any impact what about staying alive to keep the memory of his wife and those who died alive with him 



just an overall weird movie almost like the people in charge were just trying to prove a point that they can lower the effort and push up the ridiculousness and sloppiness and people will just be fine with it
  

  
just really disappointed with this movie
  

  
and before someone says it no john wick shouldnt be a turn your brain off kind of movie it was one of the better action franchises and so the expectations were and should be high

makes me feel like an insane person because of the insane positivity im seeing everywhere lots of things people are complaining about with movies nowadays but seem to ignore here so weird",2023-03-24
"the hotline miami scene lots to love about this film

also i swear mr nobody didnt blink once since hes a tracker and all that couldnt wait for marquis to die either shoutout lance reddick considering the reality of things it was shocking he was killed off rip charon rip lance reddick",2023-03-24
"holy  that whole osaka section is the best action sequences and shots ive seen in recent memory felt like a live action anime

amazing fight choreography throughout and just kept doing  i never knew i wanted",2023-03-24
the long overhead shot of wick blasting those dudes to  has got to be one of the greatest action sequences put on film,2023-03-24
i dunno which i preferred more right after viewing fury road or this i just know that this is one of the best action movies ive watched period  keanu you earned that break man even though you would be terrible at frogger and lance rest in peace your character death hit so much harder with you gone,2023-03-24
"my only complaint about this film was the overuse of the bulletproof suits i really feel like they leant too far into them for most of the film 

i did love it though the fights at the arch de triumph were so much fun and that overhead apartment sequence was incredible

eta the visuals in the osaka scenes were possibly the best looking fights of the series so far imo i kinda did wish we had more inventive fights like the library fight and museum fights in 3",2023-03-24
i like the homage it paid to the warriors when they increased john’s bounty the dj spinning tracks while he’s fighting his way through town almost 3 hours run time but keeps you engaged the entire time also those dragons breath shotguns rounds scene were insane,2023-03-24

"i feel like john wick tumbling down the stairs is going to become a meme

also theres a postcredits scene so dont miss it",2023-03-25
didnt like how john wick took zero damage throughout any of the fights until the very end didnt really make sense like at least in the first few movies he seemed human but in this one he dropped from balconies and  and just got up without any struggle,2023-03-27
"everybody is understandably talking about the amazing soundtrack cinematography and the insane actions sequences but theres not enough love for scott atkins character killa

he was hilarious when the crowd split for them to fight and the music built up it really felt like the intro to a boss battle  and then he just wouldnt go down  another iconic john wick club scene with amazing le castle vania music",2023-03-24
every time they said “mr manager” to winston i heard michael bluth “manager we just say manager”,2023-03-24
"saw an early screening of this a while back and while i dont remember exactly everything heres the things i noticed were changed

japan sequence was a bit shorter there was a scene in the final cut that had a soldier falling down an escalator that was the end of a fight that they cut if im recalling correctly

the nightclub scene had a scene of john wick sneaking past caine and the water made it hard for caine to recognize him there may have been an extra fight between them or at least more of caine killing grunts in the club

my friend i watched it with said the staircase scene seemed shorter but i didnt notice anything different so who knows

this change is expected but i thought it was cool how they turned what was an empty parking lot in my screening into the arc de triomphe it was always supposed to be the arc but still cool to see it finished now

the biggest change i noticed though was the postcredit scene instead of cutting to black the version i saw definitely had the daughter getting revenge and killing caine or at least hurt him really bad before slipping away unnoticed caine didnt even realize what happened fell down and he never even reached his daughter she did notice the commotion though of civilians surrounding caine

movie is still just as good as the first time i saw it",2023-03-27
"loved it the third movie had me apprehensive because it seemed to wander and had too much gunfu for my tastes


this movie had the brilliant sense to bring back the brutal efficiency of the first movie but make the fights as drawn out as the sequels by just throwing more and more scores of people


definitely a spectacle movie that i really enjoyed seeing in a theater that was vibing with it can’t wait to see where the franchise goes next",2023-03-24

if i ever apply for a henchmantype job the first question i’m going to ask is ‘if i take this position is there a more than 0 chance i’m going to die by getting shot in the head while a dog chews on my nuts because the number of guys who die by getting shot in the head while a dog chews on their nuts in this film is given the overall body count not particularly high but it is high enough that i’d really have to carefully consider the entire benefits package before joining the team,2023-03-24
the nunchuck sequence was one of the coolest things i’ve ever seen in film so was the dragons breath sequence shot from above and then the stairs at the end didn’t love jw3 so i was apprehensive about getting my hopes up for 4 but it did not disappoint personally i think it’s second only to the original,2023-03-24
"amazing movie but the movie rather series sure has some huge holes lol  


1 where are the police

2 where are the other high table members

3 how the  an ordinary man jumps out of a building falling to the ground not breaking bones  


again the movie is amazing for its action scenes but plot sure doesnt make all the sense to think about lol",2023-03-24
"everyone is mentioning the action which is phenomenal ofc but can we talk about how immaculate the cinematography was in this every frame legitimately a painting with a ton of variety

also that final duel sequence was executed perfectly it was like you knew what was going to happen but didnt know how he didnt shoot yet registering with the audience right as it does with skarsgard was my favorite moment",2023-03-25
"i think i’m in the minority when i say that  was way too long 

other than the movie being long i enjoyed it donnie yens character stole the show for me every scene he was in it was just soooooo  sick he’s really a legend 

i just with they cut out like 45 mins of the movie for shortness sake lol",2023-03-29
"i have to be honest man suspending ones disbelief has always been a part of these movies and i think the 1st movie hit the perfect balance in terms of realism for me 2nd and 3rd kind of pushed it but this one went to far especially in the osaka scenes im not being one of those bbbut its not realistic people i just literally had trouble staying immersed when so many times john was up against 34 people hed knock one down and then when he had his back turn the enemy would get up only to zone out completely and forgot how to bring down his blade that he already had held high like

look all im saying is i preferred the way the fighting in the 1st movie was  it was about him taking the fights one by one when possible and when he was injured he actually needed medical help from the doctor i understand that each movie has gone more in this direction and i dont entirely hate it its just too much for me especially with such long fight scenes as osaka

id give the movie about a 710 personally if the first was a 910 for me not just due to this reason but its the leading one second and third are about a 75810 for me 4 had a bunch of really good aspects too dont get me wrong",2023-03-24

"maybe i had a wick overdose from watching jw3 the previous night but i was kinda bored throughout the first half of the movie i could appreciate the difficulty of the action set pieces but they went on so long that it lost its effect

its like if you drive really fast in a straight line long enough you kinda lose the sensation of how fast youre actually going",2023-03-25
fun movie but let’s be honest this franchise is basically fast and furious now lol fun action and effects but a nonsensical story and reality,2023-03-27
"i guess im alone here but this movie did nothing for me its just extended action sequence where john wick kills a bunch of nameless goons then they take a break to visit a new place and explain some new rules then another extended action sequence where john wick kills a bunch of nameless goons followed by a break to visit a new place and explain some new rules ad infinitum 

it all felt so basic and meaningless to me nobody had any depth nobody had any arc and i guess i shouldnt expect that in a john wick moviebut four movies deep the endless action is getting stale the rules feel like theyre constantly changing or can always be bent 

now everybody has bulletproof sports jackets and getting hit by a speeding car isnt even a flesh wound 

i just dont think i have an eye for good action choreography and cinematography i loved the first john wick because it was all fresh but every movie has just been diminishing returns for me 

though yes that topdown sequence in paris at the end was awesome on every level",2023-03-24

"loved the movie overall but the whole time i was thinking this is a 3 hour movie

the pacing of the first act is pretty meh and the 3 hour runtime was screaming at me in the back of my head every time they let scenes run on too long

the third act is almost perfect though it falters a little at the end

didnt the marquis say that seconds are killed if the primary loses so why is caine still alive

keanus delivery was all over the place it felt like they taught him his lines phonetically

charon dying for no reason was kinda dumb but at least we got a sort of memorial for lance

i think i got tired of the nunchucks mid way through their first scene then he just keeps using them to do the same ineffective moves over and over again against armored guys who hes not hurting

it was hard to keep track of who was armored throughout various fights i thought akira was wearing armor during the hotel fight but apparently she wasnt so it was just a neat looking suit she wears around all the time

the soundtrack had decent moments and good callbacks but a lot of it was generic dubstep which fell flat for me

810 movie super fun",2023-03-25
"somewhere along the way these movies turned into live action anime and im 100 on board with it every  thing in this movie is over the top stylish from the settings the outfits the weapons and fighting even the dialogue is corny and esoteric its so  silly it comes back around to being cool as 

this movie has got 

 john wick vs armored super soldier ninjas in a japanese hotel fighting alongside an army of yakuza and sumo wrestlers using swords and bows and hiroyuki sanada being a literal samurai daimyo

 john wick vs  german gangster and his hatchet wielding goons in a packed raving nightclub while avoiding a cowboy bounty hunter and a blind guy with a stick who are all trying to  him all so that he can get a brand on his arm and rejoin his old crime family

 john wick killing over a hundred assassins and fighting through the streets of paris in a 30 minute nonstop finale action set piece that changes locations four times and includes the previously mentioned cowboy and blind man an attack dog a car chase a dragons breath shotgun and the funniest  ive ever seen the stairs sequence

 john wick fighting an old school pistol duel at sunrise and finally finding peace

definitely a spoiler here i know im in the minority for sure but i dont believe the ending is what most people think it is i do genuinely think its at the least ambiguous enough to be open to interpretation with the little quotes including clinging to death can bring life the fact that johns said he wants to live to remember the fact we dont see a body nor anyone else at his funeral we see winston and bowery king have a small ambiguous exchange about johns where abouts we get johns dog who im assuming he would want to live for looking off screen to where john could be and then theres people that are saying the wounds are similar to the ones inflicted non lethally to the doctor with the exception of the gut shot being on the symmetrical right instead of left all in all i just dont feel like this send off was entirely right we cant forget a 5th movie was green lit but couldnt get filmed and both the director and keanu never outright ruled out john returning just that they were taking a break at the very least i could see john returning in more of a supportive role for his allies in a later movie with them as the protagonists and then giving him a true definitive climactic end when its appropriate or maybe just him finding peace and going back to his normal life fully out of the game sorry for the long rant here guys im an over hopeful fan that wants just one more movie,2023-03-25

"i don’t understand this movie had some seriously bad acting from keanu poor choreographed fighting sequences overblown nonstop pow pow i have no idea why everyone is calling this the greatest action movie of all time 

the 3 paragraphs of storyline never made any sense",2023-03-24
"interestingly i seem to have quite a different opinion than most people and critics i find john wick 4 to be easily the worst movie of the franchise not horrible by any means but it took everything i disliked in 3 and made it worse

starting off with the action scenes literally the most important thing about john wick yes they were bombastic and overall well done but they pale when compared to the last three movies less detail and focus on choreography lack of new concepts expect for the awesome topdown shot and the complete removal of any last ounce of realism this was a trend that kept getting worse with every movie but 4 often requires a complete suspension of disbelief which is a shame as especially john wick 1 didnt make keanu feel invincible he was simply that much better than everyone else also what happened to the directors counting shots and making sure john actually reloads in accurate intervals

story wise it was meh the first 5 minutes cover such importance that it could have been its own movie and the next 1 12 can be summed up in one sentence luckily the second part of the movie gets back on track and delivers a really good and suspenseful ending

cinematography was great

overall 610 not a bad movie but a disappointment after the amazing first three entries in the franchise feel free to counter my points id love to hear other opinions",2023-03-24
i felt the tracker character was kind of pointless take him out and the movie doesnt really change much they could have combine his character with donnies  and gave him the dog since you know hes blind,2023-03-24
"i had very mixed feelings going into john wick 4 i got bored during the second half of parabellum mostly because it felt like a series of looselyconnected action setpieces that went on for far too long and were largely there to show off what the fight choreographers could do and it absolutely was that but the introduction of the elder left me with the impression that the writers would just keep moving the goal posts back to make it impossible for john to achieve anything  all while he became increasingly onedimensional mostly there to wear suits shoot people and say yeah

i felt the same way about fifteen minutes into john wick 4 but then the masked assassins were introduced and everything suddenly clicked for me i realised what the entire series is about this is johns ongoing struggle against a world that has decided who he is and everything that he will amount to by covering the faces of the assassins the filmmakers presented them not as people but as an extension of the will of others theyre everywhere and they just keep coming and they wont stop until john accepts what somebody else has chosen for him or dies and thats when everything made sense for me johns entire backstory is that he never got to make his own choices but now he is trying to assert his own agency the only way to get ahead in this world is to master a series of obscure and archaic rules that cannot be learned if he somehow learns part of them then the rules can be changed to yank the carpet out from under him the process repeats until he either dies or submits the whole thing was encapsulated perfectly by the scene where he gets kicked down the stairs just as he starts making progress the rules change and he is forced to start all over again trying to do the same thing until something changes because thats all that he can do i found it surprisingly deep for a film series where the main character has to have a  count approaching 500",2023-03-25
"i swear its like i watched a different movie from everyone else 

the first jw movie was the best loved it was really hoping this one would recapture that what i got instead was a neverending gun battle i mean yes there were some gorgeous action sequences that running overhead shot of him clearing room by room with the dragons breath was amazing but ffs there has to be more to the movie than 50000 trigger pulls they needed to cut about an hour of people shooting at each other out and replace it with some actual story telling

and the bulletproof suits i cannot roll my eyes any harder at how overboard they have gone with those things theyre basically magic at this point and i just looks ridiculous to have people running around with one suit flap held up in front of their face like the phantom of the opera

then we have the dance club battle most dedicated dancing partiers on planet earth  people being massacred left and right right in front of them and they just keep going like they were hired to be the background in a music video and they think all the people dying are part of the act or something

and yeah its fun and cool to have the blind warrior character if its even slightly plausible they started off trying to get there the little doorbell sensors etc giving him a realistic means of knowing which direction to shoot at people were well done but by the end of the movie hes just dropping people left and right at a distance in conditions where there is no way he knows where the people he is shooting at are and then to have him as the chosen champion in a dual with pistols if john was actually trying to beat him he just takes one silent step left before the first shot and its game over who is  enough to make that call that is a guaranteed loss if john wasnt deliberately trying to draw the marquis in

etc i was just really disappointed and unless everyone else was only in it to see if they could set a new how many people can john  in one movie record i dont get how this movie is getting the ratings it is",2023-03-26

so watching this movie in 4d you feel every stab in your back during the japan scene but besides that no notes sure its dumb that a man doesnt have bones of gelatin after all those falls and being hit by cars but when it looks that awesome who cares at the end of the day great use of each actor especially yen and sanada those sword fights got me so much,2023-03-24

i know a good deal has been said of the stunt work and gun play but for me a major highlight is the cinematography if you’d have told me it was a roger deakins film i wouldn’t have been surprised gorgeous colours and truly beautiful shots  i could have picked dozens of frames that would be perfect desktop wallpapers,2023-03-24

"i really dont want to be a prisoner of the moment but at one point in the theater i said to myself this is one of the greatest action films ever made i cant believe how they just consistently top themselves time after time despite 234 feeling like theyre in completely different universes than the 1st this franchise has somehow became one of my favorites of all time it really felt like this movie was the creators just laying all their cards on the table leaving absolutely nothing in the tank and trying to make the most  insane action filled badass film they possibly could 

the lore can be a bit confusing but the action makes up for any of that",2023-03-26
appreciate the kingpin vibes they gave scott atkinss character,2023-03-26
john wick does not take any fall damage if we ever get a john wick video game it should be like that in it as well,2023-03-26
"definitely the best of the series the fights in 3 were great but i felt that there wasn’t any personal stakes or connection to the antagonist glad that changes for chapter 4 

all the new characters were amazing loved caine and nobody caine  wick’s friendship really made this film imo both men trapped in lives they didn’t want the inevitable clash is tragic so many nods to greek mythology throughout this is the most visually spectacular film in the franchise imo 

i also like how caine feels like an actual blind character it’s not like daredevil he actually can’t use his other senses to “see” and needs motion sensors",2023-04-09
comments making me fall insane felt this was the worst entry to the series japan sequence felt way too over the top slapstick movements of the marquis forces was too much entire first half was unnecessary and poorly paced until the end after like the 20th car hit him wick didn’t appear to be getting hurt at all i guess they couldn’t find a place to fit him reacting to anything in the ridiculously long runtime the kevlar suits really removed any danger hotline miami sequence was fantastic tho,2023-03-25
"did i enjoy it a bit wanna preface this by saying i enjoy the franchise and think we need films like this not exactly like this but sorta i love donnie yen keanu basically everyone here this is not a bad movie

 that being said

should it be considered critically acclaimed absolutely not it was objectively the worst of the 4 the action scenes got repetitive i was kind of shocked they went with the whole gunfight in a club fight on the stairs quietly shoot each other from close range while walking in public dog sick balls  all over again they did a really good job in part 3 of adding some innovative fight stuff this movie we had a couple things with donnie yen and then just a lot more of the same 

drink when john wick in the middle of fighting 20 people does a jumping judo tackle only to eventually shoot them in the head with the gun thats in his hand the whole time 

the amount of lore that pops up and then goes unexplained has finally caught up to me and is now annoying they may make some more films or shows in this universe that ties some of this up but if not this is going to be a neverrewatch for me",2023-03-24
"never been to this sub before i just feel like im going crazy or missing something about this movie and its driving me wild im probably gonna get down voted to  and i will definitely struggle expressing myself fully yet but i think a lot of this movie was cut before release there has got to be an actually coherent schneider cut under here somewhere i loved a lot of the action set pieces and new characters but most of the other stuff didnt really make a lot of sense to me 

im gonna talk a lot about the plot and you might say it doesnt matter for a jw movie and thats fine but this movie spent like so much fing time on the plot so i feel its an important thing i was totally fine with this movie being super long it didnt even feel that bad watching it but a lot of my problems are how they used the time not the time itself so please keep that in mind when replying 

i dont really understand why they went to japan in movie terms of course i love the action and i think its a very fitting location for a jw film better for this movie than paris imho but i am unsure as to why they went there in the first place none of the characters which needed to be set up there had any lasting impact on the actual film whatsoever and other than that there were no important elements there to my knowledge it was really disorienting for me when the only surviving character who needed to be set up there just disappeared once they left they spent like an hour setting this character up with a whole personality and tragic backstory in a dope setting she also had some ridiculously badass action scenes and they just dropped her it had no bearing whatsoever on the rest of the movie in any way shape or form and it felt completely separate and kinda confusing totally pointless and if its setup for another movie thats an atrocity everyone and their mom dumps on the mcu for doing that even when its way less egregious there was literally no purpose to her character and that is such an absolute shame it was just so jarring and it felt like the team forgot about her and the entire japan thing

furthermore the killing of the high table elder was so shoehorned in it was absolutely disorienting and served very little purpose it felt like a quest in skyrim that you never checked in to finish so the marker has been sitting on your map for days and days until you finally fast travel there to talk to the npc and watch a cutscene to officially complete the quest

i think the entire club scene was super lame and the slow motion was very corny and i think inherently goes against john wick even if its not being used for direct like heavily choreographed combat there wasnt really anyything to make the fight interesting in any way and it was all the exact same setting in multiple previous movies just done in a more bland and boring way the slo mo absolutely ruined it for me too and the  indoors exaggerated popcorn action rain which mixed together made the whole thing look like a scene from a cheap tv show they are better than this i hated that whole scene probably my least favorite action scenes in the whole series by far 

i also didnt like how much time was spent undoing the events of the previous movies it doesnt feel like an evolution of a story or even like anything at all changed they spent a solid like 45 minutes just resetting the charm or whatever for the ruska roma just to complete the larger goal of resetting basically all the events of the past 2 movies i think this is really bad writing and i get that they wrote themselves into a corner and they didnt want to go the route they had seemingly considered overthrowing the high table but you cant just spend a whole movie just resetting everything that happened in the other ones and set the whole thing back to how it was before just with like nearly everyone including the main character dead

if youve read this far thank you i was kinda disappointed they simultaneously didnt bring back a single character from the old films and introduced so many new ones i understand of course that most of the actors might not be available but i was really hoping to see hallie berry or common or the indonesian guys from the raid or anyone honestly its okay that nobody was available i wont hold it against the movie but i thought it was very disappointing that they did introduce like 5 or 6 new characters many of whom had very minimal actual impact on the movies story or characters itself as a way to possibly make up for nobody being available most were super super cool characters but this whole thing could have had none of them and itd be the exact same no dog hunter no one from japan replace the aristocrat with anyone  even just remove donnie yen and replace him in the dueling scene with the frenchie and the ending is literally the exact  same i wouldnt care about this at all if they didnt  john wick and doom these characters to spinoffs at best

anyways i think there must be another cut of this movie which actually makes sense out there even if its 5 hours i really wish i liked it as is i really do i certainly love the action especially frogger nunchucks and of course hotline miami dragons breath  honorable mention sticking people to things with arrows

edit if youre gonna downvote me at least tell me why you think im wrong first",2023-03-24
i seem to be on an island on this but i was driven numb by this movie i have found the jw films to be increasingly ott as theyve went on but still enjoyable but halfways through chapter 4 i began to  hate it and it carried through to the end i am genuinely confused at how anyone can watch this 2h49min unwieldy torture device of a movie and come out satisfied and not pummeled into submission the action in it is like finding yourself in that everrepeating hallway in thorragnarok youre just subjected to keanu awkwardly dodging a point blank gunshot and shooting someone in the head over and over and over and over and over this must have happened at least 150200 times there are a few bright spots and inventive moments in the action sequences nunchucks axe flaming shotgun but 95 of it is some variation of that gunplay after a while it just becomes white noise i was left livid that something that felt so fresh in the first couple of movies has now been reduced into a gunk thats gorged down our gullets like were foie gras geese if i had a time machine i would find the screenwiter who have the idea of bulletproof suits and smother them in the crib,2023-03-24
"almost three hours and i wasn’t bored for a second 

side note that long one take over head shot was  sick

"im ok with suspending my disbelief for movies

but when i have to completely shut off my brain for almost 3 hours i just dont find it that enjoyable

i felt exhausted after watching this

dont think its a bad movie cause its definitely gonna have its fans but it just wasnt for me",2023-03-25
i dont understand the praise this movie is getting i went in blind and was very disappointed i think the writing was incredibly off which makes sense now that i know there was a different writer than the previous 3 it felt like a marvelfication of  the john wickseries pointless fighting that dragged on for way too long a blind man somehow fighting effectively and capable of noticing the exact number of enemies like hes daredevil john wick taking ridiculous amounts of damage with no consequences which felt even dumber since you know he wasnt going to die in the middle of the movie every new piece of assassin lore was dumber than the last all the locations felt so cliché as soon as they mentioned berlin i knew there was going to be a  rave scene and japan must always be some neon  cityscape for some reason i dont get why they introduced so many new characters that i didnt care about if caine died i would have felt nothing nor did i feel anything when koji died i only felt bad for charon whom i think deserved a better death i dont think ill see whatever is next it feels like theyre just going to milk it for as long as they can from here on out,2023-03-25
"the last hour has some of the best fight choreography and stunts ive ever seen

i loved all the references especially the warriors radio dj and the radio station being wuxia

im not completely sure on the exact reference but the boat that john is ferried in is called hortense which is latin for garden it kind of felt like he was being ferried across the river styx to the underworld could have been fitting if charon were there to drive the boat",2023-03-25
i just hope stahelski and keanu really let wick rest for a while we need to see stahelskis chops in other movies too hes currently attached to 9 movies i hope his next project will be either highlander goftsushima or rainbow 6 though his idea for tsushima wouldnt fly in hollywood,2023-03-25

"keanu reeves is an enigma of some sort he is not a particularly good actor but he is in a lot of my favourite movies somehow that stiff  expression works well as a narration to all the chaos that happens around him 

but in john wick 4 his acting is just terrible he is a plastic doll while everyone around him tries to inject some human emotion into the scenes the few words he utters are so contrived and his delivery is painfully forced i’m so shocked nobody noticed 

the choreography whilst artistic and pretty to watch was unrelenting and repetitive the rules of engagement has become a farce kevlar suits using forearms to block bullets the entire action sequences have gone too far he is basically ducking bullets towards the end as he makes his way up the stairs the pacing of this movie was exhausting 

i have no idea why everyone is calling this the greatest action movie of all time",2023-03-27
"the king made it a point to say the viper held 21 rounds so i started to count john’s shots to see the film’s accuracy however i got side tracked and started counting how many times john got hit by a car however i then got sidetracked counting how many times anybody including dogs got hit by a car 


suffice to say i don’t have a count on any of the three",2023-03-28

a  obese mafia boss that can take john wick so easy even when he have some shoots in the body the  factor when the  start to fight and destroy wick was amazing is like wow now i understad why that   the father of the bielorrusian girl

and his death was perfect because john wick was in real serious danger more than another time in the entire franchise",2023-03-31
im late to the party but i have one thing that i dont see anyone mention i loved the berlin poker scene it was hilarious perfect satire of poker in movies,2023-03-31
"a lot of people in here praising the movie i guess i’ll be the one that’s a little negative please don’t crucify me

while i enjoyed the movie as a whole there were just way too many scenes that brought me out of it mainly just how much punishment john takes over the course of the movie just to name a few examples john jumping out of a two story window and bouncing off a car before landing on concrete he’s fine falling down almost 5 flights of stairs in what looked like something straight out of a loony toons cartoon he’s fine getting shot  near 500 times and he just shakes it off cuz he has his bullet proof vest which it’s pretty common knowledge at this point that if you get shot twice in a full on vest much less a thin suit you’re breaking a couple ribs 

i’m not some neck beard movie critic so i’m not gonna write a thesis for it but there’s a couple other reasons i didn’t enjoy the movie as a whole i thought it was just okay

edit i also should have mentioned that this is just my personal opinion on it i don’t blame anyone for enjoying it i just personally didn’t care for it",2023-04-05

"this is likely a relatively unpopular opinion but i felt super let down

wick is basically op now  he can repeatedly fall out of multiple heights from the building take a  ton of beating okay always go rolling down 100 steps get repeatedly hit by cars and still whoop someone fresh

plus the addition of the bullet proof suits was ridiculous  it may not let the bullet through but its not some magic repellent  its gonna sting like a ",2023-03-25
you all are high as a  kite this movie just repeated the same nonsense in the previous 3 iterations same gun scenes same chase scenes just because it’s keanu doesn’t mean you can’t criticize one of his movies for being too long and too boring the dialogue was so bad too to compare this movie to mad max fury road is ridiculous,2023-03-27

infinite ammo and no reloads is now a thing 

suits have gone from just thin kevlar that’ll still knock you onto your  into straight up bullet force fields

gravity and momentum do zero damage to friendly forces 

blind people are totally capable of firing a gun with total accuracy

why is nobody even in this movie for his character is not needed other than setting up a spinoff or something,2023-03-24
"i dont know how more people arent talking about the fact that they just were using their suit jackets as bullet forcefields the entire movie all the creativity of the movies went into how can i get the coolest headshot people hunching behind jackets taking shots like they were airsoft bullets it bugged me the entire time

i am not a person to question realism i generally enjoy over the top action but they ruined the movie with the bulletproof suits i loved the cinematography i enjoyed the story loved the characters but man the suits ruined it ruined the combat made it so they could 3x the amount of people he fought and where they fought and it just became the same thing over and over

not to mention keanu was so stiff when talking its like they were in a covidsafe environment and he couldnt act next to actors i swear theres the scene in the church when hes talking to caine and theyre on opposite sides of the aisle i dont think theyre acting next to each other i think theyre on their own plates and comped in together and donnie yen is being very charismatic and emotional and keanu is essentially reading off a paper

also a lot of the combat especially with keanu stuntmen would hit their mark much earlier than him so theyre just sitting there for half a second while he catches up

i feel like people went in with rose colored glasses and were just rock hard the entire time they didnt stop and go huh thats like the 4th time in a row he twisted someones arm back and shot them in the head in the last minute oh thats weird theres a massive fight happening and people look over freak out and then just go back to dancing to no music there were just so many weird things that were happening consistently it was tough to just enjoy the movie",2023-03-24

 fantastic the movie is so over the top with action that it’s hilarious at times felt like a videogame with how much john wick could take whether it be falling from an almost endless flight of stairs falling off buildings and getting shot by a shotgun point blank it’s just a fun  movie and the set pieces are  impressive,2023-03-24
"i loved it theyve definitely abandoned pretending john is human there were a few things in the other movies you really had to suspend disbelief for like john getting shot 3 times in the kidney at the start and being fine for the rest of the movie there is a lot of that in this one but honestly the movie was so fun i was just ok with it

my only gripe is that the character of the tracker seems like it didnt need to be in the movie at all and the movie was really long he actually is a nobody with very little seemingly differentiating him from the other nameless goons getting mowed down by wick but the big bad is negotiating with him in person and on the phone for 30 million bucks like hes a known quantity like cain then at the end theres a a huge dual with only the high table people and 4 duelists present but also him for some reason

apparently the entire thing was a setup for a spinoff which cheapens the inclusion of a major character that had almost 0 impact on the story

thats just nitpicking though overall i had a 1010 experience in the theater",2023-03-24
"only 2040 million for the bounty on john wick seems incredibly low so low that it reminded me of the dinosaur auction from jurassic world only 10 million for a dinosaur and the whale juice 80 million a vile for something that stops human aging completely from avatar 2

"never seen an action movie like this it took the raid and the first 3 movies and gave it steroids 
crazy to think how old yen sanada and reeves are to still be able to do these types of stunts meanwhile skarsgard is like half their age and didnt have to do anything lol
why tf did that nameless goatee guy have so much plot armor lol i thought he died like 5 times
when did their suits get laced with adamantium
charons death  that hits different
how did yens character know what his cards are
didnt think winston would make it or patch things up with john so fast but thats fine with me between him the guy with the dog and yens character and common from the 2nd one john had a real knack for avoiding killing his most interesting enemies
wait so is that tatttoo woman from the last movie is she supposed to be johns cousin or something now that was the same character right
im glad they didnt market this as the final part i really thought john was in the clear",2023-03-25

that was so  awesome the 222 steps fight was amazing but the paris apartment fight with the overhead camera and dragon breath shotgun was  incredible my theater myself included were whooping at every  especially the guy who got blasted upward through the table

also donnie yen is such a badass i did find it kind of amusing that he was blind in another badass fighter role though hed be too powerful if he could see so the universe had to nerf him

the way almost my entire audience went oooooo when scott adkins character landed on his head was satisfying to the bone

i think the main thing the movie left me wanting for was more of akiras bow and arrow kills so great",2023-03-26
unpoppular opinion the first movie is the best storywise at least,2023-03-26
having seen quantumania just a few weeks back this movie really highlights for me just how horribly boring the action in recent marvel movies is john wick 4 had me engaged from start to finish,2023-03-26

"second watch last night 

its still very much as insane as the first time i saw it 24 hours prior 

cinematography is brilliant its crazy to think this is the same movie series from 2014 every shot is full of colors and framed really well 

reeves dialogue is hilariously basic and sometimes robotic but the other cast members make up for it donnie yen is still my favorite but  if scott adkins isnt  insane 

im a gun nerd and i tried to focus more on the action this time theres so many stylish dynamic reloads this time theres magazines flying everywhere but the detail is still there as hes constantly grabbing mags from dead enemies checking round count and doing a few reloads with partially full magazines the elder death scene is the best illustrated one 
also love the scene where donnie yen checks the chamber of his own gun to feel if there is round present or one at the top of the magazine feed 

dragons breathtopdown scene is still a banger really enjoyed led spirals being reused also wick scavenging for new magazines among the deadtransitioning back to his pistol is  great 

second time around what really made the movie for me was the relationship between caine and wick the church scene stair scene and the duel

i dont know if it was intended to be funny but john rolling aaaaaaall the way down those stairs he just fought his way up then getting punched and rolling down another eightorso sets of stairs was comedy gold,2023-03-27
"i really liked whatever came after the osaka scene but theres something that bugs be about the things in japan 

when they shot arrows some of them went sqaruely through the helmets while a dude blocked it with his forearm also when they were on the roof john was fighting three guys at the same time and i thought it was not properly choreographed 

the people who got down on the ground or got pressed up against something always flounder their arms around and not throwing punches or whatever when johns engaged with the other two the third couldve stabbed him however he chooses to wait for john to turn to him and proceed to get killed i just dont really get the choreography 

also i cannot believe the extent to which they made the suits so op they can deflect shotgun bullets a man can get shot multiple times without having his lungs compressed or get internal bleeding from the shots they just walk on as if the bullets dont mean anything 

i understand that this probably isnt everyones first priority but to me for a film that portrays other gunfights very well i just find some of this very unrealistic the first two films were pretty believable because john bled a lot he wasnt invincible but now its as if he couldnt get hurt at all that makes it not very enjoyable for me but still a good movie nonetheless",2023-03-30
what kinda games do you think john plays on his phone whilst on the plane to all these countries,2023-03-31
ive noticed after revisiting the first two films that john becomes increasingly less verbal over the course of the franchise he used to be able to speak in complete sentences and hold a conversation now its mostly just monosylabic responses i suppose that could be part of his transformation back into what he used to be,2023-04-03
the only thing that bothers me is skarsgard’s ridiculously bad french accent the dude is insanely scandinavian looking  either make his character swedish or hire an actual frenchman,2023-04-16
"genuinely surprised by the love this film is getting 

this franchise has gotten more and more absurd  loved the first 2 films and the 3rd is decent 

despite some great action sequences which is to be expected with the talent involved they just went on for far too long the first film felt so grounded compared to the ridiculous action films we get which is something that made us love it now though john wick is essentially a superhero 

beaten up shot and stabbed multiple times with vest falls down multiple flights of stairs hit by cars and jumps out of a 3rd story window half landing on a truck come on now this  is just laughable 

the audience i saw this with was laughing at the absurdity of it and i was hearing multiple complaints of how  it was 

disappointing",2023-04-22
good movie but i feel like the bulletproof suits are going a little too far its like they are made out of vibranium or something,2023-05-27
 is that stair falling bruh acting like hes spherical shape or sumn,2023-06-06
just seen the movie  it was kimd of dissapointing to much bs like the nunchuck vs the armored guards to john wick having a lot of ammo to people not reacting to people dying  this movie couldve been 2hrs max honestly good thing john dies no more jk5 let the series die before it turns to ,2023-03-24
"wow there was enough action to fill 100 movies in this one i found the second half of the movie to be a lot stronger than the first half with the entire scene with the  guy who killed peytrol might be misspelling that to be peak wick from card tabletokill that stair scene near the end is legendary lol

also i’m seeing a lot of people suggest to some ambiguous endingand i think they’re wishful thinking didn’t see it coming but john the loving husband is dead",2023-03-24
"the paris landmark sequences were very reminiscent of missionimpossible  fallout chatting at the trocadero taking a boat through the skylightfilled tunnel the whole sequence around the arc de triomphe albeit much longer my headcanon has stahelski maybe a little  that tom cruise did it first 

having said this the one novel exception was the fight leading up to then at the church basilique sacrécoeur which makes complete sense as i can imagine stahelski smiling saying “hah take that you scientologist”",2023-03-24
"just came back from the movie this is probably a very unpopular opinion here but the movie was ok but not as good as any of the other movies in this series not by a long shot part three  and one were the best films for me this would be the least favourite of the sequels without any doubt it almost feels like someone tried to make a movie like john wick and succeeded to an extent 

the movie’s number one issue is predictability story lines are usually predictable in john wick but action was not  except the one scene in the end car traffic fight scene everything else was repetitive and felt like it was all done before and extremely predictable except very few action scenes in the end 

there was absolutely no need for the movie to be this long but i didn’t feel bored too  reducing length wouldn’t have solved the issue  it’s just that they did almost every possible amazing stunt ideas in all of the other movies that this feels completely redundant 

i also loved the camera angles  in the end  no spoiler  you will know when you see it and a special weapon  was pretty good 

i still would recommend this movie for john wick fans if you like the previous films you would like this one too but don’t go with high expectations  

i really expected some better action  in part three i can remember all the catchy scenes the book  sword fight  horse  bikes so on and so forth but nothing that memorable happened  here  except a couple of scenes 

it looks like like a clear case of one of the two things or both there has been some change in the creative team or intervention by someone who were not involved creating previous films 

simply put this movie is only a shadow of its previous films still entertained tad disappointed this is not going to be re watchable for me so surprised at reviews though puts the  movie in complete opposite spectrum you can like this movie sure but to call this one the best of all is an insult to the rest of the movies in the series

edit downvote me all you want but before you do it please watch the movie the reviews are coming in from die hard fans rn over the weekend i predict some mixed reviews showing up 

i am right in one thing though derek kolstad the screenplay writer and creator of john wick was not involved in this movie it clearly shows  what a poor decision to not involve him in this movie 

my prediction is long term this movie will be most poorly rated john wick film in imdb ",2023-03-24
movie felt like it was 6 hours and not 3 if you remove most of the action scenes and dialogue it actually could be a good movie,2023-03-25
jw went full fastfurious on itself and it just needs to be done,2023-03-26
this movie wastes nearly 40 minutes of its time in a hotel in japan without advancing a story and john kills everyone without a single scar on his face  the worst movie of the seriesfor me the first movie is the best movie,2023-03-30
"ill be honest i fell asleep during the first act maybe because i was tired and it was an extremely late showing i felt like there was too much fighting i mean its a  of a way for john wick to go out the way he did but i feel like some of the fighting could have been cut out then again its john wick everybodys after him

did the series carry on too long i dont know while i somewhat enjoyed the movie part of me was waiting for it to be over of the extended run time maybe ill give it another go when its on streaming

also whats the brand of that watch all those falls fights and gunshots and not a single scratch on that timepiece i need me one",2023-03-25
"the entry i liked least

its still fun but the story and characters were just so disconnected with any actual purpose that it made everything else feel a bit flatter  and i know “its for the action” etc but still

also definite overload of trademark fights 

highlights is donnie yen and the topdown scene",2023-03-26
honestly i’m kindve shocked that i’m the only one who thought this film was so bad the main villain had the worst french accent and basically couldn’t act his lines were so basic and boring it felt like he was reading from a script the blind guy didn’t fit his role either wasn’t particularly intimidating or impactful fight scenes and his motive and backstory felt so weak his daughter was basically it like they could have shown some emotional scene with his daughter in the past or something to make me care about his story a bit i thought the fight scenes were ok but not amazing except for the cars crashing in paris part the black guy seemingly spared john cuz he saved his dog but he could’ve got 40million and ripped his hand didn’t make literally any sense johns fighting felt pretty repetitive as well like he would flip them to the ground then shot them he did that like 100 times man could’ve tried throwing some kicks or something  bru the homeless king guy was the only good actor and his is always barely in these films why also the guy said he would put friend on the guys gravestone  so  could’ve had said anything better… the spanish fighting guy  had better fighting choreography then most of the cast he was decent the staircase fight scene was the last big fight scene  just going up stairs and shorting people was hella basic and ok he fell off the stairs but soo  not the amazing i’m probably missed more but what do you guys think,2023-03-26

i always have kinda low expectations for the plot for the john wick franchise and am willing to look over major plot holes for the sake of mindless popcorn action on which john wick delivers  
but the missing plot logic is getting annoying with john wick and fails to deliver even the low expectations so much that it distracts from the action  
here are my thoughts

  
the arab elder was built up as some major untouchable person for whom even john wick was forced to give his finger and now in jw4 not only is the elder form jw3 replace with some other guy he is killed by jw in a minor struggle  
why is jw in osaka  what was the whole point of him showing up in osaka just to get another old friend killed

the lighting and scenery of the osaka level was cool though

they pull a super villain out of their  in every jw episode what makes the snowflake marquis so dangerous why is everyone of his goons willing to risk their lives for him why not beat the  out of him and take his familys fortunes

the guy with his dog was pointless why was this character introduced are they trying to do a jwthe last of us spinnoff his plotline is so  he is build up as someone who is able to get jw in his crosshairs then goes out to blackmailmake a deal with the marquis for money only to get his hand stabbed by him and let the marquis get away with this monstrous  act

why would the jw family take him back they are all badass murderers who even manage to capture and torture jw why havent they killed the guy in the club themselves long ago why do they need jw to do that for them money instead they go get killed like flies by the most dangerous assassin of them all

the berlin stage had much more potential the scenery and setup at the poker table was good nice pictures but the plot around it is 

why would the jw family take him back they are all badass murderes who even manage to capture and torture jw why havent they killed the guy in the club themselves long ago why do they need jw to do that for them

as per the duel rules the blind guy had to be killed too for being on the loosing side they broke the duel rules also the blind guy was collaborating with jw the whole duel was a dishonest sham ergo visavis jw has no honor

x200b

i thought they have already filmed jw 4 and 5 back to back so what is the point of killing off jw in jw4 that wasnt even a real wound who are they fooling with this is jw5 really canceled

what was the whole point of the jw franchise if at the end his plan ends with him getting killed what has he achieved what he couldnt have achieved by faking his death

x200b

in the past jw movies the action and villains were much cooler and i could live with the lack of plot logic but with jw4 the action is not as cool as before which makes me whine about the plot logic 

i give the movie 710",2023-03-26
"between the love for this movie and mad max fury road i feel out of touch i don’t understand the response it’s getting reeves looks and moves like an old man and it’s almost as bad as watching deniro fighting in the irishman

there’s no filling it’s all dessert

it’s the first movie i can remember where the world seems neat but the story being told within it makes me dislike it

i understand it’s just a fluff piece for stunt work but as a movie it’s a failure as a stunt reel it’s overly choreographed

the trope of the hero never running out of energy needs to die these people have inhuman cardiovascular systems keanu has to walk like he rides a horse all day because his hips are going bad i can’t buy him as a cardio machine",2023-03-28
"i fell for the hype critics and early reactions and my expectations were not met  i guess thats on me

most of the fight choreography with keanu looked off slower and staged

tldr  more of the same

edit  the overhead shootout is worth a look",2023-03-24
i feel like im in  the minority but i think this was the most boring john wick because it didnt do a whole lot of new things we didnt see in other movies or earlier in the movie it seemed like the action sequences dragged on because they just kept killing everyone in the exact same way i got some nun chucks let me  50 more people with nun chucks oh there is a lot of cars lets hit people with cars 50 times oh there is some stairs lets throw 50 people down it i always liked john wick a lot because of how creative he got with using his environment to  people whether with his belt a pencil a book a horse throwing knives etc the only part that seemed really unique to the movie was the top down part and the dragon breath rounds which were really cool also it seemed like there wasnt a lot of passion in the choreography at times especially with caines character after that initial kitchen scene he kind of just shoots randomly and hits people or cuts people nothing much more ik im being overly critical too but j had such high expectations for it after 3 so im kind of let down,2023-03-24
"you could swap the fight scenes in 2 3 and 4 and it would not matter

the 1st movie is the only one that stands out  the other three movies are just fight scenes with a few breaks",2023-03-27
"found myself yawning and checking the watch about 15 to 2 hours in never a good sign

 got tired of the action sequences and their repetitiveness john wick grabs someone by the arm leverages it to flip them around and shoots them in the head rinse and repeat 1000x for a movie with a 3 hour runtime 

 skarsgards french accent is  woeful

 keanu has managed to become a worse actor somehow 

 its like they dialed up the camp in the dialogues thinking the more there is the better",2023-03-30

"maybe it was the cinema screens quality but anyone else notice how much cgi was used in this movie

"the closing shot of john wick on the sacrécœur was legendary   


it was keanu looking like jesus i was like look two jesuses on the screen one on the chapel one on the steps so freaking glorious",2023-03-24
anyone else feel like the tracker had no reason to be in the film he’s super  greedy for like no reason does   like save john to  john and then just gives up at the end to the surprise of no one i feel like they had him in there solely because the dogs and halle berry did such an amazing job they wanted to do it again but otherwise his character was so pointless,2023-03-29
to no surprise i loved this movie so visceral and stylish and brutal yet beautiful at the same time keanu gets a heavy hitting in this like wow it may not of been him but when john wick rolls down all those flights of stairs it was wonderfully entertaining haha,2023-03-24
i need a yen spinoff to wrap up that postcredit scene,2023-03-24
the cinematography and the set design was out of this world the shots were so spectacular with wicks silhouette against different backdrops also caines  to marquis drew a huge laugh from the audience so unexpected and funny,2023-03-24
"when john was on the steps dying and they had the little flashback to their kiss i was kind of hoping that he’d have a tiny flashback to the original dog too when that is my only disappointment in the movie that’s pretty great — entertained from beginning to end 

i’m also genuinely curious in seeing where that postcredits scene leads to it’s essentially teeing up to the sort of movie  bill vol 3 could’ve been with vernita’s daughter coming after the bride and i’m here for it between that potential film and ballerina it’s neat that this wild universe can really continue to expand naturally without john who i was sad to see go but satisfied with how he went out really cool that this feels like both the end and a new beginning without either notion undermining the other by stepping on the other’s toes

also  was i shocked to see charon die so quickly — reddick has been part of so many things i’ve watched since the ‘90s from oz to the wire to lost to fringe and beyond… really hit in a big way and eerie that the character death lined up with his passing truly a loss from a guy that commanded the screen every time he was ever on it",2023-03-24
"that ending was quite smart ngl  
i probably will be rewatching the roundabout battle many times",2023-03-24
"its pretty great

director chad stahelski continues to achieve his talents with great dramatic and action moments blended together well as john wick chapter 4 is probably the best installment of the entire john wick film series im not very big on the john wick films but i have enjoyed every one of them and this one is my favorite one the action and fight moments were extremely well executed and there are plenty of gorgeous cinematography shown throughout there are several sequences of long take action films that are gorgeous and splendid to look at with an amazing climax every performances was pretty good as each cast member provides good chemistry and style the character of john wick remains interesting and through each film his character manages to stay consistent and is interesting to observe with dialogue moments they are some moments that felt a little of putting but they were wellwritten great uses of sounding colors and style used throughout and really cool action moments as some of scenes are burned into my head

overall great action film

810 or 910",2023-03-24
one thing i would have liked to see a group of people in a bar their phones go off they check and see there’s a bounty for john wick they look at each other and they laugh they put their phones back and continue with their drinks basically some people won’t go near him,2023-03-24
is this movie worth watching in imax,2023-03-24
i would love to see the tracker again maybe even a spinoff,2023-03-24

"thought this was fantastic way better than jw3 and a great sendoff for an epic series of movies first 20min was kinda cheesy and keanu is just grunting all his lines but  once you get  into the world again its just such a fun and wild ride  

donnie yen was great glad they didnt  him off after they killed sanada mr nobody was fine thought they just added him as another chaos element but having more dog take downs was not bad   

all the action was just topnotch man osaka fights berlin paris cant pick a favorite but each had some amazing stuff all the set designs and ost are still amazing maybe the final 1v1 fight with yen was kinda anticlimactic with dueling pistols but i guess it was nice that it also slowed down to make it more personal  

big highlight was the dragonbreath shotgun overhead cam man wow that was like hotline miami lol",2023-03-25

overhead shot in paris was just insane best movie i’ve seen in theaters in a long time",2023-03-25
"i loved near the end when john wick says on his grave he wants to be called a loving husband

my take on the movie series is its about john wick trying to get out of the life of being a professonal assasin and live a normal life which he had done in the first movie i believe itw as flashbacks that showed he wanted to move on and got married but they had her killed

its been a while since i saw the first movie but i think what triggers him is when they  his dogk which for him was the closest he could get to being a normal person 2 3 and 4 were about him wanting a way out in 4 he finally finds a way out but ultimately costs him his life 

but the way i see it his scarifice was worth while as it gave johnathan his life and dignity back and gave fairness back to the whole thing 

question though now that that french ahole is dead who takes over as the head of this secret society of asiasins around the world",2023-03-25
this movie was  bonkers 1010 action cinema easily the most impressive film in the series i especially appreciated the longer run time allowing for more quiet scenes discussions storytelling etc made the whole thing ring truer than the previous three which i already enjoyed immensely this was also easily the funniest film in the series the whole theater was losing it for like the whole duration which is impressive given how long it was endlessly entertaining,2023-03-25
so john wick movies are basically fully meta now i don’t remember 2 and 3 super well but i don’t think they were anywhere as funny and nearly winking at the audience as this one was it’s my favorite john wick by far,2023-03-25

what a great movie it was the frames at the continental in japan were like paintings painted by artist the dialogues were like poetry the whole over the head camera action sequence was so brilliant and the action set piece at arc de triomphe what do i even say pure treat im still sad that the great john wick is no more but the franchise was so great literally no flaw in any of the movie loved it and going to miss john wick a lot,2023-03-25

loved the movie but did anyone else not really get emotional when john died at the end just putting it in quotation marks because i heard there is supposed to be a john wick 5 but the movies made it look like he died so idk what to think that aside it still felt very underwhelming the last bit of the movie was hilarious though lol,2023-03-26

if it wasnt cgi the stuntman falling down so many stairs in an unbroken shot is absolutely insane  like mission impossible has the flashier stunts but that was one of the most ridiculous and incredible things ive seen in a movie,2023-03-26
i’m a sucker for nunchucks and that scene was  spectacular,2023-03-26
"john wick honestly might be the first series where the sequels are always better than the predecessor as someone who just watched all 4 in the last 30ish hours for the first time what a  ride 

i was worried iv would suffer since it’s the first one to not have the original writer not that the writing was this franchise’s strong suit but the writing is actually better here not by leaps and bounds but definitely better 

not that it matters but does john’s bulletproof suit help him against spinal injuries that dude fell on a steel beam like 3 different times and just walked it off every time i know injuries in this movie only really happen when you’re an npc or the plot requires it but i just kept thinking this dude is getting absolutely bent on this rods and nothing is happening

every big set piece was phenomenal him falling down the stairs was a lil silly but i can forgive that for how bad  he and caine were together when they went back up 

the overhead oneshot was unlike anything i’ve ever seen in a movie and was  awesome

most fun i’ve had at the movies this year i’ve watched 12 new releases this year and while i don’t think this one will stay at 1 i don’t think it’ll leave my top 10 the only threats i see for it in the near future are mario and guardians",2023-03-26
"i enjoyed this quite a bit but for two things i had to  and keanus line delivery

people comparing this to t2 die hard etc are high on something as far as nonstop fights go this was quite a ride cartoonish skindeep villains shifting alliances with foes etc it was fun but this is action to the absurd somewhere more serious than a satire or parody but with the same effect a hyperbolic homage

overthetop tothemax fun stuff",2023-03-26
one thing i noticed across all the john wick movies is that john makes several trips across different continents without it being explicitly stated how he got there im pretty sure he wasnt flying on a private jet for most of those trips  is john wick really flying on commercial airlines on his way to  dozens of people imagine going on a vacation to paris and sitting next to the baba yaga for 7 hours,2023-03-26

"i know its a small moment but john hesitating to  caine in the beginning of the movie was one of my favorite scenes one of the things i love about johns character is how emotiondriven he is and that scene showed how much he valued his friends

also needed more akira was expecting her to come back later in the film and was kinda disappointed she didnt aside from postcredits of course hard to pick my favorite set piece but i really enjoyed the sequence in osaka

donne yen was great that  had our whole theater cracking up i loved how his character wasnt like daredevil either  he was skilled but clearly had moments he couldnt see

other thoughts

  stairs man lol
 the marquis getting shot through the head got a big round of applause in our theater
 the paris roundabout sequence was so much fun
 lance reddick dying so early in the moviehurts man
 the paris house sequence was straight up out of a videogame and i loved it
 cinematography and color in this movie just wow
 sound so glad i got to see this in theaters didnt get to do so with the previous ones",2023-03-27
"i loved every second the new characters are the best of the franchise and the osakaparis set pieces were maybe the best of the franchise as well keanu took a bit of a back seat in this movie for the first half as well and his script was very sparse it actually did feel like they were slowly killing him off until the end 

my second favorite john wick behind the firstit’s just a classic hard to beat",2023-03-27
"along with what everyone else has mentioned 

one of my favorite shots of the whole movie was winston coming to bring the dual terms the juxtaposition of him against the painting and the kindof absurdly long take of it was so good it reminded me of barry lyndon for some reason amongst all of the fast cutting action and very objective cinematography that shot felt like a weird breath of air

"probably in the minority but i was a bit disappointed especially by the action sure theres some nice cinematography especially in the paris segment it looks gorgeous but it lacks variation in my opinion many fights are just the same combinations of shootouts and throws my problem with the shootouts is that all of the blood is cg they just dont feel as visceral as eg john woo shootouts with practical blood effects and slowmo shots and the magic kevlar suits take a lot of tension out of the shootouts 

and in the martialarts segments you can see that keanu reeves and donnie yen are almost 60 years old donnie is a martialarts legend i just watched in the line of duty 4 last weekend the martialarts scenes in that film are otherworldly its a whole other level than whats shown in jw4 both of them are obviously in amazing shape for their age but i wonder why there are no action stars in their 20s or 30s wheres the new talent why are all the big action franchises led by actors in their 50s and 60s the rock diesel cruise statham reeves etc

its still a 710 for me cause i looove how huge and megalomaniac this film is its so gloriously overdramatic and theatrical and it fully commits to its act and the set design and cinematography are gorgeous except for the sacrecoeur finale which looked to digital for my taste its the closest we get to a heroic bloodshed film made in hollywood",2023-03-30
could not stop giggling at how fun that overhead shot with the dragons breath shotgun was,2023-04-01
the lighting and set design in the osaka continental was chefs kiss,2023-04-01
"i think it is really weird that john wick movies are almost universally praised while other movies with dumb plots with great action are often hated i really enjoyed myself at this film but i cant say it was a different feeling than any handful of fast and furious movies both have me smiling eye rolling and chuckling at the absurdity yet wick is loved and fast is hated though both make a lot of money and are enjoyed by general audiences it just doesnt feel a lot deeper than michael bay types which i feel has a clear place in cinema

the story and suspension of disbelief is so deeply  in all of the jw movies but why care the fight choreography and reeves doing awesome stuff is easily worth the admission price this same lens can be appropriated for so many types of movies it actually makes a lot of marvelsuperhero movies feel much worse  unbelievably  or bad stories compounded by inferior cgi boring battles 

i think it ends up coming back around to discussions like scorsese criticizing the roller coaster type thrill ride movies as not cinema he specifically calls out superhero movies but i fail to see how jw isnt a superhero since he has greater durability than captain america

the only reason i point this out is because you can look at some of the reviews from the certified fresh column for this movie and find the same reviewer absolutely dumping on other extremely similar movies where you could interchange the reviews i suppose the difference is jw just has action that is better and more satisfying than the others but that isnt the focal point of many of these seemingly hypocritical reviews

anyway i really loved the movie and enjoyed it its dumb fun and keanu rules i guess my dumb pointless reddit rant was more about review culture than anything else",2023-04-04
loved the movie only criticism is that it could’ve been 30 minutes shorter if keanu didn’t deliver his lines in slow motion,2023-04-05
i know that everyone in this movie uses bulletproof clothing but given the amount of blunt trauma characters suffer without making them stop fighting makes me think that at this point they all have wolverines healing factor,2023-04-07
all the shootings and killings where’s the police swat team army  nobody called ,2023-04-07
"a fun ride but i dont think it had to be as long as it did there were several scenes that could have easily been edited down a bit and with their current length came off as comedic and undercut the tone of their respective scenes ones that come to mind were them actually fully showing john tumble down all those  stairs and winston taking like 300 years to walk through the art gallery when it started i made a joke to my friend that the rest of the movie was going to be winston walking in there but then it actually did just keep going for like a full minute lol

i also have a hard time suspending my disbelief that the blind guy is just as prolific of a fighter and killer as wick even though it is donnie yen like why wouldnt john just duck during the duel or take a step to the right or literally anything idk donnies fight scenes were so on point with the choreography also that they made keanu look slow in his own scenes but i guess that can be chalked up to wick just being mad tired after fighting for 4 movies",2023-04-07
"i’m a little late but did anyone notice how caine didn’t  any of the people at the osaka continental 

the rest of the movie he kills 

i don’t even think it was about continental grounds since he tries to  john but he did not  any of the japanese henchmen just thought that was cool",2023-04-08
"just got back and that movie was so  epic i was very wary of the run time going in but i actually thought the pacing was perfect they did some build up in the beginning and then had some good breaks between the action some pretty shocking moments overall in the film especially the ending im really not sure what exactly the future of the wick series looks like 

overall i was so impressed with the cinematography and the action scenes so much every scene they honestly set up so beautifully with the scenery and the actioni mean i cant even describe how  epic all the action scenes were donnie yen also was so masterful in his role i mean there isnt really much to say i really cant even say what my favorite action scene was honestly all the parisend of movie action scenes were just so  good",2023-04-08
this movie was so  i loved every second of it,2023-04-09
"its hard to imagine a more extreme evolution of the direction the jw movies have been going in than this one assuming we arent completely giving up any pretense of john being human its a spectacle to watch for sure

and yet i cant help but miss scenes like the bathhouse from jw1 i wont say that the sequels are lacking in visualphysical artistry the cinematography the long takes the stunts etc etc but this scene has a sort of pacingstorytelling artistry and intensity that it seems has been missing from these movies for a while now overall i think its just a much more balanced mixture that made it more compelling to me",2023-04-12
"overall i really enjoyed the movie but i’m gonna get a couple of unpopular opinions off my chest here

i feel like everyone is massively overselling the dragon’s breath sequence the fiery shots look cool for sure but nobody actually did anything novel with it even once i wanted the fire to be used in an interesting major way by both john and his opponents i wanted the whole  place to be on fire at the end of the sequence the camera angle was also a neat trick but at the same time it really took me out of the intensity of the action it made it feel like i was just watching someone play a video game

also others have said it before me but it’s crazy how they escalated the bulletproof suits to be pure magic — now bullets just ricochet off them and don’t even knock bruise or affect the wearer at all in jw2 john holds the suit in front of his face as like a lastditch desperation move and you get the sense it would really  him up if anyone actually landed a shot there… in jw4 it’s everyone’s goto move and works 100 great which feels completely looney tunes

i also wish they focused more on the logistics of mag counts reloading cover that kind of thing it’s not like i’m in the theatre counting rounds or anything i just really appreciate when the movies do have that attention to detail and it felt way less present and gritty in this one

anyways you might not believe me but i really enjoyed this movie just wish they handled some of the action differently and wanted to throw my two cents out here  ",2023-04-12
my favorite beat was watching winston walk with purpose for like 30 seconds wearing the loudest shoes on the wood floors past all those paintings  it just kept going  and it was delicious,2023-04-16
"im just not sure how i feel about one aspect of the film namely that they basically give wick and select other characters invincible bullet armor that is far as i can see not much heavier than regular clothing but seems to have the characteristics of hard thick steel

i will give them much credit for not simply saying oh yeah kevlar suit and then doing nothing the choreography incorporated it quite heavily and they clearly put a lot of thought into developing a combat style for wick that made use of it in the constant grabbing of the lapel or shielding of the face with the arm

so as far as literal plot armor goes it was much better done than most films which just handwave it away but all the same it meant some people were just unlimited damage absorbers and by the end on the stairs scene in particular it felt way too overused not to mention i guess it also absorbs being hit by cars or falling four stories

i liked it when it was just a matter of peeping around a corner with his lapel up but when he was just completely out in the open and functionally impervious to bullets really wore thin when they inevitably make his death be a fake out andor whatever the spinoffs end up being i hope they tune it down a bit

to be sure though as long as they keep doing a lot of cool gun choreography and mostly a cinematography idgaf at he end of the day",2023-04-17

honestly baffled that anyone enjoyed this extremely long boring video game of a film my  did it ",2023-05-25
the plot didn’t really make any sense the high table is fine… nothing changed for anyone,2023-05-26
the action in this movie was cool but it was way too long and very repetitive,2023-05-27
how the  did caine know he had 4 nines and a four,2023-05-27
"this movie felt long and i was fatigued from all the fight scenes i would guess that they reused the same stunt people unless there are hundreds in hollywood that are up to do the job

i liked the vivid colors and cinematography whoever was in charge of lighting did a fabulous job i liked the grand locations

i think bill skarsgard was miscast he doesn’t have enough of a presence to be menacing and psychotic enough should’ve casted a different actor",2023-05-28
john wick’s durability in this movie is mcuesque,2023-06-04
"so when the duel is about to happen morpheus and swearengine give john wick a new suit and take him on a ride down an underground canal on a fancy motorboat along with

meanwhile everyone in paris knows that there is a huge bounty on killing him  including wick  yet he seems to get dropped off at the arc de triomphe which is quite a distance away from the sacre coeur location of the duel

swearengine shows up at the duel early without any issues  

why dont they transport wick to the sacre coeur like swearengine

just stick him in a random car with tinted windows and drop his  off close by rather than let him walk in plain view

that way he wouldnt have to fight off half of paris to make that nightmare commute to the sacre coeur",2023-06-05
i really wanted to like the movie but i thought it was terrible at parts the fight scene in the club literally not a single person stops dancing when people are getting killed right next to them the whole movie is absolutely ridiculous talk about suspending belief… at least in the first three there was some way to think he was human i thought this would be an action movie not some ridiculous superman fight scene garbage terrible,2023-06-10
i am like 30 min in and this is terrible fights seem clunky everything is slow everybody is just waiting for each other and that blind guy lol not sure why this was made,2023-06-12
"i came here months after its release having just finished this monstrosity to say that i think its total garbage and i havent seen 5 minutes in the entire series that ive thought were good 

the standards for moviemaking are total  the global audience cant understand enough english dialogue so movies like this and fast furious keep getting churned out to international markets where they dont have to pay attention to anything other than candy car crashes with purple and pink lights making everything look yummy 

completely overdone nonsense where no plot is necessary 

john wick isnt even a character anymore hes just a thing that moves though scenes from the beginning to the end so that the credits can roll 

it has no meaning whatsoever its a video game 

i hated that i complained about the other 3 movies and got  into this giant time waste again 

at least i havent paid a single dime for anything to this franchise 

its elevated trash that lasted way too long had way too many action sequences and i cant tell the movies apart the scenes are so similar in choreography its not even worth it its just more kicking and shooting and stabbing and nonsense for 180 minutes",2023-07-11
 movie bad scenes horrible choreography  music cgi  plot makes no sense the ending makes all the other movies worthless,2023-03-28
"without a doubt the most dumb and ridiculous action film i have ever watched yet also quite fun and entertaining my only major complaint is a lot of sequences just lasted way too long making the action feel very repetitive this film would have been better if they cut a good 30 minutes out
  

  
this film doesnt even try to act realistic anymore i find it hilarious to think the entire world is fully aware of this secret assassin organisation just continuing to live their lives normally while theres people having axes buried in their heads less than a meter from them or goons being thrown into the front of their car
  

  
that top down sequence was a lot of fun to watch and probably the most unique and interesting part of the film
  

  
personally the first film will always be my favourite it was somewhat grounded and believable as soon as they introduced the bulletproof suit in the second film the stakes dropped as john became invincible thats no more obvious than in john wick 4 where he just survives impossible scenarios and they dont do a good job making it seem plausible at all",2023-03-24
"an enjoyable movie with some pretty severe flaws following the same arc as the fast  furious franchise  started out with something gritty and pretty realistic but has turned into cartoonish substance over style

 donnie yen rules the crowd pop when he said  to the marquis lol

 but did he have to be blind i half expected him to say i am one with the force and the force is with me

 the movie is way too long most of the action set pieces could be cut in half without sacrificing anything like did wick really need to fall allll the way down the stairs again

 fightaction choreography was pretty good but not as great as previous movies in the franchise lots of enemies arriving two at a time in the hotel fight and many instances of bad guys waiting to be hit

 its cool that they dedicated the movie to reddick

 skarsgards attempt at a french accent is hilariously awful

 does paris not have any police officers a huge shootout around the arc de triomphe and no authorities arrive to check it out a million shots fired near the sacre coeur and noone thinks to phone the cops

 having a secret assassin network run from the eiffel tower looks cool but come on  millions of tourists traipse through there every year couldnt they find somewhere a bit more discreet

part of what made the original movie great was its grit and realism now wick has unlimited ammo most of the time and jumps out of buildings and walks away without a limp its so loony toons im surprised he didnt drop an anvil on someones head

still had fun watching it though its a gorgeous movie and i get why itll make a ton of money its just not as good as jw1 in my opinion",2023-03-24
"i rewatched 13 tuesthurs and had them all fresh in my memory going into 4 friday

switching writer for 4 with consistent directing was interesting absolutely loved the new ideas for set pieces they’ve been obsessing over showing us the past 4 years  especially the oneshot we all loved brilliant in all of them

but the new writer superherofied it too much halfway through the japan armored guard scenes it struck me that i was watching a superhero script without the campy halloween costumes and instead some tasteful lighting directing choreography and physical acting

i could have used less mashups of big name characters that convoluted john’s relationships and motivations especially donnie yen completely and more focus on jw and his firmly established relationship with winston and their motivations against the high table

this really hurt a lot of the payback in his “death” donnie yen is not hateable enough for real gripping tension in the duel he is also not loveable excomrade enough for emotionally gripping tension even the emotional exchanges with halle on the couch and the side by side fighting together create a strong connection between the two of them for the audience caine’s just an additional mashup guy superherostyle for the sake of being there in the script

absolutely shocked when they made that third shot “mortally” wound him even if he’s back for jw5 the whole ending payoff was ruined by a guy to the audience who just claimed to be close to john taking him out in a pistols contest which is john’s primary superpower  after we’ve watched him go to the underworld and back laboriously an unspeakable amount of times and heard even more stories in russian accents that are at best watered down if at least we knew john’s love for caine’s daughter or something of the sort there would be some emotional payoff of sacrificing 3 clean shots to spare a standin rather than have john directly tensely duel joe burrow himself

super hateable super early on for shooting charon",2023-03-25
i loved the return of the fookin’ pencil chapter 3 was really missing it,2023-03-24

i miss jw chapter 2 i feel like the whole high table vs jw has taken precedence over jw actually doing a contract and showing how efficient he is at killing the boogeyman i wish we could get that in chapter 5 i thought chapter12 was peak jw,2023-03-24
did anyone else agree with akira regarding john she was one hundred percent right the hotel and everyone in it was in danger because he broke the rules when you look at it from the perspective of her character john is a very selfish man i know theyre assassins or criminals but hes gotten so many innocent people killed because of his actions and he barely seems fazed,2023-03-24
"i just saw it today and i was gonna make a long  rant about pretty much why this movie is terrible and that theres bad 90s action movies that are more entertaining to watch than this dribble but ill just leave my key thoughts on everything tldr this movie was terrible as far as action movies go and the only neatentertaining part was the over head shot sequence

the elder scene was pointless

what was the point of going after the high table when he just focuses solely on the marchese anyway

tracker guywhy i honestly believe the sole reason they put him in was for the scene where john saves his dog instead of shooting him

bowery king they just completely said  this character plot other than to give him a suit and a boat

akira was basically pointless other than to basically show were gonna do a spin off with this hence the end credits id be surprised if they dont

i dont know if anyone else caught this but they dropped the ball on the choreography there were waaayy too many scenes where its like 3 v 1 john  up two dudes and fights the 3rd then one of the two guys gets up and just acts all stunned until john turns to him and then guy is all alright i can attack now just awful compared to the first movie

the absurd amount of bjj like we get it sweeping someone and rolling around and finishing them with a bullet to the head looks cool but i swear to  that mustve been 90 of every single 

and my last complaint the whole  this man to get back into the family and get the crest was a total cop out and just bad writing",2023-03-29
"fantastic action movie  john wick movie  i wouldve likely loved it if it werent for the titular character because much of the choreography sets and location were wonderful  unfortunately wick himself was basically an immortal superhero the entire film until it was time for him to die  the fall he took in the last movie alone shouldve killed him and he took two of those here barely a day between them  even ignoring the what seven times he got hit by a car 

i loved the first film and to a lesser extent the second because it really showed why and how wick was wick  he wasnt invincible he was just better than everyone  he knew where to take cover how to sneak to the perfect vantage point and who to  and when  the second movie was less that but still did a few things right  the third was a major departure sadly and this movie seemed to take everything wrong with the third movie and amp it up even more   

910 action movie 410 john wick movie",2023-03-24
is keanu reeves awful at acting or is that just his character every line he delivered was just cringeworthy it felt like an snl skit how awful his acting was when it came to him speaking,2023-03-25
"me steps on an ant oh no 

john wick has anyone seen my pet ant

me oh no",2023-03-24
"idk how to feel about this movie exactly the movie requires a total suspension of disbelief with the ridiculous stuff happening on screen that im okay with on its own but then it tries to have serious plot beats i guess theyre serious like the relationship between keanu and caine or keanu w anyone and it is just so bad keanus performance in this movie outside of the action was like a parody of itself in a bad way someone in this thread said he sounds like an alien speaking english for the first time and i cannot disagree the characters make a point to refer to each other as brother or friend but it reads like a total cliche with how theyre all brand new characters with no chemistry or history maybe this movie is meant to parody itself

x200b

so you have a movie that is overthetop to the point of it being comedic and also unintentionally funny at parts with the action scenes going on way too long with random henchmen strolling in keanu rolling down the stairs too long the blind assassin being a character at all doing the dog bit too often characters soyjacking at the obvious bullet fakeout at the end etc add in the terrible drama and keanu performance and im kinda confused at what this movie is trying to do i feel like most of the action scenes could have been cut down by two minutes with how long they were dragging on without doing anything new to justify the runtime

x200b

its funny at parts the drama and dialoguestory scenes involving keanu  some of the action is cool topdown scenemost of osaka but most of it is long in the tooth i guess i have to say its overall kind of bad in the end but maybe so bad that its good idk",2023-03-24
way too long,2023-03-24
might just not be my thing but aside from that apartment sequence i thought this was trite and boring i researched no1 yesterday and that massively benefits from a shorter run time and less plot armour for john theres at least 34 times in this movie where kevlar suit or not he should have been crippled or killed,2023-03-24
this one was a bit more unbearably anime than the others burst out laughing when they opened the freezers and it was a bunch of swords and bows so ridiculous blind cane ffs might as well have been a cartoon,2023-03-25
this was the worst movie in the franchise  the first part was so good this movie felt like a bollywood movie no real stakes john was invincible fight scenes were quite generic and everyone was a stormtrooper and it really shouldn’t have been a 3 hour movie,2023-03-26
"i enjoyed it overall but it has definitely jumped the shark since 2 and i dont like how much they overdid it here also the movie would have been much better 30 minutes shorter with a couple of fights left out

they really lean into the nonsense of it and on one side i appreciate that but on the other i cannot fully suspend disbelief when its so much nonsense from the dude being blind to the rolling down from the stairs it was a bit too much for me

i am also very surprised that critics are praising this",2023-03-26
"gonna be honest this movie had a few real problems

a it was too long i had to  at one point left the theatre was gone for at least 5 minutes and came back and the same people were fighting in the same area

b the traffic fight scene looked fake and it was also too long so it lost its impact about 23 minutes in

c as the pacing never lets up you never get to reset your adrenaline levels so it stopped for me at least being thrilling at one point and became tedious",2023-03-27
so john killed 150 people accomplished essentially nothing and then died about what i expected,2023-03-27
"the bulletproof suits really stopped me from enjoying this movie it’s not that they exist but the fact that there’s shots where you just see a little spark hit the suit and it doesn’t affect them at all not even like a normal kevlar vest where you get the force of the bullet still just some cgi sparks

i enjoyed the creativity of this movie’s cinematography but they really just said  it everyone is completely invulnerable now as long as they keep their head beneath their suit",2023-03-24
"the extras in this movie crack me up on the dance floor guys are getting full on axed in the head and they just keep dancing some weird octopus moves that dont look at all natural sometimes they even briefly stop to look but then just go back to dancing like there isnt mass  happening

then fighting in the middle of the arc de triumph and guys are just beeping cars like its not a bunch of people shooting up the place not a cop reporter or helicopter to be seen at one of the most famous spots in the city the van john wick hits into the side of doesnt even have a driver its like they were dropped in a glitchy sandbox world filled with npcs on pre programmed behaviours",2023-03-25

but the crowd  died when caine told the marquis to  at the end duel and i was also laughing there were a few other moments in the movie that had the crowd laughing and it was an overall delight 


oh and the audience loved it when nobody gave his dog some beer at the duel",2023-03-24
did anyone catch the black latin words on the snowy stairs scene i really want to know what it said,2023-03-24
the ending is kind of brilliant because it could either be left as is or a potential fifth movie could show how the baba yaga faked or cheated if you will his death,2023-03-24
so basically we saw john wick use pencil book and rear legs of a horse as weapons and just when we thought he couldnt surprise us with anything else he had an ace up his sleeve,2023-03-24
"that stair scene got the biggest chuckles from the audience 

amazing movie 1010",2023-03-24

the empty house fight scene into the step fight scene was an insane onetwo punch the best movie in the franchise so far for sure i think,2023-03-24
that one take that was clearly inspired by hotline miami was the most beautiful action i’ve ever seen my long time friend was beside me and the shotgun with dragon’s breath was similar to one we used to main in modern warfare and that just added to my already borderline explosive enjoyment of it,2023-03-24
i really enjoyed it the arc de triomphe sequence was the highlight of the movie for me 910 from me,2023-03-24
i just watched this i loved it so much unrealistic but fun action i would go as far to say its the best of the 4,2023-03-24

this is the most video game a film can be especially the healing factor of john loved every overlong action set piece to bits the stairs sequence and the paris apartment scene stand out,2023-03-25

i think john wick 4 and no time to die are very similar in how the movies in in that both actors wanted to end the series on thier terms i dont think reeves as great as these movies are wants to play john wick forever im sure he wants to do other things in the same way i believe daniel craig wanted bond to die to make it final,2023-03-25

i feel blessed that they allowed them to have an almost 3h movie everything feels relevant the characters grow with the stakes and the action sequences are absolutely stunning,2023-03-25
"assuming he actually is dead it would be really fun to take it in a weird direction and do a john wick in 

he’s distraught to end up in actual  and learns that a man like him can never reach heaven where his wife is so he makes a deal with the devil to return to earth with the condition that  be condemned to  people for eternity truly becoming the babayaga






edit ok i’m having fun thinking about it and i’m imagining what a  in the john wick universe would look like it would be really interesting to see a sort of stylised  that fits the aesthetic of the franchise i think it would work best if it was sort of modernised and sleek but that’s just me it doesn’t have to be the traditional pits of fire and endless physical torture 

i think the good place did some really interesting stuff with the concept of  it borrowed from jean paul sartre and his idea that “ is other people” i think it would be cool for this franchise to do something similar but with john wick’s  being his endless destructive path 

maybe it could be a chance to face the hundreds of people he’s murdered could make for some interesting character development to see what’s he’s done or it could turn it into some insane 200 v 1 fight where he has to  them all over again 

anyways it’s probably not going in that direction but it was a fun idea",2023-03-25
unfortunately the elders warning at the beginning proved correct a sobering ending to the franchise,2023-03-25

most fun movie of the year so far keanu just kills it as john wick the rest of the cast was spot on especially donnie and rina unbelievable fight scenes i loved rina’s fight scenes especially the stabby parts came out of the theater a little deaf though,2023-03-25
i feel so  dumb i spent the entire movie thinking the marquis was viggos son who came back to life,2023-03-25
i’d say john wick isn’t dead he just changed identity and went to an east european country to continue his life as normal,2023-03-25
he can’t be dead yet not when aurelio hasn’t finished fixing his car we’ll see him again probably christmas 2030 ,2023-03-25
the criteria for the amount of violence needed to run out of a club screaming was really arbitrary,2023-03-25
"amazing movie i loved it

my only complaints is that some fight scenes drag on for too much 

other than that almost perfect action movie great action amazing visuals",2023-03-25
"some thoughts

1 the bravest thing john wick did was wearing black in the desert yikes
2 what if the concierge had been wearing one of those bullet proof suits
3 the guys in the hotel wearing the body armor that body armor seemed useless they should have given them the same bullet proof suit john wick wears
4 caine seems like he would be pretty easy to defeat throw stuff to the left of where you are and sit back and watch him attack it then throw stuff to the right and watch him attack it its like using a laser pointer to play with a cat",2023-03-25
this happens within the first three minutes so i hope it doesnt count as a spoiler but those horses despawn as soon as theres no rider on them and the camera angle changes,2023-03-25
i absolutely loved this movie i was expecting a bit different of a story of john setting himself up to break the table in a 5th movie  i do kind of hope that he is truly dead it seems like the right send off for the character  the cinematography and fight choreography just chefs kiss every fight sequence felt unique and had something memorable,2023-03-25
if i had a nickel for every time keanu reeves was the title character in a movie whose first name is john where he had a scene shot from above killing people with a shotgun which set them on fire i’d have two nickels which isn’t a lot but it’s weird it’s happened twice right,2023-03-25
"pros really great cinematography especially the scene with winston strolling through the art museum as well as the sunrise illuminating the final shootout duel another standout scene for me was the birdseye view quasivideo game like shootout in the abandoned building in paris  those incinedary rounds were literally fire haha donnie yen stole the show in the scenes he was in i was cringing at first when he first appeared as a disleveled joke but in later scenes he was definitely on or even surpassing john wicks level the fact that cain was blind made his fight sequences even more impressive

cons john wick falls down four stories onto a truck and then minutes later is kicked down hundreds of steps all with virtually no injuries so hes basically superman at times the film required a bit too much suspension of disbelief

overall john wick 4 2023 rating 910 go see it in theaters as soon as possible dont read online reviews about this film before seeing it to avoid spoilers",2023-03-26
"almost the entire final act started off with “wow cool warriors reference i think”…then she dropped the boppers line…then “nowhere to run” played and then he has to battle across town while people chases him and they just kept up with the warriors homage

 loved itnow i gotta wonder how jw4 ties into the iliad",2023-03-26
i am somewhat disappointed that marquis vincent de gramont turned out to be a rather cowardly  by the end we already had a similar villain in santino in the second movie i figured that the duel would have been a conventional one with guns and melee weapons rather than a gentlemanly pistol duel he doesnt even fully commit to the duel attempting to grab the glory  when caine seemed to do all the hard work for him im not too surprised but i hoped he would have been a prodigy in combat like john wick though without the experience to truly match john wick yet perhaps vincent could have been akin to john wick when he was younger turns out he was just a blowhard he wasnt really a notable villain to me a young villain with honor and respect for his organizations rules and history would have been nice not a prissy rich boy with a chip on his shoulder,2023-03-26

it was okay but went on too long the scene in the club was utterly ridiculous guys fighting and shooting and everyone around them is still dancing the club scenes themselves were the weakest of the series,2023-03-26
watched 1 2 and 3 a few years back but didnt finished 3 cause its getting a bit ridiculous just finished it recently since am planning to watch 4 dunno what i expected reading a few comments here saying this one has continuous shots on action scenes had me excited plus the high scores but man this is painful to watch bored me to death theres something about johns invincibility and the fights looking a bit slow for my taste seems like the goons are waiting to attack before wick attends to them to take action didnt enjoy it sadly and nearly put me to sleep,2023-03-26

the final fight up the stairs was brutal and everyone in my theater made sounds of pain and disappointment when he ended up back at the bottom",2023-03-26
" i’m so in love with this movie the cinematography the music the choreography the lighting and colors it’s a  masterpiece of action filmmaking

all the action sequences were stellar the japan arc the club in berlin the dragonbreathtopdown fight this movie completely plays out like a video game with small boss battles in between getting to the final boss…it’s so so so good 

i’m still so enamored by the color palette though the fact that a john wick movie is genuinely one of the most colorful and visually stunning movies i’ve ever seen is so surprising and the action is so incredibly well choreographed it’s as if you’re watching a dance this movie was perfect",2023-03-26
loved the ending i don’t know where they can go because tbh the whole “john wick vs the world excommunication double decker taco supreme” angle is played out like does he literally have to go to the high table itself and flip it upside down and set it on fire to end the whole thing or what,2023-03-26

"how the  hasn’t there been a wick shooter or action game akin to hitman yet

this was the best video game movie ever made they’ve finally made it feel exactly like a game enemies that are bullet sponges wave attacks even the flow of the plot and i say this all in the most complimentary way possible 

great way for the series to go out if this is the last mainline entry 

but they should absolutely make a game something rpgish at least choosing your own equipment and abilities emphasis on movement just wanton mayhem",2023-03-26

excellent movie just sad how the ending went but it was a good one nonetheless,2023-03-26
"i love how ridiculous these movies are this one is probably the most fun ive had with the series since the first one  
  
the thing i love about these movies is the world building they established that all the shooting and violence and such happens inside an invisible bubble where police dont get themselves involved  
  
i think the only time in the entire series i can remember police even getting somewhat involved was the house check on wick after he killed all the intruders  
  
but back to the world building i love how with every movie every culture seems to have their own style of killing the japanese with their samurai swords bow  arrows wick is well versed in all of these killing styles caines blind man style incorporates more kung fu martial arts in his style we saw at gramonts compound and horse stable there were some equestrian riders i wonder if that was sort of the french style we didnt see for their assassins riding on horses  
  
i really loved the osaka stuff we know japanese culture is big on honor and loyalty so the fact koji basically shut down the entire hotel to protect wick over some favor and friendship we had never seen before said enough that whole sequence in the movie was arguably my favorite  
  
on a personal note i was just in paris end of 2021 and it was so funny literally seeing them have all the major plot points of paris at all the places i went to eiffel tower is the obvious one but i walked those 200 steps up to the sacre couer the arc de triumph etc just was cool to be like hey i was there at night time and it looked just like it did in the movie",2023-03-27

only a theory though",2023-03-27
i like how the blind guy could do things like fire a gun accurately quickly cut someones throat and stab johns hand precisely but then would struggle to reach for something right in front of him,2023-03-27
it was pretty good…but the arc de triumph scene was over the top ridiculous they made it seem like civilian drivers are completely oblivious to their surroundings and a police presence doesn’t exist in paris,2023-03-27
maybe i missed it due to the adrenaline high i was getting from the whole movie but why wasn’t john  at winston from shooting him at the end of parabellum,2023-03-27
if john wick really is dead i think its a cool easter egg that he drew dead mans hand in the card game,2023-03-27
"my only gripe with this one was the story i know in a jw film its more about the action and such which was top notch but the whole film felt like it had no direction other than the action

i swear john never said more than 4 words at a time and delivered every line like he was struggling to remember how to speak the trackernobody guy seemed to serve no actual purpose in the story we never learned anything about him yet he was given so much screen time even cain seemed randomly thrown into the movie as if we were supposed to immediately accept his place and care 

in the end john died but for what he killed some table underling that will just be replaced he earned his freedom just to immediately die from a wound that he could have probably survived without too much trouble i guess for his send off i was hoping for more of a resolution in the story

that being said the fight scenes in this are some of the best ive ever seen sets the bar crazy high",2023-03-27

after the movie was over i realised that going to watch it alone was among the best things id done for myself recently i had nobody to think about what they think about the movie nobody to take my focus away from the movie itself nobody to share the snacks with

if any of you here is anxious to watch this or any other movie alone do yourself a favour  just go to a theatre and watch it and while at the theatre focus on the movie itself and you will have a very good time dont let somebody else deprive you from doingenjoying something you want",2023-03-29

also found it funny how they kept reusing stunt men for goons lol i think i saw that one asian mook with a mustache die like 3 times

also good lord but if this was your first impression of john wick youd probably think he has a mental deficiency keanus acting has never been good but every line in this movie sounds like hes straining out a  its seriously awful",2023-04-02

has anyone noticed an important downgrade on the amount of blood and explicit violence during action sequences from the first movie the step up in the amount of brutality in each sequel was noticeable but in chapter 4 we barely see splatters and spilling some gunshots targets are cut off screen and with the exception of some dragon breath incendiary rounds targets there are no memorable deaths in this entry like there was in 2 with the pencil or in 3  like the stable or the weapon shop or the library fights this was a huge let down for me i know its hard to use practical blood effects in complex coreographies but at least some added cgi would have gone a long way previous movies achieved a pretty good balance between practical and cgi blood but in this case it seems it was an afterthought and i think this is one of the main draws of the saga,2023-04-03
just watched the movie quick question i didn’t see the other movies why is john wick so robotic or awkward sounding is he just suppose to be written that way or is it just bad acting,2023-04-03

"action wise  the final third of this movie might be the most creative fun unique and explosive combat put to screen second only to fury road 

story wise  it’s rough lots of time dedicated to characters and mini plot points that just go no where why did we need to see that backpack dude get stabbed in the hand why was 90 percent of the first 30 minutes dedicated to characters we have never seen before why is so much of the first third focused on combat that doesn’t involve john wick

there are long long stretches of boredom story points that lead to nothing and you feel that in the end john wicks death was done right there isn’t a satisfying way to  him besides one that he allows but with a weak story and so much time focused on others that death doesn’t elicit the emotions it should however it’s still john wick the action is literally leagues above anything else you can watch the scenes are honestly exciting it’s hard not to smile while watching fire endless incendiary rounds in an overhead cam or fight in traffic  this movie is awesome and you should watch it but it’s awesome when it’s awesome and for a lot of the screen time it is definitely not awesome",2023-04-06

i thoroughly enjoyed the movie highly recommend,2023-05-26
made the mistake of watching sisu before this movie is way too long and actually boring i hope they dont make a fith one,2023-05-27
donnie was awesome the entire way through really enjoyed him as always,2023-05-28
"made some action scenes in 60fps

i was let down by this movie i need to quit buying into the hype,2023-06-02
my wife and i got less and less interested with each movie still we went from loving jw1 and enjoyed jw3 but the fourth movie had us yawning so often there was a cool overhead scene sure a snooze fest for us tho my wife is usually super generous but she said 4510,2023-06-04
"anyone else felt the choreography went downhill compared to the previous movies japan sequence particularly it all felt like those taken fights where they have to make 20 speed cuts to hide the fact that liam neeson cant fight at all here they dont cut away and you just see old men reeves and sanada try to slowly and with difficulties grapple guys who are clearly giving in 

or the nunchucks where john uses them like never saw that weapon in his whole life and only after several minutes does the choreography actually improve to show the character is a master not a rookie

it all used to be fast meticulous and believable now its slow and laughable",2023-06-10
i really really wanted to like this movie but i was on my phone 1 hour into it i fairly enjoyed the franchise but this was boring fight choreography and takedowns were slow and so repetitive i thought for a second it was a running gag of some sort bad guys literally  just standing there watching this should’ve been a trilogy this movie was utterly pointless,2023-06-14
"there is movie disbelief that is easy to look over that we see in john wick and other action movies like 10 guys firing at him as hes sitting moving slowly in a car with no doors or windows and everyone misses or when hes falling 34 stories onto a solid piece of iron then the ground without anything broken list goes on and on

yet blind assassin that can read cards struggle to pick up something from a serving tray being held beside him yet can shoot duck sword fight dance through new locations never been to for me i found it just pulled away from the flow of the movie it stuck out so badly that i just told myself he can see and forget he is blind then the movie became more enjoyable him being blind doesnt add anything to the movie for me and was just breaking the movie world rules too much for me

i did find the choreography in parts to be badly slow in that you can see people are waiting for keanu to hit them and keanu is showing his age as in the hand to hand stuff hes moving very slow and awkward again stood out especially early on in the movie

bringing bow and arrows to a gun fight eh just give john wick a gun and let him do what he does best

the nobody character was pointless really the dog is cute so maybe they do that for audience approval

overall was a very good looking movie back to more of the rules of that world was funny hearing him take the family oath and being all serious when they had already broken those bonds before so how seriously can you take it the a second time 

hopefully he didnt die and they just made his gravestone would be shame to go through all that

starting at the motorcycle action scene to the overhead view scene the movie hits its grove all the way to the end they put in so many nice picture perfect scenes throughout the movie would want screenshot posters 

id rank the movies from best to worst as 1423 

4 over 2 since the action set pieces in 4 definitely are some of the most memorable

this 4th movie reminded me of guns akimbo as i was expecting them to put a graphic overlay counter of how many stairs he was climbing as well as headshots kills etc

fun popcorn movie believe the count is 140 kills in this one alone",2023-06-20
"just saw it great action but jesus christ keanu cannot act to save his life 

his delivery is below  acting levels 

dont get me wrong hes an incredible performer but unless they deliberately made him give deadpan lines for every single scene and refuse to show any emotion hes just not good at acting 

you have monotone boring delivery from keanu across from ian mcshane and skarsgard the difference is painfully obvious",2023-07-08
liked it didnt love it was way too long and the action was starting to bore me especially the one in the street and up the stairs the top down view fight with the dragons breath was cool i also felt there was way too many characters especially the tracker guy hes was pretty pointless they could have combine him with donnie yens character and the most unbelievable thing was how they kept their shirts so white after fighting all day,2023-03-24
"i always love a john wick movie and i really enjoyed this one but there were several things that broke my emersion

  a lot of action that stopped so other action could happen 
 when he was being chased by 4 cars and 2 motorcycles but then circled around a group of guys to shoot them what happened those those cars that were behind him
 in osaka he fought 2 armored guys and one of them kept falling and couldnt get back up while john beat the other one down just watching him struggle for so long after getting hit with nunchucks was weird

  there was a moment when john was rolling down the stairs and he could have stopped but i understand they needed him to be at the bottom for a comeback moment
  who was telling the dj his location if he kept killing everyone in the area


theres also plenty i loved about it to name a few

  i find it funny how after the second movie the bulletproof suits became canon and everyone fights by ducking their head behind their jacket
  after playing hitman this movie made me realize that berlin really does have a big rave scene

is winston johns father at charons grave winston called him a friend but at johns grave winston called him son",2023-03-24
"john should have just killed himself at the end of two would have saved everyone a lot of pain suffering and loss 





john seemingly did not actually achieve anything across the last two films  the high table structure corruption system is all in place as it was john just got some of his friends hurt and killed but didnt actually further any goal 




john set out to  them all but didnt do anything i wouldnt mind if something had changed but john is dead and nothing has changed except some good people died and some bad people who will be replaced by equally bad people died 





also winston could have raised the idea of the duel at the end of two would have saved john some time 





if john isnt dead and it is faked then why wouldnt john do that at the end of two if the hightable would still be aware then faking his death is pretty pointless





very cool action set pieces and choreography pretty terrible ending that seemingly invalidates johns journey john could have been free and died at any time",2023-03-27
"honestly i have to say i really didnt like it as much as i wanted to huge fan of the series but man this was really lacking for me

it felt like the actions scenes were very repetitive in this one coming from 3 where we had the horse kicking deaths and tactical dogs and the knife duel and boban getting killed by being curb stomped by a book it just doesnt have anything like that for me

the drone ceiling pov scene was very cool but that was really it where as 2 and 3 it felt like it was loaded with stuff like that

also i know keanu is old as  now and it aint his fault but it really shows in this movie and some of the fight choreography looks like dudes just waiting on their cue to do something",2023-03-29
"this is not a good movie watching an assassin as he fights stabs and shoots his foes in a bloody quest for vengeance despite the fact that the bible clearly states that killing is a sin  
we follow john wick as he battles for freedom from the council of crime lords known as the high table a vendetta that shows a blatant disregard for the sacred command the lord bestowed upon humanity in exodus 2013 thou shalt not   
despite this crystalclear commandment john wick puzzlingly spends the films runtime either ignoring or intentionally flouting gods edicts as he guns down his socalled enemies and even pummels his fellow man to death  
even without being bornagain into the faith of our savior jesus christ a passing knowledge of the old testament should make wick aware of the divine law against killing that the prophet moses brought down from mount sinai etched into stone spoken to him by elohim himself
strangely however he still repeatedly commits this transgression without once attending confession and repenting for his sins  
while the character of john wick does have redeeming qualities seeing as he never covets another mans wife or creates a graven image before the lord to engage in idol worship audiences will likely feel these apparent virtues undercut by his willingness to spill the blood of fellow children of  as if the love and grace of our heavenly father doesnt matter to him at all  
admittedly the film makes some flimsy attempts to justify wicks sinful nature suggesting that his foes are also sinners who have strayed out of the light of the lord but most filmgoers will easily see through this theologically misguided perspective which does not absolve john wick of his wickedness as we find in the lords word in romans 1219 dearly beloved avenge not yourselves but rather give place unto wrath for it is written vengeance is mine saith the lord i mean how could that be more clear killing is wrong  
still while audiences will no doubt be saddened by john wicks inability to accept the holy spirit into his heart while he succumbs to lucifers temptations many will find solace in knowing that the lord will eventually be avenged sevenfold with john wick someday facing divine retribution for living in defiance of sacred ordinances perhaps carried out by the swift flaming sword of the archangel gabriel or by st peter himself denying wick entry into the shining gates of heavens kingdom  
ultimately one can only hope that any sequel to john wick 4 follows the characters journey into repentance as he accepts the warm loving embrace of the lord and chooses to solve his problems not with violence but instead by falling to his knees taking out his rosary and seeking the guidance of the almighty  and if not audiences can at least rest easy knowing that after he dies john wick will go directly to

movie was dumb fun only complaint was the blind guy caine was too much i’m all for the cheesy action and overthetop’ness but the blind guy being so integral i just couldn’t stomach,2023-03-25
theres some really spectacular action in the final act but getting there was a huge drag  why this movie is nearly 3 hours long is mind boggling,2023-03-28
it seems i have the complete opposite opinion about this movie than most people i thought it was way too long lots of boringrepetitive action and a lot of the movie felt pointless the japanese hotel fight scene felt way too long and served no purpose why was john there the action was extremely repetitive and it felt like the same 23 takedowns continually repeated i think that my problem was that the scene felt like 2030 minutes when it should have been 10 also what was the point of trackernobody it felt like they wanted a repeat of halle berry in fact i think it would have worked better if it had been halle berry especially if the table has found her daughter and was threatening her like they were doing with caine i did think that the movie got better when they got to pairs except for the stairs fight leading up to the dueling location which again i thought went on too long and was too repetitive and also thought the overhead shot scene was amazing i almost wish most of the movie had been john trying to get to the dueling location also i think johns death was pointless which i guess may have been the point but that doesnt mean its good i have no problem with his death but i feel like it could have done better if fact it think it would have been better if the movie started at the japanese hotel john goes to the his old friendmanager to get information about the current location of the elder the manager dies and his daughter blames john way more then at the end of the movie caine dies somehow as well as the marquis john goes to visit caines daughter to pay respects and the managers daughter appears to  john to bring the seriess theme of revenge full circle i dont know why this movie felt so different to me i didnt have this problem with the other three movies,2023-03-26

kane being blind legitimately  me off like it was cool at the beginning when he had the sensors and stuff but towards the middle and end it was like he just had super powers and was only blind when it was convienent like seriously the man played poker and knew he had 4 9s without seeing it,2023-03-25
did anyone else love seeing fishburne and reeves back on screen together it made me wonder what that crappy new matrix movie could have been,2023-03-25

"there were some fun moments but these movies keep getting lazier how many scenes where 10 people are shooting him only for him to hold up his suit and block every bullet are we gonna see the first film was good because most of the kills were creative and watching this calculated methodical killing machine was like watching bill murrary at the end of groundhog day now he might as well be in an iron man bulletproof suit for some of these fights and for what the same judo flip headshot move weve seen hundreds of times now 

the best parts of this movie were donnie yen the japanese fights and that dragonsbreath hotline miami shot because they were new and creative but i was rolling my eyes at the 17th john and guy run up to each other and grapple for a judoflipgun throw give me more knife fights from 3 and less cgi cars somehow not killing john wick",2023-03-26

gonna be honest i thought the bulletproof suits concept was pretty dumb,2023-03-25

" he cant hit the guys riding on horses in the beginning but hes this perfect assassin felt weird
 lance reddick dying and having his character die so quickly was hard only to have charon be spoken about with such reverence in the story killed me 
 legit use of nunckaku is something i never thought id see in a gun fight
 mr manager is always going to be hilarious arrested development is a great show
 the gold teeth guy scott adkins is a well known stunt actor whos done a ton of cool work before this
 why didnt everyone run out of the club when the bodies started hitting the floor
 laurence fishburne felt kinda out of place here
 donnie yen was fun to watch
 car chase sequence was incredible john wick just ate cars with his shoulder
 why doesnt john just ride a random motorcycle up the stairs after the first try
 i liked the way they ended it and kept it open
 tracker and his doggo were the best invasion is pretty good if you want to see more from him
 nuts",2023-03-24
my brutally honest take is that the series peaked with the first movie the cinematography in this movie is excellent but the fight choreography is sloppy and nonsensical every single fight scene relies on highly trained assassins running at john one by one in the open the fight scenes in 1 were much more grounded and believable i cant enjoy the action in a movie when the tension is nonexistent,2023-04-01
"some excellent set pieces and top notch action but i was kinda disappointed 

the premise of the movie is very thin especially considering the fact that the preceding movies in this franchise have tread very similar ground and keanu can’t act to save his life really felt like the action and villain’s performances did all the heavy lifting also felt like there were a lot of loose endsplot holes that became sort of frustrating as the runtime went on i know these movies are not meant to be analyzed or pored over but there should be something beyond the action that draws you in imo 

i feel like it’s worth the price of admission but if you’re lukewarm on some of the other movies in this series you’re not missing a whole lot that hasn’t been done already",2023-03-25
i sadly did not like it at all i had very high hopes for the movie but the fight scenes felt worse than the liam neeson trying to jump over a fence scene,2023-03-31
im not trying to be overdramatic but this movie deserves an oscar for sound editing and cinematography,2023-03-24
"while i loved the creative shots for the final fights 

they really blew there load starting in japan i think those fights were the best in the series it was just awesome seeing bows vs guns and the location was so well used and colorful 

it’s a great film not as perfect as reviewers said it was i felt parts were filler for world building and if they made this series a tv show i think the film would have been better paced but it’s amazing moments are so dam good that when the film slows down it’s noticeable only because of how high this film gets 

i can’t decide if this film or the third film is my favorite but definitely both are some of the best action films ever made",2023-03-24

"went the other night with two others  we’ve watched all four films together

this was easily my favourite after the first which i rewatched after seeing 4 and it is still the best one

i don’t really know the terms but the quality of the filming the vibrancy of the colours etc was all amazing

as always the action was incredible but if i dare say it some of the action scenes dragged a bit i feel like they could have chopped a couple of minutes off each of the goon fight scenes in the japanese hotel by the arc de trombone and fighting up the stairs and not lost much but kept a tighter run time … i feel like it went for maybe 2030 mins too long

the scene with the rolling back down the stairs was a bit dumb like i get the point but people in the cinema were laughing in a ‘that’s ’ way

i really enjoyed the dialogue focused scenes with winston the marquis etc some great lines

the plot of the duel wasn’t what i was expecting at the start  i thought he was going to hunt down the table members and  them off

ending was satisfying too feeling like a natural conclusion and a fitting end",2023-03-24

did anyone else get confused over the lead henchman dying like three times i guess they were just similar looking actors but i could have swore he died in osaka where john took the pin off him then when he fell down the stairs after trying to shoot the minois and then on the stairs to the church when the dog got him,2023-03-25
"pros 

this is peak keanu he was born for this role

the osaka sequence is godtier

donnie yen is the definition of cool

the birdseye view sequence covering an entire floor of a building during a shoot out

the flight of stairs sequence

the cinematography is amazing all the colors pop

the pacing and editing doesnt feel its run time at all

the duel sequence

the ending unexpected and perfect 

cons

 it had to end 

this is the apex mountain of modern day action movies these films have been an unexpected surprise and the people behind it have gone above and beyond perfecting their craft along the way to entertain the audience in a world dominated by cgi blockbusters the john wick films have been a breath of fresh air relying on beautifully crafted stunt choreography fantastic direction and actors that came to play and who knew exactly what kind of films they were making chapter 4 took everything from the first 3 films and amplified it i don’t wanna spoiler anything here as this deserves to be experienced first hand keanu reeves was born to play this character and this is his best outing as the character yet i cant say enough positive things about this film pure action escapism 910",2023-03-25
i’m not a huge fan of the franchise but enjoyed the previous 3 films but this one…holy  it’s an action masterpiece the cinematography the sound the stunts the locations are incredible…and even the plot makes sense which is quite rare for such an intense action film i loved it i’m going again to watch it on the imax,2023-03-25
"the pros

1 cinematography

2 soundtrack

3 action

4 pacing

5 choreography 

the cons

the plot im sorry but alot of this  didnt make sense the “old law” just allows anyone who is excommunicado to just…stop being that along with any list of terms if they win a duel… and whats the point of having “excommunicado” if someone cant just…rejoin a family to be back in 

and wick’s death was not satisfying whatsoever the entire movie they hammered home that killing the marquis accomplishes nothing as he will just be replaced “before the body is cold” yet alllll of this 4 chapter saga culminates in john dying to  an inconsequential baddie 

all of john’s friendsallies who had to die or be hurt along the way only for john to accomplish what exactly the 2nd hand man to the hotel is dead the hotel itself is in ashes the bowery king is mutilated shimazu is dead etc 

i feel the series either needed to end with wick dismantling the table entirely escaping with his true freedom again or dying to right his own wrongs all he did was create more chaos and deathand for what it’s established his motivation other than revenge was to “remember” his wife cant do that now can he 

killing the marquis was irrelevant to avenging his situation anyways how was wick dying at the end of the movie any better than him dying at the beginning",2023-03-25
i find pretty much all the “lore” in this series to be very silly and convoluted but like what is the point of challenging someone from the table to a one on one duel if they can just sub in somebody else like that’s so ,2023-03-25
 that has to be one of the worst instances of a characters death and the actors being in sync,2023-03-26
"the intro was a bit odd

john rides out into the desert the pistolwork was pretty lame and meets the elder who is a different elder and then kills him just seems like a random additional plotpoint  why was the elder different what happened to the old one would it have mattered if the jw3 elder was still there but didnt have the ring were led to believe this whole thing is happening over a period of months not prolonged years right

its not really worth dwelling on as killing him sets off the chain anyway its just a bit random in a generally quite tight script

edit i should add i dont necessarily disagree with him hunting down the elder i just dont know why its a different elder",2023-03-26
whole theater applauded when john shot the marquis,2023-03-27
"looking around on the internet i feel this might be the only negative review youll read i dont know if i really liked this movie i like the jw franchise and how it often pushes what is credible action but in this movie i had difficulties believing what was happening my main problems are

guns guns have become obsolete weapons the kevlar vest is cool but people are just immune to bullets in this movie it felt like swords were more effective weapons than guns

action i felt a strong regression from the action in the previous movies the camera started to become more shaky particularly in jhons scenes out of all action scenes jhon ones are probably the most generic with some exceptions the over the walls shot was amazing the club scene was also very good looking the car chase felt cgiish

jhon wick  jhon doesnt quite feel like hes jhon wick he never is truly in control of a situation hes just pretty much immune to bullets he gets constantly surrounded taken by surprise and he just survives out of his property of not getting harmed by bullets also the way he takes out enemies is boring and repetitive

weird factor i like the weird factor of the jw franchise the kingpin looking guy was great but sometimes things are just a little too weird like most of the kingpin henchmen not using guns and using tomhawks instead with no context whatsoever 

side characters side characters are pretty good the dog guy felt to me like he was more jhon wick than jhon wick i wish the bowery king had a bigger part in this movie

story the story doesnt really make much sense on itself and doesnt connect well with the previous movies either the last movie ended with jw and the king plotting toghether their vengeance towards the table hinting they are gonna try to dismantle the table system they  the regent at the start of the movie but that didnt really work out it felt more like a declaration of war but then he just randomly goes to the continental in osaka and the movie reverts to the plot of the third one its the table stalking him not him stalking the table even if the table couldnt be dismantled it would have been ok if they caused so much mayhem that the they would force the tables hand to give up the bowery plays little to no part in the story 

the marquis the marquis is cool but he isnt even a sitting member of the table hes just a random guy they tasked with killing jhon wick he isnt big enough to be the final enemy of the last chapter of the saga

the ending while it looked very good with the very beautiful dawn shots i dont think the ending is a satisfactory conclusion to the story basically jhon lets himself get killed for what to save winston and the blind assassin if he had to die to get his freedom back he might aswell just have died in the last movie his death is just dumb and nonsensical he literally achieved nothing everyone who died died for nothing the guy in osaka sacrificed himself for nothing it is also implied that even the blind guy will get killed just a weird way to wrap it up

i swear i like the jhon wick franchise if you could convince me that this movie is actually good id be happy",2023-03-27

"this was one of the most jawdropping action films ive ever witnessed
  

  
havent felt that way since mad max fury road i now dont look forward to any action film simply because they raised the bar so high in this i doubt anything in the next 34 years at least will be able to top or at least match it
  

  
brilliant choreography and camera work
  

  
donnie yen was amazing and stole every scene he was in
  

  
and credit to keanu for the insane effort he put in his action scenes in this one i cringe at the fact the most they gave him in resurrections was a force push considering what he put on display in this film
  

  
1010  easily i need to see it again asap",2023-03-24
im sorry but when he got knocked down the stairs at the end i was  i was like here we go again jfc i enjoyed the movie but it was an hour too long,2023-03-24
"action wise this movie delivered in spades and had some jaw dropping stuff in the final hour

plot wise i was disappointed various threads from the first three movies didnt get wrapped up in any way lawrence fishburne did nothing and winston just ended right back where he started in 1 who learned anything 

i was in this to see the whole high table wiped out and a new order established instead we introduced a bunch of new characters for a story that was good enough on its own but not satisfying as a conclusion which is what it surprisingly ended up being 

the guy and his dog felt like they only existed to be a backdoor pilot or something which is weird because id have expected ana de armas to be in that slot instead 

im disappointed common halle berry and others didnt return if this was the grand finale and that they didnt really utilize fishburne or winston much i dont like winston getting a happy ending for himself either not sure why 

i was so on board with everything because i thought they were setting up 5 as the conclusion and then when i realized this was the conclusion i was bothered by how it all turned out 

so as the conclusion to a storyline i had gotten pretty invested in it disappointed but as a 3 hour thrill ride and a standalone movie it was fantastic could have been tighter without the stuff that only existed to tease potential spin offs but it was still entertaining throughout the first half of the movie really had john feeling like a side character the second half of the movie more than made up for it",2023-03-24

"objectively how absurd was it when wick was kicked down the stairs and afterwards is still able to walk

seriously in real life your going to the emergency room and you arent getting back up and moving around 

then there is the scene where he jumps out of a window lands on a vehicle then hits the ground but then gets back up how",2023-03-25
idk why did they make marquis french even if skarsgard is swedish why couldnt  swedish or if he had to be french why didnt they cast a french person it was painful to watch him try sounding french cause he is clearly not,2023-03-26
i didnt like the ending also thought it wasnt as good as any of the other jw movies,2023-03-26
i was the biggest john wick apologist since 2014  i wasn’t all that impressed with this one  nothing felt impactful with a character that has nothing to lose  at least the second was about them disturbing his mourning period but after that i expected something more satisfying  had fun for the most part on this ride but now i’m out,2023-03-27
"man i wanted so badly to like this movie but came out of it disappointed i really loved the first one still one of the best action movies of all time in my opinion however each movie has had diminishing returns  more action more spectacle but less and less story the action felt so selfindulgent that it took me out of it my favorite stuff was at the osaka continental but then we got to the part where john was just killing dudes with his nunchuks and gun over and over and over same thing at the club against killa and his men and then on the stairs

i always feel like the action should not only look cool but inform the story and move the plot along there was so much action that could have been cut out of this movie and nothing would have changed action for actions sake if you will the fact that he just takes so much damage and gets up like it was nothing also took me out of it i liked in the first one after he fights viggo hes battered and actually limping he actually got hurt in the other two jw movies as well but in this one hes basically like superhero just falling 4 stories and getting up like its nothing it didnt feel like there were stakes involved whenever there was any action i honestly rested my eyes at times during the action because there was so much of it and i felt like i didnt miss much

i love keanu but man the dialogue and delivery felt so off every time he talked i was like i guess this is just a stylistic choice to talk like this i dont think it felt that off in the past movies

this has been mentioned in some other comments but john had no real arc i feel like the movie built up that he would be free and then he just dies at the end it didnt pay off at all in my opinion what were these 4 movies for how many people died by his hand or friends that were killed because of his actions and for what so he could finally die at the end

akira and koji were awesome i wanted to just live in that set piece and world and get to know them more

hope the movie does well i freaking love keanu just didnt live up to what i was hoping for the potential end of the franchise at least for johns role since they have other spinoffs coming",2023-03-27
"saw it yesterday and i liked it

what i loved the cinematography was incredible absolutely amazing the action was entertaining and well done mostly the conclusion of johns story was believable

what i didnt like jesus  christ how did john go from more or less a regular human being who was a skilled killer to an unstoppable force of nature how the  is this movie really trying to pass off a blind man kicking  as a believable thing john wick getting his  handed to him by a morbidly obese man with a bullet in his  who was doing high roundhouse kicks no just no and more of that   danger doggo  jesus and the dont hurt the doggos  or youll regret it cringe and this was def keanus worst performance in the series mostly one word sentences yeah or cain

and why was the elder recast did they not want to bring back saïd taghmaoui was that just a different elder who was talking about someone else when he said like the elder before me and john has family in germany when this  from the comics that no one has read and while the action was entertaining it did drag on in places and was just too over the top in others john rolling rolling rolling down those stairs after slaughtering dozens of guys and dropping from like 30 feet from a window onto the roof of a car and hes more or less okay even the  dog got thrown into the windshield of a moving car and was more angry than hurt  outta here and if you told me the final john wick movie would spend a considerable amount of time of its third act to referencing the warriors i wouldnt have believed you i dont hate this movie but its my least favorite of the quadrilogy for sure with the weakest writing probably because derek kolstad wasnt involved with the script and that  post credits scene has me worried theyre gonna make a bunch of spinoffs of john wick

in case you cant tell the first john wick is my favorite",2023-03-29
i felt like i was watching someone play mortal kombat for three hours with an arthritic 57yearold keanu reeves as the only playable character the background characters behave literally like they are cgi objects each ludicrous sequence of him killing the same 50 guys is broken up by some absurd cut scene with the next goofy  tracy villain,2023-03-30
can someone please explain to me why they didn’t just duel as soon as they decided to duel lol these movies will give any excuse for an action sequence and it’s kind of hilarious,2023-04-01
"lacked the charisma and punch of 2 but overall a more complete film than any of the first 3

objectively this is the best john wick film it is also a fitting end to what i would consider an iconic character

cinematography was special this goaround did notice the use and saturation of blood wasnt as prevalent as it was in 2 and 3

but i also think that this was less about being visceral and more about utilizing those fight scenes to exercise and transport the relationships john had in the world

the fights supplemented the story rather than the story having to navigate the fights

also seeing the runtime scared me but the pacing was incredibly welldone i never felt fatigued watching it

this is an a yam

like i said  a complete movie all around",2023-03-24
so ‘if there’s a fight in a club it’s the best fight of the movie’ is totally a set rule for the franchise now right,2023-03-24
yeah,2023-03-24
i feel like the creators must be hotline miami fans with that extended overhead shot,2023-03-24
"holy  it’s like keanu reeves has the cheat code for blow your  brains out and i predict this movie will be the best action movie of the year unless someone makes a movie about a pair of sentient  that fights a werewolf
perfect 57",2023-03-24
this movie definitely delivered i saw it in dolby cinema and in the first few minutes of the movie the rumbling was amazing i felt the movie whichever team did the mastering in the dolby cinema deserves a pay raise,2023-03-24
fun tidbit i found the 9mm pit viper pistol in the third act is sold by taran tactical taran tactical is who has done all the firearms training for keanu and other cast members thought that was a cool little homage to them in the film,2023-03-24
maybe i didn’t get a memo but haven’t they already announced a john wick 5 kinda makes the ending feel a bit less impactful,2023-03-24
movie was dope just got home from seeing it keanu is a beast how many times do you think he shot falling down those steps lol scott adkins is a gem,2023-03-24
gonna be hard to top this films action in a sequel,2023-03-24
felt like it was to much im sure he has some kind of mutant healing factor,2023-03-24
charons headstone reading friend hits different after lances passing,2023-03-24
the dog  on that henchmans head had the entire theater laughing their  off and that overhead long take was absolutely brilliant,2023-03-24
the fire shotgun  overhead scene was  sick absolutely  hype,2023-03-24
"the first half of the movie my theater which was full was silent except for a few moments but the second half had everyone going absolutely wild  the staircase scene especially went from oohs to laughs to oh  to more laughs to  yeahs   speaking of which that scene was my favorite in the film  

i dont care if its not as real as the first one  they made it clear they were leaning into it when they made him fall four stories like five  times it was absurd in the best possible way 

standout part of the film was that there were no final boss type characters like in previous films  the guys that john usually has to fight but has a hard time fighting end up helping him out at multiple points which was such a good decision and made for really really cool dynamics  

the villain of this movie was so well played  he carried a grandiosity with him that you dont see much these days  

some of the shots in here were  amazing  my favorite probably has to be the cherry tree shot with john on one side  close second is the card scene",2023-03-24
joe burrow was being really rude to everyone,2023-03-24
"cant pick a favorite scene but the only thing that kept sticking out to me was the french for it to be very basic sentenceswords that was a bit distracting for me but everything else was absolutely fantastic so glad to get the dogfu fix 


also it was so good to see a lot of my action favorites like scott adkins donnie yen hiroyuki sanada in one movie too cant wait to take off work and have a john wick marathon ",2023-03-24
it first got announced that they were going to do wick 4 and 5 back to back after seeing this i’m pretty sure they just combined the two movies and it was so  good  also saw it in imax and the punches at the beginning were so freaking loud lol,2023-03-24
i wonder how many references were packed into this movie obviously there’s the whole the warriors bit and i’m sure “get up those stairs” is from something then people are saying the top down hotline miami looking sequence,2023-03-24
anybody else feels like hes not dead just an end to that life he just lives a new chapter finally without being the john wick,2023-03-24
i wasam dying to know why the harbinger had the same ring finger chopped off as john also now that i think of it i thought for sure john was going to get his ring back since it got brought up in the beginning,2023-03-24
"i knew leading up to this movie that they had originally planned to shoot chapter 4 and chapter 5 back to back but changed plans to only shooting chapter 4 when covid happened

so i went into this movie so sure that this could not possibly be the last one that there was going to be at the very least one more john wick instalment

that’s why it was such a shock when john dies at the end did not expect that at all especially as he won the duel against the marquis and he seemed like he suffered worse wounds before and survived

i know that some people are saying that it could be a fake out that unless we see a corpse we can’t be certain that he is truly dead but i really think this might be the end

john wick’s story really feels like it is concluded and as sad as it might be that we might not be getting more movies bringing him back for another movie would feel like they are cheapening his death i think they ended john’s story in a really nice place

keanu reeves is almost 60 years old too so he might not have it in him to do such an action heavy role again there might be spinoffs featuring other characters as the postcredit scene implies but i don’t think john wick will have another movie

seeing that this movie is almost 3 hours long i think it’s possible that when the plans to shoot chapter 4 and 5 back to back fell through they instead opted to combine the plot of the two movies into one extra long instalment

all in all i loved this movie i thought this was the best instalment yet and i hope there is more but i really think this might be the end of john wick and i’m very sad about that i really thought there would be at least one more ",2023-03-24
not sure if anyone else noticed but when john was reloading at the stairs it was way faster than normal due to those flared ends of the gun really cool detail,2023-03-24
"falling down those stairs was both exhilarating and hilarious to watch ngl 

910 for me i personally think its my favorite of the jw franchise also the cinematography and soundtrack were ",2023-03-24
"so many scenes in this movie felt like a video game love i
actual video game movies take note",2023-03-24
can anyone explain why john was just friends with winston again after being betrayed at the end of three he clearly starts this movie on the warpath cleaning up the loose ends,2023-03-24
can someone please rewatch all four movies and count how many people john killed throughout the series,2023-03-24
such an amazing action movie i can’t wait to watch it in imax again,2023-03-24
"i need the guy who makes the suits because 

what an amazing film the overhead take hotline miami never looked so good",2023-03-24
oh  the aftercredits scene,2023-03-24
"the movie was real good it felt it’s length though i feel like they could’ve condensed some scenes to cut down some time the night before sunrise specifically the roundabout really took me out of the movie and felt a little over the top the overhead dragon breath scene was my favorite of all john wick movies 

bill skarsgård reminds me of joe burrow every time i see him lol",2023-03-24
"some of the best cinematography i’ve seen in an action movie aside from the other john wicks you can tell the directors and actors love for the project and i felt so much more emotion in this one 
slight spoiler the beginning with the ny concierge being put down hit me hard especially since the actor passed away i’m looking forward to seeing what they do with the series going forward",2023-03-24
someone brought their pre k kid to our movie,2023-03-24
"yooooo that ending was straight up spike heading into the building to take down vicious 

the explodingincendiary from the birds eye was one of the most awesome scenes in action 

straight up fps style but this movie didn’t feel like a video game

what a way to end it best john wick movie",2023-03-24
a hotline miami reference inside of a warriors reference oh yeah this ones the best of the series imo,2023-03-24
john collapsing on the stairs in front of the church immediately reminded me of spikes final scene in cowboy bebop both exsyndicates with dead lovers and nothing to lose,2023-03-24
the homages to the warriors and hotline miami made the third act my favorite part of the movie,2023-03-24
how is no one talking about that warriors homage,2023-03-24
am i the only one who was constantly scared for the dog for the entire movie like i dont care what happens to anyone else just make sure the dog is safe lol the scene when john saved it was very powerful awesome movie and a worthy finale to this franchise,2023-03-24
"cinematography was top notch
music was ace especially loved the justice song while going up the stairs

the action can’t say anything bad about it absolutely unmatched 

the story the marquess was kinda intimidating at first but in the end he was just a spoiled brat hoped for a 1 v 1 fight with mr wick",2023-03-24
movie was awesome donnie yen was absolutely the star of the film i hope they make a spinoff movie of the caine character,2023-03-24
"jesus john wick 4 is peak john wick each action scene could be the climax in a normal action movie the hotline miamilike sequence the arc de triomphe roundabount the club in berlin all exceptional a lot of selfawareness regarding johns quasiimmortality got a good laugh at the staircase falls incredible choice of music too loved hearing gesaffelstein and justice in a theater cinematography was also off the chart especially the club in berlin and the duel at the end a beautiful movie all around this could be the end of the franchise if they wanted to but as long as i dont see johns corpse i will not believe that he is dead props to keany reeves for doing so many action scenes at almost 60
  
also what was that post credit scene a big  you to caine or a teaser for a spinoff",2023-03-24
shout out to the foley artists,2023-03-24
i loved the two huge sumo bros in the osaka continental wish we got a bit more of them kicking ,2023-03-24
"obviously a great film like so many have said the overhead long take shootout was unreal and the set pieces throughout really were better than most other recent action films best set pieces 

all the main side characters were great as well which has been a bit uneven in this series in the past but donnie yen and lance rip   were stellar and actually felt like they belonged in the universe jw1 set up

but this one definitely felt its length to me 170 mins even with everything they wanted to cram in is just too long for a film where you want great sounding set piece shootouts and nothing else given the protagonist doesnt really talk or have a personality beyond vengeful dog owner and avatar of gundeath which brings me to its only other downfall

keanu who i know is sacrosanct on reddit and esp here and who i know could never really act act anyway but this was the worstmost draculakeanu for a long while he speaks like he doesnt know what words mean and hes sounding out letters phonetically and theyve really dialled up his pauses across these films  in jw1 he was stoic and brooding now he comes off as a bit slow

overall i cant imagine theyre going to  him off for real esp seeing as this is their best financial performer to date and ballerina might need him as a draw and im really hopeful for jw5 but they need to reign it in a little  keep it under 130 mins and maybe dont lean into jws personal mythology so much he was a real if shallow character in jw1 its cool that in universe characters esp villains mythologise him but we dont need to only see him as a caricature of himself",2023-03-24
"this movie was such a thrill from start to finish obviously the action pieces and sets were all amazing but i have three smaller comments

im so interested what kind of ip it would take to overtake john wick…

i watched this in a dolby cinema theatre and the opening sequence rocked my seat with his every punch

i could not get over how similar the marquis looked like joe burrow the quarterback for the cincinnati bengals it was a fun diversion though hehehe",2023-03-24
"i watched a 1045pm show  its 3am the movie has been done for at least an hour and i am so wired

why is no one here talking about winston the отец

or am i missing something obvious  i remember long ago around here was the first time i heard that winston might have been helens father  but no one i saw ever theorized winston was johns dad  maybe everyone else knew and im the slow  which wouldnt be the first time

 at the grave when winston touches johns tombstone you see a ruska roma cross on his wrist  and he most obviously says do svidaniya my son

 at the end john asks winston to take me home  i know this one is a little weak but after seeing the gravesite scene take me home hit different

 osaka continental is run by father and daughter so its fair that families could work together

 caines whole journey is because he has a child  its all fathers and their kid

also   in berlin made me laugh so much  his ridiculous haircut his sweatyness and the gold teeth when he smiled looked like his moustache  i enjoyed   getting killed",2023-03-24
i thought that was an amazing movie that had some incredible action sequences was pleasantly surprised to feel some punisher john wick and daredevil caine vibes too with a bit of kingpin berlin nightclub dude thrown in there,2023-03-24
"i think the idea is that what happens in chapter 4 becomes the new “legend” when citing the exploits of baba yaga making the “impossible task” pale in comparison

despite being considered dead the rumours he is still alive give him an even more ethereal and mythical quality the man who tore up the high table and obliterated 3 cities worth of assassins…some say he’s still out there",2023-03-24
how good is the movie my  gosh you know when those movies stick into your head for hours after it actions scenes were obviously abit dragged but sooooo good,2023-03-24
i am klaus ,2023-03-24
this was such an amazing ride no action franchise delivered like this one,2023-03-24
that was one heck of an action packed 3 hours so many highlight scenes,2023-03-24
my ears are still in pain a day later i dont know if it was just my imax showing but the sound was way too loud,2023-03-24
"i gotta be honest

that dog was making me nervous af the whole movie

i was like theres no way jw kills a dog is there",2023-03-24
"takeaways
akira is basically paloma from no time to die and paris scenes are more intense than in missionimpossible fallout",2023-03-24
did not expect cantonese and my  the whole theatre laughed out loud when john repeated it,2023-03-24
some of the best quotes throughout would be cool to have a poster of all of them with the characters images behind them no follow up on the vengeful daughter and who is mr nobody no explanation at all deff had western vibes with the revolver lever action and the bandanna lots of questions,2023-03-24
i did not expect to see sven a pleasant surprise indeed,2023-03-24
"i hope that honest trailers does a count for  


how many times john wick gets hit by a car  


how many times he throws people onto oncoming cars  


how many times he falls off a high height that would normally  or injure most people",2023-03-24
the soundtrack hit during the action ive never looked up an official release so fast,2023-03-24
the top down shooting scene is literally that john wick game man how he takes cover and reloads his guns and shi,2023-03-24
"absolutely loved this movie and the action was phenomenal after each action set piece i wasnt sure how theyd change it up or outdo it on the next one but they found a way throughout

i also loved the music especially in the berlin fight",2023-03-24
john wick’s biggest enemy stairs,2023-03-24
this was my first john wick and i gotta say im so glad i watched it in a theater loved laughing and oohing and aahing with a bunch of other folks,2023-03-24
anyone else crazy impressed by how agile the big card dealer was,2023-03-24
im trying to avoid spoilers so i have just one question imax or dolby cinema,2023-03-24
i loved the hiroyuki sanada action sequences i knew he was supposed to have been in chapter 3,2023-03-24
which brand of suits did marquis wear,2023-03-24
when the song from the red circle scene in the first movie kicked in for the overhead scene in this one i almost squeeled this was incredible,2023-03-24
"just got home from the cinema and initia thought are that i have mixed feelings on this one same as number 3

the action was great but only really shone in the paris sequence near the end

it follows the same problem i have had with every movie after the first too much plot and exposition

the first one had a pretty basic story and some cool worldbuilding but theyve just continued to expand on that until now it just feels bloated and a little silly i’m really glad they didn’t show the high table which was what i was expecting

a good portion of the movie felt like padding the berlin section especially could have been removed quite easily and not hurt the movie in my eyes

with all of that said the last hour of this movie was up there with the best action and moments of the franchise i especially loved the top down house fight and homage to the warriors and a fitting end to john’s story

i just really pray they don’t find a way to continue john’s story show us another part of this world they’ve made sure but if they bring john back i’ll be washing my hands of the franchise",2023-03-24
the continuous crane shot during the fight in paris was electric made me wanna stand up in the theater and cheer,2023-03-24
"i love all of these movies

will be a day one purchase for me as soon as it comes out

plus the film is just beautiful very well shot

i want a phone wallpaper of donnie yen right now",2023-03-24
an interesting tidbit of the making off for the cars scene in paris they didnt close any street that are genuine french drivers on a casual monday night,2023-03-25
outstanding movie loved every action scene especially the one with the overhead shot had to stifle a laugh when the  bad guy at the club toppled over the railings and fell directly on his head,2023-03-25
absolutely loved this movie probably my favorite of the 4 my only complaint did anyone else notice the lack of reloads during the arc de triomphe scene i may have just missed the reloads but it seemed like the infinite ammo glitch was on i know it was a big magazine and i wasn’t counting the rounds but it seemed like he should have reloaded way more than he did,2023-03-25
i thought it was going to be a yugioh duel when they had those cards on the table,2023-03-25
the movie is incredible and absolutely lives up to the hype how is keanu reeves almost 60 years old and able to do this,2023-03-25
"a lot has already been said but special shout out to scott adkins for doing martial arts in a   suit as killa i love that he finally got a bigger part in a mainstream movie he killed it

i was so excited to see this amazing cast do their thing  wasnt disappointed",2023-03-25
felt like a cowboy bebop prequel especially the stair scene also at one point it looks like he throws spike down the stairs,2023-03-25
the entire stairs bit had me wheezing like  my ,2023-03-25
i love how they referenced the warriors with the dj telling the gangs where to find wick that was such a cool idea,2023-03-25
so great to see a movie like this in a packed theater amazing action as always and they went more insane,2023-03-25
i’m glad this wasn’t advertised as the final film even though i hope it is it made the ending more impactful,2023-03-25
donnie yen was the standout in this one,2023-03-25
this movie was absolutely spectacular a critic said its the best action movie since mad max fury road…i cannot disagree 55 from me,2023-03-25
"i noticed a lot of matrix callbacks in this film

…checkered flooring in the mansion

joint a resistance line my morphius

subway scene",2023-03-25
shoutout them using french techno and electronic music in the paris fight scenes was a nice touch,2023-03-25
"fitting end for a great action quadrilogy its nice that they had an ending planned because doing a 5 6 7 8 9 etc would eventually get stale and even if hes not dead hes listed as such for now and keanu and company are done with wick for a while to give the series a rest ballerina notwithstanding

rip my dude lance reddick genuine shock in the theater when he was killed his line had me tearing up donnie yen ofc killed that role and was my favorite side character besides marquis de gramont he and skarsgard stole every scene they were in cain actually kind of reminded me of marcus willem dafoe from the first movie as an ally but also  get you if hes in a tight spot mr nobody also reminded me of him good to see scott adkins kick  in a  suit probably my favorite of the sequels but its honestly hard to choose because for the course of 9 years theyve just gotten better and better

definitely watching again",2023-03-25
legit my favourite movie this year and an incredible way to end the john wick saga 95 out 10 sooo good i loved every minute of it adding donnie yen was perfect loved seeing him do his thing also if i had to pick one scene that was my favourite it would be the apartment scene in paris the used of the top down shot plus the incendiary shotgun rounds were amazing hard to really put it into words so happy i saw it on opening day,2023-03-25
"okay this dude john gotta be a mutant or something taking hits like a champ 

also that top down sequence is the best film scene of the year christ that’ll be hard to top",2023-03-25
so uhhh the total runtime of action scenes well exceeded an hour right that was absolutely insane,2023-03-25
the overhead apartment scene was amazing reminded of that scene from mr robot,2023-03-25
i never thought i needed a live action hotline miami scene in a john wick movie movie was a 810 up until that point and is now a 1010 after that scene,2023-03-25
so many great scenes but my favorite was near the start when everyone including john wick goes to japan the action scenes in that part of the movie were truly 1010 especially with the use of swords it was like watching a real life anime,2023-03-25
loved the hotline miamilike segment,2023-03-25
holly  didnt realize big jack horner would be back so soon i think hes dead good for good this time though,2023-03-25
legend has it he’s still rolling in his grave,2023-03-25
"i think in terms of john wick movies its over if they have another movie with caine and the duaghter of the osaka hotel owner going at it they will have to call it something besides john wick but then most people wont have a clue what its about

my guess is those characters will continue on in a tv series",2023-03-25
i genuinely want to know if donnie yen actually is not blind irl after watching him immaculately execute both the caine role and chirrut imwe in rogue one,2023-03-25
anyone that had doubts about the ghosts of tsusmina movie were in good  hands,2023-03-25
this movie was amazing i need to rewatch it again just for that overhead pan shot of the apartment gun fight,2023-03-25
does anyone know the music that was playing in the background during the killa fight,2023-03-25
someone start a petition to rename this john wick dont fck with dogs pls,2023-03-25
that  man killa gave wick a serious beat down,2023-03-25
i cant wait for stahelski to do ghost of tsusihima some of the osaka parts seemed like he was tinkering in preparation for got but again idk the timeline for when this movie was made vs when he agreed to do got etc still will be amazing,2023-03-25
i like how the osaka action sequence wouldve been the final action sequence in any of the john wick movies and here it was the very first one it just escalates from there,2023-03-25
amazing movie but got a couple of questions why didn’t caine  john when he had the chance at the german nightclub table or when he was at the bottom of the stairs,2023-03-25
i loved caine donnie yen aka ip man was the perfect partner for john and an absolute badass when caine got to throw some wing chun punches i was so so happy,2023-03-25
when he was walking down the stairs i was thinking are they gonna blade runner us,2023-03-25
i credible movie anyone else confused why the ruskaroma are based in berlin,2023-03-25
as a fan of john wick films where i accidentally watched part 2 before the initial film  part 2 still the best of the franchise most of the fights in this film are similar to that one the threat of part 2 endingif you remember the scene is not felt here since part 3 took much of it already i liked caine much more in this film than even john wick,2023-03-25
"saw this last night with my bf since he’s a big fan i haven’t seen many action films but this one was great it felt a bit long but it was paced well 

also there’s an after credit scene apparently we didn’t think there would be one so had to search it up online lol",2023-03-25
the tracker guy was interesting my theory was that he was tied to laurence fishburne bowery king because they both always wore that black fisherman beany,2023-03-25
did anyone feel that the dialogues were too muffled or not understandable throughout the run time i had a hard time comprehending,2023-03-25
"loved the scene but couldn’t quite follow along what exactly occurred at the negotiation table to dictate the terms of the duel
wick and marquis each propose a demand and whomever flipped the card with the higher number won and what were the topics discussed there was time location weapon but then a few others that i couldn’t hear clearly",2023-03-25
i really liked the bond between caine and john after the duel was over all i could think was  this is almost biblical cain killed his brother abel and caine delivered the potentially fatal blow to john who he thought of as a friend and brother crazy parallels,2023-03-25
nobody pulling his hand away while that knife was still stuck was the most painful scene ive seen in a movie,2023-03-25
who was nobody i thought he might have been a relation to halle berrys character in 3 because he also had a belgian malinois but i dont remember the movie saying anything about him besides him being a tracker of some kind,2023-03-25
i have to say those people that worked for marquis are scary big you can see the height difference in the osaka lobby,2023-03-25
if killa had used a spacer with his albuterol inhaler as one should maybe he wouldve had enough lung reserve to beat john,2023-03-25
where is daisys tombstone  that would have brought it full circle i think otherwise great classic wick,2023-03-25
donnie yen is so badass they keep having to blind him in movies to make the fights seem fair this was the most fun i’ve had at the theater in quite some time,2023-03-25
that was fantastic much better than 3,2023-03-25
they walked 30 paces out and then 30 paces back in and it was not the same distance at all,2023-03-25
huge respect for the stuntman doing what they do best and making this happen especially the poor sob that had to roll down all those stairs oo,2023-03-25
did chad stahelski cameo as one of the guests in line at the osaka continental i feel like i recognized him in the crowd but im not sure,2023-03-25
can anyone explain why koji didnt walk away and how that was fighting for his daughter,2023-03-25

"i swear the european pokerplaying mafioso dude looked like steve coogan in a  suit i just couldn’t unsee it which made everything extremely funny to me

i kept waiting for him to yell “back of the net” after throwing a punch at wick

or i expected him to mention caine’s name and then do a michael caine impression",2023-03-25
did anyone else notice the  ton of movie referencesinspirations in this movie the opening 10 minutes seemed like a homage for lawrence of arabia where later on in the film there was a beat for beat reference to the warriors loved this movie,2023-03-25
"congrats to jw4 for winning the most unexpected reference to lawrence of arabia award

"i think it’s up there with die hard the rock and the raid 12 as a perfect action movie  
  
keanu delivered as always but i was really blown away by donnie yen in this movie you really think he is blind but also a lethal and a resourceful killer especially those doorbell traps  
  
osaka the fight with killa and his goons the warriors homage the apartment buildingoverhead shot the stairs the duel etc chef’s kiss  
  
i really can’t wait to see what chad stahleski does next as a filmmaker i appreciate in this film and the movies and his friend david leitch’s movies that the fightgunfight choreography fits the characters i really think donnie yen is blind and scott adkins who is a physical specimen is doing wonders and wheel kicks in a fatsuit and i am bought in because killa is wheezing and out of breath as he does it  
  
perfect way to end the john wick story",2023-03-26

also a minor gripe for a series that started so grounded those dragons breath rounds would have melted the barrel of that shotgun after around a dozen rounds and at the very least the barrel should have started glowing red dragons breath rounds destroy the shotgun theyre fired from which is why theyre generally used from disposable coach guns",2023-03-26

donnie yen loves to play blind bad  first rogue one now john wick it’s awesome,2023-03-26
that hotline miami scene man  this movie is soooo dope,2023-03-26
"the one thing above all else that i want after this movie is just a movie about caine or at the minimum now a montage of all his fights this is the second movie ive seen donnie yen play a blind fighter and both times hes the absolute standout in terms of action scenes 

overall a really good conclusion to the whole franchise i think it dragged a bit here and there but the plot and the whole theme around breaking the cycle and consequences really helped it 

minor nitpick though especially in the japan sequence some of the kicks that keanu does look really weak to incapacitate someone there was one where he does like a stomp kick to someone on the ground and for some reason it felt really weak and didnt sound like it warranted the crunching sound it made maybe its just me aside from japan though the rest of the action scenes were excellent especially the apartment scene felt like i was playing an oldschool shooter",2023-03-26
im hyped for sisu that  looks amazing,2023-03-26
everything about this movie is fantastic  i dont know if cinematography is the right word but the colors lighting and different angled shots when the card game is being played was awesome  and caine is a perfect character,2023-03-26
this franchise is just so beautiful i can’t get over it the lighting atmosphere camera work music score i’m obsessed number 4 definitely takes the cake for most action there was almost no breaks in between fighting sequences beautifully choreographed  i don’t think for a second that my man john is dead,2023-03-26

"surprised that this wasnt advertised as the end of john wicks story a nice surprise to be sure but they set it up pretty hard throughout the movie that this was the end

that said the long run time was really felt but understandable great cinematography particularly the hotline miami shootout towards the end i also liked the new characters and i hope they do something with caine and akira as they teased id also love to see mr nobody again he was cool id also like to see sofia again but i guess the producers dont care about her as much so i look forward to not seeing mr nobody again   sad that this was one of lance reddicks last movies i loved him and his roles throughout the years

my audience did laugh when john fell out the window and tumbled down the stairs does he have a steel spine or something",2023-03-26

so like did john actually die i couldnt tell he just collapsed and then we see his gravestone for a second and it ends is he just still alive and wants the table to think hes dead or did he actually die and all of his efforts were for nothing,2023-03-26
went in expecting phenomenal action and a kick  soundtrack and got both of those however i did not expect the film to look as good it did the visuals and the colours were top tier and so was the editing for a nearly 3 hour film i didnt feel the length at all its just really well done from top to bottom,2023-03-26

im just saying it wouldve been extremely useful for winston to remember the whole high table duel thing a couple of movies ago knowing that little detail probably wouldve stopped john from killing a certain high table member on continental grounds,2023-03-26

"that actress playing the radio dj during the paris scenes… she got a soothing voice i would’ve watched a whole sequence of just her giving exposition such a very small role in a movie filled with much bigger scenes but her sequences left an impact because i just loved her voice 

the dragons breath… just  when i found out that those rounds actually exist…that terrifies me lol 

my theater had some guy who actually said “for  sake get on with it” during the stair sequence which i agree it just went on too long we didn’t need to see him fall down every flight…just cut back to winston the marquis and everyone waiting to show their reaction then cut to him at the bottom 

that end credits scene had me and my friend actually shout “no…” when it ended rip caine you kinda had it coming",2023-03-26
genuinely one of the best times i’ve ever had in a movie theater saw it by myself at a 1pm sunday matinee with a half full theater it was so fun experiencing the room gradually warm up and get super into it to the point that we were cheering and full on cracking up in the best way at everything from the stairwell fight until the end of the duel,2023-03-26
i got huge mortal kombat vibes from a few fight scenes mainly because of what was going on around the fight,2023-03-27
"so i watched all 3 in 36 hours to prep for this i came away a bit irked i liked the movie but considering in 3 we had sofia burned by the table winston and charon burned by the table and bowry king burned by the table it really seemed like we were gearing up for a complete dismantling of the syndicate i think the lofty hopes and disappointment are my own cross to bear but what i think is unforgiveable is shoehorning amazing characters like caine and shimazu and to a lesser extent harbinger and tracker into this movie and saying yeah weve always been here were only just now relevant

it made shimazus death feel hollow and a complete waste of hiroyukis talent and screen presence it made caine feel like convenient plot device and tracker just tacked on it makes the whole plot of the movie feel like maybe they didnt know where it was going prior

x200b

i also really wanted the adjudicator to die but she just disappeared after 3 as well 

x200b

i loved the action thats always on point but the suit jackets stop bullets and inertia of small and large arm fire but fully armored table operatives get completely dazed and confused by a shot to the chest is so sharkjumpy to me along with john getting hit by no less than seven cars and walking it all off even a dog i like feel good movies but good lord commit to killing a good guy somewhereand not in some  way like they killed off charon

overall like 65 i enjoyed the  out of it but man i think they missed a lot of great opportunities with what they already had and showed more of what they could have done if they had planned a bit better

i enjoyed how this felt like a videogame and moving forward to the next final boss per stage osaka berlin paris the fights are amazing and imaginative but at the same time some of them felt like a choreography

all the characters and engaging and interesting to explore but that also makes john appear kinda plain i don’t know but he felt like doing the same as always and had just a few lines to say",2023-03-27
"i loved the referencesnods toward classics like lawrence of arabia blowing out the match and cutting to a desert and zatoichi caine  are there any others that i missed

ps please please please make sure you see this movie in an imax  i knew when john was punching the block of wood – with the shockwave reverberating underneath my seat – that this movie was going to be special",2023-03-27
the fighting sequences were great and i loved the ideas used the poker tablenight club arc de triomphe top down apartment fight and last duel but tbh i kinda felt nothing by the time 3hrs rolled by was entertaining to watch to a degree but not anything i can take away i honestly enjoyed something like bullet train more despite that purposely meant to be a comedy opposed to john wick but the mindless violence was more entertaining in that one,2023-03-27
"i  loved this movie i mentioned to my gf that they definitely had to handicap yen and adkins in order to give john a chance lol

my favorite scenes
the apartmentfelt like i was watching a brutal run of metal gear solid lol

the staircase was awesome but hilariously reminded me of kung pow

the highway scene was intense when that guy gets hit by the car and on the way down john just unloads bullets at him was so cool 

john couldnt ever have any nice cars 

mr nobody flip flopped so much his name should have been flip flops lol
this all started because somebody killed johns dog so its only right that john saved one in the end

i really wanted john to retire in peace he did so much just to right almost everything for everyone else and i dont think i can accept that my headcanon is that he faked his death 

im ready for the caine spinoff",2023-03-27
"just got back loved it 

it didnt seem as long as it was except i had to  but i took a good break with the bowery king and winston with the boat under paris

the action is so absurd i laughed because it was so exciting

only knock is it seems they added a couple characters to build spin offs  thats fine but i dont know if ill be as excited

"the john wick world tour was excellent jordan ny osaka berlin and paris introducing rina as akira just builds more of the world building
natalia tena as the new head of john wick’s original belarus house was a good cameo 
john wick’s one night in paris completely destroyed the parisian henchmen economy i wanna see the killcount people crunch the numbers on this film 
the gods eye scene with the shotguns and the stairs scene are both technical masterpieces that they’ll still be talking about them a year from now john taking off his jacket and vest for the duel and hearing all the bullet rounds falling off his shoulders onto the ground the symbolism of the morning sun over paris with the clouds making it seem the whole city was under a high table
clancy brown was right with the death of the marquis he is no longer john wick but patron saint wick

hotline miami,2023-03-27
"whats great about these movies is that just about every criticismmeme about them is objectively correct but its so awesome that no one cares

like mine i think they overdid the bulletproof suit thing they introduce the concept in the first movie but its still treated as a realistic material where you get hurt if you get shot in 4 they were all using these suits like magic capes that they could just hold up in front of their face and be good as if a real bullet wouldnt simply brush the material out of the way

but still its awesome so who cares",2023-03-27
three days later im still thinking about this movie there will of course be a lot of imitators like we dont have those already after the first john wick release but one take away i hope other movies will take note is the framing of its action and the camera work wider angle shots where you can see the choreography and longer takes  theyre nothing new but i hope it continue to popularize that long takes with stable camera work is superior to that  of rapid cuts and extreme close ups,2023-03-27
"i like that after 4 entire movies theres still no real answer as to what this hitman society actually is were shown various elements of it  the continental the high table the marquis etc but as far as im aware we have no idea what its actual function is or what all these hitmen do when theyre not hunting john wick we arent shown any substantial connections to the outside world beyond some shadowy relations with underground organized crime its like the wizarding world in the harry potter series  separate and parallel to everything else

and i think thats great its mysterious it lets our minds wander a lesser movie writer would have tried to ground it in reality",2023-03-27
i just love how they utilized the new cast members everyone got their chance to shine and had their own unique fighting style,2023-03-27
"some thoughts

x200b

 japan was by far my favourite place in the entire john wick franchise i love hiroyuki sanada and he didnt disappoint sad to see that he dies but he didnt fight on even grounds considering he was already wounded he also seems to be the most loyal friend to john wick as he houses him with nothing but downside i dont really understand why he fought caine though considering he would have let both of them walk

 caine being called caine because he has a cane but also kills his brother john is in typical john wick fashion both genius and utterly dumb

 overall i felt like this movie had too many enemies nobody imo served zero purpose in this movie neither did marquis left hand because we already had caine imo they should have left both of them out 

 caine being blind was a bit too much for me particularly because his hearing capabilities were incredibly inconsistent his fighting style was cool though

 the dollhouse shooting scene in paris were amazing 

x200b

summary

810 a great ending to the john wick saga should it really end there could have been 1010 but felt a bit too crammed for me i wish they would have focused more on the main plot and cut out 12 of the action scenes particularly john killing half of paris felt rather redundant

"this is the first john wick movie i do not consider better than the last one donnie yen was great the fight scenes in paris looked amazing and the choreography remains excellent but none of it felt as impactful or interesting as 2 or 3

i know that plot isnt the first reason people come to these movies but the setup for the movie felt both unearned and meandering as circuitous as the stories to 2 and 3 were they at least felt like forward progress was always being made the ending of 3 and the opening of 4 seemed to set up a new type of soft reset of the plotline where now johns revenge would be on the high table itself but then everything with the marquis feels like a villain of the week distraction instead down to killing off a named character to show how powerful the audience is meant to believe he is mr nobody also seemed to serve no real purpose other than adding in a side antagonist with a dog the ending especially felt completely unearned as well resetting the status quo in a way that doesnt feel permanent if another sequel is greenlit

in terms of action scenes there are several memorable scenes but not as varied as the scenes in 3 the scenes with the stairs and the dragons breath were cool and all of them continue to be well shot and choreographed but they all felt like action scenes standard for the series with variations only in a key weapon and the setting none of them had the sheer variety of 3 where john fights and kills a giant man with a book builds a revolver uses a man as a knife holder and weaponizes a horse all in the first 15 minutes the finale in 3 felt like an actual challenge rather than just feeling like an overly long obstacle

i dont want this to be the last john wick movie if only so we can see the realization of the plot that i thought this movie would provide john tearing down the system that led to this domino effect of death and destruction for the sake of preserving power and order would be a perfect arc for his character but while this is a very entertaining chapter judging it against its previous films its a middling chapter to me",2023-03-27

i saw this movie today i watched the first john wick a few years ago and about half of part 2 i didnt finish part 2 because i honestly was exhausted and bored by it  first the positives  the action choreography and staging is incredible the cinematography and music are great and overall the movie has a ton of unique energy the negatives  it was way too long and as great as the action is the sequences just felt like they dragged on unnecessarily long i was into the first part of each sequence but it just felt like they ran on and on without any need to theres only so many times i can see john wick shoot someone in the head when he got knocked down the stairs for the 2nd or 3rd time i almost screamed in exasperation because of how long the sequence had gone on for i understand the action set pieces are the main selling point of the movie and totally understand why so many people love them so maybe these movies just arent for me again i greatly admire the technical aspects of the movie and there were many moments where i was on the edge of my seat but there was a certain point where i had had enough,2023-03-27

"i have a question about the duel  given that caine was such an efficient killer and that he and wick exchange some sayings before the last draw those who cling most to life

x200b

before the last draw i read that exchange as they had a common understanding that they would cooperate on something of what i didnt know at the time  as in more obvious lines  wick you thinking what im thinking  caine yeah

it seemed clear to me at such close range someone would surely die if not both of them since both are such skilled shooters

x200b

did caine intentionally not  wick  did wick know it too  for caine is certainly capable of shooting his opponents dead while not in an ideal stance and while the opponent is in motion

"ill be real i think the ending was absolutely perfect  i think if they want to continue with the franchise it should be in the form of spinoffs weve already seen so many unique and interesting characters with goals and motivations left unsatisfied with so many opportunities to explore the already established worldbuilding if they bring john wick back it would just cheapen the natural conclusion and suffer from the same fatigue that dragon ball has

also not sure if everyone knows they mentioned they’ll be doing a spin off set after john wick chapter 4 in the next few months i have a sneaky feeling there’s going to be consequences for akira cane  the tracker for helping john the high table surely must have kept a close eye on all of this i feel all three of them will be hunted down i also feel the high table won’t be happy about what happened and the deal the marquis accepted in chapter 4 perhaps at the end of this movie if i’m right when they all about to be killed light cut out and you can hear screaming and bullets going off and through the darkness the babayaga reappears ready to take down the high table we’ve yet to see these ",2023-03-29

rip lance after your death the scenes referring to you had much more levity to me

part of me wishes they reigned in some things for a bit more a touch more realism  its really my only criticism  

its funny to think how grounded and really emotional that first john wick was  i had forgotten the puppy had dragged itself over to rest near him  that really hits home for me with my first about to cross the rainbow bridge and my new pup being a bit older than the one in the movie

the 4th is really the best with the emotional ties of the other characters more  the daughter of caine and wanting to just be retired akiras loss of her father the death of charon

i dont think there should be a 5th but definitely a spin off  if i were brainstorming ideas i feel that going back to their roots where someone  and arrogant on their own power  with the wrong person   thats essentially been the formula for just about every single one  just tighten the scope for an introduction and fully broaden it with new stories and motives but with other characters

i enjoyed a lot about this film but it was overlong for me  i was john wicked out by the time we got to the journey to the sacre coeur which had what should have been the highlights stair fight overhead shot,2023-03-30
that was an amazing movie and i loved it and it’s my favorite of the series but is it just me or did somebody else noticed how less violent the movie is compared to its predecessors ,2023-03-31
so john can just challenge a high tabler to a duel why didnt winston say this during the second movie,2023-03-31
it was better than 2 and 3 but it just didn’t hit the spot like the first one did the first was cool and stylish and every one following that was just more and more over the top,2023-03-31
who stayed for the after credits scene it was perfect all loose ends tied up,2023-03-31
4 just felt fine better than 3 but not in league with 1 or 2 the story is muddled and mr nobody felt like a late addition to the already bloated script the killa and the top down apartment sequences were pretty dope but the rest of the action felt boring and sometimes overstayed it’s welcome,2023-03-31

"is it just me or is the radio station in this film an almost exact replica of the radio station from the old film warriors

"that entire like  45 minute race through paris was spectacular and is one of the best things ive ever seen in an action movie in my life at first i though it was  that the bowry king only got john wick like 200m down the road or that they were going to play off sacrecoeur as being close to eiffel tower but no it was clearly just something they needed to to have one of the best action sequences ive ever seen in my life

starts off simple with just a fight but then the fight in the middle of the arc de triomphe roundabout was insane and the overhead one shot in the dilapidated house was spectacular and then everything about the staircase segment was phenomenal how this series keeps manages to just put random characters in random places with random weapons and then just making the coolest thing ever with it is something i greatly admire",2023-04-02
the nightclub scene would have been the best fight scene of most other movies and it was the worst one of this one ,2023-04-02

might be a hot take but i think it’s in my top five movies ever the combination of the insane sceneries with incredible camera shots made it by far the most entertaining watch i’ve had in a while,2023-04-02
i didnt like the radio lady nod to the warriors or the dudes in short pants but everything else was awesome they sure did a good job at scott adkins  suit though,2023-04-02
"as soon as i saw the length of the movie i had a bad feeling and i was right after john wick 3 which i felt was the best installment they just didnt do enough to differentiate between it and even between different sequences within itself too long too up its own  not enough bloodrealistic aftermath of the violence he was shooting heads at close range and barely any blood was sprayed making it feel amost like a pg13 movie none of it felt like it had any impact despite being well choreographed jw3 had a lot of great locales which really made one area feel different from another in this movie there is barely any visual differences from the japanese german and french localessets every location is night time with neon lights and panes of glass for people to get thrown through  it just wasnt inventive enough to justify its own existence and too long to be as fun a ride as the others or even a satisfying conclusion

"going into the film i was hoping the series would conclude with john being a freeman and getting a call from aurelio saying his car is finally fixed up john then proceeds to drive off into the sunset playing on the westerns influence throughout the series although that would have been pretty cheesy

still very pleased with the movies conclusion such an amazing installment i dont entirely buy that john is dead though but i dont know if theres any reason to keep him around for another installment without it ruining the point of the last films",2023-04-03

"ill preface this by saying i absolutely loved this movie and think it is the best john wick has ever been  


now while watching the movie i felt that at times some of the firearm details were seemingly lacking of course catching a slide kick is hard to do in the midst of an action sequence with so many guns going off at once then i felt like the pistols had a lot more ammunition than they should on the 300 steps sequence ive since gone back through footage in single frames trailers etc and sadly it does look like certain scenes have taken shortcuts on the more grounded aspects and details that made the original film so great",2023-04-03
the only snag in this movie for me was the nunchuck scene just felt like it dragged on for far too long nunchuck scenes have got to be done in a very specific way because they always have to display dynamism or it doesnt feel compelling what i rather would have done is if he had used different kinds of japanese weapons like spears or 3 section staff instead,2023-04-03

watch john wick do the reload gag  did you miss it  thats ok he does it a couple more times

watch john wick get betrayed again

watch john wick fight an army and then get gassed out by a 500pound asthmatic judoka then fight an army again

watch john wick get hit by 20 cars and leave a trail of wreckage and bodies but somehow traffic at this roundabout doesnt slow down at all

watch john wick fall down a hundred flights of stairs and make no effort to stop at all",2023-04-05
personally i’d rank the films 1342 some aspects of 4 was just off… great gun scenes and action throughout however the new introduced characters i can’t get behind a blind assassin yeah forsure and ik it’s a movie and all that but i thought that was a terrible choice also the tracker dude… pointless if you took him out nothing would change he brings no core element to the plot,2023-04-05
im baffled that i cant find anyone else complaining about the lack of dawn before sunrise in the final section its fullon night on the sacrecoeur stairs and then boom we see the sun rise but its still superdark in half the sky thats not how sunrise works at all even under cloudy conditions first the sky gets lighter nautical twilight then ambient light gets stronger until just before sunrise so lights arent needed any more civil twilight  would start 530am in paris if the suns rising around 605 not only did it wreck the scene for me but also the gradual increase of light would add to the suspense and characters wouldnt have to be consulting their watches what were the filmmakers thinking has nobody involved ever seen a sunrise,2023-04-05

why no one talking about the soundtrack i loved that electro full of energy and groove,2023-04-07
"ive predominantly enjoyed all the jw movies but 3 and 4 definitely seemed to feel more like selfaware musicals to me just replacing the musical numbers with action scenes that being said aside from winston once referencing that he shot john off the roof of the hotel and john having punched his family ticket you could almost go from jw2 to jw4 without missing anything plotrelevant and the resolution in 4 didnt seem to fit johns initial goals he doesnt need to ride off into the sunset but we went from  them all to seemingly settling for ensuring a friend could free his daughter

just wished the series had biased a little more towards retaining a tighter story than awesome choreography  action which it certainly did well nonetheless among seemingly endless new characters nobody could have been a disgraced cassius for example and in the end john hasnt seemed to have changed anything in regards to the table",2023-04-12
i loved it and i also dont think john is gone i think hes back for 1 more film there was a somewhat throwaway line about if john won the duel he would be seen as a saint and the balance of power of the high table would change with john winning and likely achieving that sainthood it sets us up for his rebirth and return to finally finish reshaping originally totally unintentionally the order of the high table,2023-04-12
"not sure if it was the theater or not but to me the gun shots were just way too loud just overtook so much of the sound and there was a disappointing lack of surround sound maybe because the gun shots drowned them out i feel old saying this but man i wish it would have just been a tad softer

only other complaint is johns dialogue was awful and this movie seemed to invalidate and replicate so much of the third movie that number 3 feels kinda pointless now

other than that it was an amazing watch amazing fight scenes beautifully shot i think if the sound was more to my liking i would have had a much better experience and easily the best jw sequel films",2023-04-12

the guy who played ‘klaus’ is the famous bouncer at berghain club in berlin i knew i recognised him,2023-04-21
i think a good comparison can be made with the die hard series the first one is grounded realistic and can be considered the best in the series while the rest up the action and the overall scale but just lack the heart movie kinda felt like a video game and went too ridiculous  crazy physics blind man being able to gun down dozens of people and so on the action scenes of course were 1010 but there were so many of them that a lot of them just get lost and feel pointless as you know random  531 wont be the one to get john wick,2023-04-23
"just saw it was a little disappointed  i mean the pure quality is miles ahead of marvel  most other live action franchise   it’s a spectacularly crafted film like the three before it

but it’s so full of fluff   the world building detracted from the pacing  i felt a lot more tense watching jw 13",2023-04-25
"john wick 4 was really disappointing i had 2 major complaint

1 it lost its realism my major enjoyment of this franchise was the detail in the fight scenes from actual martial arts to accurate bullet counts but having soft body armor spark and the actors show no pain from being shot in soft body armor is a huge downgrade from the previous installments also john wick became immune to blunt force trauma when 

the introduction of a blind assassin is amazing but he needed to be a one off you can’t have someone use daredevil powers to dodge bullets then the next scene show him struggling to find an envelope between him and the big mafia boss guy having super strength it’s like a bad anime power scaling 

2 the plot seemed forced the foreshadowed plot had john taking out the high table as another impossible task but instead he killed 2 replaceable characters and was still under the high table the entire movie the plot thread of his japanese friend dying was never wrapped up and his “sacrifice” at the end didn’t feel satisfying 

overall the movie just didn’t live up to expectations it suffered from the same fate as the fast and the furious franchise john wick 5 would feature him fighting his way out of  to get to his wife in heaven because that’s the next logical step in power gain",2023-05-02
"my favorite moment is when the marquis’ bodyguard tells donniecaine to “get to work” after seeing him slurping on some noodles in the kitchen fight scene 

he sources a gun from a dead goon and i’m like what’s a blind man going to do with a gun 

and then he shoots the ceiling like 4 times and i’m now i’m thinking “is is he using echolocation”",2023-05-06

"tbh this was a little disappointing really it was ok but it got way to out of hand 
3rd one was better still had some cool moments that overhead scene i  tbe building was cool rewatched the first 3 before this but doubt ill watch this again 

iv never seem many pistol shots in a movie i started getting sick of hearing them go off constantly tbh

i was excited for donnie yen but the blind part was kinda dumb like he shoots and fights ppl easy then its like he remembers hes blind then cant see anything right in front or cant pick up something

the amount of damage ppl taken was really a bit to much it was like they can only do 10  damage to each other i dont really expect realism in action movies but cmon lol 

idk if its because i seen fast x day before but when he kept rolling down the stairs and just jeep going it reminded me of that bomb ball for some reason that just kept on going  him rolling down the stairs  became comical after awhile snd was a shooting star me lol",2023-05-21
everything just went for to long the fight in japan the amount of times hit by cars that ridiculous rolling scene the shooting stuff was to much as so many ppl take no damage and its just constant shooting lol,2023-05-21
john wick vs batman the bets are now ope nevermind,2023-05-25
honestly it was far away from previous one biggest problem is stunts the only scene that actually looks good is a topdown one because there they cant ignore enemies and everyone moves in normal scenes bad guys often just do nothing until their turn to die comes also while in other parts wick overpowered enemies by strategic movement and percise shots here it was 90 bulletproof suit and 10 enemies who cant shoot at the head or hands use  rifles explosives or whatever and the caine were worst part of it because literally all it takes to defeat him  is to stay silent and shoot in the head since he approaches openly with no way to find out if enemies are there also it seems like law enforcement do not exist in that universe since after massive firefights all over the big town not a single police officer shows up but most likely its because everything happens within a video game  and a club scene where npcs completly ignore fighting and shooting and keep dancing until the very end of the scene are a proof of that,2023-05-25
"back here over two months later having finally watched

great action as always but i couldn’t help of thinking while watching him fall down all those steps of kung pow and to a lesser extent hot rod so stupidly hilarious",2023-05-25
"it wasnt a bad movie really but it lackedpretty much everything compared to the other 3

cgi was a bit weirdoffbad here and there

fight choreography wasnt as good and they used more jump cuts and the like

the plot was nonexistent which is far worse than especially the original

the fight scenes dragged on too long and they took up like what 75 of the movie

another macguffin had to be pulled out of their  in order for wick to have another chance at a way out and for that macguffin another macguffin had to be used as well the duel rules and for that the needed family that he had to get back in to

thumping techno music was blasting over most fight scenes which was more distracting than helpful most of the time

the japan scenes were basically pointless as even the daughter of the manager which i thought would lead to some plot or something was left hanging

x200b

and some specific stuff

the gun that shoots flames wasflashy i guess but kinda  considering what kind of action film the series has been so far

the frenchman was stereotypical and highly predictable a typical overconfident loose cannon going after the main character gets more desperate as things progress and in the end tries to cheat his way out as he becomes nervous of the mc kind of antagonist seen it too many times before already

the overhead scene in the building which apparently people praise was out of place and too gamey in my book

the bowery king was relegated to just being a supply npc pretty much same could be said for winston relegated to someone on the sidelines

keanus acting was even more deadpan than in the previous movies which weirdly impressive to me as i didnt think that was possible but not a good thing

the rolling down the stairs scene was alsopretty out of place imo like i was suddenly watching a 90s cartoon

what was even the point of mr nobody all he was was a named mob to use a video game term among the masses of mooks a bit more importance and focus than regular mooks but didnt really add anything to the movie also wick saving his dog and suddenly he doesnt care about the moneyconsequences anymore was pretty predictable

what the  was with that female radio announcer ini think france the first announcement was good but the updates after that just made it comical in a bad way half the messages didnt even sound like realistic coded messages just thinly veiled status updates but said with a sexy female voice 

and of course they leave wicks end scene just ambiguous enough to either leave him dead or bring him back for a jw5 which will undoubtedly be more of a decline compared to 4

x200b

overall this movie was okay not a bad watch but not something id want see in theatre more something id put on while playing a game everything gave me a feeling of complacency like the director knew that at this point he could just go through the motions and itd make bank no matter what and judging by 90 of the reviews ive seen he wasnt wrong",2023-05-25
we are taking a  break at home lol didnt realize this is 3 hr so far didnt they already done a fight in a glass house with light box it was samurai themed too i believe theres some obvious shot of the daughter concierge done by a double because shes too slim and the stunt double had more waist lol,2023-05-26
"dumbest part was getting the blind man to gun fight a perfect shooter at 30 paces a fight that you really need to win

i know the blind guy is a badass and basically daredevil but still 30 paces come on

i was originally thinking there wasnt anything as amazing as the knife fight in john wick 3 but then i got to thinking how much coordination the cars would take for that scene and appreciated it more there was also a one shot  from birds eye perspective that was great

loved the guy in the  suit doing karate kicks

john wick himself is barely in this but it was still good that being said i do not have any interest in spinoffs they are trying to push maybe a manager spinoff",2023-05-26

honestly didnt like him dying at the end for some reason wouldnt rewatch it because of that lol prefer the retirement,2023-05-29
theres just too much action which takes away from developing interesting characters and a good story plus the movie doesnt seem realistic at all  things happen that defy the laws of physics and the blood and injuries dont look genuine while there are a few exciting moments the movie struggles to keep everything together and make us care about whats happening overall john wick fails to deliver a satisfying action experience,2023-05-30
i know im late to the party but did anyone else have a problem with the cannon fodder not trying to take each other out to increase their odds of collecting on johns bounty  i mean theyre not all from the same organizations  why didnt any one organization use one of the others to slow john down and use them as collateral damage to  him  they all just run at him and attack like theyre all best buds trying not to harm everyone else  its maddening,2023-06-05
man the latest comments did not vide with this movie i had a fun time yeah the movie is dumb but i think they’ve been dumb the whole time if you enjoy  violence in novel ways with a crazy mob based king of the hill world that keeps getting revealed i think the movie will be a good watch for you but if not i get it,2023-06-11
"do these mf’rs have like bullet proof suits on or some  did i miss a crucial plot point

i counted like 50 times where someone including wick gets blasted point blank and you can physically see the bullets deflect off their dress suits 

i’m being serious did i miss a plot point  is that",2023-06-17
this viper has ferocious  fangs,2023-06-19
by far the best john wick since the first one and a fitting end to the franchise bravo,2023-06-19
"i know keanu is almost 60 and its almost a decade since the first movie but man it sucks that his movements are noticeably slower he looks nowhere near the efficient assassin that he was in the first movie the fight choreography is great as always its just that keanu doesnt look believable when hes fighting hand to hand lots of awkward scenes where the enemies are just waiting to get punched he really looked like he was no match for chidi or even killa im really happy that he can finally rest now

also is no else  that winston got away scott free he was doomed at the 3rd movie until john helped him in an almost unwinnable fight but then he betrayed him instantly the first chance he got and now he got everything back he shouldve just been a straight up villain charon was the better man and he deserved to live

lastly quite disappointed that the bowery king was barely there the 3rd movie ended with john and him teaming up and swearing against the high table but he only shows up to provide two suits a gun and a boat ride 

im glad that atleast koji was there to show someone with power who was actually on johns side even through the actual battles the osaka scenes were my favorite for being gorgeous and full of carnage for all factions",2023-06-25
the only thing i cant stand about these movies is how ok all the public is with bullets being fired around them and blood splat all around them and have no worry whatsoever about a stray bullet theyll see 4 dead bodies beside them then keep dancing or keep driving by a area where they just watched like 20 people get lit up its so dumb it half ruins the movies for me otherwise awesome combat,2023-07-04
why was the duel only applicable with marquis why did not john wick duel with anyone from the high table at the very first so he could get out,2023-07-23
"worst jw of the franchise firstly those  bullet proof suits are dumb and ruin the action 
second see something people in a young country like the us dont often understand because most street corners look like the next is that you gotta be vaguely believable with where you shoot scenes in paris the sequence is all over the shop porte des lilas is at the edge of paris at 2 oclock they go grab a boat in a tunnel thats at 1 oclock half way into the radius of paris but more importantly from porte des lilas halfway to the  sacré coeur they then somehow cruise to pont diena closest he can be dropped which is farther in the opposite direction than both the previous locations where they were they then make john cross the seine river to the opposite bank to where sacré coeur in the opposite direction on rue de luniversité then the fight is shot near  to then drive to the arc de triomphe 90 degree off he should be going from the fight to sacre coeuradd to that the american muscle cars that have no reason to be there and the 2 cars that ram and tilt jws car on the place de letoile round about and come of absolutely undamaged not even a broken light and the   fake french accent of skarsgard and a million visible details and you have the worst realised jw ",2023-07-31

dear lionsgate

please don’t get greedy and make a fifth one spinoffs sure but let john wick finally rest in peace",2023-03-24
"possibly the best john wick of them all until a sequel appears

fantastic action sequences from the getgo with a fantastic grade a cast rip lance reddick that elevate every scene and every moment

great visuals and cinematography that show you gorgeous places like morocco but they filmed in jordan osaka japan paris france and berlin germany

intense and high paced with barely any room to breathe john wick 4 has  and mayhem with pistols revolvers shotguns knives axes pencils horses cars motorcycles dogs playing cards hand to hand combat bow and arrows samurai swords throwing stars nunchucks and the list goes on

keanu reeves while providing a masterclass in physical acting action sequences and stuntwork does stumble along but has his moments in dialogue

the heavy standout in this movie would be donnie yen as the blind master hitman caine truly impressive fight sequences touching emotional and funny moments as well audiences will have a fun time with caine

rina sawayama did a fantastic job as akira held her own and then some has a good presence and does not show at all that it is her first big time role in film greatly adds to any scenes she is in

the rest of the cast bill skarsgard fishburne sanada shamier anderson ian mcshane clancy brown scott adkins are all just terrific professionals and once again just provide john wick chapter 4 with the legitimacy and gravitas to be as good a movie as it is

very excited to see what comes next

bleh,2023-03-24
"saw it in imax today 

 people 

what a  ride im going to see it tomorrow night in dolby 

donnie yen kills it love his character just enough personality that hes not some soulless assassin but not annoyingly so 

i want an origin story of nobody and his dog 

apartment with the dragons breath was so  fun and the fact that the action set pieces were so well timed 

also theres no way hes actually dead lots of posters have mentioned his dog looking off screen during the burial plot scene hes still alive 

well done very well done",2023-03-24
"theres so many loopholes here its borderline impossible hes dead 

 like you said we didnt see him die we saw him slump over after the hardest 24 hours of his life and only bearing wounds that this series has canonically demonstrated arent lethal

 the last philosophical discourse between him and caine his friend who equally hates the marquis and who might even have been in on wicks gambit lays the foundation for this those who embrace life find death those who find death receive life

 there are only two kinds of graves with grass on them old ones and ones that were never dug

 the post credit scene shows akira has unfinished business shes coming for those she feels are responsible for her fathers death and while caine may have been the instrument its ultimately john wick who killed her father this is even more intriguing when you consider that ballerina is going to take place between 3 and 4 so its not like that will be resolved there ballerina isnt going to so much be a spin off as it is a rebuilding of the worlds mythos

 edit afterthought canonically every time john says someone will die in this series he kills them he said he would  all of the high table this did not happen in this movie this series in not yet done

 extra edit not my observation but as others have mentioned johns dog perks up strangely at the end winston and the kings conversation is also oddly ambiguous and lacking in any finality the next time we see john wick and i believe we will he may be walking out of the cemetery from the tree line after noticing his dog notices him 

john wick is not dead he received life by embracing death and is loving peacefully  until one of two things happens possibility one akira slays caine and maybe even goes after winston for being a part of all this pulling wick out of hiding or she goes after him and in the process outs his current hiding spot to the many many enemies he made in service to the table  they then show up to try and collect the 40 million dollar reward that ostensibly is still in play as it remains in escrow despite the marquiss death and after all the table will have a new member before his body is even cold perhaps they too will prefer not to have a loose end like john wick running around",2023-03-25

i need some help i just saw the movie and i didn’t like it i thought it was way too long the fights were way too long and overthetop john had insane plot armor even in comparison to the other movies and the story felt really shallow it just felt like everything that worked in the other films didn’t in this one but everyone i see says it’s amazing why is there this discrepancy what am i missing here and do other people think this or am i alone,2023-03-27
doesnt it feel like this movie entirely undermines what felt like the drive of the last 3 john was a man fighting against an unjust system but in this one hes just playing by the rules even his death is meaningless by the internal logic the film sets out  the marquee will simply be replaced and the system will continue so what was the whole point more samurai swords,2023-03-27
the gun effects in the first 2 hours of the movie where absolutely terrible i could not belive it worse than the first one thankfully it had those flame rounds otherwise totally hopeless effects what makes it funnier is the directors recent comments about how digital gun effects are all we need in modern cinema lol,2023-03-27

"i really enjoyed the film overall but i have a lot of issues with it from a story and structure perspective

overall it reminded me of no time to die in that it was a very handsomely photographed high concept high budget entry in the franchise which was also far too long and without nearly enough meat on its bones to justify the runtime

i long for the simplicity of the first john wick and its commitment to lean back to basics action filmmaking",2023-03-24
"finally got to see jw and it was spectacular my favorite parts were definitely the fight at the osaka continental and jw using the flamethrower gun tbh i think the osaka one is miles better than new york

"couple quick notes

 bill skarsgard was a perfect villain
 style and choreography was turned up to 11 and i loved every minute
 loved how they really used the bullet proof clothing to proper effect
 the only action sequence i had issue with was the arc de triomphe my suspension of disbelief couldnt handle the idea that it wouldnt be an immediate traffic cluster  
 forgive me shamier for thinking that you were john david washington the entire time
 soundtrack was perfect
 the ending to me at least was pretty clear cut but reading up on it it sounds like it was intended to be more open ended or was that just prerelease fud",2023-03-24
"so the paris scene is like definitively one of the best action scenes in a film right like i’ve seen raid 2 comparisons but raid 2 couldn’t evade the length problem but jw4 has just enough variety and careful pacing to make the concept work 

shoutout to wuxia radio lady only heard her voice but yeah",2023-03-24
"its funny that the least interesting thing about the john wick films is john wick there are no stakes for him and he really doesnt have any character other than gruff man who maims

but the action

holy 

that fight on the highway between roaring traffic the japan sequence donnies ip man punches sounded like a machine gun in cinema sound awesome

scott adkins was hilarious and obviously brilliant during his fight scene props to keanu for committing fully to the action i cant imagine the amount of time and effort it took to learn all that choreography",2023-03-24

"a handful of favourite parts from this movie

1 keanu not being on fire in the old building cut to jumping out the window suddenly on fire then again not on fire when he lands i was crying laughing
2 having the most obscure cameo appearance from the berghain bouncer
3 referenced already but the club goers continuing to dance as people are getting axed in the dome
4 donnie being the most incredible fighter despite being blind but then when he’s not actively fighting bumbles to open an envelope and seemingly trips over his own feet
4b donnie using motion sensors to emit noises when people walk by but then not being able to track where john is when he’s 7 feet away and talking to him lol
5 playing justice while in france was a nice touch
6 i found it hilarious the number of times keanu pulled a dracula and used his blazer as a face shield as he took corners i left the theatre mimicking this move with my jacket",2023-03-25
i know im not the only one who realized this movie was gonna be a different beast as soon as that establishing shot of john with cherry blossoms was shown i was like oh we got motion picture on our hands here boys,2023-03-25

"long fangirling with spoilers ahead because fan girl 

i feel like they wanted to go all out on this film so they crammed a lot of stuff in they reeled me in by casting hiroyuki sanada so im kinda bummed that the japan subplot ended too early i guess its there so they can pick it up if they decide to make a spinoff or a 5th jw but how

that nunchuck scene was very dragging we get it john can be awkward and vulnerable sometimes since hes a formerly retired assassin in his 50s but did it have to be this long and this early in a 25hr long film 

akira continuously stabbing that giant dude on the back as he crawls up the stairs encapsulates my everyday struggles why wont you just die

you know those moments when you witness something so captivating that youre suddenly filled with longing because you remember someone who wouldve loved seeing it donnie yen gave me that jesus if my grandfather who was addicted to hk action cinemaeven those without subtitles was still alive donnies role as caine couldve changed his mind about keanu reeves films he was too old school to appreciate the matrix trilogy back then 

awardgiving bodies need to invent an award for that overhead oneshot fight sequence in that parisian apartment asap i resorted to just dumbly gaping and gesturing at the screen because what the 

that stairway scene invalidated my future excuses for skipping leg days 

the creepyevil skarsgard brother was wonderfully creepyevil toptier nepo baby 

this is peak john wick sure he found himself inside a crowded techno club again but how else are they gonna top this now that he massacred his way out of berghain the pencil callback to the 1st film and the dog that john was finally able to save led me to anticipate and accept the ending if keanu decides to retire and just ride motorcycles for the rest of his life which he clearly deserves id be happy with just thisand thats saying a lot because ive had a crush on him since i was a teen but if he does decide to make another one my wallet is always ready to be thrown

keanu really is a genius for spotting gold i never imagined that a guyavengesdeaddog story was just the foundation of something so insanely satisfying no joke i fasted for the entire afternoon because i have a weak bladder and just waited for the luxury recliner seats with free snacks because i was that ready for john wick nothing and nobody was going to ruin it for me a john wickzilla ",2023-03-28
i liked the 3rd better think they are just getting worse in each movie but the fighting in the last 2 and 1 ofc were way more iconic and memorable felt like this one was creating more cinematography for the sake of it and putting less emphasis on the actual fights but also has way too many throwbacks and cliches from other movies its all over the place from last samurai to for a few dollars more and the ending was straight from blade runner 2049 and felt abrupt of course he earned the duel but i figured he’d be taking down the entire high table not just another guy with a “parlay” moment and things like the stairs scene started to be too silly the fight with the twins in the last movie and in clubs and the mirror room in 2 was amazing not to mention 1 being perfect this movie i’m struggling to remember anything but the explosive cod shotgun fight and halle berry didn’t return but they brought back the dog fights which felt like they just wanted to use another k9 unit cause it was fun for the directors just too many different cliche themes and ideas taken from other movies as well with less dialogue that was as good it tried a little too hard and was a product of its own success for me too much of a parody of itself 7510,2023-03-28
"this was great
 chad stahelski might just be the best action movie director of the decade even the camera work is in constant motion just as a stunt actor would be to be completely honest though none of it would work without an actor as dedicated as keanu

 keanu reeves commitment to the stunt work over four movies is truly commendable this entire series rests on his willingness to go through the ardous training and he fully delivers hes stoic but determined every scene hes in though is an action scene i just wish we spent some time with him wrestling with all the destruction hes causing all the friends hes endangering maybe have a moment where he contemplates if this is truly the only way forward

 caine stole this movie for me i was so worried hed be a daredevil caricature but he brought hes own style and flair to his fighting and mannerisms he was constantly tapping surfaces with his blade to assess hes surroundings hes head was always turned so hes ear faced the guy he was fighting the scene where he plasted motionsensitive doorbells on the kitchen walls was genius

 nobody is a character i did not connect with at all the movie gives him a lot of screen time as if hes going to be some big baddie but besides his  rifle and ability to find john wick which everybody does anyway nothing stands out about him the marquis relied a lot on nobody but nobody never proved himself worthy in fact the marquis second in command seemed a far more worthy match for john wick the actor playing nobody was also incredibly weak he tried too hard to make the character feel dangerous but i dont think the actor did a good job honestly this actor was the weakest part of a stellar movie for me cut him out and the plot still moves forward by contrast

 akira is fantastic she did an excellent job as soon as she came on camera behind that hotel desk you could sense this was not an extra her fight scenes were balletic and brutal the bow and arrow on the rooftop and that icepick  scene as the baddie is crawling up the stairs was great 

 marquis also felt a little flat for me he just seemed like a 12 year old richie rich ordering people around the actor had so much room to let loose but he never did instead he chose to be monotone the only sense of danger he shows is in the horse stable with the knife i have friends who were on set with him recently and apparently hes a massive  in real life so im surprised how reserved he played this

 the cinematography was gorgeous for a movie set entirely at night
this really took full advantage of that the tokyo scenes looked stunning the overhead in the paris apartment i could pause this anywhere and be happy to screenshot a new desktop background

overall 910 highly recommended to anyone who loves a good action movie between this and top gun maverick im so happy to see real stunts i am so over the marveldc 3rdact cgi monster mess this is real its gritty you feel every hit every gun shot my  this is an action movie",2023-03-28
"my only issue with the franchise is the lack of realism  in how wick is able to take punishment to his body that no person in real life could withstand

for example how on earth does he surive being shot multiple times falling of a building and hitting the ground at the end of john wick 3

also how is he able to roll down the stairs near the end of part 4 and then get back up and keep fighting

is this franchise set in a universe where physics dont apply and people dont get hurt",2023-03-30
"this is going to be an unpopular opinion but here goes

they took a lot of the world building and general tone in the first three and lit it on fire in this one

 i really liked the combat in the first john wick movie where at the end johns bruised bloody and limping along home what real fighting is actually like seeking medical aid where appropriate  now  john can get hit by like  20 speeding cars in a row and then  like 100 people after that immediately  
 in the second movie they made a spectacle over how many guns john procured in preparation for his battle on the way out and then strategically placed those weapons along the way now  unlimited ammunition while john did donuts around the bad guys  i didnt count bullets but it was definitely more than the 21 per clip that was stated 
 in the second movie they introduced the suits that stop bullets and they talk about how it will hurt like  but at least you wont be shot  now the suit is full on armor protection without even so much as flinching
 in the third movie they made it a huge  deal that john was excommunicado and had a  of a time going pretty much anywhere  now  hes a jetsetter going from nyc sewers to osaka to berlin to paris in no time flat  no problems here my dudes
 and even in this one the stormtroopers have hard bulletproof armor on but arrows arent bullets and they can totally go through the armor that bullets cant  checkmate atheists

i feel like most moviegoers dont mind suspending disbelief at movies so long as the world is internally cohesive  and this latest chapter broke a lot of internal rules which is a  shame because the world building in the first few was incredible",2023-04-16
man this was too long,2023-05-23
"sub par movie too many loose threads that made no sense 

john wick at its best is 50 story and lore building  50 action 

this movie was just 90 action and 10 nonsense",2023-05-23
"this was the most boring of the series for me i could only stomach like 30 minutes of it

no idea why people like these movies honestly just a string of stunts with no tension or motivation behind them i guess these are meant for the fast and furious audience its so dumb",2023-06-06
"meh 

the action is the point but it just goes on and on and on  no tension because we know john wick isnt going be headshot by some random dude wearing jeans and a windbreaker   they make us sit through like 30 minutes of tedious blam blam blam blam before we get to the telegraphed twist of a conclusion where the marquis dies and everyone who isnt john gets a happy ending",2023-06-06
john wick is definitely not dead they left that pretty obvious,2023-03-26
one critique i’ll offer… i wish there was a bit more of a denouement it felt like it ended quick wasn’t fully clear if he was dead which is dumb because… grave… but everyone in my theater was yelling where’s john at the end nearly 3 hour movie and maybe… three minutes after the action ended it felt a bit rushed and like they were going to pull the back from the dead bit at the end,2023-03-24
it was  amazing the only negative thing i have to say about this movie is that i wish caine wasnt blind,2023-03-24
"of all the impossible violence john sustains the thing that actually takes me out of movie a bit is the relatively low seeming contract value not that 20m isnt a ton of money for someone to have but i think it seems incongruous against the sheer opulence of the high table and the transcendence that they seem to have about money 

loved the movie though really left nothing on the table and was everything i hoped it would be",2023-03-24
"what a fun film donnie yen is so cool his moves are so slick 

so many beautiful shots and like you want to go to paris and osaka and berlin  but truly the highlight is that overhead shot

so impressed with bill skarsgaard  his acting is truly great here and clancy brown

but seriously imagine a movie with caine and akira now id actually watch that he’d understand a daughter’s plight besides didnt he say “ill wait for you” so he knows what is coming for him",2023-03-24
jw4 absolutely shreds 3 or maybe more genre defining set pieces great pacing some really nice supporting cast additions etc just an absolutely great time as of now my favorite in the series slightly surpassing 1 see this in the largest format with the biggest crowd possible it was a joy to see it in a packed imax house,2023-03-24
i don’t know if this is an unpopular opinion i loved the movie overall but did anyone else really dislike the voice bill skarsgard put on for marquis not sure if he was just adjusting from a swedish accent or what but to me it sounded like he was slurring every word and was kinda hard to understand at times,2023-03-24
this was the dumbest movie i have ever seen and i loved it,2023-03-25
"does anyone else think it was a huge missed opportunity to not have laurence fishburne be the one that comes in for the save when john wick gets kicked down the stairs

it is an even bigger missed opportunity that he doesnt do any fighting in any of the john wick movies his only scenes including in this are just dialogue",2023-03-26
"i gotta say i love john wick and i had fun with this for sure but something about this one isnt sitting completely right with me 

something that i hated about 2 is way that the nonstop samey action caused it to all just blend together and get numbing 3 fixed it by adding huge variety between all the fight scenes so they all felt at least slightly different from each other and also have each action scene build up intensity from each other i couldnt tell you a specific detail of any of the action scenes of 2 while in 3 i can remember each action scene separately because they all feel different and distinct and while there still is some decent variety in this one it didnt feel like they put the same thought into the variety at all the only one that felt truly full of variety was the first one at the japanese hotel and then they all started to have less and less distinct differences between them until it came really close to hitting that mindless all blending together thing 2 had going on and instead of each action scene getting progressively more and more intense like 3 it felt like the high point was the first action scene and then the rest was on the same level or worse sure there are some highlights like that overhead scene but it just felt like it had much less thought put into it from 3 the whole staircase sequence was alright i guess but for the final part of the final action scene for what could be the final john wick movie it left a lot to be desired 

and then the story why did it devolve into being this directionless feeling it felt like the direction story was going with 3 didnt match where it went here characters from 3 were dumped in exchange for new characters that didnt need to be there when you really think about it the nobody guy didnt need to be there he had no purpose it felt like watching a movie that had weird retconing going on in a series that definitely didnt need retconing

still had a lot of fun with it but something felt so off about it i wonder if the cancelation of 5 had something to do with the lack of direction this one felt like it had",2023-03-27
the action got a little tiring and my  is reeves a bad actor,2023-06-05

"chad stahelski is a master at his craft and this is easily one of the 5orso best action movies ever made if not number one it felt like watching vince carter in the 2000 dunk contest  the only person on stahelski’s level is stahelski and he’s playing to oneup himself at this point

loved the references to the warriors wuxia topdown video games and game of death

and   bill skarsgard had one of the best tailors in recent memory",2023-03-24
the warriors homage was the icing on the cake in the third act as soon as the dj said all you boppers i was on another plane of existence,2023-03-24
it might just be the best one yet at least in terms of narrative and emotional weight hiroyuki sanada and donnie yen both came out to play on this one the perfect roles for them too my only complaint is that there should have been more of john wick interacting with his dog but besides that it’s basically a 1010,2023-03-24
the paris scene set to paint it black amazeballs,2023-03-24
would’ve been hilarious if they used “rollin rollin rollin rawhide” or limp bizkit’s rolling song when wick was falling down the stairs in paris like a family guy character,2023-03-24
one of the best movies i’ve seen rare 1010 in my books,2023-03-24
i havent watched it im debating because its almost 3 hours the last one i thought was great but was just so much action i got desensitized to it and it felt like the action got a bit boring by the end even though i liked the film with this being almost 3 hours long can anyone tell me if its going to be the same proportion of action but for an extra half hour,2023-03-24
reading some of your comments im starting to hate that i let dog memes make me think john wick was a terrible series,2023-03-24

my left ear is still wincing from that ",2023-03-24
"firstly my entire theater cracked up when john fell down all 222 stairs 

secondly was i the only one who didnt care about the japanese daughter the movie was wrapping up and i was like oh wait shes still somewhere is she ever going to do anything and then by the time she shows up im mad they even included her because its just another loose thread",2023-03-24
legitimately the hardest movie i’ve ever seen,2023-03-24

"good it’s john wick being john wick 
for some reason felt over the top compared to previous films some action scenes were fantastic  some not so much felt redundant and predictable sometimes i feel like the fight scene actors were waiting for their turn to be  kicked  lol 

some parts of the movie didn’t connect  the emotional parts didn’t really land at all talking about landing  wth was the rolling down the stairs in climax so many times people were laughing in my cinema  

hearing the screen play writer of the original films didn’t get involved in this one makes sense as to why this one is my least favourite out of all 

still   fun would definitely recommend watching it",2023-03-24
"great movie fun dumb action not much in terms of plot my favourite plot is probably still 2

marko zaror shouldve had more screen time and a badass extended fight scene kinda wasted a bit 

akira shouldve had more screentime 

donnie yen shouldve had more screentime really liked his characters exaggerated movements and actions 

charons death feels really awkward in the hindsight ouch 

loved it wouldnt say its my favourite in the franchise but it kicked ",2023-03-24
i also want to give a shout out to the marquis’ 3 piece suits oh my goodness so beautiful the metallic one when he was watching the ballet was so crisp thank you to whoever designed the costumes,2023-03-24
has keanu reeves acting always been this bad i remember watching the matrix and thought him being emotionless is part of his character but after seen him acting like that in every movie i see of of him makes me realized the farthest his acting capabilities can go regardless i love the movie,2023-03-24
loved it the only thing that bothered me was the light during the sunrise scene they couldve put more effort in replicating sunrise light source and a toneddown sky,2023-03-24
"no spoilers in this post

the entire movie was just an westernanimevideo gamehk kungfu homage

guns arent even guns anymore firing a shot is like throwing a punch and those  shots are like  rather than serving a tactical purpose like the 1st movie which i started to like after realizing what they were doing

i loved the nunchaku fight sequence i could be wrong but that was a game of death homage john wick fighting up multiple levels of the building and employing different fighting techniques as he advances 

the birds eye view hotline miami oneshot is mentioned a lot and well deserved i leaned over to my wife during that scene and whispered this is cool i love how the dragons breadth shots really added to that hotline miami tone  was just flying all over the place but it was not hard to follow the action at all i was grinning that whole scene

all the new characters were onedimensional but all pretty memorable donnie yen  stole every scene he was in this may be his best performance to date 

i also found it funny that all the hundreds of bodies they throw around in the action scenes are all wearing masks or hats im sure the same stunt team of a couple of dozen people are constantly getting killed over and over again ill love to see a stat sheet per stuntman for how many times they got killed by a named character

there are certainly some annoying things in the movie where i didnt really agree with the choices i thought the nobody character was pretty pointless you can remove him from the movie and youll have the same movie 

john wicks dialogue was more cringey than badass the man speaks like hes been punched in the head too many times i rather he go the completely silent protagonist choice than what they went with

overall i liked the movie although i felt the nearly 3 hour runtime was a bit much for a pure action film with virtually no narrative i wouldve loved to have experienced this movie as a miniseries where each episode was a new stage or action set piece that way you get a breather between each action scene and really let them marinate in your head as a feature film it kind of all blends together and its hard to appreciate the last action scene when this next one is going off",2023-03-24
im glad that this movie is employing so many stunt guys but i think thats it for me  its gone stale  it went from a bunch of goons getting killed in a warehouse to assassins with silencers killing people in new york while discreetly dealing with the bodies to finally a full on terrorist attack in the center of paris  the only place left to go would have john wick 5 take place on the 50 yard line of the superbowl while the game goes on uninterrupted the action and stunt work was of course stellar but it is definitely time to retire this franchise,2023-03-24
"standouts for me were

 the overhead long take 
 scott adkins was killer heh in that fatsuit
 donnie yen will probs get his own spinoff and deserves it
 johns not dead  intentionally left ambiguous just in case they want to make another down the track
 in the other films there were only so many setpieces or standout action scenes in this one almost every action sequence is a treat  the donuts in the car far out
 bill skarsgard was a great villain anyone reckon hes actually a decent fighter he did manage to take nobody by surprise after all
 speaking of nobody whats his deal whered he get the book of john wick is he related to halle berrys sofia from chapter 3",2023-03-24
so do we expect them to still do the 5th lionsgate greenlit it and its one of their only franchises left so i cant see them wanting to let it go but that ending was satisfying and doing a actually hes not dead runs the risk of being forced,2023-03-25
his last walk down the steps has to be a homage to spike in cowboy bebop right,2023-03-25
theatre applauded at bills death it was very satisfying as i really wasnt sure what direction the duel would go in he played such an unlikeable character in such a way you could tell he was having fun with it and so the audience was too also shouldnt caine be in trouble for killing so many henchmen on the way up caine had the best lines from the  to the let me see in the card game probably the best in the franchise,2023-03-25
"i think winston and charon should have swapped roles it makes no sense that john wouldnt want to get revenge on winston for trying to  him the narrative making him out to be a noble guy and johns friend was disappointing since john getting vengeance was a big selling point at the end of chapter 3 john always had a good relationship with charon and him being there till the bitter end and becoming the head of the rebuilt continental would have been fitting 

also i think the mr nobody role was also useless he didnt contribute anything to the narrative since his role in the narrative was already occupied by caine i think the daughter would have been a much better pick for the third foil role she has it out for john and caine and it would have been interesting to see her continuously interfere with john and caines fighting by trying to  them both

i can’t remember a movie whose nearly threehour runtime went by as quickly as this i will admit that in the past especially with parabellum i have had some issue with the length of the killspree scenes in fact i was a little disappointed with chapter 3 and a bit worried going into this — i now know how foolish those thoughts were

 all i really wanted was just some coded message like the rest of the sommeliers scenes from 2 this suit will do you well for a party but if it gets too wild youll need to let it breathe and just say that the suit wont stand so much impact within a short amount of time then you can have all the mooks fail to  john wick and by the time the big guys come around reintroduce the threat by taking away the suits protection",2023-03-26
winston being johns father has so much depth keeping him a distant orphan but close and involved in the underworld winston basically orchestrated the downfall of the table,2023-03-26
"some things that bothered me about this movie though i can look past a lot if it as the action was amazing 


1  the osaka continental manager  what did he offer john as his friend  just safe harbor and passage and why was john even there  they just left it dangling and i felt i paid attention to a lot  this irked me

2  at the end of 3you  john  and then it was just left off  i guess kind of answered with killing the desert guy but idk  if this wasnt the last movie then ok but they said for now it is  didnt take down high table only one of them 

3  john felt weirdly less reponsive in this movie  i mean just weird

4 in the other ones john was banged up in need of medical attention  in this one he literally fell and should have broken his back in that dancing sceneor if he got lucky therethe stairs i chalked it up to him knowing how to fall since he wasnt rusty anymore but still  a bit too on the nose especially since he got hit  and how did the dog not get hurt by the car

5  john deadyeah obviously i think he faked his death and feel like the whole crest thing was to show john is dead but jehdani is alive imo

felt like the movie could have used some more editingi need to see this movie again to catch some extra things",2023-03-27
"glad it wasnt  but yeah it was a movie with some video game characters dialogue was ok nothing special action scenes had some good concepts but not very realistic seemed like it wasnt the best effort cos its john wick 4 and people want violence 

im happy to be alive rip lance reddick",2023-03-27

"there is zero chancejohn is gone

my guess iscontinental airs this yearsee what the taste for it isthen the ballerina movieand then another john wick

pull a palpatine on john
somehow palpatine john wick is backthe dog didnt seem fazedand the way the beggar king laughed

they could even do some style of mr nobody crossoverbob odenkirk

really wish they had of followed through with the high table  ppl seem to  enough of the ppl beneath them its amazing no ones tried to coup them before johns shown that 1 man can  ruin their day if need be

the high table just seem like massive cuntsu give us ur eyesand a never see ur daughter again kind of  dont have enough muscle to  all the familysso its  weird its taken someone till john  came along to  be like   u guys


plus what happened to that weird scene regarding the coins at winstonthat sort of implied that he is putting counterfit coins into circulation from the 2nd film",2023-03-28

"i loved every bit of the movie but the japan plot confused the  out of me

why did john wick ever go there like the daughter said its kinda his fault that everyone there died if the narrative reason is him picking up the marquis pin winston would have told him eventually whether he had the pin or not so its not like john gained anything from going there i guess im struggling to see the point of that entire thing other than cool ninja fighting and nunchucks 

please tell me if i missed something it kinda feels like koji died for no reason",2023-04-01

"its gonna be a hot take but the cgi was horrendous in this movie the overhead action sequence felt like a video game in the worst possible way people were on fire but the fire casts no shadows or illuminate anything everything was cgi and particle simulations that big mirror on the floor breaking was terrible papers flying around was terrible color matching was terrible every car except the ones driven by main actors were gci every bullet hole was cgi even the blood they had on their clothes at the end duel was cgi 

and dont get me on the unlimited bullets in the previous movies you could count the bullets and john changes the magazine when the gun is empty in this they specify the gun holding 21 bullets but he fires more than 40 times knives materialize in the hands of people people get stabbed with something but we never see with what the attention to detail was lacking in this movie 

and once more the cgi was horrendous color matching was terrible there was unnecessary green screen work at the end john being illuminated in white light but the buildings are in yellow light john being brighter than everything else yada yada

i dont know the fights on the third act didnt feel personal because of the excessive cgi never felt like john was in danger first two acts though masterpieces",2023-04-06
these movies are ridiculous to me they are basically just stunt men showing off i just wish there was a better story and characters to support it i know its meant to just be ridiculous but its hard to care about anyone,2023-04-08
this installment was a bit ridiculous with all the lighting shanenigans in the fight scenes sure it looked nice but to the point it was distracting i dont think i was meant to wonder why are there all these led tubes everywhere in these abandoned warehouses,2023-05-22
this movie went too far the fights were ridiculous especially the kevlar suits turned out to be just silly after the initial use in previous movie whole fighting scenes looked lame you could easily see how the mobs waited for keanu to be ready to handle them bad guys were silly cartoon bosses the blind hitman was total joke i did like the actor thought black hitman was totally unneeded as was the japanese hotels daughter i got bored at the action after 15 minutes it offered nothing new like the whole movie similar scenes than in previous movies repetition gets boring it was watchable but i would have cut at least 30 minutes of silly looking fighting scenes 710 mostly for the nice scenery and highclass places,2023-05-22
great action but these overly complicated rituals and traditions are kinda cringe,2023-05-23
worst thing about the movie were john wick being hit by multiple cars and not dying or even falling out of a 2nd story window onto a car hints of bollywood,2023-05-23

"this one reminded me of a video game so much meet the russian npc who gives you a mission to  the german sub boss and retrieve a tooth thus earning you a tattoo to allow you to fight the final boss etc

this one completely does away with any semblance of realism for better or worse its all very over the top it really was a bit long though i think sometimes the fight scenes went on way longer than they needed to even for john wick the nunchaku fight was probably my favourite

not entirely sure how i feel about the film very mixed on my end",2023-05-31
i thought it was great i loved how he saved the guys dog it made me think of how all of this started if only viggos son didnt  johns dog,2023-05-31
honestly i was extremely let down by this one john wick 1 was glorious just incredible action writing world building no notes except maybe next time get a russian to show you what a russian accent sounds like john wick 2 and 3 i still thought were good not the fireworks out of nowhere that the first one was but they managed to create a trilogy that didnt completely fizzle out towards the end like so many do but this time i felt like they couldnt  their own dicks hard enough while also forgetting why anyone liked the first one especially the very first fight osaka was annoying more so than tense bullet proof jackets were established  jackets that bullets will literally ricochet off with a silly ping and can be  dozen times without any pain were not and i did not appreciate it even worse that these same adamantium clothes were no use whatsoever at all again blades except that one time john was able to avoid getting his wrist cut by caines sword through virtue of having his shirt sleeve intervene but then they are also insanely good at absorbing blunt force considering the parisian stairs event also going back to osaka dripfeeding the bad guys so there were always 23 to fight before the next 23 arrived was bad enough given that the location was incredibly wide open with multiple avenues of approach so there was no natural funnel or secondary obstacle to regulate the influx of reinforcements that out of five or so people who clearly saw john only two figured it was worth their time to come at him was a bit worse but the number of times enemies would recover from johns attacks move to attack him again but visibly stop themselves and for no reason whatsoever flail around a bit more because john wasnt ready to fight them again just yet was just silly also john acting like ammo is infinite and quadrupletapping people even if his second shot already did their head in was a head scratcher decision for me but then again people are just really hard in this universe like mr nobody who used the hand he just split open a day ago to punch somebody without so much as flinching and the whole duel premise johns demand of leave me alone was fair enough but for winston to add on a bouncy castle and a pony and the contents of fort knox and not being laughed out of the building was silly  having a right to a duel is one thing but a trade as uneven as that is unreasonable by any measure of course it wasnt all bad the hotline miami topdown segment was pretty mint for instance and the ending wasnt the worst but overall i come away from john wick 4 disappointed and kind of annoyed actually,2023-06-01
"what in the f was this russian reboot of a marvel movie disguised as john wick

i had to quit at 45 minutes in and fck that movie all that expetation im not watching that but i have to have some answers from a wicker 

1 when did the john wick universe become a superhero world suddenly it was 4 clans attacking 1 samurai 2 maskman with guns 3 a group of jack reachers and solo dolo wickdare devil  it as the movies boss 
2 the blind guy was hella good in the start and could hear every move the other person made he was basically like dare devil but when john wick slid 2 meters next to him and sat there for a good 15 seconds while glass shattered while he moved  he reloaded and the blind guy cant suddenly hear anything then he walks 1 meter to the left of john and john moves towards him 
3 back to the superhero thing when did john wick become bullet proof ive seen all 3 and it was more like a modern take on rambo he was lucky and overpowered and survived  like a 1 in a 1000000 scenario but with this movie every guy needs 4 shots or a headshot to die wick just has to hold his hand against his face to survive even though he has fought of 30 guys within the first 30 min of the movie

this movie should be in the guinness world record book for the most action in any movie ever and i doubt it will be surpassed by an other movie any time soon they worked hard for 4 years and it shows still 8510 for the unrealistic part but atleast they had the balls to  him off which backed it up a few notches this was a banger,2023-03-24

the action in this movies is the best i think i have ever seen in a movie the gun combat reminded me of the movie equillibrium starring christian bale

but here is my question why did they  off john wick so they basically killed the franchise right how on earth can it possibly continue without john wick

i believe there is a post credits scene why not show it after the main end credits finish i ended up leaving missing the end credit scene

do you think if he could have a do over that wick would not have challenged french guy to a duel personally i think it was a dumb idea especially considering he ends up dying 

for me that third act of the movie minus the scenes wher wick is fighting seemingly every assasin was completely ruined by the duel storyline

what dan laustsen and kevin kavanaugh accomplished here is nothing short of incredible this might be the best looking film of the last few years yet i already know it wont get any awards recognition one of my favorite moments in this action film is simply winston just walking through an art gallery in a dolly shot

i also think this is a lot deeper than most people will give it credit its very obvious how much stahelski is influenced by greek mythology and i thought this film hit a lot of themes very well",2023-03-24

"when they announced this feature would be a 3hour epic i had a gut feeling it would culminate in wicks last outing after they killed off james bond last time i feel like all bets are off the table what i find curious is that they are still supposedly making a john wick 5 but i dont see how they can resurrect the character unless its a prequel or a fake gravestone and if you watch the aftercredits scene it seems to hint at a spinoff with other characters

as for the movie itself it was extremely john wickytake that as you will there are ridiculous set pieces where ravers are dancing wildly in the pouring rain sprinklers while other people are being killed all around them and another scene set in a busy traffic roundabout where cars drive on by normally then you have wick himself who falls from several great heights and gets knocked down 800 stairs but keeps getting back up again and it all culminates in a good old fashioned  duel what else could you ask for

donnie yen was great as the blind assassin did they call him caine because he carries a walking cane as improbable as that character is in this world and all the extended action sequences managed to feel like a liveaction video game especially in top down mode probably the single most impressive shot in the film my only complaint is that the film did seem like it was dragging on too long in parts which could have easily been cut down i miss when movies used to be less than two hours

"i enjoyed the film a lot 

still gravitate to the original as my favorite though there was just something brilliantly simple about the premise

also i like what they did with the mythology expansion of the high table and everything in the sequels  it was a good way to build on the story and keep things interesting  but frankly i also felt like it watered down the “legend” of john wick somewhat

in the original movie he seemed like a badass hitman whose very name instilled fear in any enemy who heard it it was like the very name john wick was enough to cause panic for anyone who dared come against them…but the more they introduced other hitmen and other foes and acquaintances in the sequels it kinda made wick just seem like one of many others and people didn’t seem to fear or respect him as much he finds himself in numerous situations in this film where he doesn’t seem quite as intimidating or respected by his peers as the original film made him out to be… it was sort of like he was the most feared hitman in the original film and that was gradually lost with each sequel

if i sound like i’m complaining i’m really not the reality is that the original film was a lot more grounded and the premise was basically “what if a retired hitman came back for revenge”  but they couldn’t keep recycling that plot in each sequel so i do get why they took it the direction they did they upped the ante and made things a little more fantastical almost in regards to the high table and the way the hotels are run and the network of hitmen… it just naturally evolved over time in a different direction

but to me the original film is still the best i need to rewatch the other sequels but this one might take the too spot if only for that ridiculously absurd final hour or so",2023-03-25
"hear me out continuing the franchise here on out is a big mistake and should’ve ended with a fifth why do i think this way

after the ending of 4 what exactly has changed in the grand scheme of things nothing as far as i can tell the high table still reigns at the tippy top of this assassination organization and we’ve never seen who is the true head of the totem pole it would’ve been incredible to go out in a huge epicscale involving the high table in some way and then indelibly altering the way things are run in this secret society the way wick passes away in the end didn’t leave a lasting impact on the franchise’s story universe after his death it will be business as usual for everyone associated below the high table so what would be an interesting hook going forward wick made a mess of things after avenging the death of his dog while the high table dispatched their expendable soldiers to  one man in the process so it’s ironically how both sides made mess of things a potential domino effect seemed like how the series was flowing until it built up to a climactic final flick where everything comes down like a house of cards to me it would’ve been cool if the high table is toppled and then all the crime organizations serving under them would splinter and become autonomous all of this resulted from wick’s war against the high table this is just head canon but i still stand that the franchise is essentially done without its lead guy so what would be the point if everything going forward will feel redundant something impactful should’ve happened to make the series a major turning point for the franchise but i guess we won’t find out whether this was a smart move or not until ballerina is released i have low faith but i’m open to give it a chance

"it feels like the topdown onetake fire shotgun scene set to the le castle vania soundtrack from the club scene in the first movie was made specifically for me but im happy it seems to have provided so much delight to everyone else

"as much as i like john wick movies and as good as the action was in this film it was way too long i know these movies arent exactly citizen kane but they normally have good plots that dont overstay their welcome and this one felt like it dragged a bit too much

the last hour was pretty rock solid but that first 90 mins had a lot of extra that could have just gone away the plot had a bit too much going on that didnt really add to the overall story  

like what was the point of nobody what did his character bring to the story the entire japan sequence seemed to be here because someone was like what if john wick but bows and arrows and while that was fun to watch you could have cut that entire sequence and the movie would have still made sense

same with the night club sequence with gold tooth boy the plot could have just as easily been that the marquis was the one that killed katias father and you wouldnt need that entire dance club sequence",2023-03-26

tracker or “nobody” was such a random insert and did nothing for the film other than add an excuse to have a trained dog run around as a spectacle i saw right through it anything for more black actors on screen though,2023-03-27
people trying to pick apart this movie with plot holes or what have you are missing the point of why you see these films,2023-03-27
"that long take overhead shootout sequence was insane beyond well done 

on another note can anyone tell me the point of the tracker character the guy with the dog he could have been cut from film and it would have little effect nothing against the actor",2023-03-27
"really happy they decided against the unlimited john wicks and cancelling 5

this was a beautiful closure to a great character  and new characters have been introduced every movie and we feel something for them   thought the franchise would suffer without kolstad but they made it work

and can we talk about how great a director chad stahleski the framing the cinematography especiallg after dan lausten came in the creativity sound mixing  its all top notch and even with the cinematic homages

and finally some good hollywood usage of donnie yen  scott adkins

all these new action films wanna be like john wick but they forget that its more than being a martial arts film  the writing the characters the acting the direction make the franchise what it is


also i mean this as a compliment but didn’t anyone feel this movie was like a live video game in order to get back in the family  this man  ensue next obstacle  get to the final duel survive the night actually was pretty brilliant",2023-03-28

this movie is basically an adaptation of an anime or video game that doesn’t exist love it you even have the armored minions who couldn’t be stunlocked and the freaking birdeye view

thoughts",2023-03-29
"welp there it is

i get why people are really enjoying this its fun has good action some solid one liners film looks absolutely beautifully—seriously some really stunning set pieces that makes me shocked they only spent 100 million on this it looks like it couldve cost double maybe triple that price tag osaka berlin paris new york it travels the globe and really its funny to see where it all started from in retrospect kind of humble beginnings

donnie yen was scene stealing made me want to watch some of his hong kong action films i thought bill skarsgard was the best villain the series has seen yet shamier anderson feels like a great newcomer and im stoked hes from toronto though felt his character was slightly under baked and more of a vessel to have more sweet dog kills the cast is pretty great

i think its the best john wick movie but again not as stoked on the franchise as a lot of people are but glad people are going to the movies and having fun for me this was definitely a little long exhausting in some parts and more of the same really i feel like john does that somersault flip over move pop someone in the head like every few minutes to me it feels like these movies are just kind of like a really really expensive fight choreography stunt showcase

also i still cant get over how keanu delivers his lines in these films this movie in particular he went hard for the stunts but he wrote it in on the acting it feels like every line he says was the first take and while youre acting with an ensemble cast who is actually trying to act its even more apparent

i think it outclasses the first film in the franchise ever so slightly and kind of a fitting end for everything its fun even though its so long i think you just need to turn your brain off and watch and realize these films dont take place in our reality but one close to it where people in a night club just keep dancing when multiple people are getting  murdered lol

that overhead fight scene though not terribly original really was chefs kiss",2023-03-29

i dont know if this is already floating around the internet but mr nobody has dreams or premonitions of images  he then draws those images in this little notebook  he goes to the location of where that image is and that is how he always finds john wick  of course it helps to have a belgian malinois nose but his images are how he primarily tracks people",2023-04-02
i loved almost all of the movie but man if thats the ending thatd be a real disappointment killing him like that just feels like a copout to me i actually cant believe how many people seem to think that ending a series of movies where for every sequel the last the main stakes are the survival of the main character with and then he dies from being  couple of times without anything really changing is really fitting or satisfying,2023-03-25
the concept of bulletproof suits are a good addition for the gun fights even theres no such thing in real life it makes mr wicks invulnerability on gun shots believable they also utilize it where there were a lot of scenes where john is covering his head with the flap of suit,2023-03-24

felt very repetitive i know these movies are not on the realistic side but there were too much dumb elements taking me out of this one not a bad film but not that good either,2023-03-24
very meh movie it felt like playing a video game the action was great but it felt like something you must play to enjoy  the cinematography was very good with nice scenery but the action scenes were sometimes waaay over the top like when he rolled down the stairs it was like he was rolling by himself or when he falls off the 3rd floor and just walks away… it felt a bit lazy on the first film you believed he was a very good assassin now it felt like he was bulletproof also come on now how can all this baddies be pro assassins and also be so bad at aiming plus sometimes it really showed that the were waiting for their turns to join the fight choreography not very good but also not bad 610,2023-03-28
"if i had wrote the movie i think an ending that would have been a thousand times better than the ending of the movie would be if wick and cain came up with a plan off screen in which they would purposely miss each other the first two shots eg hit each other in the arm then on the third shot they both turn thier guns on french guy and both put thier bullet in his head then  have wick tell the guy that was judging the contest to walk away and not tell anyone what happened or else he will wind up dead honestly if i had seen that ending at the cinema i would have applauded at the twist 

even caine what did he gain by being in the dual and poetntially dying he could have killed french guy at any time and be on his way

or have them both threaten french guy and have him sign a document to free both wick and cain from the obligations of the table

i would also write it so that her wife did not die she just dissapeared for her safety she comes back into wicks life gets kidnapped by french guy and so wick in an act of desparation decides to participate in a duel not with french guy but with cain to which french guy agrees then it would make perfect sense for 1 wick to do the duel even though he could die and 2 wick dying in the end 

also why on earth would wick go and see johnathan when he tried to  him at the end of part 3 if i was in his shoes johnathan would be the last person on earth i would want to see let alone agree to his plan 

the ending was so poorly written so let me get this straigh wick agreed to a plan which leads to him dying also what an extremely poor and unsatisfying way to end the movie franchise me personally the way it ends makes the entire four movies and evrything he fought for completely pointless

my score of the movie the action and fight choreography 1010 storyline and ending 110",2023-03-30
"the movie gets off to a kind off start with deserte scenes and the elder feeling the need to go back to elements of part 3 but after that its a well oiled machine


really with a slight rearrangement of elements this could have just been the third film

i alleviated how well this film built out a new supporting cast and how much the themes of loyalty and friendship and what people owe eachother played put through them 

much as i love john wick 2 the introduction of the bullet proof suits really skewed things now when many of the goons have the same technology its almost like dune where everyone has shields so they have to resort to fighting g hand to hand really brought stakes back into the fights in a way that had been missing for a while",2023-03-24

"now i get that with these movies you need a serious suspension of disbelief and i was able to maintain that for john wick 1 2 and 3 with no problem the only thing that really sticks out for me is when john fell off the roof after the third movie and lived but aside from that nothing really broke my immersion of the films 

but a blind assassin no way not even the dumb fun of the series could keep that from being a total immersion killer every scene he was in just yanked me out of the movie and i could never settle in

there were some silly bits however the nightclub scene was very “i want all you extras to pretend there’s club music and just keep throwing your hands in the air like you just don’t care about the killings happening around you even when your life would technically be at stake”  

also john should have easily been able to headshot the guy when he saved the dog that dude had way too much armour and plot armour 

lastly the assassins who had a clear view of john and could have easily shot him instead just stared at him and then waited for him to fall in the street before hitting him with their cars worst strategists ever

however the roundabout car sequence was awesome though",2023-03-24
"that overhead sequence is so  good pretty much every action sequence in the movie was amazing but that one definitely takes it for me it was just so satisfying the fight on the stairs was great but john getting kicked and rolling down like 8 flight of stairs was goofy as  i kinda cringed when he rolled down the first 2 but then it somehow became better when he just kept rolling because it became so ridiculous that it was funny caine was awesome the whole berlin club sequence was probably weakest actionwise though still really good but the big german guy was so hilariously hammy in the best way possible im pretty sure john isnt dead since they still have 1 more movie announced afaik

overall it was amazing and 3 hours went by so  fast the movie felt much shorter than it was because it was just pure fun",2023-03-24

is donnie yen going to be blind in most movies from now on,2023-03-24
"a  of a time throughout with the standouts for me being the stairs the incendiary shotgun and the overhead scene where it got used and donnie yens blind fighting style

the thing im not big on is the end  john wick dying at the end of the series makes sense but it doesnt feel like hes accomplished what the story has been leading him to  dr full destruction of the high table and an end to this whole mythic rulebased criminal underworld

he never killed them all he never brought a war to the high table he just got his offical freedom and saved a friend  but it seems like the deeper he got into all this the less respect he had for their rules  being given freedom by another of their convoluted rules shouldnt mean anything to john at this point

also weird that he never got his ring back

so maybe theyll reveal his death was faked it would make story sense that hed do it  but if thats the filmmakers plan then they shouldve revealed that to us  they can lie to the high table and the criminal underworld but theyre not supposed to lie to us thats not part of the series

that said im still absolutely going to see it again soon  that incendiary shotgun maaaaan",2023-03-24

"resharing thoughts from another thread

x200b

this film continues the theme of john being a bringer of death and destruction wherever he goes  sofia resented him for it and marcus koji charon died for it alongside all the others who he called in favours for and were harmed in the process he built up lots of goodwill over the years and we saw him burn more and more bridges as he fought for survival and freedom
  

  
hes always been established as selfless but not selfish and after the loving husband line i was thinking about how they would resolve caines story without john becoming someone who would rather sacrifice his friend and caines daughter and how the best resolution would be for john to die and his last act be one of saving a life
  

  
problem with that conundrum was that the marquis wouldnt have got what he deserved so the resolution to the duel still surprised me but i was satisfied with the end to his story seeing him think of his wife and free
  

  
on the film overall its still fresh in my mind but it does feel very indulgent and as a fan im happy with it but can see how those who arent obsessed with the films could get lost easily it makes sense to think that they grouped chapter 4 and 5 together since there were original talks to film both back to back
  

  
action sequences were so fun particular favourite was the gunchaku sequence arc de triomphe hotline miamidragons breath also appreciate the reprise of the catacombs music from chapter 2 and staircase definitely felt some more western homages in the final duel within the score donnie yen and shamier anderson stole the show bill skasgard was fun but perfectly functional",2023-03-24

"loved it and it’s an amazing imax experience but i do think it takes a bit too long to get to the duel if the marquis and wick had met earlier and the time wick had until the duel had been like 3 days or something instead of one night i think it would seem a bit more connected 

still loved it and i’ll definitely watch it again but the third act feels almost like another movie",2023-03-24

"the only thing i would add to the four movies is show more flashbacks of john wick killing people as an assassin to show the audience you cheer for him now but before the first movie he did some very bad things

by the way how on earth does john wick survive the end of the 3rd movie

also my only real gripe is where on earth are the police in these movies where are the french police near the end of the movie especially involving regular people driving thier cars on the streets as cars are driving back and forth bad guys are literally getting run hit and run over yet no police rock up",2023-03-25

"the first movie when the puppy was killed we were like blood must be shed

and this movie when the concierge was killed especially with the recent irl death i thought there might be a riot if the killer was not killed",2023-03-25
"i think i just saw the john wick franchise as one being more “grounded in reality” versus fast  furious which has leaned fully into being strictly a “spectacle” movie 

it’s like the difference between pierce brosnan and daniel craig james bond movies both are well made and good for what they are… but if you put some of the sequences from the brosnan films into the craig movies they wouldn’t work because the craig films are a bit more grounded in the rules of the real world — even if he is doing things that are otherwise impossible

jw 1  2 and 3 to a certain extent have things that are “impossible” but still feel like they are on the very edge of what is possible for the world’s greatest assassin when you have a magic suit that absorbs all possible damage it almost takes away from the skill that is supposed to typify the character",2023-03-25

i really enjoyed the movie and its probably my second favorite of the series behind the first one i saw the movie in dolby and i do have a complaint that the sound mixing was too muddy and loud sounds were too loud to the point where things got kind of muddy it became so much loud noise at once that it was drowning out other things in the scene thats really my only major complaint is the sound mixing hopefully this isnt an issue for the 4k blu ray release,2023-03-25

"really enjoyed chapter 4 i dont know i may need to a second viewing but im leaning towards liking chapter 3s action scenes better i think parabellum was peak jw action the fight scenes in 3 escalated at a really great pace from the initial knife throwing and motorcyclekatana chases and introducing those armored swat units towards the end was so entertaining to watch and to top it off jw fights the  iron chef chairman at the end 

i get they wanted to go with a poetic climax with the classic dueling pistol match but i would have loved to see yen and reeves square off handtohand or some combo of melee weapons cant go wrong with a final boss fight imo the stairway fight was okay but at that point so many of the previous action scenes were so good it ended up being underwhelming 

scott atkins as killa could have fooled me for kingpin 

favorite scenes was probably the beginning osaka hotel fights what a sequence

1  2 feel like much different movies compared to 3  4 with the success of the prior movies they were able to go so big and creative with 3 4 just takes the best of everything and overall is very satisfying conclusion storywise probably the best of the franchise also the cinematography and action shots were topnotch gotta give credit to the john wick team they been hard carrying the action genre for a while now and deserve some high praise for the phenomenal choreography that has become so vacant in a sea of cgi blockbusters",2023-03-25

i think weve learned that gaining your freedom from the high table doesnt really stick didnt work in johns case and even though kaine is retired and gave up his eyes they still hold a life for a life over his head 

makes some sense that they would fake his demise so that he can live the quiet life he wanted plus im not convinced a shot to the abdomen could take him down based on his ability to soak damage and with winston right there and reinstated and able to use the continental facilities 

of course signs point against this it wasnt filmed they show his grave and the bowery king walks off with his dog but part of me wants to believe hes still out there he definitely earned his freedom",2023-03-26

other little signs imo hes not dead

winston being cagey when answering where he is

john dog kinda looked like he saw someone he recognized

caine owes him one

its stated by the marquise that if john wins it could be very bad news for the high table shake it to its core or something i forget exactly what he said well john won and i dont think the high table is going to be very pleased he might be free but john is 100 in danger best place for him to be for now is dead so the high table backs off

bowery king is trying to form a resistance army against the table so far only john was its only real soldier im under the impression that johns friends can theoretically be recruited

the table itself we never saw them feels hollow if john is truly dead and never dealt with the 12 of them personally break the table then truly everyone is free",2023-03-26

"great movie great ending to john’s story 

also i gotta get my hands on that pit viper",2023-03-27
the only question i have is what happened to his dog and car getting repaired lol rip charon gone too soon 3,2023-03-27
loved the movie but is keanu alright between this and matrix 4 i seriously think hes had a  or something hes entitled to privacy of course but his speech pattern has become so slow and stilted hope hes okay,2023-03-27
does anyone know what kind of dogs were in the scene alongside the guards when caine is summoned by marquis they were monsters,2023-03-27

john wick yeah…",2023-03-27
"i just rewatched one of my favourite donnie yen fight scenes  the rooftop fight from in the line of duty 4 which had a uk bluray rerelease just last week and i noticed he does a certain move that also turns up in one of the fights in jw4



at 924 in the video theres a forearm windup punch which he also does at one point in the japan sequence of jw4 ",2023-03-27
john wick 3 kind of dipped its toe into the water with it but this is probably the first movie ive seen where bullets themselves are treated like melee weapons,2023-03-28
great john wick is not a saga where you have to find physical or script explanations you just enjoy it,2023-03-28
"i always expected this series to end with john dying after leaving such a trail of carnage in his wake however justified you may or may not think it was theres simply no going back and even if he were to finally put an end to it and gain his freedomwhats he even have to go back to it only made sense that john had to die at the end of all this

and yet watching him draw his last breath  after 9 years of following this series  still hit like a truck id be happy getting a new jw film every few years from now until the end of time so for things to seem so final is really sad however necessary it may be these have been some of the best flat out action movies ive ever seen and they really went all out for this one the cinematography in this movie was for lack of a better word incredible everything was so crisp yet dripping in moody colors and lighting it was a  joy to watch when combined with the usual level of jw insanity 

if this is the end im going to miss the  out of the series but im so thankful that we got 4 great movies that all lived up to a high bar of quality and a truly epiclength conclusion even if it did feel a bit draggy in spots",2023-03-28
movie was  awesomepretty sure he isnt dead,2023-03-28
can we all just agree john isnt dead especially since a 5th installment has already been greenlit,2023-03-28
"final scene with john walking down the stairs gave me cowboy bebop vibes

its a good end for him if they decide to end it there it can go either way winston was in great debt to him for getting back to his former position and helping him fake a death had no consequences since he was free from the high table


edit he was also in a vehicle related hit like 8 times 6 if youre just counting being run into while on foot",2023-03-28
what would’ve been the rules of duel if marchese had his weapon of choice bladesswords fight until one cuts the other then reset and how would john have killed him assuming it plays out the same way marchese takes the sword from caine  walks up to him  you arrogant  he didnt strike  consequences  stabs him fatally,2023-03-28
this movie and series just makes me more hyped for sisu an upcoming balls to the wall action movie by the team that makes the john wick movies looks sick as  too,2023-03-28
yen skarsgard and akira were all such great characters to introduce,2023-03-28
lots being talked about… but can we talk about how laurence fishbourne did a “lawrence of arabia” transition bold great movie,2023-03-28
i love the fact when john fell down the stairs all the audience in the room gasped,2023-03-28
what an awesome movie although i wish we got more gun and  variety i felt like they rehashed the pistolover shoulderheadshot sequence too much apart from that what an awesome movie amazing set design thunderous sound and stunning visuals hoping there is a 5th where they take on the high table but also happy for it to end there,2023-03-28
phenomenal action loved the warriors homage and a great movie but i will be extremely  if he’s actually dead,2023-03-28
did anyone else noticr that in the duel they shot each other in the places the doc told wick to in the third film,2023-03-29
the line that stuck to me the hardest was dont insult my gift to you im gonna use that line lol,2023-03-29
"so many great supporting roles in this rina sawayama was scorching as akira great debut fatsuitfatale scott adkins shimazu tracker caaaaaine

"incredibly stylish movie i didnt think they could continue it from the previous films without it being stale but it absolutely proved me wrong so many cool scenes like the car drifting while shooting and the fire shotgun it really felt like a video game come to life

story was fast paced and it never felt boring despite the long running time  it definitely has a the real treasure was the friends you made along the way feel but i think at the core of it all thats the moral of the story doing the right thing for the people you love despite the worlds rules against them",2023-03-29
if it ends here i hope this is the final john wick film it really is impressive to have an action franchise of this quality that constantly ups the stakesskill on display with the same core cast and director wish i could say writer but they oddly snipped kolstad for this one its rarest in action franchises to have a director stay on for sequels let alone for all four in the franchise this makes me a lot more open to the spin offs as one of the most fun things with action franchises that swap directors is seeing new takes within the established world so thats how i view things like ballerina i think the wickstahelski style has been done to completion but the stunt format in the series and the world building could carry on for a lot more,2023-03-29
the movie started out feeling like so many video games i love but then when it turned into actual frogger i was dying  what a fun  movie,2023-03-29
how did donnie yen know exactly what cards he was dealt when at the poker table,2023-03-29
so can someone explain to me what was mr nobodys deal was,2023-03-29
keanu reeves and donnie yen are so awesome together the action isnt just fun its impressive the choreography of the fights the cinematography the lighting the music the directing and scott adkins in a  suit,2023-03-29
clancy brown runs everything,2023-03-29
i enjoyed the  out of it john is a beast i was wondering why he spoke so weird as if he had brain damage though it wasnt as noticeable in the first 3 movies it was definitely exhausting to watch after 3 hrs but im down for directors cut,2023-03-29
"the entire paris sequence alone was worth the price of admission

im not exactly obsessed with the series i think these movies just kind of blend in with each other at this point but if you just want a good  time with some mindless action this is one  of a film franchise to binge",2023-03-29
"osaka going full samurai

arc de triumph chase scene bringing the car back 

the  eye shooting scene was perfect

didnt wick  the head of the table in the desert for a moment i assumed he was the guy above him but his not",2023-03-29
"loved it my favourite of the sequels

first one is still my favourite it had an elegant simplicity that cant be beaten imo

the scale and ambition of chapter 4 were amazing though i loved the variety of action and colours and the sheer beauty of the cinematography

cast was all around great and i like what they did with the story  


yeah it didnt need to be this long but i was never bored and was mostly grinning like an idiot

810",2023-03-29
"i think as a final movie in its series it earned the true jumptheshark moments in the same way that the fast and furious franchise slowly built their way to increasingly absurd action sequences 

almost like a video game it was really interesting to see how the elite level bad guys adopted the high level gear like the bulletproof suit introduced in 2 and the heavily armored guards introduced in 3 with all these concepts and established rules of combat coming together we got some really creative action scenes that are pretty much up there for best in the whole series 

sure if in the first movie we saw john wick doing donuts and shooting at a bunch of goons or judo throwing his enemies into traffic and shooting them as they ragdoll in the air or tumbling down an absolutely massive flight of stairs it might be a little silly but here it feels right i loved the balance of the brutality and whimsical absurdity that reminds me of hkstyle action the fighting can be lighthearted and fun within a serious story and you can still have a great time",2023-03-29
"this seemed like the one movie where it was more grounded they start the movie with the cool set that has a lot of glass and tube lighting  and then the sets gradually become more and more real until theyre just fighting outside sacre coeur

and the patrons in the nightclub reacting with varying amounts of disgusthorrorconfusion not entirely ignoring it",2023-03-29
"watched it last night in a small barebones theater  will be seeing it again in imax with a fuller audience 

 fantastic addition to the series 

i didnt pay much attention to seeing previews in fact ii barely new it was being released  i read keanus ama a couple weeks ago and then i randomly saw some clip with scott talking about wick  couldnt wait

 if youre not familiar with adkins check out the rest of his stuff  ive seen everything hes been in as well as donny yen and theyve worked together before ip man 4  two of my favorite martial arts actors  they both have seriously improved their nonaction acting so happy they were in it    

the overhead shootout scene  amazing  reminiscent of s1e4 of true detective single take  

rolling down the stairs made me think of the myth of sisyphus and that john is both sisyphus and the stone  

doing donuts and shooting  more please 

what a jampacked movie loved it",2023-03-29
"absolute  tier of an imax movie had enormous fun then the third hour came and my jaw dropped repeatedly

the 2nd and 3rd movies were good but suffered a bit from being ambitious i hoped that they would tone it down for the 4th turns out i was wrong and the solution was just to press even harder on the ambition pedal more locations more complicated shots craizer action scenes 

the ending did bring back that bit of heart that made people love the character so much in the first movie i really liked it and applaud the choice",2023-03-29
psa on when to use the bathroomgo  any time you see a scene with the pink ladies in their dispatch office if youve seen one scene with them youve seen them all they just keep boosting johns bounty and alerting the masses,2023-03-30
why did john  the elder why did caine assist john up the stairs,2023-03-30
such a fun film action is on point and really badass well choreographed and chaotic while also over the top yet gritty so much fun action it’s hard to pick a favorite fight the incendiary shotgun scene seems to be the fan favorite i really enjoyed the club fight sequence where wick fought the  guy although i thought it was kinda bs that  man did as well as he did the third act is fun but that’s where the action got to the most ridiculous wick getting hit by several cars and later falling all the way down the stairs  a western style duel was a fitting final fight i had some problems with the film not the runtime tho i thought the film had good pace but it’s my favorite in the wick franchise,2023-03-30
i thought for a split second after john saved mr nobodys dog from being hurt that they would form an alliance  i was wrong  i would like to see a spinoff about mr nobody,2023-03-30
what was the line that koji said to john something about friends and convenience,2023-03-30

"say what you will about representation in movies but  did it feel good to be “inside” on the joke when caine cussed out  dealer in cantonese and jw joined in 

i also loved that they embraced donnie yen’s fight style from his chinese movies and even used it to show he was disarming but not killing koji’s army since they were friends their friendships didn’t feel forced and neither did caine’s character in this movie",2023-04-01
there are people that are baffled how others can suspend their disbelief and enjoy this movie and im wondering if they remember common and keanu discreetly shooting at each other on adjacent escalators thats when this franchise earned my suspension of disbelief,2023-04-01

"absolutely breathtaking a fine conclusion to the john wick quadrilogy

chad stahelski the director and the entire team one upped themselves in this one incredibly fun to watch

a straight 10 out of a solid 10 

do svidaniya john wick",2023-04-01
best movie of the series this can be said for parts 2 and 3 as well chad stahelski is a  genius,2023-04-01
when marquis walked over to john to take the last shot and winston was like you  biotch he hasnt even shot yet and then he shot marquis in the head i laughed way harder than i should have but it was so satisfying,2023-04-02
that call back to the warriors and the boppers listening was a great call back,2023-04-02
seemed like there were a lot of nut shots i’m surprised the high table didn’t get cups for everybody going up against john wick but then no one’s ever survived to report to upper management,2023-04-02
just got out of theaters that was amazing,2023-04-02
wait so how the blind guy can see what cards he had and where to shoot that was throwing me off throughout the movie,2023-04-02
he’s not dead,2023-04-02
"i just watched it in theaters what a fantastic movie

the franchise was already known for its gorgeous cinematography but chapter 4 tops the previous ones action movies rarely get love during awards season but this movie should get nominated for its cinematography but it wont

in addition they shouldnt go forward with a fifth movie because i dont think they can top chapter 4 they have explored a ton of exotic settings with ridiculous set designs throughout four movies maybe the geniuses who worked on this movie can think of more places to explore but i cant think of anything else they can do with this franchise

and donnie  yen what a badass",2023-04-02
can somone help me out here in the end john challenges the marquee or however you spell it to a dual each gets to nominate a second we are told if either side loses their second also diesso firstly why was cain dueling when wick challenged the leader secondly upon johnwinning so to speak why isnt cain killed as well as per the rules,2023-04-02
"the only things that were kind of meh for me 
 the character of nobody you could take him out have caine  the other assassins to have john for himself and thats it useless character imo
 the outright terrorist attack in the middle of paris and no police intervention in the first movie jimmy came to his house because some noise was reported here cars kept going for 1015 minutes although it had that awesome scene where john did the drift around the assassins and killed them
 the stair scene i honestly wouldve preferred caine and nobody if he had to be in the movie to just help john the whole him getting to the top then falling back and then getting back up again was a bit much in a movie that had 249 hours runtime already

other than those amazing action and all that and ill even give the benefit of the doubt to the osaka scenemeaning that story wise its hard to believe john would endanger his close friend a solid 85 on my part",2023-04-02
im just glad after 4 movies this franchise is still good usually things fall apart around the 3rd movie,2023-04-02
is it just me or did keanu reeves look gassed in that scene in osaka continental when he used the nunchucks,2023-04-02
"just came out of the cinema loved it
 question in the poker card scene how did caine know that he had three cards of 9 how did he knew the cards i thought he would call for one of killas servants to read and whisper the cards for him",2023-04-02
that whole paris sequence had to be homage to the warriors amazing movie my favorite one after the first one,2023-04-02
im sure john wick and neimar can have prolonged conversation on rolling,2023-04-02
im a wuss so i have to ask are any eyes or fingers getting hurt at least can i see it coming like in john wick 3 cheers,2023-04-02
did the sound cut out during the rave scene or did my theatre have audio issues,2023-04-02
how did the blind guy do like anything how he see how he know,2023-04-02
i loved it it felt a little tongue in cheek at moments for the sheer ludicrousness of the action scenes and unlimited ammo etc and whether intentional or not made it all the more entertaining,2023-04-02
is john wick really dead tho,2023-04-03
"just watched it have watched the previous 3 and for further context my favorite movie of all time is the raid 2 john wick is the closest thing to the raid 2 that hollywood has to offer im a sucker for good action however average action does nothing to me which is what youd see in a marvel movie doesnt mean i dislike average action but it just doesnt get me any excited

that said i dont remember much of john wick 3 since it has been a while since ive seen it i think it ended with him having that huge bounty on his head and all of new york about to chase him 


spoilers ahead


now to this movie first the positives i really really enjoyed the locations and sceneries whoever was responsible for those absolutely fantastic job i wish i couldve paused the movie and just look at some of those places for a good minute or two i continue to enjoy the world theyve built with its rules and factions its really fascinating the action was really good as always however maybe its just me but since my favorite movie of all time is the raid 2 i wouldnt mind the john wick movies to have a little more blood and have a little more gore here in germany you can only watch it if youre 18 which is the highest rating so its not like they had to hold themselves back from a bit more brutality the raid 2 was also shown in cinemas here uncensored maybe its a bigger issue in other countries 

to me it also felt like it didnt need to be this long i think john wick 4 wouldve benefitted from being a more compact movie cut one or two action scenes cut some less relevant ones short have it be around 140 minutes and i believe it would be a better movie to make a good action movie imo you need a quality over quantity approach dont have too much normal action and the action you do have make all of the scenes unique and innovative so theyre memorable john wick 4 didnt quite hit the perfect balance but dont get me wrong it was still really good especially the locations and some of the camera shots were amazing that apartment fight with the above camera like youre playing a videogame was great i think you could also remove one of the side characters as part of making the movie more compact in hindsight i dont think the movie would be any worse without the black guy with his dog i was also under the impression that john wick was 110 definitely beyond recovery so him getting out of all his troubles completely within the rules was a little lame

is he dead is he not the ending reminded me a little of the cowboy bebop ending maybe he is maybe he isnt came a little unexpected for me i thought there were more john wick movies confirmed and i guess the door is open if it happens if not this is enough to bring the series to an end

overall i really enjoyed john wick 4 it couldve been a little more compact but i still came out with a smile on my face id give it a 7510",2023-04-03
"just seen it and for me easily the best jw movie

absolutely loved the overhead camera action in the style of diablo hack and slash gaming really  brilliant

equally loved the homage to the warriors wasnt as good but then nothing can beat the original however it was really good constant action

the cars were a good touch you think its an easy home run once he gets the car but nope that didnt happen

and the scene where he went rolling all the way back to square one made me genuinely laugh out loud because those stairs were  painful

great movie loved the finale the arrogant coward thought he had john but yeah arrogance brings comes with a side serving of complacency and carelessness

great sound track and among the classic covers was a really nice violin piece cry mia river

felt like they never really tied off akiras story though and im still not sure if the end really was as it seemed

910",2023-04-04
"guys am i trippin but why everybody saying that part 4 is good 
let me explain 
john wick is not “good story” movie
but part 4 is not good even good action movie 
yeh scene like hotline miami gameplay is incredible but other tricks and fight scenes are so bad even this fight in a club 
that fake purple jacket muppet etc
don’t know but every time i saw fight scenes i cdobt believed in them 
because they were so fake",2023-04-04
good but i could’ve done without the first half and still been ok kinda a snooze until paris everything after that point was great though i think 3 is still my favorite,2023-04-04
"well that was insane the last hour in paris was one of the greatest action sequences ive ever seen just when you think it cant get any better it just keeps getting more crazy in the best way possible

one thing i dont like is how invincible john is the amount of times he gets hit by a car or falls from a lethal height is ridiculous and he doesnt even get hurt that much when he reaches sacre coeur there isnt even a drop off blood on him its a bit too over the top for me

i think i still like the first one the best but this one is probably second so in the end id rank them  1  4  2  3  

i am glad the main series is likely over now theyve been skirting the line of over the top for a while and i dont know if they could keep it up

overall this is an 8 out of 10 for me",2023-04-04
a much more satisfying fourth movie would have been wick going out to end the high table once and for all with the help of koji his daughter and caine that would have made for a much better movie,2023-04-04
"ding  bam so good

i freaking loved this movie not as good as the first one but i thought it was better than 2 and 3

just so many good scenes to pick from saw where the duel was headed as soon as he didnt fire and it still felt great to witness but man when he hit the top of the steps and the top henchman sparta kicks him back the bottom i audibly said you  i felt johns exhaustion lol

our boy aint dead the dog perking up suddenly during the funeral points heavily to a fake out to be able to finally be away from the table  is what was suggested there yeah was really expecting john to just go ham and go after the whole high table but maaaaaan

and i think my favorite running bit was any time johns pistol would run out of ammo hed chuck the thing at people made me laugh every time",2023-04-05
fun fact the harpers pin from dungeons  dragons makes in appearance in jw4 as the emblem pin of the high table,2023-04-05
probably the first time where we see two absolute legends in asian martial arts movie fight on screen  hiroyuki sanada and donnie yen also they had to nerf scott adkins being a fatty because he clears same with donnie being blind,2023-04-06
really loved the surprising homage to this scene in the warriors,2023-04-07
saw it last night  boy am i glad i saw it in theaters,2023-04-07
the real hero here the nut grabbing beer drinking dog  thats what i call a friend ,2023-04-07
amazing camerawork and use of colors in dark settings i usually don’t like when main characters die at the end of movies but i thought they did this one really well,2023-04-08
would’ve been so sick to see john take one of the giant spears in the background of the glass room in osaka  go medieval on everyone,2023-04-08
i havent seen this one yet but i loved the other threethat fight scene in the shop with those knives in the third moviedamnthat movie was everything and just think it all started in the first movie when someone killed is little dog now you know that wasnt very nicehuhhahah,2023-04-10
they brought in ronaldo to train him to keep rolling down those stairs,2023-04-10
legends will say that that was berghain,2023-04-11
i quite enjoyed this movie overall but i do wish the action hasnt gotten quite so ridiculous and it felt less violent and impactful overall the entire nunchucks sequence just felt slapstick the hotline miami sequence was amazing though really liked the ending too but there is nothing else for this series to do even wick had to give up on trying to  the high table this world is now set in stone maybe you could do john fighting a predator or something but i like this being the end and john dead parabellum is still the best of the films,2023-04-14
"finally watched the movies can’t add anything that’s not already been shared here

think wick finally died because he was at peace no amount of hard falls form buildings high speed car hits and what not could even leave a scratch 

it would be extremely bold of lg to let john wick be hope they do and move the universe forward with other characters

all studios looking for easy cash cows",2023-04-15
i havent thoroughly enjoyed a movie like that start to finish in a long long time  i think it was jw3 last and especially the hotline miami scene just  outstanding,2023-04-15
very relieved that it did not end with keanu spreadarmed like the end of the matrix 3,2023-04-16
the poker table scene was sublime casino royale move over,2023-04-19
is it me or does john wick dying at the end leave the audience unfulfilled for 4 movies i watched this guy escape death in a numerous amount of ways inflict pain and death in fashionable style and literally own the nick name “baba yaga” as he is the one you send to  the boogeyman i feel like the image of john wick to the viewer was supernatural almost godlike an unkillable force the literal boogeyman as he was hyped up to be and to just die instead of  everyone who sits at the high table seemed anticlimactic and boring is that just me,2023-04-20
osaka sequence and the third act is  goated af,2023-04-23
i got a bit fed up towards the end on the stairs when john wick gets hurt in ways that definitely would have broken every bone in his body including his back but he keeps on getting up i did love the way it ended though that amazing duel scene was just set so beautifully,2023-04-24
does anyone even take seriously the idea that john wick could have in fact died and so the series are over too i find it laughable tbh not sure why they even did the twist,2023-04-24
no leguizamo this time,2023-04-25
wait so akira tells john if he doesn’t  caine for killing her father she will and caine even tells her “i’ll be waiting for you” does this mean we’re getting another chapter with akira doing her best  bill impression,2023-04-26
"my favorite part of the film is donnie yen just walking up and poking people in the chest with his sword all he needs to do is hit them in the heart and they stay down and he does it like 5 or 6 times meanwhile john is leg sweeping and judo throwing people to get close enough for a guaranteed head shot

it was a really cool yen and yang at the two fight styles as john is giving his all to move forward and caine is really not in to this fight",2023-04-27
this film introduced so many cool new assassins that im now much less sceptical if john wick spinoffs would be a good idea im absolutely up for a caine movie,2023-04-28
"does anyone know what that move is called that john used a couple times where he lays on his back in front of his opponent his legs straight feet on the opponents hips to keep them out of range 

he did it in osaka then again against mr nobody in the apartments mr nobody countered though  flung johns feet away when john tried it on him 

move name andor fighting style  martial arts name would be great i thought maybe jiujitsu",2023-05-01
youre gonna carry that weight,2023-05-01
i just started watching the first john wick and after that guy killed the puppy for no reason i really wish john had tortured the the son more instead of taking him out immediately  ,2023-05-02
about mr nobody’s dog… mr nobody is seated in the lounge area of japanese hotel…he’s looking through pages of his notebook… is it me or has anyone noticed the photo of his dog with what appears to be a 48k bounty written over or under the photo,2023-05-03
so one thing i didnt get how did the blind guy get everything he wanted as far as i can tell the duel rules went like this the duel is to the death you need to a have a second standing by if you win both you and your second get your demands met if you lose you die and your second gets executed along with you blind guy and john were dueling bad guy blind guys second tags in at the very end to do the coup de grace because he wants to be the guy to  john gets shot and loses doesnt that mean the entire blind guybad guy team loses and that blind guy is supposed to be executed at the very least i dont see why hed get his demands met when hes on the losing team or was he just let off the hook from being in the duel altogether when bad guy tagged in and bad guy dying also just automatically absolved him all debt since thats who his debts were to,2023-05-05
i loved it up to the point where they said ‘you know what this movie needs an idea just ripped out of another classic movie no not a homage just use the same idea dialogue and song……’,2023-05-11
sacrécœur is 15 min tops on bike from arc de triomphe  the final act makes no sense,2023-05-19
wow so donnie yens character lost his eyes much later in his life meaning i can only imagine how much more  insane he was when he still had them,2023-05-24
will there be a chapter 5  since john is dead dont tell me its fake death,2023-05-25
"it only takes life

and only gives death",2023-05-26
oh has anyone spoken about the bullets thay literally burst into flames,2023-05-26

why wasnt caine killed after the duel he was the marquis second right i thought the second was killed as well,2023-06-07
the only thing that tics me off was the main villain being played by someone who does not speak french as a french person hearing is horrible accent was really bad im sure he could have worked on it a little better,2023-06-11
the choreography was impressive but watching wick fight nothing but clumsy dudes with bad aim got boring pretty quickly anticipating the movements and punches was too obvious for me to get into especially with as much fighting as this movie had,2023-06-16
i loved the part where john wick gets kicked by chidi and falls down a flight of stairs for 3 minutes honestly i did not expect john wick to be sounrealistic and im all for it but honestly my favourite parts were the osaka continental fights i would absolutely love to visit all the locations in john wick,2023-06-20
i have a feeling there are going to be many sequels and spinoffs to john wick i hope one of them is about caine and another is about the tracker those two were great,2023-06-21
could very well be the best action fighting movie i’ve ever seen,2023-06-25
crazy thought  i  hope peter mensah is cast to replace lance reddick ok maybe not a replacement but in some fashion im just rewatching 300 and he trully stole that opening scene this is madness,2023-06-27
i think the extraction series is giving john wick a serious run for the money i loved the action sequences in the second part a lot more than john wick tbh anyone else feel the same somehow it feels more impactful in extraction,2023-07-01
"what if 

john wick when he dies wakes up as neo and morpheus is looking over him and tells him that hes been in the matrix all this time he had a virus implemented to hes brain thats why he couldnt get out or others help him 
only morpheus could enter the john wick world marquis was the virus he had to  final boss 
meh i dno ",2023-07-12
just watched and couldn’t hold my self to talk about the “champs élysée” car scene  and it’s awesome,2023-07-14
"i finally got around to watching it this one moreso than any other john wick movies felt completely like watching a full game walkthrough no commentary like there were clear levels boundaries tiered henchmen with palette swaps quick time events cutscenes etc 

the most video gamey one nope not the top down shooter view was the car level where cars just kept driving through until john disposed of all the current enemies and the level could go to the next cutscene where they finally stopped driving

edit the choreography is fun as always but in a campy way more this time than any before even though he does a lot of his own stunts keanu still moves like a 60 year old man which is more noticeable in some of the more flexibility or agility requiring movements specifically grappling movements on the ground also i stg no matter how much armor they have or how well equipped they are all the henchmen have the slipperiest soles on their shoes of all time everyone struggles to stand when hit until the moment the current protagonist can get to them",2023-07-24
whyyyyyy couldn’t i handle watching him fall down those 98 flight of stairs and rolling for 23 mins straight uuugh… what a crazy scene lmbooo,2023-07-30

i thought mr nobodys choice of primary weapon was interesting  a takedown tactically modified levergun  i dont recall seeing him reloading i was on a longhaul flight using the ife trying hard to not fall asleep so i may have missed him doing that and it looks like he nearly had a weapon retention issue or two which is one of the arguments against using a longarm in a closequarter situation,2023-09-29

"they didnt even try to sync the music with her fake violin playing 


how nice of these guys to wait a full 30 seconds before following caine into this room so he would have time to set up all his proximity alarms


what gift that one cup of tea and alcohol


so after the tracker interrupted their fight instead of following them caine goes and sits on some random stairs to wait for umeda and ask him where john went not only did caine somehow know that umeda would come this way but also that he told john to go to some train station which umeda also did for no apparent reason


they never say what the tracker needed the money for but apparently this guys entire motivation is to buy a mansion for just himself and his dog


if the marquis really did have all the tables resources at his disposal  he must have forgotten to use them


not a single scratch on the front fender after crashing twice 


who the  designed this clock


for some reason john is on fire when he jumps out of the window maybe he was supposed to have been ignited by the sparkler shotgun but they forgot to shoot it


twelve or nine what",2023-10-19
"a very pretty film that suffers from a fundamental issue  john wick 4 renders john wick 2 and 3 pointless

id just like to take a moment to thank the internet for not spoiling john wicks death the way that it has spoiled every other movie for me,2023-11-27
i enjoyed the movie and characters i didn’t “feel” bill skarsgard’s character unfortunately the accent just seemed so forced and unnatural i loved the  man’s agility i don’t think i have ever seen such grace and fortitude in a bad guy large person,2023-12-25
i have many questions,2023-12-30
"sooo first my guy of 26 yrs watch this multiple times know these movies i watched all the borne movies so ok dont be mad i jumped in at movie three aka i get the geist of the movies but first question was it for his first dog reason then cant he just  the freakin counsel and ask morphis and tell wick to go neo and then bam over next wixk tired he needs to resteat and have a time out and cant he just tell them
i did my duty send him to an island and be left the f alone

ok go i requesting answers and appreciate it",2023-12-30

"i feel like they could have shortened the paris sequence cut a little off the arc like how many times did he beat the guys then more show up keep the entire apartment building bit because holy  that was incredible then shorten the stairs sequence a little

cut it down to 2 and a half hours instead of 250",2023-03-25
i liked the pacing overall but felt there was just a little too much of john fighting his way through paris,2023-03-24

sadly at the stair scene i had to  so bad i was too distracted knew i couldn’t leave  it up rough stuff 4d did not help,2023-03-25
i immediately thought of ken jeong when he said that lol similar appearance to the first hangover movie too,2023-03-26
donnie yen is a  treasure,2023-03-26
i thought it was well paced but the scenes that lingered lingered too long,2023-03-25
i didn’t want it to end ,2023-03-26
i read an article that for every cut or change even as small as 30 seconds they would watch the whole movie again to check for pacing and cohesion,2023-03-30
i didn’t even get the urge to ,2023-04-05
exhausting no bro,2023-04-03
agree i just got out of the movie and too tired to type anything else,2023-04-17
of course its just an opinion but this movie absolutely dragged for me by the end i couldnt wait for it to be done,2023-03-24
the berlin stuff was where it dragged for me if they limited it to the card game and lost all the nightclub stuff i think it would have worked better,2023-03-25
i thought the “” was the worst timed part actually it made the end more exhausting for me,2023-04-29
didnt check the runtime until after and was so surprised it was nearly 3 hours it flew by,2023-10-20
i think he killed at least 400 in this movie  theyre gonna run out of henchmen at this rate ,2023-03-24
guys i dont think 400 was enough we better throw another 400 guys,2023-03-24
well he killed like 299 in the first three films combinedhe had to have killed well over 100 in this film i think were looking at closer to 500,2023-03-24
 theon greyjoy,2023-03-24
i was in a qa with the director and he mentioned that john’s killcount in this chapter is close to 300 not sure if he was ,2023-03-25

the russian mob sent assassins to  john in his home before he ever made a move against them,2023-03-28

i was saying that to myself while watching it too,2023-03-26

good thing they all come in small waves and cannot comprehend that firearms are in fact ranged weapons,2023-04-24
haha you just have to love it ,2023-05-26
i never understood this though wick was such a pushover when they killed his dog and they could’ve easily killed him aswell but then boom he’s the immortal boogie man,2023-06-02
love the statistics like how john has been shot 200 times over the course of the series or something like that,2023-10-20
yeah,2023-12-25
to be fair he was hoping for a sword fight,2023-03-24
im pretty sure he did that just to make wick  one of his last friends,2023-03-29

"there exists an old tradition of duels against the high table  to challenge you must need the blessing of a crime family but if you are labelled excommunicado you must first receive a new crest symbolizing your loyalty to said family

the way the duel was introduced was excellent outside the first film it was probably the best the series has been because it encapsulates the world of the films perfectly johns only way out is to understand the complex and archaic rules that govern the world and as soon as he understands them the rules change seemingly on a whim just when he things hes got de gramont right where he wants him to be de gramont forced caine to fight on his behalf because of his unspoken right to do so thats what made the ending so satisfying when winston tells de gramont how he got it wrong i just wish the film had given him a moment longer to let his mistake sink in",2023-03-25
i really wish caine wasnt blind thats probably my own con with part 4,2023-03-24
somebody just put up a topic about the worldbuilding was inspired by feudalism totally see it in the new movie too,2023-03-24
"theyre making up hightable rules as they go like a playground game of pretend

taking notes from dark souls his name is big hat logan because he has a big hat,2023-03-25
he originally had a more asiansounding name apparently like shang or chang but donnie yen convinced them to change it to make it less stereotypical,2023-03-27
and both are done to perfection,2023-04-02
i actually thought his name being caine was a clever nod to stick from daredevil considering he is also a blind martial arts master then i saw others on here commenting how his name could be a reference to the biblical story of cain and abel since he is tasked to  his brother overall its just another example of how good the worldbuilding in the john wick movies is because even a seemingly simple detail can sometimes only be the tip of the iceberg,2023-04-20

im ok with it,2023-03-26
there was a story recently about how donnie asked to change the name because it was like chang or too stereotypically asian paraphrasing here so i think its funny that they changed it to be a big indicator that caine is blind,2023-03-26
to be fair as was likely pointed out a reference to the character from the bible,2023-03-27
but also because caine is a brother trying to  him,2023-03-29
i honestly didnt even put together the cainecane thing until skarsgaard nominated him for the duel i felt so dumb,2023-03-29
imdb trivia says he was originally called chang but donnie yen suggested the character have a less stereotypical name,2023-03-30
it’s  up his name is caine and they blinded him so once he was free he had to use a cane and was probably reminded of it every time someone called him by his name,2023-04-02

y’all really think he is dead  the last dialogue of  the movie seems to hint at that he is alive,2023-03-26
i originally planned to see it first in dolby but the closest one wasn’t showing it until monday in the dolby cinema so i went to my closest one and saw it tonight loved very minute and will be back to see it in dolby for sure,2023-03-24

absolutely fantastic camera and choreography work,2023-03-24
literally the best action sequence i think i’ve ever seen,2023-03-24
i couldn’t imagine the movie would outdo the paris middleofthestreet fight sequence by that point but my  it absolutely did that entire topdown sequence is an instant classic and will be referenced for years to come in fact this entire movie is an instant classic,2023-03-24
honestly it was a very nice detour from the traditional camera work we were used to seeing the fight scenes conducted i was getting stiff from all the persons eye view onslaught nice to mix in a birds eye view,2023-03-24
to the same music as the most hype scene in the first one night club,2023-03-24
i saw that shot raise up and thought “no  way” and then they proceeded to do it again like that whole shootout was  the last 40 minutes or so my jaw was on the floor,2023-03-24

he was doing great just killing everyone and then hold up lemme just hop outta this building right quick,2023-03-24
that was by far the best scene of the movie the dragons breath rounds really made it extra stand out,2023-03-24
thought they had something good coming after featuring them testing the fire guns but holy shot edit  but shot works too,2023-03-24
i couldn’t believe what was happening when this shot started to elevate up the stairs and then above the floor plan i wish i could have rewound that 100 times in the theater to try to put together what camera rigtechniques they were using really impressive stuff it almost felt like it had to be a small drone with the way it moved,2023-03-24

cannot wait to watch this at home in hdr,2023-03-24
top fight scene in this movie among the top for all the john wick films,2023-03-25
that shot was amazing my other favorite shot was at the arc de triumph the drone orbital while john was shooting circles around a bunch of cars the whole film was a cinematographer’s wet dream i cannot wait to watch it again,2023-03-27
loved that grenade launcher gun the visual of people getting hit with that thing never got old,2023-03-24
it was so  good i really like john wick but ive never loved it until that scene,2023-03-24
reminded me of the hongkong massacre game especially the way the sparks and blood splatters when the enemies get hit,2023-03-24

i love how when john ran through a doorframe he didn’t get behind the corner cause the goons shoot exactly where his head would’ve been right after,2023-03-25
i knew vaguely of this scene and suspected it to be a oner but holy   that was amazing,2023-03-24
it was awesome reminded me of the feeling i had when i first watched the matrix my wife did say it gave her a headache though,2023-03-24
seriously i went o throughout the whole sequence,2023-03-24
"agreed my absolute favorite part of the movie 
paired with the dragons breath albeit not all too realistic was one of the best shots in the entire movie",2023-03-25
i didnt like it at all it looked like a video game in the wrong way a more grouded scene with real props and a drone would have been way better than the  cg used,2023-03-26
i was so beside myself watching that like when youre high and you notice a bunch of  and you look around to your friends questioning are you seeing this too  i was like holy  this is incredible  like between this and the car scene where people are getting hit by cars flipped and shot before they hit the ground i was thinking  i dont deserve this,2023-03-27
that honestly was the best bit of the movie i was so bored of the action before and after that mostly because of the dumb magic suits and double tapping everyone 7  times,2023-03-25
like hotline miami,2024-03-27
chad is a real man,2023-03-24
i hated that scene  it was cool to see it overhead  but i think it was used way too much  i was waiting the whole time for it to go back to showing behind john like the previous movies particularly like they did with the catacombs scene in jw 2  and that flame thrower machine gun that was too overpowered in my opinion,2023-03-25
i was in awe that whole scene  just unreal,2023-03-24
mesmerizing is the word that comes to mind,2023-03-24
so good,2023-03-24
yeah i was blown away by it too as ive never seen a fight scene filmed like this before so cool,2023-03-24
that exact scene elevated the movie up a few points for me videogame aesthetic captured perfectly and not too cheesy,2023-03-24
the flares from that shotgun looked insane,2023-03-24
"top down single take dragons breath rounds 

amazing",2023-03-24
yeah that was an amazing sight scene has any movie done anything similar,2023-03-24
best scene in the film,2023-03-24
the overhead in that stairwell was one of the most interesting shots ive seen in a movie in a long time,2023-03-24
was one of my favorite parts i thought they did it really well,2023-03-24
and it brought back that hype night club shootout music from the first movie as well,2023-03-25
there is a dub step type song that plays during that scene that i would love to know the name of it sounds so familiar,2023-03-25
should check out the hospital clip from hard boiled one of the longest takes out there,2023-03-25
the way he falling from stairs is funny though the marquise bodyguard is kind of disappointing not giving any impact despite appearing and positioning as major obstacle probably the biggest flaw in this movie,2023-03-25
that was my favorite scene in the whole movie i’m not the biggest fan of the john wick films but i loved the cinematography in this one,2023-03-25
just witnessed this now coming out of the theater early contender for favorite movie scene of the year that was so  cool people in my audience were whooping me alongside them,2023-03-26
was is all cgi,2023-03-26
by far the coolest scene i think i’ve ever seen in a action flick with only 1917’s line charge scene being a close second,2023-03-26
legitimately blew my mind i’d never seen anything like it,2023-03-26
it was spectacular a reference to the joh wick hex videogame perhaps i loved they brought the song from john wick 1 for that scene the rave song,2023-03-26
this sequence is my favorite not to mention probably one of the best well put together scenes in an action movie since my second favorite sequence is definitely scott adkins character at the pokerrave club,2023-03-26
felt like i was witnessing some movie history being made,2023-03-26
hotline miami scene,2023-03-26
made me think of that super controversial hatred game just because of the camera angle,2023-03-27
loved that they used the shots fired track from the first movie in that scene,2023-03-27
like a lot of people have said it was very very very hotline miamilooking and so freaking awesome,2023-03-27
i absolutely loved that scene,2023-03-27
best fight in the movie too,2023-03-28
"the best experience of my life fking  great

hail to chad stahelski",2023-03-28
"my girlfriend whos not really into action films absolutely loved it and noticed that it was one take 

sometimes quality is definitely appreciated even if theyre not the target audience",2023-03-29
possibly the most iconic action sequence added with fire spitting shotgun,2023-03-29
"it reminded me of competitive r6 siege with the overhead

absolutely beautiful",2023-03-29
made better by the dragon fire shotty like watching csgo,2023-03-30
yes i loved the way this was filmed i wondered who was going to fall in the hole in the flòor,2023-03-30
i had a  the entire time,2023-03-31
as were the arc de triomphe and the stairs scenes three fantastic set pieces,2023-04-01
yeah the gods eye view is so amazing especially love that in  bill vol 1,2023-04-02
if you watched close he didn’t  them  he tried to incapacitate them,2023-03-24
i like how he doesn’t try to  them in japan yet goes all in against the marquis’ men,2023-03-24
i thought he was planting small bombs  nope just doorbells  brilliant,2023-03-24
i didnt realize those were doorbells when he was first setting them up when the fight started and the first doorbell rang i laughed out loud in the theatre i think i was the only one who did,2023-03-25
my theater lost it during the stair scene too my stomach hurt so much reminded me of the game “getting over it” which is why i laughed hella hard,2023-03-26
i dont know if this was intentional but he lowered his first doorbell my thought was because asians are short,2023-03-27
the oscars really need to introduce a stunt award almost every mainstream movie these days has multiple fight scenes,2023-03-30
i was only disappointed that he didnt pick the doorbells up after he was done so he can potentially use them again elsewhere that would have been an awesome detail,2023-04-15
just watched and all i was thinking during the stairs scene was if i was a stuntdouble for keanu reeves i would have walked off the set after reading that stairs scene in the script lol,2023-05-28
i couldnt stop thinking of the slinky scene from ace ventura when i saw that happen,2023-04-09
that really was some video game  where people would rage quit lol,2023-04-15
removed due to reddit api changes,2023-03-24
the best were back moment,2023-03-26
this fave me major fear the video game vibes where there was a nailgun that had exactly the same physics,2023-03-27
"every jw movie has one of these and its usually relatively early

in jw1 its during the nighttime raid on johns house when he breaks the dudes neck over the edge of his kitchen counter

in jw2 its in the catacombs when he pins the guy down with his shotgun barrel while reloading it then blasts him without even moving

in jw3 its a tie between the library book  and the guy who gets hit with twenty five throwing knives in ten seconds in the knife room scene 

they always sneak one of the best kills in early to make you go oh  here we go",2023-04-23
this one guy in my theatre when crazy when that dude blocked the arrow with his arm and pulled it out,2023-03-28
he took and arrow to the knee,2023-04-16
if we had a killcam after we died that poor ,2023-04-10
donnie was  awesome loved him speaking in cantonese in the berlin club as well hes so slick and agile in that clean getup i was so happy he had so much screentimestory,2023-03-24
my theater went wild on that line 1010 delivery and comedic timing,2023-03-24
"donnie was great

so was hiroyuki sanada",2023-03-24
" marchese

rboneappletea",2023-03-24
that line alone made we wish donnie could be cast in a full on comedy the timing abd delivery of that was absolutely perfect,2023-03-24
donnie yen was so great in the movie for me badass action some great comedic lines and a lot of the dramatic stuff was really good,2023-03-24
loved that and i am klaus with the whip ,2023-03-25
he crushed every line his whole persona and physical acting was awesome i loved his character lights out assholes,2023-03-25
i really loved donnies sassiness in this movie  he usually doesnt get to portray that too often hes usually stoic and tough it really feels like he had a lot of fun in this movie,2023-03-26
canes fighting style was the best,2023-03-25
when you have important work to do and your  boss is micromanaging you,2023-03-25
donne yen was both hilarious and awesome his fight scenes were all great,2023-03-25
"caines line of  to marchese was hilarious donnie killed that role and others

by others do you mean john",2023-03-24
when caine went pokkai ham ka cham the threatres went wild here in singapore,2023-03-26
yeah everyone in my theatre laughed hard at that line and everyone cheered loudly when winston pointed out that john had not shot caine at all,2023-03-28
"best moment was him winding up his punch in the hotel kitchen

and double tapping every  with his sword  donnie yen is a treasure",2023-03-29
he made some great changes to that character by bringing in more humor and sass since apparently originally the character was written more off a stereotypical stoic asian assassin,2023-03-27
"donnie was just incredible all around


it’s wild how grounded they made him as a blind person and avoided going into superhero feats",2023-03-28
donnie is a legend loved every scene he was in,2023-03-26
that was so  appropriate too  if caine was some sort of lacky of marquis thats exactly how i expected caine to react being forced to  a friend,2023-03-27
donnie yen was a  monster in this one every fight scene was so fluid great choice,2023-03-29
i was slightly annoyed to read hes super patriotic to the ccp but i watch him for his acting and not politics so whatever but he does think that hollywood should bend to portraying chinese a certain way,2023-03-29
i loved him and that  dog this movie was spectacular,2023-03-26
he killed it in the berlin raveclub scenes literally and figuratively lol,2023-03-26
it is never a surprise to me when donnie is the best part of whatever movie hes in,2023-03-27
hes honestly so awesome in this i mean ana de armas is cool and all but i honestly hope they would make a spinoff with caine as the main character,2023-04-05
just saw it in theaters what was caine’s other line after kicking  something like “lights out ”,2023-04-08
hopping on this comment why did caine duel wick and not marquis i thought wick and marquis were going to duel,2023-04-08
that was unexpected but long overdue,2023-04-09
i watched in in the theatre yesterday and everyone cracked up laughing at that line ,2023-04-15
how wick knew the marquis would take the final shot,2023-05-09
yeah dunno how many times those guys fell down stairs got tossed and got hit by cars ,2023-03-24
this not once did i think it was another last jedi in the throne room fiasco,2023-03-25
"yeah rip i was sad that they actually filmed a death scene for him 

didn’t think i’d see his character and my boy john die in the same movie",2023-03-24
yeah man that one really hit me,2023-03-24
he passed exactly a week ago today rip lance reddick ,2023-03-24
such is life,2023-03-24
i work in the industry so saw this a few weeks ago when the news about lance broke i had this scene replay in my head nonstop for like two days straight,2023-03-24
i saw it thursday night and had some idiot laugh at that scene and make fun of the fact he died  never felt more enraged but so is life  other than that  that scene and the ending with donnie yen on the steps and the showdown was amazing,2023-03-24
almost cried when he repeated such is life back at winston so fitting that much of the movie is grieving and seeking revenge for his death i did want him to live forever in the franchise though,2023-03-25
wish we had more of him in the movie but it was also fitting considering what happened in real life,2023-03-24
same,2023-03-24
the best part of the movie for me was winston stopping by the painting of charon and repeating his last words,2023-03-25
most likely lance’s final last words on screen  besides the voicelines not used in destiny 2 yet,2023-03-26
makes me wonder if lance felt something was up in his life during filming and spoke to producers that he wasnt planning on participating in potential sequels,2023-03-24
yeah that was a bit tough to watch was glad to see they were able to get in rip in the credits on such short notice,2023-03-26
i was fully expecting him to have just as much of a role as the 3rd movie his character was taken from us too soon and it really made me realise that lance was taken too soon as well,2023-03-25
most likely lance’s final last words on screen  besides the voicelines not used in destiny 2 yet,2023-03-26
most likely lance’s final last words on screen  besides the voicelines not used in destiny 2 yet,2023-03-26
one of the cons of the movie is how brief his role his knowing what we know now,2023-03-26
 no i,2023-03-27
i also follow another ip where lances character delivers a eulogy of sortsthen to see him die in this film that hurtrest i peace lance,2023-03-31
fr rip,2023-04-01
"at the same time i do think they lucked out and that will the best we get for a proper goodbye and vengeance if his character was still alive theyd have the issue star wars had with carrie fisher as sad as it is to see charon  lance gone at least they didnt mary poppins that 

idk how they added it in post so quickly or maybe they somehow pushed an update to theaters but at the end of the movie after the post credits there was a in memory to lance reddick i think it was very nice of them to add that in",2023-04-03
charon dying is when i knew winston wasnt going to betray john again dude was furious,2023-04-05
long live the king,2023-04-27
only thing john can’t  the vibe,2023-03-24
the drivers in paris too lol,2023-03-24
it’s a berlin nightclub run by a gangster  they obviously hand out molly at the door,2023-03-25
that whole scene ,2023-03-26
"oh boy theyre doing berlin i wonder what the set piece will be 

oh fetish dance club should have known",2023-03-25
i’m glad i wasn’t the only one to notice that ,2023-03-24
last night a dj saved my life,2023-03-25
that entire thing i felt wasn’t really needed lol they were all like professional dancers in the background and the penguin mf didn’t need to be there lol,2023-03-26
are people forgetting the 3rd movie where people are brutally stabbed in the middle of grand central terminal and no one reacts,2023-03-28
"i was watching that scene when i created a fan theory

are people that universe’s dance clubs because they’re also killers  part of that society ",2023-03-26
,2023-03-25
he was using water guns,2023-08-26
power of molly,2023-05-12
its an alternate universe where you either go to secondary school or become a hitman that was just another tuesday night to the people in the roundabout,2023-03-24
the berlin scene people would see john put an axe in a guys head and keep dancing i loved it,2023-03-24
i haven’t seen a cop in these movies since the second one,2023-03-24
there’s a moment when a van slides sideways and john is slammed into it immediately after that there’s a wider shot as he’s getting up where you can see into the van and… there’s no driver the driver’s side door isn’t even open like the driver decided to flee there’s just no one period weirdly in any other movie i’d be annoyed yet the way civilian existence is treated in these movies is just one piece of the charm,2023-03-24
i think you kind of just get used to it when 23 of the population are assassins,2023-03-24
my girlfriend said it’s like a fighting game background ,2023-03-25
saw a tweet which said that john wick is about the secret world of the fae folk who can choose to not be perceived by regular people they were joking but the more i watch these films the more it begins to make sense,2023-03-24
"dancers became less aware of danger as the series progressed

in john wick 1 the club dancers freaked out when john started to execute bodyguards right beside them

in 2 the crowd at the castle party cheered when john started killing people

in 4 john was burying axes in heads and the dancers didnt even react",2023-03-26
the john wick movies run on video game logic the civilians in these movies are pretty much are like the npcs in gta,2023-03-25
they were hilarious in a fun way at one point there was a woman directly facing john gyrating floating and vibing in happy bliss while john put faces through the floor,2023-03-24
their sudden decision to get scared and run made no sense but was absolutely hilarious,2023-03-25
grand theft auto 5 has better crowd reactions,2023-03-25
remember that in this world literally everyone is a hitman except john wick’s dead wife,2023-03-29
"the berlin nightclub had me in stitches small groups would just freeze in place like gta npcs when you start shooting just cowering with their hands above their heads standing still 

also a shootout in front of one of the most popular tourist attractions in the most tourist filled city in the world at sunrise bro there would be road sweepers everywhere the market would be setting up just down the road it’s so silly but you can enjoy it because they lean so far into how silly it is",2023-03-25
especially the people at the rave lol,2023-03-24
"paris pd when theres a companysized criminal underground engagement in their streets i sleep

paris pd when a protester throws a bottle real ",2023-03-25
i have a theory to this it seems 75 of the world’s population is employed as assassins and 10 work in assassinrelated fields like operators concierges etc that leaves 15 of people who are  to seeing assassins killing people that they just arent phased by it anymore,2023-03-29
"they’re just filling a movie dude 

happens all the time in new york",2023-03-25
"there are no civilians in the john wick universe  literally everyone is a secret assassin waiting to be called up on a job    

this film is just more evidence for the fan theory that this is just a different iteration of the matrix and the table is the machines method of control in this version",2023-03-29
the entire night club sequence i wondered what kind of drugs would cause these people to keep dancing while jw be killing them mfs next to them,2023-04-22
yeah that was the main thing that annoyed me it gets progressively worse in each movie heck that roundabout scene shouldve created a traffic immediately,2023-04-24
throughout the years i have never been sure if this was a conscious decision we were supposed to notice or just a consequence of filming on location in massive world class cities,2023-03-25
pretty sure all the rave folks were on drugs in story don’t know about the drivers in paris though,2023-03-27
this is why there needs to be an oscar for stunts,2023-03-27
they do react thopeople dispersed a few times in the sequels when they realize what is happening and people in the nightclub were visibly horrified when they noticed lol,2023-03-27
it felt like the background to a street fighter level,2023-03-28
"this is not our world so i accept it for what it is 

but at least people in the night club were actually reacting to it with some level of disgust theyre not scared cause they know they wont get targeted i assume but they didnt like what was going on",2023-03-29
quality storytelling,2023-03-30
"regular people dont exist in their universe

during the roundabout scene a car smashes into a van and the drivers seat in the van is immediately empty no civilian running to safety an empty seat and a still closed door",2023-04-01
i dunno parisians really do just drive like that,2023-04-02
lol came in for this that club scene where everybody was dancing while a gunfight ensues two feet from them was hilarious,2023-04-02
well the director is a stuntman he knows,2023-04-04
lol fr when they were in berlin i kept watching the people in the background thinking “why are you still dancing” eventually they started showing some people reacting towards the end,2023-04-09
they have given into total nihilism in a world of just death and destruction you might as well keep dancing,2023-06-04
thats because the whole john wick series takes place within the matrix series and they are npcs,2023-06-04
all i could think was wow these folks really don’t understand germanfrench anti terrorist forces response times,2023-06-09
the storytelling sucks its not even secondary to the action its not even relevant or needed at all ive seen all 4 and have no idea what the idea of the plot of any of them are its keanu reeves shooting and kicking a  tone of people thats all,2023-07-11
"at some point i was like theres never any cops showing up then at some point during the massacre on the way to the duel seriously no cops yet at all

could argue that in this universe cops keep an ear on underworld radio and know to stay the  away when a millions dollar bounty goes up",2023-08-05
they took away that attachment in mwii a few weeks ago john demonstrated why they had to nerf it,2023-03-25
other than the red circle in jw1 that was the best sequence in the franchise,2023-03-28
it was incredible but i wish they’d had a bit more variety in weapons so that john wasn’t able to just blow each person away in one shot,2023-03-24
now we gonna see copies like how we see hallway shots now,2023-03-29
what’s actually badass is that the shotgun used with the dragons breath rounds was specifically designed for the movie,2023-04-02
" let me guess 5 of a kind was a funny line

what did john say in response to that i missed it",2023-03-25
marquis was surprisingly good the whole ego driven desire to be the guy who took down wick definitely brought a refreshing flair to his character,2023-03-27
‘you dead yet john’ was so tense,2023-03-31
the way donnie yen was hyper stabbing people with his sword  on the ground just awesome,2023-03-27
i liked “nobody” but i have to ask what was his deal at the end of the film he just got no money and let everyone go,2023-04-03
i dont get how the audience can hear john breathing but the world class blind assassin cant,2023-03-28
i think they left it ambiguous intentionally i have a feeling lionsgate will want to milk this franchise and might push for a 5th but i really kind of want john wick to just be at peace and end on a high note,2023-03-24
i’d like for him to be dead because this felt like a good send off for the character,2023-03-24
i’d guess he’s still alive  faking his death would be the only real way for him to stay gone without someone coming for him     but i’m completely fine with him being dead it was never going to be a good end for mr wick,2023-03-24
"i read a theory somewhere that  it looks like he was shot in the same “safe places” as where he shot the doctor in the last one

and even the final scene made it look ambiguous so that they can either end it there or choose to do jw5 later on",2023-03-24
he asked for his tombstone to say john loving husband not john wick loving husband in a different part of the movie they talked about how john wick is a killer and john is the person who has a peaceful life in a movie where symbols are so important i dont think this is just a coincidence a tombstone for john wick just means he really quit and he is john now,2023-03-25
"the dog perking up felt oddly like a way to show a scene in 5 with john watching 

at the same time keanu is 60 cant have him doing this forever what he did for this alone is incredible",2023-03-25
i think it’s a fake out it’s a good ending but i think they pull a nick fury after winter solider fake death so he can chill,2023-03-25
dont see him buried when asked where he went who knows i think john wick the name is dead as a man he just got rushed to a secret hospital,2023-03-25
i think its up to the opening weekend numbers if theyre high john is alive if theyre not  which i doubt  then this is the finale and it would be a great finale,2023-03-24
"at the end winston said where do you think he is heaven or 

and a part of me feels like heaven and  are probably the names of two places in the jw universe it would fit so perfectly",2023-03-27
i dont think theres any chance hes actually dead but that doesnt mean well see him again ballerina doesnt count because its set before this,2023-03-24
the high table still existsjohn will return,2023-03-25
"hes not dead

just dead",2023-03-24
next one has prequel written all over it,2023-03-25
i went to an 1145 showing this morning and it was packed,2023-03-26
"i wish they’d just let him and the franchise die a hero’s death  i don’t see a chapter 5 being as good tbh

i’d think maybe they do a prequel of sorts only way i see this retaining a similar level of quality then you gotta contend with kr’s age",2023-04-01
bro  nah john wicks story has ended i would really hate it if a john wick 5 was ever even thought of,2023-04-01
depends on the money they can make if this does well projections look good they will make another one down the road,2023-03-24
"after that fall off the waterfall in the club onto his back on a concrete bar i can only conclude john wick is a kryptonian and can survive pretty much anything

like say a 4 storey dive onto a van and then cobbles",2023-03-27
he needs to finish killing the high table,2023-03-29
john is 100 dead  it has been confirmed by both the director and reeves,2023-03-26
i dont think the harbinger would have concluded the duel if he didnt know that wicks wound was fatal which given the nature of how this universe works is a safe bet he knew,2023-03-24
if they bring back john that would invalidate his entire 4 movie arc after returning to his old life in the first the next two films were solely about him being able to live and die as a loving husband rather than a legendary assassin it would make no sense to have him live he earned his greatest prize and got everything his character wanted,2023-03-25
he’s not dead,2023-03-28
i don’t think that he is i would think he would try to end the high council once and for all seems like an odd way to build 4 movies into him just getting his freedom and dying i think there are plans for spinoffs so i can imagine a team being built maybe john mentoring them and then they go towards the high council,2023-03-25
i saw a speculation where his tombstone represents him finally being free he may still be alive,2023-03-26
the next one could be “the legend of john wick” or something maybe prequels or maybe a new guy trying to live up to his legacy who knows,2023-03-26
i’d say 100 saw an interview from keanu and director they both insisted that the character are honest,2023-03-26
i hope theres one more movie where its revealed john wick faked his death to go after the high table or become a member of the high table plus he deserves a love interest and get closure as a widower,2023-03-26
i think it’s time to let him go as a fan i want peace for his character,2023-03-26
"i assumed he wasn’t cause at the grave the dog kept looking off to the side

it could have just been where the trainer was off screen but i’m assuming it’s because the dog smelled wick lurking",2023-03-27
i think a 5th is already greenlit,2023-03-27
i say nil,2023-03-29
i thought he was pretty dead and it was a suitable ending according to imdb most audiences at the opening thought he was still alive,2023-03-31
idk winston saying “who knows” and bk laughing his  off makes me think they’re at least leaving it ambiguous,2023-04-07
think hes gonna be benched during a few spin offs and maybe return after a while,2023-04-10
"well if john wick 5 never comes out and it doesnt turn out that he faked his death as an act of deception against his remaining enemies i will be extremely and bitterly disappointed and  off what master assassin doesnt fake his death at least once

x200b

i figure he has to come back and stop that girl from killing caine idk thats what i half expected",2023-06-20
it’s such an amazing line,2023-03-24
the way you do anything is the way you do everything was also a great line,2023-03-26
that line and the line in the church about his wife not hearing him chefs kiss,2023-03-25
its another form of fairweather friends quite a common saying but so well delivered,2023-03-25
"when i heard that line it immediately brought to mind a better one  


a good friend will help you move but a true friend will help you move a body",2023-03-28
i went to see this movie with my best buddy we looked at each other and nodded when he said that phrase this movie is full of amazing motivational phrases… man it’s been a while since i left a movie theater as satisfied as with john wick chapter iv,2023-03-25
"i liked it too 

it sounds like its something the person believes but they prove otherwise instantly",2023-03-24
this reminds me of tolkiens faithless is he that says farewell when the road darkens,2023-03-30
was one of my favorite lines in the movie too,2023-03-27
lots of great lines in this one surprisingly my favorite was from shimazu when he said the fool talks the cowards are silent and the wise man listens,2023-05-24
a friend in need is a friend indeed i dont think i got the meaning of this saying until i heard it phased that way in the movie,2023-04-16
thank you for the reminder best line ,2023-03-29
that was the line i will always remember,2023-04-03
that was so good my other favorite line dont presume to tell me about a man ive known longer than youve been alive,2023-06-18
that and how you do anything is how you do everything,2023-05-23
when he grabbed the pencil and tucked it into his pocket i could feel the  hairs on the back of my neck going woo woo woo,2023-03-24
i really liked that they made caine likable  because of his and johns mutual respect especially the  magnificent team up to get john up the stairs  you could not want either one of them to die and thats where it was headed  also that cheeky little hand stab cmon gotta love caine  loved how they sorta escaped the scenario of having to  each other i didnt want a huge fight i wanted them to get through this as brothers somehow,2023-03-26
a  pencil ,2023-03-24
tony robbins ,2023-03-24
spanish tony robbins,2023-04-22
i was thinking maybe john learned that from him,2023-05-30
saved his life in the end,2023-03-25
i wouldnt mind a spin off with nobody as the main character seemed like a pretty decent guy at the end of the day and he had a good deal of charisma too,2023-03-28
i was wondering if that character was supposed to be halle berry in some version of the script,2023-04-09
its such a great jw scene a save the dog scene in another series will serve its purpose of aw theyre not so bad but in this series its like a calling card for the entire character and the tracker knew exactly who jw is in that moment,2023-08-05
"for me it was japan 

but then the arc de triomphe 

but then the house

but then the stairs 

but then the duel 

so… nearly every longer major action scene 

the only extended battle setpiece that didn’t hit like an alltimer for me was the berlin nightclub and even still that was a hugely entertaining scene

i think japan was the best overall though because of how many different things were happening and each done so well",2023-03-24
the dragon’s breath rounds were so cool and he kept grabbing clips off the dead dudes,2023-03-24
"same it’s hard to pick one each action sequence feels different and could easily be the highlight of any other action movie 

osaka has the best aesthetic along with the most amount of weapons used including swords guns bows knives and even nunchuck 

fighting in the middle of night traffic in paris feels the most creative incorporating cars and oncoming traffic into a shoot out and hand to hand combat makes the fight feel brutal

shooting indoors with the overhead hotline miami cam is the most videogame like and something we didn’t know we need in a john wick movie 

the stairs fight is the most badass as we finally see john wick and caine teamed up it’s the moment they built up the entire movie my theater cheered when caine showed up and helped john up the stairs 

the final duel is the most stressful and tense but also satisfying at the end 

the only action sequence that felt “meh” in this movie was the berlin club scene still a good sequence but the previous movies did club scenes better the rest of the action sequences are easily some of the best we have seen in the john wick franchise and action movies in general",2023-03-24
"the fluid shifts from thst top down back down to closeups and then back up fro the ceiling was incredible

during some similar shots in malginant they actually adapted an nfl stadium camera wire rig to zoom around i wonder if something similar was used here",2023-03-24
if i remember right once he picks up the dragons breath shotgun and we dont have music i think just hearing the burst of flames and sparks was just a beauty to watch,2023-03-24
im never going to forgettop down single take dragons breath rounds,2023-03-24
the  topdown view of the apartment is legitimately the coolest sequence in any action movie ever its 100 hotline miami,2023-03-25
that was one of my favorite action sequences of all time the way they transitioned to top down was super fly and the single take was just a cherry on the top this is why i love this franchise so much,2023-03-25
that hotline miami  was  great,2023-03-25
the hotline miami scene has got to be my favorite action scene ive seen in a long time it was just amazing,2023-03-26
felt like i was watching irl hotline miami,2023-03-25
for me it was the comically long scene of everyone getting hit by an equally comical amount of cars,2023-03-27
this,2023-03-24
nothing ever topped the ninjas on motorcycles from 3 for me but it was amazing the single take being up there with the best wick sequences,2023-03-26
that was exactly my thoughts watching it literally holy  this is awesome i just wish they showed more donnie yen,2023-03-29
do we know it was single take keanu was hidden by doorways several times a cut could be hidden,2023-04-02
for me its gotta be those stairs the symbolism the emotional high and low of him reaching the top only to be kicked all the way to the bottom,2023-04-10
its the nunchucks and gun combo fight for me  freaking nunchucks man,2023-10-15
but if you want it to be transcendent dont stop there go for a single take overhead action sequence,2023-03-24
i love how he sets one guy on fire in the kitchen he runs out of the room and runs straight into the next room still on fire i might add only to get shot by john again that made me chuckle,2023-03-25
each one of those shots launched the man like 5 feet back,2023-03-24
i knew those guys gonna give it to wick instead of using to  him lol,2023-03-24
dragons breath would have made gigli nominated for best picture,2023-03-28
the sweeping atmospheric music when introducing the osaka continental really set the tone too,2023-03-24
"the wide hourglass shot when the marquis was scolding winston was fantastic the dialogue is happening on the left side of the screen but just like the characters your eye is drawn to the right side to look at how much sand is left

brilliant shot",2023-03-25
when that cherry blossom scene came on i was like thats gonna be my wallpaper when a hires version comes out absolutely beautiful,2023-03-26
when the opening scene had the homage to lawrence of arabia  fishburne blowing out the match smash cut to the desert sunrise i knew the cinematographer was going to be swinging for the fences,2023-03-26
yeah i definitely need to customize my hue lights to an osaka rooftop color scheme,2023-03-26
"for me it was the scene with all the large piece with winston walking through it also the eiffel tower scene where they talked terms 

absolutely beautiful",2023-03-29
gave me arisaka cyberpunk vibes john wick capped it off,2023-03-29
that’s exactly what i said in the theater such a glorious yet delicate shot,2023-03-27
how about caine after he throws the flashbang and poses like bane while saying “lights out” top notch,2023-06-24
that whole act was aesthetic af,2023-08-05
that scene if it wasnt in a jw movie felt like it could have been in austin powers or  gun he just kept rolling and rolling then when he stopped it started again,2023-03-24
reminded me of hot rod,2023-03-24
him rolling down the stairs was the new keep on being slammed into glass containers from the 3rd movie,2023-03-24
call back to kung fu panda,2023-03-24
"i really want to know how people felt about the stairs i chuckled and my theater laughed but i couldnt tell if it was supposed be funny or it was just awkward then right back in to a serious fight important to the plot moments before the most important fight of the movie 

i didnt hate it but it didnt feel right either",2023-03-26
we wondered out loud why he walked down the stairs in the end scenes because he clearly doesnt have a problem with bouncing down them,2023-03-25
kung fu panda vibes,2023-03-25
my whole theater loved that moment i was in years  it was perfect,2023-03-26
whoever his stuntman was hope they paid him well,2023-03-25
cars are also a strong contender,2023-03-24
i was expecting some gimmicks to that fight like rolling things down the stairs or handcuffing him to weights to slow him down,2023-03-25
getting over it with john wick,2023-03-25
it was like in jw3 where got kicked into the glass like 6 times in a row,2023-03-26

needs more stair master sessions,2023-03-24
john wick and the kung fu panda have something in common,2023-03-25
so relatable i have vertigo,2023-03-25
"who knew john wicks biggest foe was going to be stairs

the films are not subtle when it comes to metaphors",2023-03-25
"we saw this in 4dx or whatever where the seats move and vibrate with hits

that stair fall was long ",2023-03-27
wasnt there a scene like this in jw eb when he was fighting the bodyguard of the lady who killed herself in the bathroom,2023-03-30
snake eater music starts playing in my mind,2023-03-30
hes just like all of us,2023-10-15
i was at montmartre a few weeks ago and those steps are really steep the little flat sections arent very big so its somewhat plausable that if you had enough momentum youd keep on rolling,2023-10-30
lol seeing him tumble down those stairs multiple times was as funny as him getting thrown through glass time after time in the 3rd installment,2024-02-03
"that talk between him and yen in the church was a really nice little scene amongst all the chaos and gunfire

do you think she can hear you

no

then why bother

maybe im wrong

its justa very real conversation in such an overthetop world",2023-03-24
anyone else see the dog perk up at the end like as if john wasnt really six feet under,2023-03-24
"i really wanted that security guy to  this dog and then nobody would understand why john wick has done what he did and then we have an entire nobody 1 2 3 4 chapters haha   


but i am glad they showed john choosing to save the dog",2023-03-24
when john told them that he wanted loving husband on his grave i knew he was going to die at the end well i was pretty sure if the boogeyman is scared then you know  serious also foreshadowing,2023-03-26
"i knew he was going to save the dog

it was bound to happen and im glad it did i think it was good that the death of a dog got him back into the business and saving one got him out",2023-04-06
with how they were making john confront the morality of his actions and where his path is leading i was scared he would be forced to  the dog and become the very thing he hated,2023-03-27
john wick being the babayaga and the baddest man around but also saving a man’s dog because he knows that no one should have to go through that pain…,2023-03-29
"this scene is powerful af it hit me in the feels and it was unexpected for what should be an action movie

i dont believe there is an afterlife but i take great comfort in knowing that i might be wrong i really fully realized this is the reason until john  wick 4 of all movies",2023-04-01
"i knew he was going to save the dog

the filmmakers of this franchise killed one dog in the first movie and they spent the rest of the franchise featuring good doggos and not killing them thats what i call a good redemption arc lol",2023-05-24
he doesnt know she cant hear him nobody does thats the ending of the conversation on that topic,2023-03-24
he believes she cant hear him but he still has hope no one can know one way or the other no matter insufferable one might be about their belief or lack of it,2023-10-15
mine too  and the stairs,2023-03-24
the dog  got the biggest laugh in my theatre,2023-03-24
the delivery on that line was perfection donnie yen killed it,2023-03-24
donnie delivered the most hilarious lines in the movie my favorite was “john are you dead”,2023-03-25
the dog peeing got a huge laugh in our audience,2023-03-26
that line got me to laugh out loud watching alone at home it immediately made me wish i had seen it in theaters for the audience reaction,2023-05-30
252 steps in 2 maybe 3 minutes while taking down a dozen men with caine and nobody,2023-03-24
i love that they showed john was fit conditioned and recovered before beginning this juggernaut run of violence,2023-03-24
the fact that he’s almost 60 is absolutely mind boggling,2023-03-25
i’m not gonna lie i chuckled when he rolled down the stairs and kept rolling and rolling and rolling lol,2023-03-24
" rina sawayama had a great debut

i agree i personally a little iffy when a singermusician debut their acting on a feature film but she was pretty good and had a great screen presence",2023-03-24
the way winston talked so demandingly to the french guy insisting he must accept this duel and the guy begrudgingly consenting made me think perhaps winston was secretly part of the high table and that he had some sort of personal vendetta against them but couldnt do it himself thats why he was always rooting for john,2023-03-24
" audience were shocked and winced when john wick rolled down the stairs 

is it bad i laughed hysterically reminded me of that scene in hot rod",2023-03-24
my theater was roaring when he fell down the stairs shout out hot rod,2023-03-24
" rina sawayama had a great debut i am more interested in her character than the ballerina spinoff

100 at least it would feel earned

for ballerina they just know people like ana from no time to die so took an obscure character from jw3 and recast her to have her own story bizarre",2023-03-24
i half expected rina to be the new concierge at the rebuilt continental,2023-03-24
" rina sawayama had a great debut i am more interested in her character than the ballerina spinoff

 yes give her standalone movie",2023-03-25
i agree about charron given the events of 3 i sort of thought wed see a little more of him this time especially considering riddicks recent death my only real gripe about the movie is how quickly it dispatched one its more enigmatic characters there was a story to be told there that now never can be,2023-03-25
i thought the falling down the stairs was absolutely hilarious,2023-03-24
i 100 agree with being more interested in akiras character than the ballerina spin off but disagree on the final shot after 3hrs of listening to that horrible french accent that death was not satisfying,2023-03-26
i love that john wick didnt do a lot of nunchunk flourishing and fanciness just economy of motion and maximum beatdownexcept you have to flourish at least once just because,2023-03-24
" audience were shocked and winced when john wick rolled down the stairs all the way to start

my theatre were groaning and chuckling because at that point it was impossible to tell if it was parody or not",2023-03-25
" rina sawayama had a great debut i am more interested in her character than the ballerina spinoff

same far more interested honestly not sure about that after credit scene though killing off caine would feel so cheap after this super satisfying ending",2023-03-26
rina sawayamas akira is so  awesome i want to see her in a solo movie,2023-03-26
" audience were shocked and winced when john wick rolled down the stairs all the way to start 

when i saw it everybody just laughed to be honest it was a little too goofy for me he just kept rolling",2023-03-25
"killing the elder felt like a leftover plotline from the 3rd movie

honestly this seems onbrand for the series movie 2 opens with john getting back his car a leftover from movie 1
movie 3 opens with john running away after getting excommunicado a leftover plotline from movie 2",2023-03-31
theres a topic about how this movie relates to feudalism the op made a theory about what the studio next and it would give rina a majot role so fingers crossed he was right,2023-03-24
i can’t think of another franchise that had 4 films be consistently great other then the mad max films or arguably the majority of mcu in that case it’s mostly solid crowd pleasers with a great movie in between in john wick’s case there was no weak film in the quadrilogy just masterpiece after masterpiece what a way for the character and films to end on a high note,2023-03-25
i was hoping him to stop rolling because the time is limited but according to physics he has to keep rolling lol,2023-03-25
and winstons what a thrill moment cant forget that beast,2023-03-25
the watchers in my theater and myself included had a good laugh when he rolled down the stairs obviously a lot of insane stuff has happened in this franchise but watching jw roll down a set of stairs for 30 seconds straight cracked me up,2023-03-26
" audience were shocked and winced when john wick 

i just watched it today and the whole theater laughed

that was too ridiculous it has to be comedic",2023-03-27
that stairs sequence was incredible  he just kept going  the stunt work in that scene is astounding  my ribs hurt just watching it,2023-03-29
i felt bad i couldn’t stop laughing as he rolled down the stairs,2023-03-27
"him killing the elder is why they sent pennywise after him so it makes sense it happens first 

really want to know why the previous actor didn’t return",2023-03-27
when the overhead scene was happening my wife whispered to me “this movie would make a pretty cool video game like the ones you have” lol,2023-03-28
my entire theater laughed when he inexplicably kept rolling down the stairs i enjoyed most of the movie but that was so dumb,2023-03-31
"winced

in my cinema everyone laughed",2023-04-01
"2nd act is probably the weakest as it had to lay a lot of exposition

yeah my adhd flaired up real bad around this part   especially since ive only seen the first one before",2023-04-09
it kinda looked like reddick had scheduling issues so his role was less in the new film pretty sure he was filming a few other things like resident evil when they were shooting this though i would have liked to seen more of him in the movie they made charons death have weight giving winston more motivation to seek revenge,2023-04-10
" audience were shocked and winced when john wick rolled down the stairs all the way 

my theater was roaring with laughter  i mean come on what a payoff after climbing all those steps thats some physical comedy right there",2023-04-17

what a perfect parisfrench connection too",2023-03-24
gesaffelstein at the arc and crystal method in the top down segment too,2023-03-24
i was kinda hoping for kaleidathinkfrom the first movie spa sequence to make an appearance again that song was so perfect for the silent takedowns as hes making his way through the guards,2023-03-24
man i loved how this movie was like a homage to the previous three films so chilling,2023-03-24
also got dreams by zhunero as when akira and wick are fighting the marquises men,2023-03-24
" genesis from justice

thats what it was thank you it wrinkled my brain",2023-03-25
as soon as that first beat hit from the gesaffelstein song i was so hyped,2023-03-25
i recognized the song as justice immediately got me so hyped,2023-03-26
i was thinking “the music supervisor has to be my age” because there were so many pivotal songs from my life lol,2023-03-25
osaka song was really good too dreams by nero and zhu i first listened to it last year when i saw nero live so it was a cool surprise to see it in the movie,2023-03-26
was that edith piaf in the subway scene,2023-03-25
dont forget they even put gessalfensteins banger hate or glory,2023-03-26
yeah they nailed it perfectly fit with the german and paris setting lost my  when i heard gesaffelstein,2023-03-26
" another one was gesaffelstein  hate or glory  
",2023-03-27
we finally made “paint it black” cool again,2023-03-26
as a big justice fan it made so much sense given the setting,2023-03-25
there’s also a nero track during the osaka fight but i’m forgetting which one,2023-03-26
a john wick movie was the absolute last place i expected to hear new tribe pumping,2023-03-25
zhu le castlevania and gesaffelstein too it was so good,2023-03-27
as a justice fan i  loved to hear genesis in this so good man,2023-03-31
they also threw in rl grime in the osaka fight,2023-03-26
i was surprised and pleased to hear zhunero,2023-03-27
" dreams by zhu

i thought i heard carptaner brut but there isnt",2023-03-27
"i was like that is so familiar

instantly recognized it as genesis what a great soundtrack",2023-03-29
dreams by nero ,2023-04-09
it was good but there was no need to remake paint it black  the original version is better imo and more energetic,2023-03-28
lets also mention rezz gets his moment during the dragon breath scene,2023-03-29
i have had most of the main action tracks in this film blasting at some point such a good selection,2023-03-26
someone else noticed it i turned to my fiends and pointed out that they used that song in the first one and no one understood,2023-03-27
i  knew that was genesis i could almost just hear it because of the gun shots lol,2023-03-29
i felt like each one of those shots where he was walking through lighting to music was setting the tone how his character went from retirement to the 4th horseman,2023-03-30
i got so hyped when i recognized genesis i think hate or glory by gesaffelstein was playing during the arc de triomphe scene too,2023-04-09
my man was having an absolute scenery buffet,2023-03-24
it was the action movie equivalent of the whale,2023-03-24
i wasn’t sure it was him until he did his signature spin kick,2023-03-25
his character was absolutely amazing the club scene felt like an homage to the first film and the music was like a reimagined john wick mode from chapter 2  literally boss battle music and he just wouldnt go down,2023-03-24
he did such a great job he really looked like one of those rare fit  guys who can  you up,2023-03-24
"hollywood in general has been sleeping on scott adkins as an actormartial artist for far too long

killa is his best role since yuri boyka",2023-03-26
that was  scott jesus man,2023-03-24
it was nice in how they fooled people into thinking he wasn’t able to fight wick then kicked his  for quite a bit,2023-03-24
he would make a good kingpin for a spiderman movie,2023-03-24
i  lost it when he busted out that roundhouse kick,2023-03-26
i was a bit sad that seeing scott being  and asthmatic and running away from john but when he decided to throw down i was pleasantly suprised he is depicted to be superior in fighting skills than even john wick,2023-03-25
yea scott adkins deserves an award for this role,2023-03-25
when i first saw the guy i thought what an oddly shaped man then i became surer and surer that it was a  suit,2023-03-25
"i called him    it was in berlin he was sweaty with a bowl haircut

and his gold teeth flashed like a tiny moustache

i enjoyed the  out of seeing   get wick’d

be seeing you never",2023-03-24
props to him for doing those roundhouses in the  suit  i say that as a leaner man sitting here eating a whole bag of chips and can barely kick past my waist,2023-03-26
my man fought better than myers  ,2023-03-25
"the purple suit is a reference to sammo hung in a hong kong film named  zone starring donnie yen who plays caine in jw4

when i saw the case rundown and saw scott adkins i was like what when now i’m reading this and get it haha,2023-03-25
is that who he played i saw his name on the credits and wonder which role he played,2023-03-26
his character reminds me of the kingpin from marvel comics,2023-03-26
all i could think of was bob from tekken so quirky but so good,2023-03-26
loved that dude big fighting game character energy,2023-03-27
im positive they watched the batman that whole sequence felt like john wick chasing down the penguin in his nightclub,2023-04-01
you cant fool me that was bob from tekken,2023-03-26
he felt fully like a batman type villain and was a blast,2023-04-03
i love that they had to put scott in a  suit almost as if to even the odds  scott adkins is legit,2023-04-27
holy  i had no idea that was scott until now,2023-03-26
that’s billy zane to you,2023-03-26
"holy  i had no idea it was him 

im always excited to see him in blockbusters but can never recognize him poor guy",2023-03-29
it was scott adkins hahahahah,2023-03-29
truly i loved the club sequence scott adkins  nailed it and the athmosphere cheff kiss i loved that the peolple keep dancing and the fight in “the rain” felt like matrix,2023-04-01
it was scott adkins,2023-04-04
i commented to my friend who i watched it with about how impressed i was with the actor playing that character ive seen big people move like that before sammo hung was my example but its rare and impressive then i get into this thread and realise it was  scott adkins in a  suit,2023-05-08
"i knew adkin was in the moviebut i didnt expect him to be in a  suit and the entire time i kept thinking  i cant believe they got this fit af martial artist known for doing bad  fight scens to just run and get killed without fighting the entire time john was walking after him 

and then they fought and it was brilliant",2023-05-23
yo,2023-03-26
that was scott adkins i saw his name in the credits and but couldn’t place and kept starring at that character like “i know your face but from where,2023-04-01
everything was perfect about the movie if im nitpicking its that i wish adkins had marko zarorchidis role i wanted more screen time with adkins im guessing he had to be nerfed fatasthmatic otherwise he would have dominated even as killa he gave wick a very good fight,2023-04-02
that was incredible,2023-04-05
i had no idea who he was and as soon as he started kicking i was cracking up,2023-05-25
i’ll be honest i really thought it was ben affleck,2023-05-25
his role reminded me of the argentinian goalkeeper emi martinez,2023-05-27
was he forcesensitive again,2023-03-24
kinda love and hate that hollywood had to nerf donnie by making him blind a second time,2023-03-25
he is so crazy quick it was super entertaining,2023-03-25
john and him fighting up the stairs was amazing  i wish we could have seen the three brothers fight together and not each other,2023-03-25
if i had a penny for each time donnie yen plays a blind man with formidable hand to hand combat skills while being a crack shot with guns id have two pennies but it is weird that it happened twice,2023-03-25
was glad he got to wing chun machine gun fist somebody too,2023-03-26
i love how he combined clumsy motion with precision lethality,2023-03-28
him being blind took me out of the movie i can buy his blind fighter character in star wars because of the force but john wick is supposed to be real world how the  is a blind man supposed to be successful as an assassin,2023-03-29
i love the little heart stabs he does at the end of each   boop boop,2023-03-26
the stuff early on in the kitchen was beautiful,2023-03-25
hes so  fast it makes you think k oh ,2023-03-30
if i had a penny for every time donnie yen played a blind badass in a big blockbuster i would have two pennies which isnt much but its weird that it happened twice,2023-03-26

his glitter suit got a laugh in my theater,2023-03-24

" bill skarsgaard even ties his tie like a 

in the museum scene he ties a van wijk knot

the magnesium shotgun was such a cool looking effect i was surprised to find out it was a real thing and yet id somehow never seen it in an action movie before,2023-03-29
"that actions is visually stunning but the choreography is disappointing time and time again we see john fighting two guys finishes them then another two guys come around the corner repeat 4 or 5 times and he goes into another room where the same thing happens

i feel hollywood should have found a solution to this problematic trope its so tiring its at a point where i focus more on the guys in the background than in the foreground because its hilarious to see what they are forced to do in order to be filler until the direction compels them back into the foreground i literally saw one goon waiting his turn to take a swing then when he did he literally punched the air 4 feet away from wick so pathetic",2023-03-24
i was hoping for eli from the book of eli to drop in an fight cain i want to see that movie,2023-03-26

when jw smashes dudes balls with the nunchucks multiple times then hits him in the ballsonelast time before headshotting him has tobe one cruel death,2023-03-29
somehow i felt the hand trauma was worse if you know the scene was rubbing my hand for a few minutes,2023-04-01
 forever,2023-04-02
like the guy’s groin john stepped on to make him raise up so he could blow his brains out at close range,2023-04-10
probably the most amazing cinematic things i have ever seen  been jaded and underwhelmed by everything recently and those long shots had my jaw on the  floor,2023-03-24
i want to watch this movie again just for that 169 minute sequence,2023-03-25
"rewatched last night its better the second time around totally missed they dropped led spiralsshots fired into that scene which really bookends johns story 

also pay attention to how many times john grabs extra magazines from guys hes smoked and how many times he needs to reload 12ga arbased rifles only hold 10 or so rounds so hes reloading a lot 

he transitions from rifle to pistol and back 45 times and its  brilliant very close to watching sof shoot house videos 

the way they bring the camera back down towards the end really makes the scene",2023-03-26
that was my favorite scene too because of the way it was shot the fact that it was a longtake and that it was a  badass weapon that he got to torch a lot of nameless faceless people with,2023-04-10
the boogeyman,2023-03-25
and everybody dies,2023-03-27
hahahaha,2023-04-01
yes down to the inhaler like mads mikkelsen’s le chiffre that seemed deliberate only with a touch of jaws teeth and the whale,2023-03-24
giving him the inhaler was such a nice bit of character building the whole sequence kindof felt like batman and the penguin,2023-03-27
felt batman to me,2023-04-03
that bond villain   ,2023-03-24
personally that was actually my least favourite part of the movie felt a little bit too played up and kinda broke me out of the immersion everybody getting stellar hands and the dude being too much of a cartoon character to the professional dancers in the club just not my taste,2023-03-26
it can i bet mission impossible this year will have some jaw dropping moments,2023-03-24
lets not forget the set design every establishing shot in this movie was a beautiful marriage between the two,2023-03-24
if only we had a stunt oscar naw thats silly,2023-03-24
i doubt it will even though laustsen was already nominated twice and this film makes those look lazy in comparison,2023-03-24
too bad the arc de triomphe and sacre coeur parts were filled with terrible cgi background,2023-03-24
the japan segment especially just dazzling to look at,2023-03-24
i wish the academy had a best stunt performance category,2023-03-24
i think it has a better case for production design tbh,2023-03-24
this had some of the best cinematography ive seen in a movie in a long time,2023-03-25
such a breath of fresh air that the movie is beautiful and not dark it was easy to see everything even for nighttime shots,2023-04-02
honestly all of the movies have amazing cinematography and set pieces,2023-03-25
the whole fight in the german rave club was just beautiful,2023-04-10
yeah it really felt like “okay for this establishing shot let’s make it look like it could be in an art gallery… then blow up the gallery”,2023-03-26
it was so beautiful i lost count of how many times i said that to myself,2023-04-09
" because that was  gorgeous

heres how they did it 

film scene 

put saturation slider to 200

aight good job guys",2023-07-08
it can and it should,2023-03-25
well to be fair if youre going to  someone on a crowded public street there are reasons to hide your face other than just because of the victim,2023-03-25
what happened in the after credits scene o,2023-03-28
for it to be the 4th entry i was honestly surprised of them actually being able to up the ante not only did they up the ante but they gave me stuff i never knew i wanted to see,2023-03-24
why did it lose the 5,2023-03-25
im not the most familiar with donnie yens work i am not ashamed to say that i wondered for a bit if donnie yen actually was blind and i had just missed this fact,2023-03-24
i think he specifically requested his character be blind both times so i guess this is just an archetype he likes to play,2023-03-24
“i am one with the gunfu and the gunfu is with me”,2023-03-24
poor donnie i turned to my wife and asked if he was going blind irl with the roles hes had lately,2023-03-24
good artists borrow great artists steal,2023-03-25
i spent half the movie thinking he was chang from the hangover…,2023-04-08
why do i feel like this is going to be a type cast for donnie yen,2023-03-30
lol i love that hes the bouncer from berghain that and seeing rina my musical crush so many fun characters,2023-03-24
i am groot,2023-03-25
gave me a very hodor vibe  even the bit parts in this series are so well done so memorable,2023-03-24
that joke didnt really land for me like the entire joke was the guy has a handicap and only says  am klaus in a voice,2023-03-25
i am klauth,2023-03-26
i feel like my wife and i had been the only ones to laugh at him here comes this old tattooed badass looking guy and you wonder what kind of threat he might be then he speaks and it was nothing like what we expected  was funny as ,2023-04-07
i was the only one laughing worth it,2023-03-26
i wonder if the writers had been watching craig fergusons show theres an i am klaus joke in there,2023-03-26
i was on the floor crying i was laughing so hard,2023-03-24
“hello klaus i’m hodor”,2023-03-25
eastern european groot ftw,2023-05-29
a lot of movie references in this one the background for the dual was basically ecstasy of gold,2023-03-27
i literally laughed out loud in excitement and my dad looked at me like  is funny and i just smiled and thought oh only a nod to arguably one of the greatest edits in all of film history agreed  i knew the next three hours were going to be something great,2023-03-25
love the nod to the warriors with the coded radio message for the hit on john wick in paris top notch homage,2023-03-28
lawrence of arabia reference played by lawrence fishburne they knew what they were doing,2023-03-31
i straight up lost it bro,2023-03-24
i’m ready for hollywood to wake up and start using more french electronic music in movies it’s such a layup you would think kavinksy in drive would have showed everyone but maybe this movie will do it,2023-03-24
gesaffelstein should do the next tron movie soundtrack,2023-03-24
oh gesaffelstein no wonder i  loved the soundtrack,2023-03-24
dont forget the glitch mob,2023-03-24
which song from gesaffelstein,2023-03-29
the cinematography was insane so much beautiful compositions especially in japan and paris,2023-03-24
"that shot of wick on the hotel roofbalcony in osaka where the red light illuminates half his face with the tree in the background  right away i was reminded of how amazing this whole franchise has looked

also the entire nightclub sequence was insanely beautiful",2023-03-25
it was every frame a painting,2023-04-01
interestingly enough they use paintings to reinforce future events and add symbolism to characters,2023-03-28
oh my  i did not even realise that was scott adkins,2023-03-24
scott is great when he hams it up,2023-03-25
i was hoping he wouldnt just die from a gunshot to the rear dude can really kick with a  suit,2023-03-25
and he gave a great acting performance too i got scared seeing him for the first time and thinking “ why would you put him in a  suit”  then he started fighting and i felt so relieved,2023-03-27
pretty sure there was a point on the stairway scene where he was just shooting thin air because the guy he shot already went down,2023-03-24
"i loved that too blind warriors can sometimes be a little farfetched due to how movies portray them the little things like him still having to feel around to get a sense of his environment or not knowing wick was right at his feet added a sense of realism 

i also liked the use of the motion sensor doorbells in the osaka fight really clever use of the scenes and his blindness",2023-03-25
the way i saw it no pun intended was a plot mechanism to nerf him down to john wicks level otherwise with full sight that man may very well have even more deadly,2023-03-24
that scene when john had a shot on caine at the hotel and caine thought he’d already killed john — that scene hit hard,2023-03-26
“johnare you dead”,2023-04-08
that fall should be mandatory training for the popes exorcist,2023-03-24
and cars  im pretty sure cars hurt john wick more than the bullets and knives,2023-03-29
sand dan glokta approves of this message,2023-03-30
wick got hit by so many cars it was insane cars must be built different there cause even the dog got thrown into one and bounced back like it was nothing,2023-03-24
some of the best action and stunt work i have seen in a long time the fall down the stairs was brutal,2023-03-24
" the last hour of this movie

thats a strange way to phrase it

 running time  2h 49m

omfg",2023-03-24
watching nobody get as excited as me when it’s revealed john swallowed the bullet so he could shoot bull skaarsgaard’s character that i can’t remember the name of i just kept thinking “these  really know their audience”,2023-03-26
pure adrenaline,2023-03-24
i had to go to the bathroom bad glad i held it in,2023-03-24
it was the second film i’ve seen in the cinema since the pandemic and my  the end had me i missed the audience so much the laughter when he was kicked down the stairs was real and so good,2023-03-24
the hierarchy of john wick universe is about to change,2023-03-24
pitting john wick against the entire city of paris was just brilliant,2023-03-25
"the crazy thing was that the first hour was one of the greatest things ive seen in my life

until one hour later",2023-03-24
this movie went full blown hamsters,2023-03-24
agreed,2023-03-24
nonstop amazing,2023-03-24
hands down the best action movie since fury road imo,2023-03-25
most of the cars that arent involved in hitting someone are clearly cg but who cares its awesome,2023-03-30
i feel bad for you,2023-04-10
now im super pumped for the spin off,2023-03-24
the use of major paris landmarks as set pieces was just phenomenal gorgeous cinematography all around,2023-04-09
the franchise got stupider after every movie the first part is a classic though good  movie,2023-03-26
sensory overload  absolutely loved it,2023-03-29
yo just a question but are you possibly aaron from the nerd soup podcast its just this is really similar to what he said in his letterboxd review for the movie,2023-06-01
you need to see more movies this is total trash are you 14,2023-07-11
yess glad someone else caught the wuxia,2023-03-25
for those that don’t know wuxia is a reference to “martial arts hero” films or the so called hk kongfu films from the 70s and 80s,2023-03-26
it doesnt feel like this film was marketed that hard and i think they knew they didnt have to  good money saving on their end unless they have been and ive been living under a rock,2023-03-26
its surreal let me tell ya,2023-03-24
i just recommended it to multiple friends this was a spectacular watch,2023-04-01
"i’ll be the first to say i love ‘em both to pieces but it’s mission impossible for me purely because i enjoy the spectacle of those films — elaborate chases of all kinds big stunts espionage — more than wick’s which is almost entirely gun fu shootouts don’t get me wrong i love a good gunfight but it feels like mission impossible can do what wick does but wick never does what mission does 

in the end it’s like choosing between candy and ice cream they both serve the same purpose are done super well and on different days im in a different mood for one or the other they’re the obvious contender for best action films right now and it’s not remotely close the merits of the comparison are only in how their different styles have different appeals",2023-03-24
"i may be in the vast minority here but i think this series peaked with john wick 1 especially the scene in the nightclub in that movie they never captured that feeling again at least for me

some of the fight scenes in this movie and the 3rd one just dragged on and on and on and on and on its like chewing a really tough piece of meat  you get the juice on the first few chews and then its just there and you need to chew through it",2023-04-01
cruise being a better actor than reeves gives the mission films an edge ethan is a more relatable character than wick,2023-03-25
john wick shoots people and ethan hunt jumps off of things different lanes,2023-03-24
can you elaborate i have no clue what you are talking about but i want to now 3,2023-03-24
anybody else feel reeves acting is so wooden every time he talks his dialogue is so bad like his  expressions dont match the content of his words nor his actions just casually uttering one to two sentence bits under his breath every 15 minutes or so,2023-03-24
there really isn’t a conversation,2023-03-25
which is better donnie yen winding up his punch in the kitchen fight or henry cavill reloading his biceps in the bathroom fight,2023-03-29
john wick wins off the advantage of not having a crazy scientologist as the lead and i say that as a fan of almost every movie tom cruise has made,2023-03-24
all they have to do is get tom cruise to come in and play the villain in chapter five he can play a villain as collateral proved,2023-03-25
why does it even need to be a competition any fan of action should be happy weve had 2 consistently amazing franchises the past decade,2023-03-26
not even a question john wicks plot is a man goes on a vengeful tour bc some guys killed his wife’s dog mission impossible actually had a plot in the beginning,2023-03-24
me and friend watched all the mi films last year and found them incredibly average 3 was the only one we really enjoyed easy choice,2023-03-24
fast x,2023-03-26
dont even compare i put mission impossible over james bond it is that good when it come to action movie the fights  the thrills and the physics need to look realistic in human eye no matter what kind of stunts they do  sorry john wick is boring i couldnt finish watching the first one,2023-03-24
¿porqué no los dos  personally im waiting for the john wick chapter 4 should be in the running for next years oscars conversation  and stahelski  and donnie yen  considering some of the movies that get noms theres just no  reason an action epic this well done cant be one of the best films of the year,2023-03-24
theyre both action movies but theyre not the same type of action movies and thus cant be compared imo mis most apt comparison is big stunt spectacles like james bond or the bourne films which it surpasses both jw is more in line with fightbased action the raid or oldboy,2023-03-24
man i cant even both are incredible but in different ways,2023-03-25
as a fan of both franchises this movie was nearly perfect for me  usually i get sleepy but this one kept me glued to it the entire time pretty tough for a 3 hour movie  mission impossible is gonna have to be pretty  crazy to compete,2023-03-26
somehow tinnitus feels good in a place like this,2023-03-25
have you checked out a game called hong kong massacre,2023-03-24
exactly what i thought of as well that was wild,2023-03-24
funny thing is i noticed that john didn’t take the shot before winston said anything i leaned in to my dad and told him,2023-03-26
wasnt the line you arrogant  ,2023-04-12
i knew john hadnt fired but was thinking it had also meant with all the rules of the high table that since john hadnt fired the marquis would get punished severely for skipping johns  turn but still enjoyed what came after,2023-03-27
one single guy started clapping really loudly after that and it ruined the whole scene for me,2023-04-23
the thud they made going through the helmets was oddly satisfying,2023-03-24
we exhausted all our gunfu now get ready for bowfu,2023-03-24
when john was fist fighting the armored guy and then the guy gets his leg arrowed to the wall followed by john finishing was great,2023-03-25
gnarly and they were indeed,2023-03-24
it was nice seeing how powerful they were too seeing arrows stuck a foot deep into walls was a great touch,2023-03-25
i wonder how heavy is the draw considering it can impale a person painkillers stake gun style while being rapid fired like that,2023-03-25
felt like playing halflife 2 deathmatch again where u could pin enemies to the walls with a crossbow lol that  was brutal in the movie,2023-03-27
in 4d you felt every one very cool,2023-03-25
"love this quote by the director awhile back

“john may survive all this  but at the end of it theres no happy ending hes got nowhere to go honestly i challenge you right now heres a question to you how do you  want me to end it do you think hes going to ride off into the  sunset hes killed 300  people and hes just going to walk away everythings okay hes just going to fall in love with a love interest if youre this  guy if this guy really existed how is this guys day going to end hes  for the rest of his life its just a matter of time”

yup we all knew how it had to end",2023-03-24
"the radio station wuxia

glad i wasnt the only one who noticed this girlfriend couldnt understand why i was so hyped when they read out the name of the radio station

even funnier when you realise all radio stations in america start with w or k",2023-03-24
"mr nobody was literally nobody he came from nowhere and went nowhere i had hoped we would have seen him at the end of the rebuilt new york continental hotel as the new concierge complete with dog

otherwise he added little to the movie and his role was pointless the biggest con of the movie for me",2023-03-26
"both the rippeddoor shootout and the opening with caines daughter playing the violin gave me major a bittersweet life vibes almost as if it was very slight homage

in a bittersweet life the prominent female character is watched as she plays a classic piece on a stringed instrument

in another scene after wringing out of being captured the protagonist jumps in his damaged car driving in a tight circle as he uses a pistol and the broken door as cover to shoot the captives around him its a memorable scene

it likely wasnt homage at all but those two scenes really stood out to me a bittersweet life is also a gangsterturnedrogue story well worth the watch with some superb action scenes a gang member is excommunicated and hunted down after refusing to execute someone he felt undeserving of punishment violence ensues",2023-03-24
" if youre in a club and see john just leave immediately 

im pretty sure i saw a bunch of extras watch john beat a man or men to death with an axe then just keep on dancing",2023-03-24
the post credit scene was her ambushing caine as he was walking up with flowers to hand to his daughter probably a surprise reunion since both he and his daughter are free now  akira was walking towards caine and had a knife out as the screen blanked to black,2023-03-24
"charon dying was bad enough but after lance reddicks passing rest in peace both of you

its disturbingly prophetic",2023-03-28
also saw in dolby cinema at my local amc this is the first movie where i had to make myself get up and walk the theater halls for a minute about 23 through because i was so wound up you could literally feel every punch kick crash or gunshot through your seat this is why we go to the movies,2023-03-24
the last time i saw nunchucks chuck was in sidekicks with jonathan brandis and chuck norris,2023-03-24
" speaking of caine i like the way his blindness does hinder him in some ways 

i thought the biggest flaw there was how they made an obvious ripoff of zatoichi and then they throw him into the middle of a fight scene where the lights go out and thats not a primary element of it i mean thats such a staple of zatoichi that they titled a film darkness is my ally

i feel like the better option would have been to start the fight between both groups without caine partway through kojis guys are able to rally and take control of the situation they get the archers into an elevated position they  the lights the marquis guys look like they are proper  and then caine shows up and just starts demolishing people since in the darkness they cant see him but he doesnt need to see them now thats a  of an entrance

in general i thought they relied too much on having him shoot people he should have leaned much more heavily into the sword partly for more variety in the fights but practically because it would be more tactile and better suited to him",2023-03-26
how he died wasnt very satisfying though for all he went has gone through in his life that was his demise,2023-03-24
facts,2023-03-24
"alongside mission impossible  dead reckoning part 1 jesus thats a mouthful this is one of two movies to release in 2023 to have a car chase with all the doors ripped off the car to clearly display its the actor doing their own driving

well have to wait for the bts but id be very surprised if the driving was real at all  movies have had tons of ways throughout the years to cheat driving even beyond just using stunt doubles  for example a pretty common one is to have a rig either pulling the car on a modified trailer or having the real car be in front of the fake car that the star is driving  you can even mix up different types of cheats in this way so that the audience is shown all angles of the car during the scene making it seem as real as possible  while i didnt spot it in this movie an easy tell from less choreographedbudgeted movie is when they only show the vehicle from the top of the wheels or higher  when the scenes do this the car is 100 being dragged or driven by a stunt driver on the front of it  these scenes usually end with the camera pulling back to show the full car as proof for it being real even though none of the action showed anything",2023-03-24
" weirdly satisfying its like theres no other way this could have ended and makes the entire series into this impressively melancholic tragedy

i personally needed to see this happen storywise i mean not like i hate john wick for there to be any weight to the action scenes the guy was frankly too much of a one man army which made for great spectacle but obviously removed any dramatic tension or weightand then the ending of the film happened and it retrospectively made it all worth it and better because it showed that there is a price to whats happening and everything that happened previously actually added up",2023-03-26
the sound was very well mixed for sure it always bothers me when movies somehow  that up,2023-03-27
this movie is loud from the very start the punches in the opening are a big bang,2023-03-30
your phrasing makes me also think of the movie john dies at the end,2023-03-30
" i wish we saw more of akira 

dont worry youll see her again there is no chance in  they dont do a donnie yen spin off espeically since yen wants it and after that post credits scene",2023-04-10
" the radio station wuxia
 

this finally confirms to me where they got the plot from for john wick",2023-11-26
one of the reviews stated reeves delivered each line like he just learned to talk for the first time,2023-03-24
yeah a lot of the time he spoke i’m wondering if they just used the first take and continued on lol,2023-03-24
he seemed especially bad when the rest of the cast is bringing their a game all of his lines sounded forced like he was being fed them as he was saying them,2023-03-24
there were two too many yeah moments like in the first one he was stoic but could still speak full sentences,2023-03-24
i think the somewhat wooden acting was intentional the marquis pointed outwick has none of those things no reason to live die  etc his vague plan iskill people associated with the high table until he dies hes sort of rudderless in a storm and i think the acting solidified that directionless sense of vengeance for the sake of vengeance,2023-03-24
yeah keanus performance speaking  here was a bit odd hard to imagine himhavong thr type of of conversations he had in thr first film like with the door man he yells to take a night off etc,2023-03-24
"obviously reeves is no marlon brando but to an extent i thought it was intentional or at least that it worked  hes at a point where hes got little choice over his own actions hes just on this path where either he kills or he dies  for most of the film he is almost a robot death machine killing everything he touches  

x200b

i thought he was fine in the scene where they set the terms for the duel and the church scene and his physical acting was as good as ever",2023-03-24
"yeah as an actors its unfortunate that talking was his worst part

loved the movie but it was weird how bad his dialgoue was",2023-03-24
"when he first says “yeah…” my whole theater laughed

it’s kind of a meme at this point",2023-03-25
"warriors homage

a shocking amount of this movie was made out of shotsreferences to other iconic moments in media off the top of my head

 the lawrence of arabia transition at the start which actually had me laugh out loud

 the first shots in osaka with the cymbal are too similar to the shots and score from the river boat scene in ghost in the shell

 that bit from the warriors you mentioned 

 an extended topdown house clearing with multiple different types of weapons set to blaring techno music a la hotline miami

i’m sure there’s a lot more the movie wears its influences on its sleeve the last bit of john walking down the stairs in front of the church was straight out of the last episode of cowboy bebop which keanu reeves has mentioned as a favorite of his for years",2023-03-26
i feel like reeves wooden performance was exacerbated by the fact that donnie yen is so  charismatic every time he was on screen i was thinking id rather just keeping watching him casually hit people with his stick instead of cutting back to john,2023-03-25
i think keanu shouldve leaned into the angry growl his voice had at the end of 3that part in 1 where hes explaining to viggo why killing his dog was so devastating to him but i disagree the scene at the church shows he could still emote like in the other films,2023-03-24
i get the feeling that someone in a test audience for the first film really really liked it when keanu turned to the cameras and said “yeah…” in the graveliest lowest tone manageable and so it appears every 5 minutes,2023-03-24
keanu in general seems to be acting that way more and more id thought hes just always sounded like that until i went back and watched some of his older movies lately he was never exactly a generational talent but man its really noticable how stiff and wooden hes gotten lately i almost have to wonder if something is going on with him behind the scenes health wise tbh though i hope not,2023-03-28
thats not his natural speaking voice he lowers it to an absurd degree like mark sinclair i mean vin diesel does thats why he comes off as insincere and unnatural when he speaks while keanu reeves may be a great movie star hes quite limited as an actor,2023-03-28
he was kinda like that in matrix 4 as well honestly i dont think keanus heart is in the dialogue anymore hes just interested in producing cool action,2023-03-24
"one criticism i did have was that this is probably keanu’s worst performance as john the way he delivered lines felt like an alien speaking english for the first time very odd 

why has nobody said this for the past 6 years this performance has mostly been the same for two prior films so by this point ive sorta gotten used to it",2023-03-25
to be fair wick really doesnt have a lot of personality to work with so there isnt a lot keanu can do with those lines,2023-03-24
"one criticism i did have was that this is probably keanu’s worst performance as john the way he delivered lines felt like an alien speaking english for the first time 

when we came out of the theatre i said to my friends it was like he was constantly doing a keanu reeves impression or like he was a recent  victim",2023-03-26
"one criticism i did have was that this is probably keanu’s worst performance as john the way he delivered lines felt like an alien speaking english for the first time very odd

sounds like typical keanu reeves to me lol",2023-03-26
i know what you mean but i feel like it kind of worked in a weird way that yeah not really line from the trailers is a perfect example,2023-03-24
i would like to see how many words he actually spoke,2023-03-25
i loved that it ended at that church it was built as a final insult to those who died fighting for the paris commune,2023-03-24
thank you for mention warriors,2023-03-24
i noticed that too dunno if its an intentional choice but some line readings were unintentionally hilarious,2023-03-25
"as of right now that entire action sequence in the arc de triomphe is the one to beat this year that whole section was spectacular

the thing that makes it work is the way its intercut with the radio broadcast the tempo of the sequence changes to fit the tempo of the next song",2023-03-25
the radio station had callsign wuxia as well,2023-03-25
his dialogue has gotten more and more like that as the movies have gone on personally i love it its kind of cheesy and campy and i like that theyre leaning into it you know its on purpose because he said yeah like 3 times in a row that one time,2023-03-27
"some of the dialogue is just not good in the franchise

tell them tell them all whoever comes whoever it is ill  them ill  them all

so much bad repetition theres a version of that line which is much much cleaner",2023-03-27
"the warriors bit was funny because i thought it was going to be a oneoff reference but they kept going back to the dj to the point where the movie just became the warriors for about 30 minutes 

and the fact that so few people here seemed to have gotten the reference tells me that we’re overdue for a warriors remakesequelrerelease",2023-03-29
he sounded like dooley from king of the hill most of the time,2023-03-24
keanu is like that in literally everything he’s in on d you accept that it’s fine,2023-03-25
"one criticism i did have was that this is probably keanu’s worst performance as john the way he delivered lines felt like an alien speaking english for the first time very odd

i was worried for his health",2023-03-27
yeah his dialogue felt like a parody of itself they left a lot of meat on the bone for more of an emotional connection with him until he mentioned his wife at the end other than that fun movie though,2023-04-01
i think keanu is just playing to the audience i read that he deliberately cut out more and more lines from john wick as the movies progressed his laconic and deadpan delivery adds to the movies tone so well personally i loved how  it sounded because its becoming more and more self aware,2023-04-02
"the way he delivered lines felt like an alien speaking english for the first time

this was actually one of my favorite things look at boxers after a match they are tired and its hard to make words it feels more real to me",2023-04-10
the way i interpreted it is that he was just tired the character not the actor,2023-05-12
isnt john supposed to be autistic,2023-03-24
"i honestly liked 2 and 3 more but they’re all amazing and i can see easy arguments for each 

2 and 3 had more unique memorable sequences with the horse ninjas on motorcycles the catacombs opt out the crazy throwing knife fight etc",2023-03-26
yh apparently he only spoke 300 words in the whole film as a lead thats crazy alot of his lines were very predictable too,2023-03-28
cause hes been beat so bad,2023-03-29
frogger the paris edition,2023-03-30
keanu is more bubbly than the character is not by a ton but still i get wick being somber and not giving a  about saying much all the  and death that’s happened around him i don’t blame him at all,2023-04-01
keane is getting old,2023-04-02
"at firs i honestly thought the arc de triomphe sequence was the best action sequence cinematography wise ive ever seen but then came the apartment sequence… 

 how is it possible for a movie to be this good",2023-04-05
that line about and hes going to  you or whatever to the marquis wouldve gone so hard if he delivered it better,2023-10-20
the four action sequences that closed the film arc de triomphe hotline paris stairway to heaven and the western duel were all godtier,2023-03-25
i really hope he’s truly dead and they don’t make it like he faked his death perfect ending to the series,2023-03-24
mr krabs worked for the high table all along i knew it,2023-03-24
i love that the blindness wasnt just handwaved as pure daredevilesque mysticism but he clearly had adapted in practical ways,2023-03-24
they added little details to his blindness that i liked at one point he runs out of ammo and if you pay attention to his hands he’s shoving his finger into the  locked open slide of his gun to verify that the chamber and mag are both empty,2023-03-25
"the osaka fight…fantastic seeing new fighting styles and weapons lots of blades and bowarrows

you can tell chad stahelski cut his teeth as a stuntman and second unit director he has an excellent understanding of how to stage pace and shoot complex action sequences without losing momentum or risking the audience getting lost",2023-03-25
what do you mean it would be crazy in the real world i know a lawyer who can’t see and does stuff like that all the time,2023-03-24
i just saw it  id say it was the best of the sequels  i did like donnie yens character  he was such an efficient killing machine  also the way he played caine was just done in such a way that i felt sympathy for him by the end of the film and i felt like i didnt want to see either him or wick die,2023-03-28
a fifth movie was greenlit in 2020 so i dont think hes really dead,2023-03-27
is bullet train connected,2023-03-29
what are the spin offs they’ve announced,2023-04-03
and the bruce lee glasses,2023-04-05
"the set design lighting cinematographycamera work and color grading all combined to create one of the greatest action films of all time 

comparing it to the first film you definitely can tell the craft and budget went up 100 whole notches love how far weve come",2023-03-27
the japan shots with the cherry blossom trees were so good,2023-03-30
"when he gets out of the car i was like boo is that all of the song we get
but then he gets back in the car and the music booms again",2023-03-25
it’s crazy that a song over sixty years old still hits so hard,2023-03-30
yes i was impressed by that like  hes prepared,2023-03-24
not only he tried to stab killa with a card he then proceeds to throw the card at another dude,2023-03-24
during the stairway scene he disassembled a pistol and i thought he was gonna yeet the parts at dudes nope he stabs 2 guys with it lol,2023-03-26
"i love how it shows he makes anything he can into a weapon

he killed with a pencil a pencil i mean what kind of guy does that",2023-03-30
at this point he’s that ben pointdexter dude from daredevil who’s deadly with any object with his 100 yeet accuracy,2023-03-25
he threw so many things at so many people im pretty sure i counted 4 pistols straight to the head,2023-04-01
bro that is legit one of the greatest film martial artists of all time,2023-03-25
thats bob from tekken,2023-03-29
 ,2023-03-24
thank  there was no connection thatd be cheap his character was really cool already and a connection would be unnecessary,2023-03-24
i feel like they teased it the dog made me think of some connection to halle berry’s character,2023-03-24
i strongly got the impression that hes not part of high table  hes some elite exmilitary dude freelance bounty hunter who studied the high table system from the outside and dealt himself in so he could hunt highvalue targets,2023-03-27
thats why theres gotta be a jw5 imo him  rina’s character there will be more for sure a lot of people will think jw isnt dead,2023-03-24
yup i was expecting him to be sofias nephew or something,2023-03-24
im trying to figure out the point of that character why was he there,2023-03-28
every time i saw him he reminded me of the lone wanderer from fallout,2023-03-25
i thought he was going to be charons son,2023-03-24
in my mind hes halle berrys son or something,2023-03-26
i feel like in terms of characters who warrant a spinoff he’s definitely up there for me loved every second of his character,2023-03-24
nope he was entirely superfluous to the entire movie i got the impression it was just an excuse to have a dog in the movie,2023-03-25
i liked this character but if he was that good with tracking he should know it all started because of the dog so he has no interest in killing wick as a fellow goodboy fan,2023-03-27
obvious spin off setup,2023-03-25
i half expected him to be the new concierge,2023-03-24
i don’t understand how at the end of it all he didn’t expect some money or  have a one liner,2023-04-03
ohh now that you mention it they couldve had charon ferry john wick,2023-03-24
john wick 5 will come out it will be john in  killing all the souls he damned doom style,2023-03-24
yep just like how everybody thought the third was going to be the last and then it ended with a setup for 4,2023-03-24
i feel similarly this series has so much life where most action films run into the ground as a trilogy that there’s no way they don’t revisit it time and time again — with the advances in ai deaging it’s not prohibitive to do more backstory behind old friends,2023-03-24
i figured going into the movie that he’d probably die by the end of it all the “loving husband” part cemented it for me when i heard it the first time,2023-03-27
1 i think the end credits are going to be the beginning of chapter 5 but john wick wont be a part of it the world is plenty interesting enough to keep going now,2023-03-24
okay glad im not going through these comments thinking im crazy google said 4 and 5 were shot at the same time really hope hes dead because its a solid end to the story,2023-04-16
i honestly think 5 might be a prequel im really interested in seeing johns impossible task that allowed him to retire,2023-03-25
the only films that come close to this level of cinematic carnage i can think of off the top of my head are john woos hard boiled and the killer and the raid 2 easily the best action movie ive seen in a cinema every gunshot felt like a punch and the size and scale of the action was unparalleled on the big screen every successive sequence tops the previous one and any out of osaka berlin or any individual section of paris could be the grand finale of 99 of action films and be an improvement first movie this year i think im going to see a second time,2023-03-25
mad max and john wick tied for me,2023-03-29
if any john wick is the defining action movie of this generation it would be the first 1 not the last one,2023-03-28
it’s unfair how good french people are at electronic music,2023-03-24
genesis such a track,2023-03-24
gesaffelstein also french during the arc scene as well,2023-03-26
yeah the soundtrack was really fantastic kept getting pumped like never before in the series,2023-03-24
yes whatever was playing during john’s fight with scott adkins was great too the whole soundtrack was exceptional very fitting and emotional,2023-04-10
i have force i will be of force,2023-03-24
dingdong,2023-03-24
so awesome so accurate lol irl,2023-03-25
great comment when my younger brother would forget caine’s name and he didn’t know his actor name he would just refer to him as “i’m one with the force and the force is with me”,2023-04-10
yup and i also think it’s kinda of a  time to die you literally spend like weeks fighting nonstop only to die one minute after you got your absolute freedom like bruh,2023-03-24
"john wick is dead

jardani is alive once more",2023-03-25
oh yeah nah he’s hundred percent showing up in the implied akira movie lol,2023-03-24
if john wick continues i hope donnie caine is a mainstay of the series because he is ultimately an ally to john,2023-03-25
"ironically i’d remove the beginning desert chase from this one too
just have john confront the elder indicating a row of dead bodies behind him would’ve shaved two minutes of pretty unremarkable action in a film that was nothing but remarkable action",2023-03-25
keanu definitely looks his age when he shaves his beard,2023-03-24
bill is still good though he plays sucha good hateable ,2023-03-24
i’ve been to all three cities made it extra cool while watching,2023-03-24
"i don’t remember the bouncer part maybe i was in the bathroom what did i miss

ah wait never mind you’re talking about klaus",2023-03-24
" i almost dont even want them to make a 5th because i kind of just want it to end on a high note

i was assuming and hoping it would go the way of fast and furious series and go to 10 films at least",2023-03-24
2 is my favorite overall and think  3 had the best sequences with the ninjas on motorcycles and throwing knife fight but this is so  good i need to see it again and i might change my mind,2023-03-26
how can they make a fifth since he’s dead or did i miss something,2023-03-24
i completely agree i want them to not make another one let the franchise die a good death,2023-04-01
oh  that’s who that was,2023-03-24
"i thought the post credits was powerful they’re damned men according to caine and in jw1 viggo told wick they’re cursed and what did john wick reply with both times “on that we agree”

the end credits were the consequences really effective scenes imo",2023-03-24
with succession returning on sunday its a perfect time for that phrase lol and someone didnt see antman 3 lol,2023-03-25
john wick succession edition,2023-03-24
"i was not prepared to be so emotional so early in this movie

that hit so hard",2023-03-24
agreed  i love all cinema and watxhing behind the scenes but i have no  clue how they pulled that off  mostly just 2 full takes and no cgi that i could spot  amazing,2023-03-24
thats psychopathic,2023-03-24
kung fu hustle shoutout,2023-03-25
hes doing ghost of tsushima its gonna be bonkers,2023-03-27
wow thanks for that he directed a lot of the kung fu films or martial art films in the 90s ,2023-03-29
rule of cool maybe,2023-04-06
our showing had a message saying in memory of lance reddick just before the opening scene,2023-03-24
"best action movie of the year this might be the best action movie of the decade 

in all seriousness though i agree with you but this is one of those action movies that almost had me speechless this is an insane achievement in stunt choreography and directing",2023-03-24
it will be one of the two best action movies of the year imho missing impossible dead reckoning part 1 thats a  mouthful is still to release,2023-03-24
i screamed when he did the ip man rapid punches in the kitchen scene,2023-03-24
"im not a huge rina fan i kinda just found out about her from a old reddit thread  in that thread a fan was talking about her banger songs and this was one of them i gave it a listen and i thought it was pretty good too 



if clubby beats arent your thing and youre looking for more vocal prowess she also does a brilliant job covering a beloved japanese classic ",2023-03-26
i’d throw it in the running for best action movie of all time,2023-03-26
i knew rina from my old workplace my desk was next to hers back in 2012 absolutely absurd that the next time i see her was on the screen ahaha i wasn’t totally sure if i was hallucinating,2023-04-16
yeah and everyone had the same dance moves same distance from each other hands up rave party style nobody going to get drinks or take a  as soon as they arrive at these parties it’s nonstop dancing the vibe is so good apparently not even an axe to the face of someone we don’t know just 3 feet away will break our vibe,2023-03-25
that scene is what i imagine a live action movie for fighting game should be bgm  people dancing while not caring two guys murdering the  out of each other,2023-03-26
" this is the most cohesive the world of wick has ever felt 

perhaps in part because the film straight up opens with a ballistic recon of the elder",2023-03-24
"okay so as somebody who is totally “meh” on 2 and 3 thinks they’re fine but not anything i’ve ever watched twice you think this one will
surprise me a bit",2023-03-24
that in the trailer was what made me want to see it  that could have been the whole movie,2023-03-24
loved it ,2023-03-26
the way you threw toyatathon in that took me out ,2023-03-26
maybe just a mentor role in later films,2023-03-25
technically part of the crime family now maybe they want him to do  for them now stakes feel like they would be lower though,2023-03-26
well an errant bullet from a henchman would  you immediately,2023-03-24
i’ve been to the location they filmed that part at and it’s just as epic in real life,2023-03-25
not cool enough for the partygoers to stop and take note apparently “hands up… must  keep dancing”,2023-03-25
wait sois he dead,2023-04-23
is it confirmed that there will be one,2023-03-25
stahelski’s modern japan looked way more real than leitch’s japan in bullet train i know covid may have had something to do with them filming bullet train in la on a set but still,2023-03-25
i hope we’ll still get that highlander movie,2023-03-25
genuinely curious what did you find satisfying about it as a conclusion john accomplished nothing there seems to be no point to anything he did in 3  4,2023-03-27
going again tonight maybe saturday too  an action epic for the ages,2023-03-24
"next time im in paris 

im rolling down those stairs",2023-03-28
i noticed some of the audience where i was at rushed to go to the bathroom and then came back in case there was something after the credits lol,2023-03-24
like 2 other people stayed for mine most of the theater left after where a midcredits scene would have been,2023-03-24
so  awesome,2023-03-24
"even calling people boppers

perfect no notes",2023-03-24
i’ve seen movies in 4dx those punches could be felt like it was in a 4dx theater,2023-03-24
i’m eight months pregnant  the opening scene shootings woke my baby up immediately he was moving like no one’s business ,2023-03-30
"i definitely wondered that myself lol 

thinking about it tho it might make some sense if thats just the process for someone vouching for an excommunicated member to be let back in to the family",2023-03-29
i had the same question,2023-03-25
yeah that kinda sucks for her lol,2023-03-28
hilarious observation,2023-03-26
"ikr lol

they should have made the duel for sunset",2023-03-28
" im not saying its impossible to bring wick back

i honestly kept expecting them to reveal he was alive and they faked his death so he could finally be free and find his good life

but it was a great ending i believe the director has said there was never going to be a happy ending for john",2023-03-24
"i remember seeing the first one opening night having no idea how good it was going to be or what would be born of it

it was a boring weekend in october when i saw the first one i had time it looked vaguely interesting it was getting good scores and i kinda wanted to see what keanu was doing seeing it expand to this one of the most consistently good film series of the era is more than a little nuts",2023-03-24
"the batman

what",2023-04-01
"i think this movie is spectacular i think theres a lot more issues with 3 it remarkably doesnt feel long and having keanu say less than ever is wise choice 

i think theres several things to nitpick  but it can still be a 1010 with the understanding that not every 10 is at the same ceiling i think the biggest issue is the lack of emotional stakes but as pure action its hard to imagine something better and they do such a good job making each fight seem distinct at least in terms of location and this is by far the best balance of lore and action as you said

 the conundrum of wick has always been how do you keep topping them how far will they go how much can you defy the table and still live if theyre so powerful and in the respect of all those questions i absolutely loved how this series wrapped up im not saying its impossible to bring wick back but if this is truly how his story ends i think its a fantastic end

agreed but obviously they at least catered to the studio to leave the door wide open for a return it would be awesome if this is the last one with reeves",2023-03-24
" i loved how he wasnt some daredevil esque super powered person



 the kingpin ive been calling the poker guy kingpin sequence

of course daredevil comparisons came to mind for me the moment donnie yens character was introduced then in the poker scene we had the addition of the kingpin and then john wick did the bullseye trick of using a playing card to slash someones throat

i suppose this means that nobodythe tracker must be elektra in this analogy p",2023-03-27
"elite action

maybe on a production scale but all the overchoreographed fight sequences are overwrought and dont know what to do with background characters they just slowly get up from the ground after a single punch and wick miraculously kills them when they are time and time again within a milisecond from pulling the trigger pretty tired of this trope and when john dispenses of a group of guys yet another group of guys just happen to come around the corner the logic is so tonedeaf to the reality of these situations",2023-03-24
" i dont think im crazy to say this is a 1010

not even close to 1010 man",2023-03-25
idk how ballerina can even get close to this,2023-03-24
couldnt agree with you more,2023-03-24
hes set to direct a ghost of tsushima film,2023-03-24
while i completely buy the fantasy aspect of these films and enjoy the  out of it the bulletproof suit “cheat” was a bit overdone and overused in this film particularly  the film even begins with wick being handed his “invulnerability suit” and then he spends half the fights running around pretending to be dracula with his jacket over his face none of the bullets even have weight until they get to massive shotgun slugs it kind of cheapens the action in my opinion thankfully it’s saved by how  gorgeous it all looks but if i had to deduct points for something that would be it,2023-04-03
"because it was cool

that is the guiding principal of this entire franchise

if we started applying logic to it the whole thing would fall apart faster than a house of cards",2023-03-24
the rule of cool,2023-03-25
he seeked refuge there after the killing of the elder it was likely a more geographically convenient place to quickly lay low after what he just did,2023-03-31
"yeah i did think the explanation was weak 

wick knew what would happen if he showed up at osaka this mess was his own making and he just dragged his friend into it i was hoping maybe there would be some back story which meant koji owned him one like saving the daughters life as a child or something",2023-03-28
i heard donnie had a good amount of input to his character and did not become a one dimensional asian gangster villain hiroyuki sanda also got some justice compared to the travesty of a cameo in avengers rina was so great as well,2023-03-24
my buddy and i were in a long queue to get into a random club in berlin and when we finally got to the door the bouncer just shook his head and we were rejected lol i felt like such a loser haha,2023-03-24
dang best wishes man,2023-03-25
"it will get better dude it just takes time

find the woman you can watch the john wick quadrilogy with",2023-03-25
 man i’m really sorry happy that wick helped  fantastic film,2023-03-25
idk man i feel the exact same way watching this movie felt like the turning point of something new truly something special,2023-03-25
i was thinking of samurai champloo ending,2023-03-24
yep thats the first thing i thought of,2023-03-29
pretty positive his reply when winston asked was simply loving husband and not john loving husband but i could be wrong  i like your take though,2023-03-27
that’s exactly what i was thinking thinking maybe john really had no other choice but to go into hiding at this point yeah he’s “free” since he won the duel but is he really either way people will still come after him,2023-03-24
i figured that the graveyard needed full name for the headstone or it was otherwise thought to be better emotionally because its so similar to his wifes,2023-03-31
i have a feeling that since he joined roma ruska again he is jordani once more,2023-04-01
as soon as it started i was like oh  we are on the level of the lobby shooting of the matrix,2023-03-24
i know the high table has an agreement with the authorities but how do you cover up such a scene,2023-03-25
and i think it’s ambiguous enough that everyone can walk away with whichever conclusion is most satisfying to them i think it would be a tall task to continue raising the stakes while still keeping tight hand to hand combat sequences so the conclusion is probably needed but i’m tired of everyone needing to die for there to be closure cough james bond so until they confirm otherwise my cannon is that john wick the killer is dead but john the man is in hiding with the closure he needs,2023-03-29
theres a post credits scene with her going after caine,2023-03-24
yes i liked her character a lot and thought for sure shed team up with john at the end,2023-03-24
i wouldnt mind it this year or next,2023-03-25
i enjoyed the movie but i think you definitely make some valid points,2023-03-24
"honestly im so glad i sorted by controversial and found your comment you have summed up my exact feelings walking out of the theater i rewatched john wick 13 last week before seeing chapter 4 and i remember distinctly walking out of 3 feeling upset at the ending the fact that the writers wanted us to believe john survived such an extreme fall was just too much for a franchise that had always taken itself very seriously when it comes to showing the physical toll these fights taken on our main character

john wick chapter 4 doubles down on these overthetop injuries that john walks away from without a scratch i dont even understand what it adds to the story in previous movies the amount of physical abuse hes taken has been for a purpose or at the very least is used to show us the struggle he endures along the way to reach his goals it also was used to show us more of the world building the continental having an inhouse doctor or the doctor being bound by the rules and having to stop midsurgery when john is cut off from its services in this movie it’s used for no reason other than… well i can’t even think of a sarcastic reason there was no point to have john be hit by multiple cars at full speed or jump out of a 3rd story window and bounce off a car  even the dog gets hit by a car at full speed and bounces off without any injuries john is kicked down probably 10 flights of stairs in a row and stands up like he’s fine its just too disconnected from what we have established before and doesnt actually do anything for the story the suits are apparently magic in this movie in chapter 2 john and cassian shoot each other while both wearing bullet proof suits and they both fall backwards to the ground in pain in this movie people are hit with bullets that just ricochet off of their suit i’m willing to accept bullet proof suits i’m not willing to accept that the person wearing it is 100 unaccepted by the impact

in terms of story continuity i feel like this one is extremely disconnected from 13 we ended 3 with john wanting revenge on the high table after they had sent an adjudicator to  anyone and everyone who had ever aided john along the way winston even shot john wick off the roof to momentarily appease the adjudicator yet she makes no appearance in this movie and isn’t even mentioned i understand she was just acting on behalf of the high table but so were many before her all of which john has taken personal revenge on instead john goes directly to the elder which isn’t even the same elder to get his ring back which he doesn’t even get based on chapter 3 i would have assumed this movie was going to show john going against the high table directly in an attempt to dismantle the entire system but apparently being told that they will just get replaced is all it took for john to give up on that quest even though he’s never given up on anything else that has seemed impossible it’s disappointing that instead of going after the high table itself we were given a villain who is in a position we’ve never heard of before the marquis this guy has a rank and title which are meaningless to the viewer and honestly quite confusing how he is connected to the high table and what his purpose is had the movie been about john working his way to the elder to issue the challenge of a duel that would at least make more sense and conclude the story in a meaningful way

the tracker was the most pointless character in the entire movie he accomplishes nothing in the movie his goals and allegiances flipflop for no real reason and his presence changes nothing in the story he tells john wick that he intends to  him for a bounty but it’s not high enough… and john just walks away from him letting him live that is extremely hard to believe john has killed colleagues who made it clear they were going to try to  him why would john let some unknown guy survive who had just threatened him the tracker then meets the marquis and makes a deal with him even going as far as pulling his hand through a blade to make an agreement an agreement which is ultimately just an open contract for any one to claim he is found by the killas henchmen and brought to the table why would this gang let a stranger into the same room as their boss and john wick they have no idea who he is but he has a gun and a dog so they let him and the dog in then he is present for basically every fight scene doing pointless and unnecessary things that don’t add anything to the plot he then ends the movie by sitting down and watching the duel and even taking a drink when everyone else does yet no one acknowledged him or even cared that he was there because he didn’t even have to be there and his dog was used the exact same way as sophia’s dogs it feels lazy to use the same trick and attacks we already saw way too many times in the previous movie he felt so disconnected even his attire and acting felt like it belonged in a different movie i’m sure they included him to create a spinoff series or film but i’m not interested

the  guy villain i finally looked up his name killa… how original and all the scenes around him were shockingly bad overacted unbelievable  suit and an extremely long and pointless scene with a poker game which led to nothing why have a hand of poker decide things if he was going to cheat anyway john could have used the playing cards without the long drawn out poker scene it was useless to the overall plot in fact why did his “family” send him in to  killa as a hostage this seemed like a perfect opportunity to get a great john wick hunting scene showing him gearing up plotting his attack and executing the plan much like chapter 2 we only got to see that once and i think that would have been a much more interesting plot to follow than just walking him in and seeing him fight his way out we have seen that so many times before the fights outside in the club were a bit more interesting but i don’t even understand why killa was originally running away scared from john but then decides to fight him i feel like they just wanted to recreate that scene from the first john wick in the club but it doesn’t work if killa ultimately fights john moments later i also don’t understand why sometimes the people in the club were concerned about the fighting and killing and then other times they were just dancing around it it was hard to stay immersed when realistically the crowd probably would have ran away fairly early on

and can we talk about that radio station i think it’s dumb that they were stationed in the eiffel tower but whatever… and fine… apparently there is a “secret” radio station that everyone knows to listen to for information and yeah ok they somehow constantly have john wick’s location ready to broadcast everywhere he goes but why the  do we need to have this  voice over telling the “boppers” to go get him every 2 or 3 minutes to break up the fights i get it its a warriors reference we dont need it 6 times within 10 minutes why even have a radio station sending the bounties to cell phones was established for the first 3 movies it was kind of the john wick thing the phones all go off and john knows something is going on and suspects anyone with a phone buzzing

the duel itself being a challenge of pistols was a pretty disappointing choice seeing as john primarily used a pistol for the entire movie you’d think having donnie yen as the challenger the obvious choice would be handtohand combat we saw some of the quick punches caine used in the osaka fight scene which looked amazing yet never got to really see him highlight one of his greatest skills as a martial artist

finally john’s “death” seems so pointless in the grand scheme of the story why was he ok with dying at this moment what did he accomplish that he would feel ready for death he killed the marquis… someone who up until a few days ago he didn’t even know existed he issued this duel to gain his freedom and then was ready to die in the duel after winning the duel the entire movie john is told these people just get replaced so what did it accomplish was it to allow caine to live why he knows akira is going to go after him for vengeance making a sacrifice for caine pointless and john has previously killed friends or colleagues who were trying to  him he has always killed anyone to survive john’s entire motivation in chapter 3 was to continue living to remember his wife why now would  at peace with death

it’s hard to feel satisfied when there are so many issues with plot and motivations throughout the movie i suspect many people who say this was the “best one” either don’t follow the story or don’t care but one of the things that made me such a fan of this franchise was its attention to details and the attempt to make everything seem somewhat believable this one didn’t even seem to focus at all on reloads i don’t want this franchise to be a fast and furious style franchise where every movie gets more and more ridiculous until john wick is shooting people on the moon i like the grounded gritty secret nature of the lore and world building this movie was the definition of style over substance in my opinion i won’t deny the amazing cinematography throughout and some scenes were done rather well but i don’t think the story warranted such a long run time and ultimately the fighting didn’t overcome a very messy and pointless story i’m glad others enjoyed it but i wonder if they just haven’t seen a john wick movie recently watching this one after recently watching 13 the dip in quality is very obvious from the fight choreography to the story acting and special effects this one was very subpar for even a standard action movie let alone part of a franchise with such a high bar for quality",2023-03-26
agree with all this almost no one in the thread is talking about the dodgy cgi the cars in the arc de triomphe section pulled me right out of the movie but the worst offender was the duel it looked so bad you could tell the actors werent actually there all of the shots were blatantly composites and the writing was very poor i dont even understand why clancy brown just called it a day and gave him his freedom at the end still enjoyed it overall but action movies like mad max fury road and the raid 2 are in a different league,2023-03-26
"i respect your opinions i really do and i agree with a lot of your points about the film but i do want to play a bit of devil’s advocate here for the sake of some fun 

the plot felt different because it had to be despite reasons you’ve mentioned for the spinoffs it’s established early on that john killing the high table accomplishes nothing “hercules had his hydra you have your high table” john knows this so he pivots in his revenge mission against the table it’s also clear that john is trying to find a way to conclude the madness or return the chaos unleashed from the pandora’s box after killing santino in the continental initially he thought killing the table would do it but realizes that it won’t do anything instead he has to reset the status quo of the table to a less chaotic time almost a “killing the idea of the table” thing instead of literally killing them conversely that’s what the marquis is trying to do with wick  the idea of wick so the table’s overstretched authority remains unchallenged 

i also see a lot of complaints about why john went to osaka it’s told early on that john has about 23 friends in the world he would trust with his life and koji shimazu was one of them it’s not exactly a stretch for caine to predict that john would go to osaka coupled with the shared history between caine john and shimazu and it’s more believable as for shimazu continuing to fight caine it was simply out of loyal friendship to john “friendship means little when it is convenient” if only everyone had a friend like shimazu 

speaking of that the theme of family is pervasive in the movie shimazu orphaned his daughter out of loyalty to a friend john reingratiated himself with the ruska roma his adoptive family caine’s very deliberate naming implies that he will and does  his brother to save his daughter winston’s last words to john’s gravestone were “farewell my son” not sure if all this means anything just interesting to note 

so anyways creative and design choices aside i don’t think the plot is as leaky as people are making it to be is it as strong as the other movies absolutely not but it’s also not grievously bad either it’s serviceable for what the movie is 

cheers",2023-03-28
"i hated how they overused the bulletproof suits made many scenes feel repetitive and too long

they wanted to conclude the series yet added enough characters and unfinished plotlines to make multiple spinoffs

this movie really felt out of place when compared to the previous 3 dont get me wrong i liked it great movie but nothing like the last john wick movies turned a legend of an assasin feared by all into some supernatural killing machine with unlimited stamina",2023-03-26
" hes supposedly shot with a shotgun point blank and we see his face without even a large bullet hole 

that wasnt a shotgun it was a lever action rifle it fires a bullet not a spray of pellets we see nobody fire it from long distance several times",2023-03-28
"i think you’re totally right the movie was bloated and needed editing badly 

the biggest wth for me was that no one thought to have caine be the one with the serviceattack dog and having him be the one conflicted trying to buy his way out or whatever would have been way more compelling than this random tracker guy whose storyline and motivations were super unresolved we didn’t need two fatherdaughter storylines either just trim caine’s and give him the dog

also it was so unclear why caine would  all the osaka continental folks if he was only there to hunt john wick why not just give us a scene of john and komi fighting side by side against caine and the dog 

and later if we could’ve had john spare caine’s dog the “you owe me” sequence would’ve hit so differently too",2023-03-29
"i know i’ll get downvoted for this but i agree with everything you said i liked john wick 1 because it was tight as  it was only slightly over 90 minutes and they didn’t waste a second of it and it wasn’t ‘turn your brain off’ action it was deliberate and details mattered if i wanted over the top nonsensical and consequencefree i’d watch a fast  furious film

there were absolutely points where i enjoyed the cinematography and the spectacle like the overhead scene but these were exceptions several fight scenes felt interminable  apparently the supply of faceless goons in paris is beyond measure and they’ll happily throw themselves forward to have a go at john despite his reputation wasn’t the first film about how no one will  with him and his now literal invincibility it got to the point where john bounced down the sacre coeur steps seemingly making it impossible for him to reach the duel before sunrise and i could hear ryan george in my head whispering ‘super easy barely an inconvenience’",2023-03-24
"  the whole final scene of the movie is ridiculous theyre absolutely standing in front of a green screen and its obvious

this bugged me the most it looked awful",2023-03-26
"i agree with pretty much everything you said but the action was so well done i was able to mostly ignore the problems i had with the plot and characters

my main gripe was the films length the berlin club scene was unnecessary and should have been cut also while i did laugh at john falling back down the stairs and having to fight his way back up them i think the scene also needed cutting it felt like a bit of a let down after the topdown dragons breath sequence which should have been the final action scene before the duel",2023-03-24
"i must say caine donnie yens rogue one character with his fighting reminded me too much of blinkin from robin hood and his fight scene he felt like a character from some parody what is the point of him not seeing if his hearing isnt improved when he in japan looks for john john replies like a meter away and caine doesnt even know where the sound is coming from and he seems to see everything anyway why not keep him normal instead of pushing it this far it is a cool idea but it didnt made much sense imo it really felt like blinkin came for a visit from a parody movie and they took him too seriously

and john survived so much it felt without weight in the end when we dont even know what can be fatal for john and what cant is being shot into the arm a big deal or not he can survive falling from heights without problems he can survive being hit by a cars multiple times without a problem what can one bullet in the arm mean anyway he walked off worse than that so why should we be too bothered",2023-03-26
"i agree with pretty much everything you said here the ending felt super off with all the damage he sustained winston not being there with him it was all really odd no idea what nobody’s motivation was 20 million is balked at how much does this  guy need 

i get he has a doodle of this mansion and his dog but it’s kinda ridiculous how much he flip flopped 

also his dog just getting rekt by a car and totally fine after was another wild bit

japanese continental caretaker died for no reason he could have just said he didn’t know where john was really weird",2023-03-28
"ive watched 13 countless times and am generally willing to suspend my disbelief for good action movies like this but i definitely felt things dragged on and had very unclearodd choices character motivations were the foggiest bit and made it hard to really get behind any of the side characters

"fully agree this movie felt braindead and the fight scenes dragged on way too long i cant suspend my disbelief when every person in the world is either a club goer a bad driver or an assassin

although i will say that john asking will you take me home was him asking winston to burry him with his wife not literally to take him home alive john knew he was dead",2023-03-25

"edit 326 its been essentially confirmed by the director of the franchise in an interview done by the hollywood reporter that john wick actually dies at the end of the movie 

so yep thats it for the character accomplished nothing but killing a bunch of his friends supposedly wanting to live to keep his wifes memory alive and then once he finally achieves his goal of being left alone he dies 

absolutely worthless",2023-03-26
"i understand your criticisms of the movie but i think youre ignoring that the other movies of the franchise had very similar issues 

john has always gotten  up from fights and then miraculously heals for the next fight the laws of the high table have always been extremely convoluted are we really supposed to believe that there are hundreds of assassins in that park when hes talking with winston what about the ridiculous shootout scene with compton in the subway station johns motivation to keep fighting was complete  in the third movie keanu looks awful in some of the fights of the third movie he was honestly giving me steven seagal vibes during the final fight with the two south asian guys even the first movie which seems to generally be considered the best out of the 4 movies is a very cliche and predictable action movie plot wise some of the dialogue is hilariously bad dont get me started with viggo it would be a footnote on keanus career if it wasnt for the brilliant action scenes and the impeccable aesthetic


but overall my point is that the john wick franchise has always been about keanu killing people in semirealistic ways while looking as cool as possible its most definitely a style over substance franchise and thats perfectly fine not all movies need to follow real world logic
its by far my favorite action movie franchise and the fourth is probably my favorite out of the 4 it doesnt make any less sense than the other movies imho and most of all it is ridiculously entertaining from start to finish it has the best action scenes and it is still beautifully shot scored and directed

it sucks that you didnt enjoy it but i agree with almost everything that has been said about the movie online its a brilliant movie that i see myself revisiting again and again",2023-03-31
" the 30 million bounty is null

i found this chapter of john wick pretty corny for many of the reasons you listed  the dollar amount of the bounty on wick being one of the biggest  the high table the continentals all of it throughout the entire franchise has been nothing short of opulent  it oozes generational wealth like theyve been running things and making money for centuries  and their bounty for killing the biggest threat in the world is a measly 20 million that gradually gets increased throughout the film  it felt like dr evil demanding one million dollars in that austin powers scene  a much larger dollar amount would make more sense to me but so would using some of their inuniverse currency  coins and markers have been the big currency in the wick universe then all of a sudden we just switch to usd mattering out of nowhere",2023-04-10
thank you for writing this im glad im not the only one who doesnt want another  ff franchise also on a related note i just cant believe the  one of the best killersfightersshooters in the world is a blind guy  i mean come on seriously it was over the top and tacky in a superhero movie way like yeah hes so good we had to nerf him by making him blind which sounds okay in comics but completely ridiculous in a serious real movie,2023-04-03
" movie too long

just like this comment holy ",2023-05-24
a car crashing multiple times with headlights still intact and those falls from buildings on stairs i wouldve called it straight trash if werent for that top down scene but im out of the franchise though the makers have lost it,2023-03-24
i think you have a point on a lot of things but provided john wick is actually dead you could easily take his request to winston as bury me with my wife because he has no purpose anymore as the marquis mentioned earlier its not a big leap,2023-03-26
thank  i thought i was going crazy,2023-03-29
"i’m with you for most of what you said 

any scene not involving high table troops is a good scene 
as someone who trains bjj too watching some of the grappling and the intensityease of people falling over was… a lot

"i appreciate your post and hear you about the “realism” of jw1 being thrown out the window but that left the station in jw3 previous movies established that shots to the suit falls from decent heights and standard car hits don’t  or even really incapacitate people here especially wick this movie turned those up a notch but didn’t break those previously established rules

if this movie directly followed jw1 i’d agree it would have felt absolutely jarring but imo it’s not fair to just forget everything that’s been established in 2 and 3 to knock this movie",2023-04-24
"huge fan of wick 13 i still like this movie i really do but i don’t love it

it’s way too long and not much of the story feels different or new was excited to for donnie yen but between daredevil and his turn in rogue one the “blind guy going off” schtick feels a little stale

action scenes were killer no denying that just wish it was a better film",2023-03-25

i agree with a lot of this,2023-03-30
,2023-03-31
yep pretty much my thoughts was rewatching some clips from john wick 1 after seeing chapter 4 and its kind of shocking how much has changed since the series first started in the first movie the action is just so much more tight and the dialogue although nothing special is witty and quick felt like all of the dialogue and acting in chapter 4 made me wince and cringe a lot,2023-04-03
"man i had to scroll way too far to find a critical comment and yours was excellent and put my thoughts perfectly into words 

i think this is the movie where they jumped the shark john just takes too much damage and shrugs it off he is some sort of side kick throughout the first half and we watch random people who we dont care about fighting the armored suits and henchmen are just too convenient and we have to believe that a blind man makes through it alive even winning a duel and yes the overall ridiculousness of the arc de triomphe scene with driverless cars driving at 80 kmh non stop at a roundabout while there are tens of bodies on the street please too much farfetched action finally they add mr nobody to the plot who was just useless except offering some more k9 action in the end he just watches the duel as a spectator somewhere alone and then the dog shows up and pees on the body like they where there all the time 

that said i liked the westernstyle ending with the duel and i hope they dont pull a fast and furious and resurrect him from the grave",2023-04-07
so did you like the movie,2023-03-24
"finally saw this movie today  i loved it and thought it was a great action movie but i mostly agree with all of the points you made especially the egregious cgi during the arc de triomphe sequence and the terrible green screening in the burned out continental and duel scenes oh and also how nothing narratively makes sense lol

i saw somebody say this movie is supposedly the originally planned part 4 and part 5 mashed into one which might not be true but its a great way to describe how it feels its as if they had only the important narrative scenes from one film but the filler from two with a lot of missing context why is john in the desert at the beginning just to  a different elder how is john teleporting around the world why does the harbinger not explain what caine being nominated actually means during the meeting unlike every other rule it is never explained why john goes to japan just to leave on his own anyways and then the duel has the really strange and over dramatic writing the tracker being in a weird closeup shot and in none of the wides and john slowly walking down the stairs alone while winston just stands there after telling john  take him home

but yeah despite the dialogue driven scenes being boring and sluggish and the few weird visual choices the action and cinematography wow is this a pretty movie are so engaging and give my monkey brain lots of dopamine also i loved the bit where he fell down the stairs

"i agree with everything you said 

 whats the point of john winning and liberating himself in such a specific way if hes gonna die afterward

probably just the idea of john becoming a saint and showing that you can actually leave the high table 

 who is the tracker character exactly

i assumed the tracker character was the son of the concierge makes sense cause of their love for dogs and that he is hunting john wick down to get at the people who killed his father

 why does wilson just let john pass outbleed out on the stairs after he just said hed help him get home there is literally no one around as hes dying

yeah this part seemed weird as well i just assumed john just wanted to rest a bit and then winston will get some doctors to come patch him up and then bring him back to new york

 and then the dog  on him and everyone in my theatre laughed 

yeah the comedy  was placed at such a weird time really out of place and i hated it",2023-03-27
"i didnt find the cgi particularly bad

edit arent those cars only going like 35",2023-04-01
i felt the same the cgi at the end pulled me out  i loved jw1 liked jw2 was so so about jw3 and felt this was the weakest one in terms of story ie not doing action for actions sake  i liked it and im happy other people loved it but to me it was the weakest entry,2023-03-31
"the ending just makes everything pointless what was the point of lance reddicks character dying and the continental being blown up if its all going back to normal in the end what was all that killing for the high table is still active and nothing has changed so its not like john made any impact what about staying alive to keep the memory of his wife and those who died alive with him

especially considering the end of jw3 the high table basically agree to let winston reopen  so this seems to pick up just a few weeks after the end of jw3 and what they are closing it down now  didnt really make sense",2023-03-31
my biggest agree will be the wavering suspension of disbelief as he gets beaten up more and more,2023-04-28

"i didn’t read it allsorry man that  is long but i saw you saying the cgi was faked and how it was a lot seeing him not get injuries and yeah i gotta agree…

fun movie but you just have to go with it to enjoy it",2023-03-24
we see him passing out at the end maybe he dies maybe he doesnt if he didnt really die then the reason for him to fake his death is so that he will be left alone and can live a life free of being an assassin who knows when the high table will make up some new arbitrary rule that will pull john back in or some person from his past comes up with a marker that forces john to do their bidding,2023-03-26
you are so right my wife and i rewatched 2 and 3 before this one and the differences are obvious so many things just did not make sense the action scenes were exciting but there was too much talking,2023-04-22
"i just got around to watching the movie and i was shocked to find so few complaints your write up is very similar to my thoughts like yes i enjoyed most of the movie especially the top down scene in paris  but i was highly disappointed by many parts as well 

the osaka fight broke my suspension of disbelief so many times with the bulletproof armor a couple of the scenes people were getting knocked around when shot even if they werent injured and then seconds later some dude in a magic bulletproof suit isnt even flinching while bullets bounce off of him

and yeah the tracker felt completely pointless obviously just in the movie to include a dog 

and the complete lack of any thing to do with actually attacking the high table the summary of the movie on amazon says its about finding a path to defeat the high table john just apparently died basically killing the high tables dog 

definitely nowhere near as good as i was hoping from all the praise",2023-08-26

1 is set up way back in the first movie the police does not get involved as long as innocent people are not being targeted,2023-03-24
"1 the high table has infiltrated all levels of government and societal institution 

2 anyone can be part of the high table  they are anonymous yet walk among us 

3 real life version of omar from the wire jumped out of a much higher building and survived in the show the wire they made it lower just so audiences would believe it",2023-03-24
3 eh i guess 007 wouldnt either lol,2023-03-24
"the series has and will always avoid the logic of police doing their jobs 

also rule of cool applies a lot to john wick",2023-03-25
matrix training program for an early neo iteration oo,2023-03-25
i felt like there was a lot of unnecessary rolling on the floor going on in all of the fight scenes to the point that john would have a good shot at someone when stood up but would for some reason keep rolypolying under the goons legs,2023-03-24
yeah they went a little too far with the unrealism i liked how it was in the second but this movie had more unrealisim and just pushed it too far… considering he fell on his back and got hit by multiple cars like it was nothing,2023-03-24
your take is valid  to be fair though even the bad guys had the amount of damage they could take amped up to 11  some dudes had to be shot like 6 times to do down,2023-03-27
always has been but at least the action is superbly crafted and thats the main draw of this franchise,2023-03-27
and each film is progressively longer and more overstuffed with more characters at least the first film is lean,2023-03-25
"im a bit higher on it than you i think but the effusive praise is pretty wild to me some of the action was genuinely exhausting and felt repetitive after the first 3 movies 

redeems itself a bit from the hotline miami scene on but i was really struggling to connect with it before then

x200b

donnie yen is great tho",2023-03-24
"im with you at this point i really do hope that this is the final film in the series forever it ended perfectly i do love the films i enjoy them quite a lot but i just find myself getting so exhausted by how long the action scenes are and how much theyre trying to top the previous films action scenes that i struggle to enjoy them 

bulletproof suits was a novel idea in jw2 when it was only john who used them now that everyone uses them its too much i liked the fully armored soldiers from jw3 and the armored samurai in jw4 i thought they were really unique bad guys but they sort of became redundant when you realise the full armor isnt needed and they can just wear bulletproof suits

i agree about the topdown sequence it was the best action scene in the film i loved the logistics of it it was just cool seeing an action scene from that kind of perspective normally its up close and sometimes you cant quite make out whats happening because it moves too fast but seeing it from a topdown view allowed you to see all of the different actors and stuntmen move through the scene quite clearly youre not just watching john youre watching everyone",2023-03-25
i have a lot of the same feelings the first movie was a tight fun action movie with just a little hint of interesting world building fast forward to this movie and every scene is either exposition dumps characters walking dramatically or incredibly overlong action scenes john wick isnt even a human character anymore hes a murderbot that exists to  and receive lore,2023-03-24
"im with you on that i loved the first one with all the world building and john wick actually emoting grieving for willem dafoes character his yeah im thinking im back speech plus his interactions with the antagonists in the other movies being seeing you with ruby roses character professional courtesy with commons character the fan boys with mark dacascos and the raid guys 

i dont know if john wick said a sentence with more than 5 words in this movie or talked to marquis or chidi

i loved caines fighting style and the osaka scenes although i wanted to see more of the sumo wrestlers the top down scene where you can see them shoot through the walls was amazing",2023-03-24
i feel the same way i also felt like i didn’t understand a lot of the characters motivations i also wonder what sort of exoskeleton john has got under that suit because the amount of back breaking falls this man took,2023-03-24
"its been this way after the first one there’s no stakes there’s no uncertainty on wick and the enemies he just does super clearly choreographed  spree that looks more like a silly music video than any real combat at this point

i dont know how people enjoy this action is cool but it works if you care not just because it’s choreographed well with cool visuals",2023-03-24
its pretty bad the action is bland and the plot makes no sense if you liked the first one i would argue that you do in fact have an eye for good action choreography since then its been pretty meh,2023-04-11
yeah i liked it but same feel like it keeps chasing the high of how cool chapter 2 was and doesnt quite nail it despite the highest efforts in its scale stunts and choreography,2023-03-24
everyone has them now because they are high table assassins which is why john already had one in the first movie plus when dollar amount is so high you are gonna get the best of the best,2023-04-01
my man is just the inverse of the tarnished,2023-03-26
"didnt the marquis say that seconds are killed if the primary loses so why is caine still alive

the way i interpreted  it was that he became his own second when he took the gun back from caine but i could be wrong  didnt he also mumble something about caine being relieved of his obligations",2023-03-28
"  turned into live action anime

it certainly is way better at being a live action anime than other live action movies that were actually based off anime",2023-04-03
you’ve summed up my thoughts on the film lol such a fun ott badass flick,2023-04-03
his notebook has a picture of a house and a price of 459 ish million written under it he shows it at one point,2023-03-25
in the kitchen right yeah thats definitely a reference to it,2023-03-25
yes it was a reference to ip man and also the windup punch is also another reference to donnie yens fight scene in flashpoint,2023-03-26
these are all good points  and as others here have pointed out not only was there grass on the grave indicating it was never dug but also when winston and bowery king started to walk away from the grave the dog begins to head in a different direction at first possible toward where wick actually was somewhere off screen,2023-03-27
" poor choreographed fighting sequences

lol",2023-03-24
"poor choreographed fighting sequences

well you can certainly have other criticisms about the movie such as the dialogue writing and the acting from keanu but this one is certainly not one of them lol this movies fight choreography is one of the best weve ever seen in film",2023-03-24
did you like other john wick films i liked the other one they threw out the creator of john wick and screen play writer for rest of the films in this movie  it clearly shows derek kolsted was not involved in the movie hence the movie seems like a shadow of its previous ones,2023-03-24
exactly this movie was generic as  first part was so  good,2023-03-26
bad choreography  sure bud,2023-03-24
"  poor choreographed fighting sequences

oh wow",2023-03-27
glad you called out john seemingly going from realistic bullet count in the first film to seemingly activating his unlimited ammo cheat in this film,2023-03-25
completely agree about taking everything bad from 3 and making it worse,2023-03-24
he added a wild card factor to the movie someone who is just in it for the money and who is unconnected to everybody else in the story plus it was cooler to seeing the blind character rely on only his senses and nothing else to fight,2023-03-24
yes i almost feel confused that something is wrong with me  but in reality i was just expecting somewhat grounded action film like first three movies 3rd started this way over the top trend but was still managable this feels like a superhero movie with guns and without costumes its like fast and furious 5 beginning of the end of the franchise for me also the whole high table was way better in small scale now its just bad and you can see they want to create massive universe but it just doesnt work i think i respect that people like it so much its probably not for me anymore chapter 2 will stay as my favourite one,2023-03-28
lol  the phantom opera  i agree completely felt like two kids with capes on a playground lifting them at each other going invincible shield invincible shield,2023-03-29
it was a biblical epic of a 4dx chair ride for sure,2023-03-24
any rain effects,2023-03-24
yeah gotta remind yourself it’s just silly fun… or john wick is like a genetic  has he even slept,2023-03-24
"the one the marquise was in front of was liberty leading the people from which you can draw a couple things out of i like to think that the marquise in his hubris sees himself as liberty but in reality its wick

pretty sure the one winston stopped in front of is the raft of the medusa from which you could draw connections of winston being cast adrift from the continental and fighting for survivala glimpse of hope

scene was set in the louvre specifically this room",2023-03-24
it didn’t make sense for john to be waiting in osaka with the guys daughter motionless when he knew people were coming for him,2023-04-01
dude im totally with you on a majority of these points,2023-03-25
i am with you on feeling insane after seeing commentsreviews this felt like a nightandday difference in quality in comparison to jw1 or 3,2023-03-25
i dont think you know what the word objectively means,2023-03-24
it did get a bit repetitive i still think i have 4 edging out 2 even the villain was a repeat basically the same guy as part 2,2023-03-26
i thought 3 was the worst by far the pacing grinds to a halt halfway through,2023-03-25
“should it be considered critically acclaimed” is a weird  way of putting it since whether something is critically acclaimed is objective whether or not critics acclaimed it perhaps you meant “should it have been acclaimed by critics”,2023-03-26
the lighting and cinematography should be critically acclaimed,2023-04-16
"and i get that they wrote themselves into a corner and they didnt want to go the route they had seemingly considered overthrowing the high table

this is the problem i had from the jw3 trailers i assumed that john would be trying to overthrow the high table but halfway through it goes in a different direction jw3 ends by setting up the plot of jw4 john finally overthrowing the high table jw4 starts with john making it clear that hes finally gonna go to war against the high table but halfway through it changes direction again and introduces the idea of a duel 

it felt like it didnt know where it wanted to go jw2 ended with a pretty clear idea of where jw3 will go john is on the run so he goes up against the high table to earn his freedom but jw3 and jw4 both discard that plot point halfway through in each film and decide to go elsewhere it was very messy",2023-03-25
"im with you buddy the action was cool everything was really cool but all of it was meaningless john shows up in osaka the bad guys can simply guess hes there and it gets everybody killed except for one character who disappears to a spinoff and john walks away having accomplished nothing hunter shows up and seems to play both sides ultimately leading to absolutely nothing he took like one shot to help john during that stair sequence and his one shot didnt even  the guy he was shooting the marquis the movies main villain comes out of nowhere is completely untouchable right up until the moment hes allowed to die even though john wick can singlehandedly wipe out the entire criminal underbelly of several cities over the course of a couple of weeks there remain people who are untouchable to him it feels like winston and the writers can just come up with any rules they want at any moment seemingly just to prolong the script how do we  the marquis lets dust off the rules of single combat but you cant just challenge him youve got a whole quest line to action scene your way through 

i could just keep ranting the story and characters are all just surface level deep and it did not make for a good experience for me",2023-03-24
" furthermore the killing of the high table elder was so shoehorned in it was absolutely disorienting and served very little purpose it felt like a quest in skyrim that you never checked in to finish so the marker has been sitting on your map for days and days until you finally fast travel there to talk to the npc and watch a cutscene to officially complete the quest

yeah i felt like the opening was quite frankly awful compared to the rest of the movie and what we see john wick on a horse chasing 3 guys and taking wild potshots was terrible 

i almost wonder if the scene with the harbinger and the continental was supposed to be the opening then they realized that they couldnt have the titular character only show up during the osaka sequence so they quick threw that together",2023-03-28
"upvoted for sharing your opinion and adding to the discussion

regarding killing the elder this is the event that alerts the high table that john wick lives and is a threat marquis doesnt come around if john doesnt  the elder john also explicitly states that he went to the elder to take back his ring and from his perspective it does make sense that this is the first of his targets after healing up from his injuries in chapter 3

i agree in part with your points around osaka from a narrative perspective the only explanation for john going there is that new york would likely be found way too quickly by the marquis and that the osaka manager was one of his few friends that he had left i do think from a thematic perspective osaka is important to highlight the bond of brotherhood between john shimazu and caine this point could have hit much harder if the relationships were introduced earlier in the series but i found the dialog exposition adequate to convey that having caine  his brother here ties into this and sets up a small emotional arc between him and john for the rest of the film

just wanted to share my take on these 2 points im sorry that you didnt like the movie as youd hope but at the end of the day you like what you like and who cares what other random people on the internet say youre supposed to enjoy ",2023-03-27
the world felt empty like a buggy videogame the drivers literally disappeared from their cars ffs,2023-03-24
"glad to hear this comment as it make me have hope for the first movie which ive yet to watch

this one was boring had like 7 or 8 coolmoments donnie yen was cool but thats about it",2023-05-07
i agree— those fight scenes were way too long i was bored by each fight scene after the first 10 minutes,2023-03-26
i think a lot of people think way to hard with these movies  a movie doesnt always have to tie in to our reality you dont watch a fantasy movie and say i dont think those elves ears were long enough in this universe there are assassins and a crime syndicate that spans globally if a movie wants to have bullet proof clothing then  it let it have it its a turn off your brain for the most part type of movie and most people know this going into it but if you didnt personally enjoy then it is what it is and thats fair,2023-03-27
exactly it’s like they didn’t put any efforts everything was generic,2023-03-26
also he took the craziest detour in paris the route made no sense at some point i expected he will go though versailles just to show everything but yes i get it its for stylistic purposes,2023-03-26
i agree 100,2023-03-25
stahelski said he modeled this film after the good the bad and the  which also takes an hour and a half until the plot in that film kicks in wonder if that was intentional ,2023-03-24
yep when john spoke to caine it imo was john giving a signal to him john isnt dead and was shot in same area as the doctor with non lethal wounds  he passed out on the stairswinston took him home and he knows john is out there somewhere  who knowswhat winston said,2023-03-26
what doctor but yeah they shot themselves in same places but i cant recall any doctorlol,2023-03-26
i still will never believe a blind man was able to accurately shoot john in pre determined spots,2023-03-26
agreed 100,2023-03-27
"i dont think its the greatest action film of all time but i thought it was entertaining    


 i have to think about what is the greatest but my knee  reaction would be  raiders of the lost ark  


fortunately for keanu he learned pick roles that suit is acting style  have you seen his early movies where more acting was required  boy does he really   


now he plays characters that are innately wooden or even ossified and he performs them splendidly",2023-03-28
i think we are in the minority but i agree with all you said i loved the series but i think its getting a bit too over the top now its i couldnt help but feel like lionsgate studios want their own fast and furious both franchise defy science and rely on stunts although i love and respect the amazingly shot and choreographed stunts of jw i think its time to end it,2023-04-11
weight of the cards,2023-04-14
did he know that he got four nines  i thought he just went with whatever cards he was dealt and scott adkinss character said what he got once the cards were revealed its been a bit since i saw the movie but i know he didnt even bother to change or even check his cards likely because it wouldnt make a difference to him  i doubt the cards had braille on them or any other distinguishing features,2023-04-09
"supposedly its possible to actually feel the difference between different types of ink but its borderline superpower stuff

my personal theory is that hes only partially blind bad enough that he cant tell if john is dead when hes lying on the ground but good enough that he can fight",2023-04-18
same it was my favorite fight all that water and axes the music during the fight was amazing,2023-04-09
my headcannon is that the adrenaline and training keep them going through the pain of handgun shots but yeah in the first movie that established its still supposed to hurt and now everyones shrugging anything short of shotguns off,2023-03-25
they’ve had bullet proof suits since the first movie ,2023-03-25
i agree it felt like it was mostly rehashing the same action choreography that the other movies did and which was already starting to get stale by the third movie,2023-04-04
"being too long and too boring


but you just said we cant compare this to fury road  but you just pointed out something they both have in common  so which is it",2023-03-28
"the fights were repetitive the only different was vs the  one but the others the same and the same and the same jiujitsu superhuman thing

i love john wick but i was more styles different types of fights or encounters no just the same 100 men vs 1 with the same style and the same techniques

three things break this movie to me the over use of the antibullet suits  some fights looks like childs playing with invisible shields  the lack of fightings styles  the same superjiujitsu thing all time over all movie  and the lack of deep in the world  like dont show the hightables characters or the lack of differents iconic gangs or the super swat guys that in this movie are made of paper ",2023-04-10
how were the fight scenes in 1 or 2 more clever than 4,2023-03-26
you missed the best part of the film but it wasnt that great overall,2023-03-29
oh you idiot thats when it blasts off into space,2023-03-24
yeah i dont really mind because everything theyre doing is so ridiculous but in this one more than any other i was very distracted by that maneuver and after a while its pretty darn unbelievable that so many professional killers could not manage to shoot a guy that very often does not have the high ground  also felt more noticeable here than the other movies just seeing all the attackers wait to attack him or wait to start shooting him jw2 still gets my vote for favorite in terms of striking a balance of campiness while still managing to keep me in the film but they did hit him with nine cars so i dont want to complain too much unless we are complaining about him not getting hit by enough cars,2023-03-24
how come those suits aren’t worn by everyone so many of the dudes chasing the bounty were just wearing regular adidas tracksuits or something is it cost prohibitive do you need a referral i don’t understand,2023-03-24
"there’s a lot more power in a shotgun a ridiculous amount it’s not like in games where you only have a few meters of range

a shotgun will  an entire wall and leave a big hole it makes complete sense",2023-03-24
deus ex machina can write john into increasingly more insane scenes with no escape,2023-03-24
"the bulletproof eveningwear was introduced in previous john wicks but they made a point of showing how badly it  him up when a bullet hit it and then in this one hes climbing 200 steps using a nothing more than a handrail as cover from a hail of gunfire from trained assassins and its just fine somehow

i get that theyve gotta go bigger than each previous movie but i wish theyd have found a more creative way to do it",2023-03-27
this series reminds me of rambo first blood was great but then they turned up the  dial with the sequels,2023-04-01
youre not alone me and my buddy walked out on the movie,2023-03-30
surprised there was so much praise ik it’s just supposed to be action but like plot and writing felt so corny,2023-03-30
you gave this a 910 on action i mean compared to normal action films sure but with the expectations of a wick film this was weak,2023-03-29
i’m not normally one to notice bad acting but holy  was keanu awful idk if it was intentional or if he just didn’t give a  but man was it bad,2023-03-25
"yh he didnt even say much and the lined he said were verystale

needed that donnie energy",2023-03-28
"yep definitely sad too cause it got so much hype i thought i was going to feel something more

my list would do wick 2134",2023-03-29
according to audience scores and critics no one agrees with you,2023-03-26
yeah it wasn’t a good french accent but at least it wasn’t overthetop buffoonish and it made him more hateable,2023-03-24
ours did it at the end,2023-03-24
mine did the studio did their best to attach it to all the screenings but said some missed out,2023-03-25
no not that i noticed my screening started with the theater playing fury of the gods before people ran out to tell them that the wrong movie was playing,2023-03-24
i feel like nobody was supposed to represent the audience,2023-03-24
due to inflation his bounty shouldve been 75 million,2023-03-24
especially with the odds of death i feel like there are significantly less risky ways to make 40 million,2023-03-25
haha i was just thinking the same thing if it were that cheap to have someone offed elon would be popping off,2023-03-24
all of them are classics,2023-03-25
if john can have plot armor why not marko  zaror thats actually a running gag throughout the film killa also revives once,2023-03-25
shang chi wasnt bad at all hand to hand wise that bus sequence is still amazing,2023-03-26
maybe he had not been fighting for a while and not in peak shape physically and mentally whereas in this movie he was seen training so he was in peak shape completely focused to ,2023-03-26
in cantonese,2023-03-27
it was intended to be funny,2023-03-28
im just wondering why they didnt show at least one fight scene with assassins trying to claim his bounty in one of the airports also how was he able to travel across the world so easily but back in 3 he had to punch his ticket just to gain safe passage to morocco,2023-04-01
good thing the franchise ended,2023-03-26
ohh did those scenes like take you out of the movie watching experience how did they make you feel i also noticed the little things youve mentioned like the fight scene in osaka or the dancers not giving a  berlin lol,2023-03-24
and that  guy is scott atkins yuri boyka and bodyguard of french is marko zaror his enemy in unduspited 3 awesome casting,2023-03-24
from what i understand chad has basically stated theyre taking a break and eventually he and keanu are going to sit down and see if they can come up with a cool idea for another one,2023-03-24
not really wishful thinking it just absolutely feels that way and imo they are absolutely leaving it open to the possibility,2023-03-24
"i agree strictly as a stand alone action movie it serves its purpose and delivers some exciting action but as a john wick movie it is repetitive and doesnt innovate much from the other movies 

im seeing a lot of comments from people who only saw the first one or who dont really care about the story ive seen people say that this is a perfect sendoff for john wick but i fail to see how john dying at the point makes any sense to his story at all what has he accomplished in this movie i suspect no one will be able to answer this and most will suggest im overthinking it but i was invested in the story and you are right the original creator who wrote the previous three films was not involved at all for this one and you can definitely tell",2023-03-25
thank you i was thinking this the whole time watching the movie the action was good but felt to repetitive and nothing new and creative except for the fire shotgun,2023-03-31
i am guessing that you hate that its nonstop action,2023-03-25
yeah this movie was nonsensical,2023-05-26
that entire section in japan felt like it was just setting up a spinoff which given the end credits scene im assuming is the case,2023-04-21
it wasn’t just me then i basically felt no emotional investment whatsoever and my mind wandered until basically the third act mostly because i liked caine and wanted to see how they’d resolve the duel in my view that was a mixed bag,2023-03-27
yeah after 4 movies its been established that he is untouchable its just a question of lets see how john wick kills a whole bunch of people in this next scene maybe throw in a hey bro moment where he lets some random person live,2023-03-26
"i think your rant is largely unintelligible but agree completely with your points

donnie yens blind thing makes no  sense hes actually blind theres no way hes keeping up with wick in a fight if hes blind like that why did they feel the need to make donnie yen blind",2023-03-29
"john had to hide out with his friends thats why he went to osaka to one of his friends

once the marquis told the blind guy that he and his daughter were free im assuming that absolved him of having to die if the marquis died since the marquis thought it was all over and couldnt possibly lose he basically was saying the blind guy was not his second anymore",2023-03-26
one would assume the marquis is protected by the high table killing him outside of a duel would probably be signing your own death warrant,2023-03-26
noticed way less tumbling around wonder if keanu was nursing injury or just age or something choreo wasnt as clean as earlier movies and jackie chan defs would have had reshoots,2023-03-24
i think this is an example of critics pandering to their audience to some extent metacritic score went from 68 for the first movie to 78 for this one the first movie was the worstreviewed of the franchise even though they are all basically the same,2023-03-24
the acting is incredibly bad from everyone it literally looks like the actors are reading the lines for the first time,2023-04-11
you are right movie was horrible there was way too much action and 0 plot,2023-04-03
similar response from me,2023-04-04
"yep enjoyed the film but i do have eyes more digitization in this one than any previous one  really distracting  i like all of the big sprawling backgrounds but there was a lot of green screen and a lot of little things like the dog getting hit by the car and then growling was way too much cg looked about as real as one of the live action 101 dalmatian puppies from 20 years ago  

i was having the same thought as i could not tell if it was my cinema screen or the backgrounds themselves but i saw lots of vertical lines  lots going on though",2023-03-24
"arc de triomphe

this one was egregious to me and was really taking me out of it reminded me of the mission impossible scene in the same place and how much more effective it was",2023-03-24
the green screen effect was very noticeable,2023-03-24
"i noticed this with the blood spatters pretty much from the beginning of the movie must have changed their effects pack or something because the quality was wayyyyy down 

only time im against cgi is when its done poorly and this had far too many examples of that to count

edit i just remembered the cgi cars in the background during the arc de triumph scene atrocious some of them looked so out of place it reminded me of the hydrogen truck scene from drive angry 3d",2023-03-26
i didn’t notice much cgi maybe 5 cgi used in this film,2023-03-24
and the top down gods view action sequence was oh  i didnt want it to end,2023-03-24
yeah you can take him out of the story and nothing would be missed but at the same time i didnt hate him,2023-03-29
just to show another assassin going after john this one very dedicated only to give up just like rest of them  the ones that fight john either die or give up lol  as far as his back and forth lol i took it as him lying to john and sizing him up  hes getting a read on john only to turn on him later  predatory assassin imo,2023-03-30
yeah i feel like at a certain point basic self preservation kicks in and the hunters acknowledge the literal hundreds of people that have failed,2023-03-25
thats my thing like hes obviously a legend  theres way too many people trying him lol,2023-03-24
yeah i have blast watching it in imax,2023-03-24
the audio was really goodimpactful in imax at my theater,2023-03-24
"i saw it in dolby after our imax showing broke and we had to go to a different showing i didnt miss the imax and im hearing the sound and colors improvement in dolby showings make dolby more worth it for this movie over imax

",2023-03-27
i’m still not sure he’s actually in the ground tbh isn’t there mean to be a chapter 5,2023-03-25
it would be really dumb to bring him back imo i feel like he got an appropriate ending what would another movie even be about i didn’t feel much when he died it was foreshadowed so much in the movie that everyone knew it would happen,2023-03-26
the two people that exited the theater maybe twenty seconds before he died “died” had my blood boilin it took me out of it it didn’t seem like he had been wounded enough where was the mouth blood,2023-03-26
yeah i think they had similar face masks with those weird crooked noses on them to i guess instill fear in others,2023-03-26
stahelski said barry lyndon was a influence for this there were def some references throughout the film,2023-03-27
"one of my favorite shots of the whole movie was winston coming to bring the dual terms

i wish they would have made winston coming up with a plan a larger part of the movie i feel like the movie could have benefited from a bunch of more quiet scenes",2023-03-27
i’ve seen people say the third one is the weakest in the franchise i disagree on that statement but many think the first one is the strongest due to the simplicity of it,2023-03-27
yeah they really used that too much in this movie  it was cool a few times in the last 3 movies but i didn’t like it being in every single fight,2023-03-29
"yeah i was thinking some of the same things this is just as dumb as a lot of things that people talk  about but this gets a lot less hate

i think part of it makes the john wick movies get a bit more respect is the technical aspects the photography and art direction are pretty amazing  putting everything in a world that is drenched in really classy looking art and architecture elevates the world 

setting otherwise boring plot exposition scenes in really gorgeous locations helps a lot",2023-04-04
i think jw gets a big pass because whatever shortcomings it has with storyscript it makes up for the intricate action choreography you can even argue that it takes a lot more effort and energy to memorize all your stunt sequences than a scriptmonologue meanwhile ff just cgi everything so it less respected,2023-04-11
have you not seen the other movies the general public knows about the existence of this assassin underworld and they just leave them to do their thing because the assassins dont bother civilians,2023-04-07
they know better,2023-04-09
"before i watched the clip i might have disagreed but after watching the scene for the first time in a few years i see were you are coming from

the look he gives as he kills the first guard with the knife was an intensity that was missing from the later movies plus it is well paced and not overdone hopefully any future spinoffs can capture a little more the magic of the first movie",2023-04-16
tbh i loved that dumb  but i get it,2023-06-11
while i get the repetitive bit they did a lot to keep things varied from the setting to the weapons used,2023-03-24
it didn’t feel repetitive for me at all i was just in awe of the stunt work plus the gorgeous cinematography,2023-03-24
john didnt just lose the duel to spare caine he also did it so he could shoot the marquis with no consequences,2023-03-26
chapter 3 closed the book on this,2023-03-24
"hes a man who acts but doesnt necessarily plan his each step and every move perhaps he leaves it up to the person he approaches to turn him away every person has agency to act on their own for example him going to the roma ruska and not thinking theyd hang him to die or maybe he did think it but we the audience werent shown

but either way i agree with you about how akira felt but it seems like her father was the type to stick to his own moral code regardless of what the high table wanted him to do especially if it meant betraying his values",2023-03-24
yh it seemed very weak of his charecter this  was his own mess and just throwing his friend into this for no reason seemed very selfish akira has more reason to have gone after wick than caine heck caine even told him to leave with his daughter,2023-03-28
"man i thought i was the only one to think of all of these points 
 
i got out of the movie thinking this is just white rbollywoodrealism 
 
none of the socalled assassinsthugs know how to shoot apparently 
 
it was just a terrible mess in terms of storyline acting and even dialogue 
 
i asked earlier here if anyone knows what was the point of mr nobody initially i thought he was somehow related to sofia from the last movie especially because they both had the same dogs 
 
they could have taken 5 mins of the 3 hours slugfest to just explain why did he  the elder what happened to the earlier elder",2023-03-29
he’s an awful actor lol great dude but acting isn’t his strong suit,2023-03-25
yeah he’s pretty bad lol watch dracula for a good laugh,2023-03-25
the physicality that he brings to his roles is amazing though i thought he did a good job in point break speed and the devil’s advocate also i’m my opinion he’s perfect for the matrix and john wick,2023-03-25
"i want you to know that i watched this movie having seen none of the others essentially knowing nothing about this movie at all and felt the exact same way the acting was so bad and the action so overthetop i started wondering if it werent actually a sort of brilliant comedy selfconsciously taking itself to extremes in the service of its surreal humor

at some point i turned to my friend and whispered hey is this one of those comic book adaptations and with that fact confirmed was able to relax into a sort of dreamy enjoyment of the stylistic visuals and choreography a lot of the reviews call the fight scenes balletic but ballet is fundamentally about emotion and experiencing emotional range and jw4 seems more about mimicking the trance state of a 12hour fps session but with better visuals 

i think instead of so bad its good for me it was more like so bad its somehow tolerable i like jackie chan guy ritchie  tarantino and can get into silly action comedies but i dunno",2023-03-26
"i dont think you are wrong

my audience laughed when he was doing donuts around 12 guys who couldnt even hit the car let alone him while sitting fully exposed without a door",2023-03-26
that’s how i felt i’m okay with them leaning into the nonsense of it and channeling the ridiculousness of some past action franchises  but this is a franchise that first became popular and well rated because it was regarded as the most realistic one to date so now it feels weird that they try to balance out the hyper realism with the extreme opposite of it,2023-03-29
because,2023-03-25
"you could watch this movie without watching the previous movies however some scenes and characters will not have as much of an impact since you dont have any background context with them you should at least watch 1 and if you have time 3 its been forever since ive watched 2 and my viewing experience was not negatively affected by not remembering it

or if youre really strapped for time you can watch recap videos of the movies on youtube they describe the movies in like 10 minutes or less just so that youre caught up",2023-03-24
you should check all of them out,2023-03-24
honestly feel you should just watch all of them whats great about this movie has been present since the first one the whole series is just so  good,2023-03-24
i cant speak for everyone but for me the raid movies are still a level up from john wick in terms of action,2023-03-24
no,2023-03-24
i love the raid 2 prefer it to the raid i also loved john wick 4,2023-03-24
they are all very interconnected one starts where the previous finishes not much will make sense if you just jump into 4 this is not marvel,2023-03-24
strongly recommend seeing the first 3 to understand the overall story and motives of the characters,2023-03-24
the first three are great films you should check it out,2023-03-25
doom music kicks in,2023-03-25
ty i was too afraid to ask lol,2023-03-25
hopefully not romania look how that turned out for the tates lol,2023-03-25
during that whole scene i was wondering how drugged up were all those dancers to not react to people getting shot and axed in front of them,2023-03-25
"that’s my biggest gripe with the other john wick films too you really need to turn your brain off to enjoy them sometimes the club fight scene and the paris car scene felt so  goofy to me i almost laughed from how absurd it all was i know it’s a movie about assassins and  but come on at least try to ground it a little bit in reality 

the birds eye view scene was by far my favorite i don’t think i’ve seen another movie with a shot like that and i loved it",2023-03-26
it’s the suit lol,2023-03-26
it took me a while to get used to that i went to a theater id never been to before and their sound system was so killer that my seat was vibrating during those opening punches,2023-03-26
"in john wick 3 the elder says okay last chance well lift the  order on you if cut off your finger with your wedding ring on it then go  winston 

he doesnt  winston he goes to the new elder to try and get the order lifted anyway and take back his finger oath the elder is like bruh nobody will ever lift the  order after you wasted your last chance john kills him as a loose ends kind of thing the elder is just one more person whos going to come after him",2023-03-26
didnt get the russian scene either why didnt the blind guy or nobody try to  him right then and there or when the action started they had every reason to and it wasnt the continental,2023-03-26
he and caine show that john isnt the only asssssin who hates it and wants to quit john choosing to save a dog rather than  a foe proves the bad guys wrong when they said being a killer was his nature,2023-03-26
johns not dead  knowing thisthe movie is much better,2023-03-26
"i never understand takes like this do you really think a person could look at it rationally when their parent gets killed right in front of them

i agree i would like to see a movie with her and caine working together though",2023-03-26
why akira doesnt help her father anyway she is literally holding the loaded gun in her right hand the entire time as far as metro where she meets john she could shoot caine at any time honor or something to not get involved between her father and him but when caine is leaving her she could shoot no problem,2023-03-26
i had the same thought  cain is clearly leaving and possibly allowing her father to live but he decides to try to stab him in the back when hes not looking    thats what villains do in 99 of all movies so not quite sure if we are supposed to feel bad for her and him,2023-03-26
think it’s better this way while it was a bit on the nose the amount of times it was said he could never have a normal life or happy life this is what he is and was he’s an anti hero there is no happy ending,2023-03-26
it could have even been more vague than that and people would have been happy   just cut to the dog looking off screen cause he saw someone then credits,2023-03-26
that poker scene turned out to be a complete waste of time though correct  like what was the point it was cringy to me almost,2023-03-26
especially right now with how awful mando season 3 is so far ,2023-03-27
" civilian drivers are completely oblivious to their surroundings

never been to houston huh",2023-03-27
"it was pretty good…but the arc de triumph scene was over the top ridiculous they made it seem like civilian drivers are completely oblivious to their surroundings and a police presence doesn’t exist in paris

they were fighting off the riots",2023-03-27
"he was pretty openly the very first thing he says to winston when they meet up is griping about how winston shot him

he just lets it go because hes got bigger things to worry about",2023-03-28
im pretty sure all of johns friends have shot him at one point or another plus it was the only way that they could both make it out of that situation alive,2023-03-27
i was rolling my eyes when everyone started showing these crazy strong hands but that made it even better when i realized he was deliberately giving them to everybody,2023-03-27
winston got him private jets,2023-03-28
what’s there to say,2023-03-29
shiiiiiit i had a  obese woman who kept bringing up her phone it was at the lowest brightness but still noticable even during the action scenes and she always kept shifting in her seat that made my armrest shake i was watching in a dolby amc cinema to keep out the riffraff but no  these people,2023-03-29
it was so  weird some of this choices in this movie were crazy they really cant be having a blind person be this good at combat without explaining he is daredevil im sorry,2023-03-29
all the movies have shallow plots,2023-03-29
unpopular opinion but i really think this secret society of assassins made the series a bit too convoluted,2023-04-01
heres just my take on it the radio station was appropriately namedropped as wuxia because john wick verse basically operates like the old school wuxia realm except in a modern world some of the common themes or plot points is that the real authority is corrupt or not powerful enough to control their territories the martial artists in these types of works will typically form their own factions and govern themselves operating by their own rules where members must follow specific set of codes like the movies wuxia also placed a lot of emphasis on following the rules and customs set by the old ways outlaws revenge honor are also common plot points in wuxia the normal folks authorities tend to turn a blind eye to the wulin the realm these martial artists operate in and in turn those part of the martial world will usually try to not involve those not part of theirs theres even a beggar sect and its not unlike how fisburnes character leads all the homeless as part of his faction,2023-04-02
i don’t think so either hopefully not anyway i think they left it intentionally ambiguous to see what the demand is like for a potential 5th film,2023-04-03
" has anyone noticed an important downgrade on the amount of blood and explicit violence during action sequences 

oh thanks  i wasnt the only one who noticed it i dont have the previous movies fresh in my mind but at least compared to the raid 2 my favorite action movie of all time its rather tame with blood and gore but i didnt remember how bloody and gorey the first three were so i didnt know if it was just me",2023-04-03
i actually thought winston’s answer gave it away when lawrence asks do you think he’s in heaven or  winston gave a cryptic who knows and they both smile and laugh with one another  not how one would speak of a dear friend who just passed  it seemed they might have been covering their bases and visiting his gravesite for appearances,2023-04-12
"“i never thought id see the day”

i heard that as i never thought id see the day that john actually leaves this type of life behind",2023-04-14
this is just how i’m rationalizing it in my mind  kinda like how the marquis said he wanted to  the idea of john wick i think that john wick the killer died but maybe the actual man is still alive and when they asked whether he’s in heaven or  they’re wondering whether being “out “ is like heaven and he can finally rest or if it’s torture  because killing is all he knows for him ,2023-04-12
also if john is alive why doesn’t he have his dog with him,2023-04-14
that could easily be explained as him saying he never thought hed see the day that hed be looking at john wicks headstone,2023-06-07
"the nunchuck part was intentional it was supposed to show him learning how to use it over the course of the fight according to the choreographer during an interview

also it sounds like they were running behind and didn’t have time to pre plan and rehearse some of the fights so they had to make up some stuff on the spot as they shoot supposedly keanu reeves is more trained than before so he just rolled with it but it still doesn’t look as polished as other stuff where they had more time to rehearse",2023-06-24
i stopped it also after an hr then watched the next two hours the next day if pretend the blind guy isnt blind the movie is a fun watch to the end first hour for me definitely worse than last two,2023-06-20
i guess he calls him son because he probably considered him as one,2023-03-24
finally someone brings him up i think he may have been head of ruska roma he had similar cross tattoo and the only other person that called john son was female leader of ruska roma,2023-04-01
"i disagree for a few reasons

 the high table structure corruption system is all in place as it was john just got some of his friends hurt and killed but didnt actually further any goal

i think johns goals in 24 can be summarized as a consistent freedom with a side of vengeance and the only way he knows how to do that is to  anyone who gets in his way i dont think he ever had a goal of ending the system except insofar as it was the only way he could think of getting out again

 john set out to  them all

thats true at the start of the film then his mind is changed after talking to winston who convinces him that theres a more direct and realistic way to get his freedom that also conveniently serves winstons interests at that time this convinces john because again his goal is not to bring down the whole system its just to be free of it

 also winston could have raised the idea of the duel at the end of two

maybe he could have but the entire plot of 3 is winston using john to secure his power over new york after the high table investigation winston is a selfserving person who is essentially the only one who can control john wick to some extent and he uses this to his own advantage he wasnt ever out to help john for the sake of it and had no reason to help him get out again until he had at least undone the damage john did to him by bringing the high table down on the ny continental after the events of jw2 my mental picture is that the events of 3 were the best way winston figured he could keep power and then when that fell apart in 4 he had to come up with another plan which was the duel",2023-03-27
the fight sequences were better in the older films,2023-03-29
im one of the rare people who hated this movie after liking 13 but thank you for acknowledging the repetitivenes of the action sequences whenever they spice it up a bit donnie yen using the motion sensors nunchucks axe dragons breath its pretty cool in the case of dragons breath spectacular even but the problem is pretty much all of it is just keanu awkwardly dodging a point blank gunshot  bulletproof suits were a mistake disarminghitting the person then shooting them in the head this happens no joke at least 150 times throughout the film and like you mentioned the choreography is pretty lackluster too just people waiting to be hit by keanu add to the fact that every one of the fight sequences was more than double the length it should be i felt like a crazy person in the theater watching everyone enjoying this its like  was so much more impressive about the 120th instance this exact same bit of gunplay happened vs the 40th or the 2nd,2023-03-29
had me in the first 99 ngl,2023-04-10
him and the boss at the poker table killed it for me he reminded me of penguin from the new batman way over the top,2023-03-25
nobody was a pointless addition and shoehorned into this film his character accomplished nothing and removing him would change nothing he was only introduced to be a spin off and i thought his acting didnt fit within the wick universe easily the worst character of the entire franchise in my opinion,2023-03-25
" also what was the point of trackernobody it felt like they wanted a repeat of halle berry in fact i think it would have worked better if it had been halle berry especially if the table has found her daughter and was threatening her like they were doing with caine

same like the high table is realizing theyre falling apart and are throwing just about anyone they have left to stop him at this point",2023-03-26
"all good points

 the japan hotel felt like it could have easily been the ending  very dumb pacing and then making us wait more than a hour for the next mini fight scene in the berlin club

 the repetition of the stair sequence was so anti climatic  the 2nd time he just went up and shot the same people in the same way in half the time  i swear i was expecting a slo motion back to back with 360 camera angles or something as he climbs with donnie or something clever like that the 2nd time

 i think the movie was pitched based off the paris set pieces and then they had to come up with the first 23rds of the movie thereafter  the first two acts were all over the place the desert japan ny france back to ny etc

 the sheer amount of missed shots was laughable when compared to the other 3 movies and thats being generous  my audience eventually started laughing how bad guys were missing with john 2 feet from him  and then john shielding himself from bullets in every single gun fight took me out of every set piece immediately it looked so ridiculous  i may be wrong but i never noticed this jacket sheilding strategy from him so often in the other movies",2023-03-26
"why even caine survived when marquis said that the second dies too when the duelant dies yeah marquis said that caine will be free since marquis believed he has won but he lost so why was caine allowed to leave

and that end of john how can it be taken too seriously when we see him survive major inuries throughout the film with no problem and usddenly this is supposed to be worse hmm",2023-03-26
im not sure how he knew the cards but if you pain attention to him on the stair sequence youll see that a lot of the time hes shooting where theres no one or shooting towards people who are already dead on the ground which was great,2023-03-25
easily couldve had braille on the cards as many cards do,2023-03-25
he may have felt what cards he was holding due to heightened sense of touch honestly when it comes to john wick movies being unrealistic i think the poker scene is one of the least severe offenders,2023-03-25
in the end jw is a better franchise than the matrix,2023-03-25
that was so  even if you were to make a kevlar suit bullets would still punch  holes in your body lol,2023-04-01
that’s been a thing since the second movie get off the phone ,2023-03-25
tracker did nothing in this movie absolutely no point to having him be there remove him and nothing changes such a terrible character i have no idea how you could consider him the best given how little he actually did,2023-03-25
"its extremely difficult to shoot from walking almost impossible without training while running id imagine riding a horse and shooting is even harder its pretty much the most realistic part of the movie

lawrence fishburne is an integral character in the franchise it made even more sense if you watched 3

and about people running out of the club have you seen any of the previous movies",2023-03-24
"why didnt everyone run out of the club when the bodies started hitting the floor

going to a nightclub in this world with less than 3 deaths is considered a boring affair",2023-03-26
" he cant hit the guys riding on horses in the beginning but hes this perfect assassin felt weird

hes also not gonna shoot the horses the set up of those shots will have to be better than perfect on account of the constant movement",2023-03-24
im so glad charon wasnt simply forgotten about after his death,2023-03-28
so you watched one of the best kung fu movies ever made and wondering why this cant keep up  ok,2023-03-24
the thing about wick is he’s precise he uses certain guns for certain scenarios for this one he is very mobile and has plenty people chasing him rifles would be too heavy for that amount of running and and slower to aim then a pistol,2023-04-01
i actually like the fantasy dream state it’s taken on we don’t need more gritty action movies imo,2023-04-01
it got larger than the sum of its parts im glad theyre finishing at 4 and hope the spinoffs return to the more grounded roots that made 1 such an excellent action film this movie was great fun to watch but it ballooned far above what the original john wick set out to do thats fine the stunts and set pieces were awesome,2023-04-01
yep agreed the first one had actual risk for wick the other ones were trying to get money way more than trying to keep him a believable character,2023-04-03
got the same feeling as well just yea yea more bad guys to fight for another 15 minutes can we move on please is there any plot action scenes should never feel like that,2023-05-25
i dont think thats overdramatic both of those departments did incredible jobs i saw this in a dolby cinema and i felt the punches through the seat it was glorious,2023-03-24
i said that too  kv,2023-03-24
about john dying in the beginning or the end i think the point was that  never really be free while alive marquis gave a monologue about it too johns a born killer whether he admits it or not  never be able to escape who he is so death was the true freedom thats how i interpreted it anyways,2023-03-25
i think one of the biggest point established by this film is that john wick is an idea bigger than life itself reaching out beyond his death he has defy the table numerous of times killed their elder killed hundreds of their men and in the end turned their own rules against them to get out he showed a chip in what was an impregnable armor of the table demonstrated to others that the will and determination of one man can achieve against bewildering odds,2023-03-25
no you obviously didnt understand it the point was to remove already used plot lines like you obviously didnt catch on winston even breaks the 4th wall in saying pick a plot implying episodic villains except its more like a villain of the movie the elder was an already done idea john immediately killed him good and then the continental was a done idea so they blew it up good what could be done differently that wasnt done before prioritizing interpersonal relationships of john wick this movie was about him not about whatever rascal was bothering him today so the marquez was belittled noone in the movie even respected him as a serious threat the movie itself highlights that the high table is what is granting him his powers he himself is not a pivotal character hes just a figurehead as the movie tries to explain how can john best this redundant cycle by getting his freedom back how well thats what happened really  the elder lol,2023-03-26
"i think i agree  it was either there to 

a get some good shots for the trailer

b give a reason for them to fire winston  otherwise i dont really know what winston did to deserve his hotel blown up  he shot and killed wick at the end of 3  youd think the high table would have promoted him",2023-03-26
i feel the exact same way i wish i was able to see this movie the way everyone else in this thread seemed to for me while there were some great moments it overall felt like a nonsensical slog that just existed to keep the franchise going john really should have died at the end of 3,2023-03-27
" like most of the kingpin henchmen not using guns and using tomhawks instead with no context whatsoever

you answered this part yourself at least everyone is wearing magical bulletevaporating suits whereas knives bows blunt weapons etc all have the ability to damage through them

the magical suits is the only thing that took me out of the film a bit i appreciate the style and that it both made the huge insane gunfights possible there are only so many dozens of ways you can make john dodge bullets from a distance and we dont want to see him hiding behind walls for 3 hours and made other cool weapons relevant but i wish they didnt bother with the holding suit flap over their face thing it felt like that kind of explicit acknowledgement took it from this is a stylistic decision we need to take to construct these scenes just go with it to this is a real part of this world and its valid to ask why they dont wear full body wraps made of this material",2023-03-27
"the ending while it looked very good with the very beautiful dawn shots i dont think the ending is a satisfactory conclusion to the story basically jhon lets himself get killed for what to save winston and the blind assassin if he had to die to get his freedom back he might aswell just have died in the last movie his death is just dumb and nonsensical he literally achieved nothing everyone who died died for nothing the guy in osaka sacrificed himself for nothing it is also implied that even the blind guy will get killed just a weird way to wrap it up

if you think about it basically all his friends got in trouble with the high table because of john he manages to save them from the high table in the end it was just unlucky that he had to fight marquis by proxy via caine otherwise he would have killed marquis on the first shot and could have lived a life in peace",2023-03-27
not the blind man able to take down more than 20 highly trained killers and dodging bullets by wick smh,2023-03-25
my baack my baaack,2023-03-25
didnt like ending either but felt they left it openas far as the whole moviedefinitely the best action but the story wasnt there  also didnt like some of the choices they made  in this one too john got his body destroyed and got uplike he almost broke his back lol  felt like he should have had intervention there  like the last movie he was deeply injured and in this one he was fine  weird,2023-03-27
i felt the same way love the first 2 john wicks and thought 3 was still pretty good but its increasingly diminishing returns john should have died at the end of the 3 it would have made more sense narratively or this movie should have been john slowly assassinating hightable members rather than just fighting an endless string of disposable goons,2023-03-27
if you recall john said right now when they were deciding but he lost the decision with the card numbers  the marquis purposely pushed it back so that he could try to assassinate john beforehand and maximize his chance at success,2023-04-01
"objectively this is the best john wick film

what",2023-03-24
what did you think about keanu’s acting the plot the comedic interjections,2023-03-24
one of the worst films i have ever seen could have been a 1 hour movie but no lets make john fight for 2 more pointless hours i wonder how did people even like this,2023-04-03
" objectively this is the best john wick film

stop watching films please or maybe watch more",2023-03-24
"but overall a more complete film than any of the first 3

more complete than the first one 

gordon ramsey noises",2023-03-30
"also before going in i heard someone say there were 14 set pieces i only counted 10 but here’s my ranking  thoughts

1 berlin  club just incredible from the buildup to wick caine and nobody teaming up and then wick brutally murdering goons on a waterfalldancefloor with an axe  this is perfect action scenes are honestly just better when there’s also people dancing in the same shot

2 paris  house i was a bit stumped when they started playing the club theme from the first for just wick killing some goons on a staircase  but then the camera just kept pulling out and it was like ‘oh okay  here we go’ also the fireshotgun is huge fun visually

3 paris  entrance onto the streets paint it black carries this  and i love that nowhere to run was great too  kinda wish they’d kept the playlist up it was a fun gimick

4 paris  arc de triomphe

5 paris  duel ‘’

6 osaka  garden love a good sword fight  and donnie yen looks particularly cool here

7 paris  sacre cour steps there’s some good laughs wick just keeping on rolling back down but there were so many moments where i felt like any random good could have easily taken him out  which i don’t love

8 osaka  continental raid if yen is there it’s fun the rest feels like busy work doesn’t help that everyone has those  bullet proof suits

9 osaka  art hall again yen is great i hate bullet proof suits and too much of this is just wick vs one guy on either side

10 desert  horses",2023-03-24
no charon is the one who died but i agree,2023-03-24
my guess is they just condensed 4 and 5 into one movie theres been no real news on 5 since it was announced they were no longer being filmed together chad is looking pretty busy in the near future and it looks like the main wick franchise might be on a break for a while if it even comes back and isnt content to let spinoffs take over,2023-03-24
incendiary rounds,2023-03-24
they probably started the finger rule because of him  when asked how many fingers you can be missing and still be a world class assassin the harbinger replied there can be only one,2023-03-24
he probably was once excommunicado like john and then made a deal with the elder to work for the table for the rest of his life john went back on his deal,2023-03-24
i know whyjohn understands that winston had to do what he had to do winston shot john but the high table loaded the gun  put it in his hands and said him or you if winston truly wanted john dead he would have shot him in the head not the bulletproof suit,2023-03-24
yeah i had the same question i was looking forward to him taking down winston but it’s just never addressed the only thing i can figure is that maybe he dropped all of that once he saw that winston lost the hotel and charon,2023-03-24
john is alive at this point because of winston 2 and 3 are really just one long movie and john made it through the beginning of 3 because winston waited an hour to excommunicate him giving him enough time to get out of dodge and get some stitches winston was either going to be killed or had to shoot john because of the leniency he showed him and he still put his life on the line shooting john’s suit something the marquis specifically references in the beginning of 4 there is no betrayal and the fall was a necessary risk john fell pretty much the same height in this one and was fine so he probably fell that much in the past before 3 so it was a calculated risk winston took for the benefit of all involved,2023-03-24
i was under the impression that was more so thematicwinston seeing john as a son figure i didnt think it was meant to be taken literally,2023-03-24
when john wick was slicing people with playing cards i got mad bullseye vibes,2023-03-25
the first fighting sequence and the chinese continetel went green was over the top so good,2023-03-24
dolby,2023-03-24
i just came from imax it was incredible,2023-03-25
dolby was awesome,2023-03-25
i saw it in imax and oh my ,2023-03-25
"first one i dont recall him having a chance at killing wick he did stop nobody to take a shot at him though but he wanted to be the one killing wick

as for the paris scene he was fed up with the marquis antics and threats and had a collab with wick to stage the  of marquis and be fully free of the table while getting his revenge

also as the other guy said there was some lost friendship and respect between the two",2023-03-25
i would probably guess that because they are good friends and go way back cain would only want to fight john in a respectful one on one both times you mentioned there was too many distractions around,2023-03-25
there was the last rule that marquis added about nomination thats why he chose caine to represent him i didnt catch much else,2023-03-25
hes bob odenkirks twin brother didnt you notice the resemblance lol,2023-03-25
"he was nobody

its in his name",2023-03-25
lol,2023-03-26
they were gimpy coming back,2023-03-26

at the start right",2023-03-25
yes imax,2023-03-26
it is called german dedication to techno things will be on fire people around be ripping apart each other the world may end but techno must go on,2023-03-26
and then a borg cube appears in space and they say we are borg,2023-03-26
it starts off with john punching that thing like in the trailer he goes to the desert and kills the elder not the one from the previous movie he got replaced and then the harbinger gives winston the hourglass and gives them an hour to evacuate he then takes them to the marquis where the building gets demolished,2023-03-26
the building that gets demolished is the new york coninental hotel by the french guy,2023-03-26
kr has to be exhausted hes what 60 or almost 60 ill give him some slack,2023-03-26
 ya greatest surprise ever cant wait,2023-03-26
nope especially since they announced jw5 and then halted only due to covid lol  oops,2023-03-26
disagree  i turned to my buddy must have been 90 mins in and been like k so weve only seen 1 fight so far right   all the other movies had wayyyy more setpieces than this one imo other than the final 30 mins    i just chalked it up to keanu getting older,2023-03-26
10 to 12 lol,2023-03-26
yeah,2023-03-27
why nerf his vision when they didnt even buffed his hearing and made him see everything what was the point anyway they could have kept him normal,2023-03-26
hasnt been since 2 which sucks he was great in both,2023-03-26
same with my theatre  and then 15 mins later we are supposed to feel sad that he died by a bullet that grazed his hip and shoulder   doesnt make any sense,2023-03-26
nah hes not dead when morpheus asked winston if hes in heaven or  winston replied with who knows so hes probably alive plus john wick 5 was already announced a while back lol,2023-03-26
it doesnt help that the scene is supposed to have weight but prior to this we see john walk off major injuries no problem why should this be different and suddenly heavily emotional when from what we saw he should be able to just walk it off anyway he could as well have cpt america serum in him at this point,2023-03-26
they tried to leave it open and a bit ambiguous they did that imho because theyre not really sure whether theyre going to return for 5 if they do they can explain it if they dont you can draw your own opinion either why,2023-03-26
"you should definitely watch 1 its a selfcontained story thats separate from 24

2 is good ofc but theres about 30 seconds of plot thats relevant to the rest of the series so up to you",2023-03-27
the church scene  brotherhood themes from the killer killa is inspired by sammo hung in spl the duel is inspired by barry lyndon and sergio leone stahelski said he shaped the whole film after the good the bad and the  with the main trio of characters the radio station is named wuxia the water in the club is inspired by the fight in the rain in the grandmaster the ending seems like a reference to cowboy bebop and theres obviously the warriors homage with the dj,2023-03-27
ive read that the dj in paris seems like a reference to the warriors though i havent seen the warriors,2023-03-27
"the duel is based off the good the bad and the 

the stairs stuff is likely at least partially referencing battleship potemkins odessa steps scene

mr nobody is probably in name anyway a reference to the sergio leone produced film my name is nobody",2023-03-27
actually thinking about it now wick says you owe me a favor after the duel was over  so i think theres no question that they intended to spare each other but had to wound each other to make it look convincing  plus those lines were setup by marquis de gramonts lines there are 3 kinds of men  one with reason to live,2023-03-28
yes wick purposely didnt fire his shot so when marquis took caines spot wick could still abide by the rules and  him legally,2023-03-28
agreed the ending was really good  but i wish winston and the bowery king buried wick next to his dog as well  for i dont remember much about his wife i do remember his dog  ,2023-03-28
do you base your criteria of best action movie ever made based on how many times the protagonist can perform an imanari roll and the deutoragonist can be a blind superhero level daredevil esque fighter,2023-03-29
that plus their smiles is meant to leave it open ended whether he is actually dead i choose to believe this i dont want to accept john is gone,2023-03-28
"john can only challenge a member of the high table to a duel on the behalf of a crime family in jw2 santino wasnt officially on the high table yet and in jw3 he punched his ticket ie severed ties with his crime family the  roma in exchange for safe passage to morocco

also what the other guy said yeah theyre friends but winston obviously has his own best interests at heart",2023-03-31
a large part of the plot of 3 is winston using john to secure his power over new york after the high table investigation winston is a selfserving person who is essentially the only one who can control john wick to some extent and he uses this to his own advantage my mental picture is that the events of 3 were the best way winston figured he could keep power over the ny continental and then when that fell apart in 4 he had to come up with another plan which was the duel,2023-03-31
3 felt like a filler movie,2023-04-01
bullet train,2023-04-02
well certainly have some analysis when the video is actually available but i think the details were still solid it was established that the pistol had a 21 round mag which is significantly more than previous,2023-04-03
"nah john challenges the marquis to duel and by rights needs a sponsor  winston 

should john win the duel the marquis dies should the marquis win both john and his sponsor are killed comeuppance for challenging the high table and losing i guess

the fact that the marquis can choose to nominate someone to take his place in the duel is a separate thing  if john kills the nominee he has still beaten the high table in the challenge one assumes by stepping back in at the last shot the marquis removes the nomination hence john headshotting him still counts as playing by the rules",2023-04-06
the marquis explained it earlier in the movie  caine has something to live for his daughter whereas john doesnt  theyre both friends so its the marquiss way of twisting the knife  if the marquis picked one of his minions as a second john would have killed that minion immediately with little to no difficulty whereas after losing so much john wouldnt want to  one of his only living friends,2023-05-26
koji didnt really have a way out  he was already excommunicado on account of harboring john wick even when caine wasnt involved  he knew caine wouldnt  his daughter at least,2023-06-06
yeah him retiring putting stuff back under concrete etc and getting a dog be better i think,2023-06-20
mr nobody was doing exactly that already in the beginning killing others to drive up the bounty also the dj referred to people at different locations by different coded names so maybe everyone that showed up at each particular location did all belong to one organization saving for marquis’s men,2023-06-24
the kevlar suits were introduced earlier in the series you’ll notice he uses his arms or lifts up the jacket over his face to block the bullets,2023-06-18
isnt he going to reprise his role in a spinoff about some ballerina he can keep doing movies that take place before this one,2023-03-24
for me it wasn’t that it deviated necessarily but that it has more or less abandoned almost any sense of realism the first two movies had for ff overthetopness like now we’re at the point where thin kevlar becomes straight up forcefields and guns have unlimited ammo hacks turned on it’s just kinda disappointing to see when compared to the first two films,2023-03-25
"what you don’t like a man who wears a force field suit that carries unlimited rounds of 9 mm who can drop four stories onto a van and down 20 flights of stairs

you don’t like a world where there isn’t one   who can get a  shot on this guy

or a copless world where you could engage in a massive firefight in the arc de triumph circle without drawing any attention or even slowing traffic",2023-03-26
definitely not its even more ridiculous than 2 and 3 i enjoyed it but it was also a hard watch at times which has been my feeling with 2 and 3 as well and this is even worse so if you didnt enjoy those then there nothing here except for one very cool scene that you might find on youtube soon,2023-03-26
i enjoyed it but i justthe endingand they left inconsistencies  like john all of a sudden survives anything in this movie haha,2023-03-27
"i think one of the best things about movies is how subjective they are  

i laughed so much at how over the top the action scenes were  maybe cause i was excited but i laughed more than most comedies i see",2023-03-27
i feel like you overall i enjoyed it but with all those caveat you mention and just like you i am pretty baffled that it is received as the best of them all,2023-03-27
"yeah i loved the first 2 and liked the third but i didnt not really enjoy this it had some great moments but narratively it made no sense to me  didnt the last one end with john and the bowery king planning to go to war with the high table i thought john would be more in control in this film like in the first half of 2 instead of just on the run again 

and while these movies were never super realistic it still felt like john was a real human who got injured during fights in this one he gets hit by about 6 cars fall multiple stories several times and is totally impervious to all attacks up until the finale even with a bullet proof suit this guy still probably has a subdural hematoma",2023-03-27
"it wasnt an unjust system john violated the rules by killing inside the continental

the movie made clear that the high table is a system and killing its members would just make them being replaced by others",2023-03-27
"doesnt it feel like this movie entirely undermines what felt like the drive of the last 3 john was a man fighting against an unjust system but in this one hes just playing by the rules even his death is meaningless by the internal logic the film sets out  the marquee will simply be replaced and the system will continue so what was the whole point more samurai swords

john wasnt fighting the high table throughout the entire 3 movies that is just in the 3rd movie because he was killing on continental ground honestly the high table did nothing wrong to john 

i kind of like the idea that winston argues with john because him trying to  everyone at the high table is bs the high table just represents the crime families and even if he kills their representatives  now all these families are after him thinking about the lore  we have a crime family in almost every larger country it seems that would mean that john wick would spend the rest of his life fighting  over nothing exactly",2023-03-27
i still have no idea how mr nobody ties into this story i guess he just tracks people i liked his character just didn’t understand his purpose,2023-03-27
hopefully they do something with him personally for me he added nothing to the movie other than being the guy with the dog that attacks ppl,2023-03-26
it was badass when he pulled straps on his backpack and out comes a bullet proof vest,2023-03-26
i absolutely loved the story structure,2023-03-24
shamier was giving me yahya abdulmateen ii vibes a few times i almost swore it was him,2023-03-24
annnndddddd whereeeeeeee are the cooppsss world war 8 is occurring in already gun sensitive france and not a single cop in sight,2023-03-24
i love both john wick 4 and the raid 2,2023-03-24
caine was his proxy but when marquis grabbed the gun it probably meant marquis became the duelist and not caine anymore,2023-03-24
"looks like nitpicking scenes from a film where the law of physics and common sense do not exist lol

this movie was bonkers and loved every second of it best john wick film in the franchise",2023-03-25
"the amount of missed shots with people standing 3 feet from each other pointing guns at one another  while shielding their face with their jackets  i dont remember this much  at all in the other 3 combined

my audience was laughing by the end with how bad the bad guys were with aiming",2023-03-26
are you just learning about donnie yen  i envy you friend i recommend the first two ipman movies enjoy,2023-03-27
"played

yes",2023-03-27
maybe a dozen cats all trained to go for the balls,2023-03-27
i think nobody should have been cut out entirely,2023-03-27
"interesting

i liked 4 over 2 and 3  and one of the reason is that the fights werent as bothersome for me  i get what you mean about the fights being more iconic in 1 and 2 and even 3  i agree with that  


  
but keanu visibly lost a step in 2 and 3 at least for me  i thought he looked really sluggish and his limbs were so slow i couldnt suspend my disbelief that he could take on guys half his age with how slow his limbs were  i kept complaining to my friend about it when we left the theater  i said wick should be a gun guy who can do martial arts if he had to it would make him more realistic  yes hahaha as if wick is a realistic film but i hope you get what i mean

  


with 4 there wasnt as much emphasis on martial arts not iconic and no close up shots of him throwing a block and counter punching etc  the director might have just filmed it so you couldnt tell how slow keanu was by picking the right angles or editing strategically  or as others have put it made the fight scenes more cinematic as opposed to a choreographed scene  and also he just used his gun more

  


so his unrealistic slowness wasnt a distraction for me  i ended up liking it better",2023-03-28
"its a movie thats the point in no way this is meant to be realistic theres an underground intelligence built by homeless people under new york and paris gunfights inside a club where people keep dancing while people  themselves with axes at 30cm from they faces

its an action movie its not a documentary

edit and especially a  blind man who fights like a whole army headshotting people from behind walls",2023-03-30
yeah at this point contract for johns head should be approaching if not exceeding a billion dollars,2023-03-24
oh boy that sucks you go to the movies enough and theres always that one time an  ruins it,2023-03-24
"sometimes you lose sight of your own pettiness and cause unnecessary escalations when you are in “justice mode” when i was younger i had plenty of moments like this where i was justifiably in the “right” and escalated the situation dude sounds like an  but on your best day you’d probably have handled it differently 

also the way you say “a crowd of mexicans form” and state that potentially watching a fight at the movie theater is some kind of treat for them… comes across distasteful to say the least",2023-03-24
was the worst  accent  i mean his character was supposed to be annoying af but i really wanted to stab his character myself just to keep him from speaking anymore,2023-03-25
thats a good point  maybe why the movie hit diff for me   laurence had no role reddick had no role remove winston and the movie plays exactly the same etc   all the main characters were left out of the movie pretty much,2023-03-26
"bro youre lost in the sauce here

i would put wick 1 and 2 up there with the raid 1 and 2 in terms of action movies but this one

how many iminari rolls can you have in one movie cause i counted 25 its cool keanu is hip with modern combat but iminari rolls are largely ineffective and it being his bread and butter is lazy as ",2023-03-29
guy with imanari roll fetish confirmed,2023-03-29
you dont feel the running time its miles better than 3,2023-03-24
its a lot of action which is what most people are going to want i felt it was a bit tiresome but i dont regret seeing it ive rated all four movies 510 so im obviously not this franchises biggest fan although this one is actionpacked it absolutely did feel like 3 hours to me fwiw im pretty confident that john wick fans will almost universally rate this as the best of the sequels see it if you liked the others but it definitely didnt feel like a short movie to me,2023-03-24
"no i watched the previous 3 the week before seeing it and it was noticeably worse in this one i think it was covid precautions if i had to guess there probably wasnt an actor playing off his lines and more likely than not they were rushed more than usual to try and get the movie done without an incident

many movies the past few years have been worse because they all lost a lot of liberties when it came to takes and time allotted for shots and the amount of people allowed on set and around actors has changed drastically",2023-03-24
caine only killed random assassins hed be in trouble if he killed one of the marquis goons which he didnt,2023-03-25

sorry what ,2023-03-26
"1  i just assumed this was one of the reasons why wick was so feared in 1 probably old friends

def my favorite part prepare to show our guests hospitality or whatever the line was that was great,2023-03-29
"i actually didnt like him at all he doesnt add anything to the story what changes in the plot if hes not there if i havent missed things nothing 

i think is only function is being a guy with a dog and opening up new possibilities for the franchise after keanu reeves character dies",2023-03-30
i myself think the 1st one is the best by far i think the series started to lose a bit of its charm with the insane bulletproof suits more so in the 4th one where some of the guys including wick are nigh unkillable because of them,2023-04-03
no way but it’s a good question about how the 4 movies are ranked by people prior to jw4 i thought each sequel was just a little less good than the previous one despite the added set pieces and inventiveness because they were becoming increasingly crazy jw1 seems so grounded now lol… having said that i find jw4 to be either the best or 2nd best of the franchise after the first even though it is actually the craziest to me though i thought jw4 has a poignant ending therefore connecting the awesome set pieces in the most audacious ways of the franchise with what i think was a strong emotional core that was missing in the second and third one but definitely present in the first do you prefer the 3rd and why if you want to answer,2023-04-03
boy is that not true,2023-06-01
"ever since the second film his suits have been literally bulletproof just because thats how they wanted it in the world  anyone of sufficient prestige has their clothes made of bulletproof fabric  even the sumos have bulletproof robes you can see bullets just bounce off them at one point  

when john holds his arm up to his face hes pulling his jacket up so he doesnt get shot in the head",2023-06-06
bill skasgard is such a talented actor i really bought the marquis character almost immediately,2023-03-24
by the end i felt let down by the marketing i was expecting the marquis to be some battle proven ruthless assassin instead he turned out to just be another mustachetwirling manipulator cain is who the marquis should have been more like,2023-03-25
which of the 12 times i feel like they used her wayyyy too many times i ended up getting annoyed every time she spoke,2023-03-25

"wasnt there that blind magician who did card tricks irl

as far as i remember the way he did it was that his sense of touch was so good that he could identify the subtle differences in texture of each single card in his deck he would just feel the card and know what it was

now donnie yens character wouldnt have had a chance to inspect the cards beforehand but the movie is kind of a hightened reality anyway so i just assumed that he was able to feel what cards he was holding anyway",2023-03-25
well its hard to say what exactly blind people can pick up on unless youve been blind before i have not,2023-03-25
"then a new marquis wold be appointedanother hot head at the table would try gunning for wick due to the prestige

"i felt he might have been put in for multiple reasons

1 a possible spiritual successor to wick since he has a dog  just in case they need more options to continue the series
2 convenient plot device to help wick out at certain times to make wick look vulnerable and to vary how many times wick cheats death
3 a side plot to keep you interested because you have another main assassin whose goal is to  wick by saving him to up the ante on his bounty

i just cant see john wick riding into the sunset after all thar happened during the events of the 4 movies

the way the movie ended was good in my opinion he set things right for his friends he humilitated the high table and achieved what they feared most a martyrs death the only reason he was even alive up to that point according to his own words was to honor his wife",2023-03-25

because someone stole a car and killed a  dog",2023-03-24
because it wasnt dumb it was awesome,2023-03-26
you must be new to the john wick movies,2023-03-28
i did notice it during the arc de triomphe scene   very fake looking all around,2023-03-26
we get it bro you like a24,2023-03-29

why watch the 4th movie in a series about a dude gunning people down and then  about that being all there was to the film,2023-03-24
you illegally pirated the movie watched it in your home and expect people to believe your review find a bridge man stop waisting peoples lives,2023-03-24
youre in the 5 not a big deal,2023-03-26

itd just be another category for we to get mad at look at sag they didnt even nominate jw3 in 2019 instead they chose the irishman joker and ford v ferrari,2023-03-24
ballerina takes place before chapter 4 there was a 6 month time skip between 3 and 4 as said by stahelski,2023-03-24
end credit scene,2023-03-24
im definitely aboard the stahelski hype train,2023-03-24
id say anything plot related will be completely lost to you you can enjoy all the action sequences but id recommend at least reading up on the last three first,2023-03-24
you should watch the first three great films,2023-03-24
"they were supposed to shoot 4 and 5 back to back but didnt because of the pandy

4 looks pretty final",2023-03-24
this gives the impression that its the final film but there is apparently going to be some kind of spinoff that will introduce new characters and presumably bring back old ones,2023-03-24
i think he got it after no shot hit him on the 3rd shot but kept quiet,2023-03-25
much better,2023-03-24
i disliked that part in the beginning it was cool but then it was too long of a shot,2023-03-25
or damage from vehicles,2023-03-25
stahelski said he based the film on tgtbtu with the main trio of characters mr nobody is also a obvious nod to the man with no name i mean the whole thing is filled with references and homages to all kinds of genre films its really an ode to action cinema,2023-03-25
i think they’re eye and neck shots,2023-03-25
"he got shot from a 15 stories bulding and jumped out of another in this movie i wouldnt say its grounded

watching this one i absolutely thought about ff and how superheroing they both were moving to and i was wondering if there was other franchises doing similarly",2023-03-25
he was at the very end,2023-03-25
"la liberté guidant le peuple

lets just say its pretty savory with whats currently happening in france",2023-03-25
i guess theres some speculation that john wick may be dead but john the civilian might not be dead during the ign interview about the end of the movie they go more indepth about it its a small snippet in the new video they posted about the movie i find it hard to believe that he is still alive but dunno maybe big maybe,2023-03-25
they were going to film jw5 right after this one but the director and keanu stated they are taking a break to focus on the spinoffs,2023-03-26
jw 13 take place over a span of about a week and a half then there’s gap of 7 months to the events of 4 it’s ambiguous if he’s dead but he’s supposed to be in the spinoffs so just depends if they are sequels or prequels,2023-03-26
shot in same location as the doctor in the other jw movie  hint hint nod nod lol  he aint dead,2023-03-26
"for me he has to be dead whatever about the film being a bit on the nose about it there was no happy ending for him this is what he is and was it’s what drives him 

he’s an anti hero he doesn’t get a happy ending that he worked out for caine to be free with his daughter is the hero play 

he’s gone and i feel like him not being dead cheapens the film entirely",2023-03-26
i mean to be fair one of them is  blind,2023-03-26
caine stabbed wick in his dominant hand 1 minute before the duel started,2023-03-26
i think hes like top level adjudicator straight from the high table,2023-03-26
doubt it johns arc is done regardless of his status but theyre doing a ton of spinoff stuff ballerina a tv show plus i bet keanu is bit exhausted from doing all of these insane stunts so i wouldnt blame him if he was done,2023-03-26
general society is a nonfactor basically part of the environment in every john wick film the fights have been getting bigger so its more noticeable but the noninteraction of the public is a consistent style choice,2023-03-26
pretty dumb and lazy writing if you tease the high table for 4 movies and then never get the pay off with meeting them or the head bad guy in charge,2023-03-27
he’s dead,2023-03-26
as far as the table goes that problem was brought up in the movie  killing any or all of them would just lead to them getting replaced even the elder the man above the table was replaced between movies killed in this one and all it did was spur the high table to take harsher actions,2023-03-27
we will get a 5th one just wait remember he never took down the the high table only one member and he probably faked his death,2023-03-27
nah they left it openended for a reason lionsgate has like 3 spinoffs in the works theyre going to milk the entire series wick or winston will end up at the high table for sure,2023-03-27
nah our boi lives,2023-03-27
did you see the post credits,2023-03-27
"i agree if they were trying to make it ambiguous then they didnt really do a good job of it he seemed pretty dead as far as dead characters go i think people are  to these marvelstyle movies where no one ever really dies

that said i wont be surprised if they try to undead him for a 5th movie but i will be disappointed",2023-03-27
have literacy skills lol,2023-03-27
they didnt really linger on him being dead he could have just passed out the grave could have been built just to make everyone else high table believe that hes dead,2023-03-27
"what are people talking about when they say they left it ambiguous if hes dead or not it seemed pretty  clear to me that hes dead did i miss something we heard his last breath saw the body slump and cut to his grave next to his wife and goodbyes  else are they supposed to do

x200b

winston is john in heaven or  who knows

dogs ears peaking up at the grave scene

those who cling to death live those who cling to life die john doesnt care about dying but rather saving the bullet for the marquis

x200b

imo he is 95 dead but they wanted to leave a tiny backdoor open",2023-03-27
from their point of view there are guys at 9 or 12 o clock so they were just choosing their next targets,2023-03-27
i think the amount of guys,2023-03-27
"can someone explain to me i thought the marquis was part of the high table but the john wick fan wiki says that hes only an agent of it can someone explain

hes part of the high table but also got the task to take care of john wick",2023-03-27
not deadit would make whole series pointless too,2023-03-27
i thought this too about faking his death but at the end john was given his freedom anyways so why fake your death if you were given your freedom however where john was shot wasnt necessarily a  shot either he has been shot in the same exact spot before,2023-03-27
why would he need to fake his death if killing the marquis secured his freedom,2023-03-29
"just noticed johns death in chapter 4 is stark contrast to viggos death in the first movie nice touch

wdym",2023-03-27
"loved the movie but is keanu alright between this and matrix 4 i seriously think hes had a  or something hes entitled to privacy of course but his speech pattern has become so slow and stilted hope hes okay

hes fine  watch the latest interviews of his i think he just made john wick a caricature to be fair it kind of fit the role in the 4th movie john wick kind of seems tired of all the fighting he has no reason to keep going",2023-03-27
"i loved the ending but i wish he didnt die i think it would have been perfect where the cast is seen one last time or walks off in the distance with his dog

its ambiguous whether he died or not",2023-03-27
either you already know this one or your username is a huge coincidence but check out equilibrium,2023-03-28
"please dont tell me 2014 was 9 years ago

please",2023-03-28
in my theater it was silence and then laughter at how comically long it was the only gasp was when he jumped out the 4th story window of that apartment,2023-03-29
then why did he die,2023-03-29
yeah he was a pointless character to me too,2023-03-29
the point is that he is a younger mirror of john who catches a conscience before getting trapped by the table forever like john was,2023-03-29
needed 50 million to buy his way out and retire,2023-03-29
"my interpretation was that the elder was just like the most senior member of the high table like a club president or something the rest of the high table is probably some sort of council

bills character was just some dude the council essentially gave resources to so that he could try and  wick like an inquisitor",2023-03-29
"as far as i can tell he just wanted it to end so he figured killing the elder who was above the table would end it all but as the elder said to him someone else would just replace him which is exactly what happened with the french guy being the new top guy

as for caine assisting john up the stairs i have no idea if i was in caines shoes id be waiting with the others hoping he gets killed",2023-03-30
caine is fighting for his and his daughters freedom and that happens only if he is the one to  wick in the duel based on his agreement with the marquis if john doesnt make it to the duel the marquis has no reason to grant him their freedom just like why mr nobody spent a lot of the movie saving john because his goal is to collect the bounty for himself and having someone else  john instead would ruin it for himself,2023-03-31
what are you talking about  he helped him after that,2023-03-30
friendship means little when its convenient,2023-03-30
"my theory  he is still alive the scene where winston and bowery king are at the wicks gravestone is to make the heads of the table believe he is finally dead someone could observe them at the grave site and report back to the table that john wick is indeed dead 

off screen wick could be somewhere finally at peace so if there are no more wick movies thats it but of there is a sequal then they can have john wick come back i would love to see one more sequal in which he goes after the table and brings it all down",2023-03-31
" in the first movie jimmy came to his house because some noise was reported here

i assumed its because at that time people in the know are aware that johns retired so it would indeed be suspiciousunusual thus the cop went to have a look whereas by the time movie 4 rolled around dude already has an ever increasing bounty on his head worldwide with a radio station providing live updates so everyone already knows to back off",2023-04-02
"i mean the guy is 58 towards the end of john wick 3 he had that 1v2 against two of the assassins now i know those two guys because they were previously featured in the raid 1 and 2 two amazing action movies from indonesia and it was obvious that they had to slow down for keanu to keep up since they fought at a much faster pace in the raid movies

but then again keanu is 58 years old its amazing he can do this stuff at all at his age it would be unrealistic for him to keep up with martial arts fighters at their peak",2023-04-03
he should be gassed canon wise lol dude has gone through the wringer,2023-05-30
a hand yes it kinda happens out of nowhere but the rest of the damage done can be avoided lol i had to close my eyes because im the same way,2023-04-02
"yeah well you do have to just accept that i mean a real human no matter how well trained wouldve been long dead in john wicks shoes just the fall from the apartment at the end would be enough to break several bones and make you unable to move for weeks if not months if not permanently 

if there is any justification it is that blind people develop a better sense for hearing than people with functional eyesight so maybe he can roughly locate the people in his mind through his better hearing ability

but you can also use as counterargument that the very loud gunshots would disrupt his concentration and therefore his ability to locate enemies in his mind

yeah if you look at it from a realism standpoint it doesnt hold up of course but that kinda applies to any action movie humans simply are very fragile so if you had it completely realistic youd have the protagonist at most take one fall or one bullet but that would make worse cinema",2023-04-03
maybe hes a really good lawyer,2023-04-10
he wasnt in 3 either,2023-06-07
"blind guy and john were dueling bad guy blind guys second tags in at the very end to do the coup de grace because he wants to be the guy to  john

in that moment caine asks maquis if hes free and he says yes caine and his daughter are free essentially ending their contractual obligation included the duel",2023-05-15
what scenemovie,2023-05-15
theyre real ammunition,2023-05-30
dragons breath rounds are real check it out on youtube its cool stuff,2023-06-02
i think its cause caine got nominated and not that he was one to nominate,2023-06-11
he’s not marquis’ second the job of a second is to help you with everything besides the actual fighting like negotiating preparing the weapon etc so you can focus on the duel itself he’s more like a champion that fights in mqrquis’ stead and he was relieved of his duty before the duel ended,2023-06-24
yeah if you ignore the 200 scenes where the enemies try to stab him with a gun,2023-07-11
i don’t think the director and keanu want to do a fifth one  keanu is 58 and living with injuries from the first matrix  the director mentioned he wanted to do other films  so it looks like they went all out for the fourth  definitely the best and great ending if they decide to stop here,2023-03-25
you could have told me it was an hour forty and id believe you blew past,2023-03-25
"i check my watch when jw climb those stair i really hope real time clock matches the in movie clock 
 
its not",2023-03-25
fastest 3hr movie of my life,2023-03-28
"i checked my watch exactly once because i really had to  and wondered how much time was left 

answer too long",2023-03-29
same here i only checked it twice because my watch wanted me to stand up and move around lol,2023-04-03
same experience as credits rolled was the first time i glanced down incredible cinematic experience,2023-03-28
it did not feel like 3 hour frankly i was shocked when i checked my phone as the credits rolled the time just flew by,2023-04-02
i checked the clock a few times but because i was curious how long the fight segments actually lasted,2023-04-25
yep and i checked a lot watching 3 gj,2023-03-27
i didn’t even get the urge to ,2023-04-05
i actively avoided checking my watch because i didnt want it to end,2023-04-05
agreed  it felt a little long i enjoyed it don’t get me wrong but i also was at a point where i could have sworn i saw keanu ‘’ the same stunt man 2 or 3 times as i was starting to recognize them,2023-03-26
"that was the only part of the movie where it felt like a chore 

i was mentioning that if they cut out half or all of the arc scene it wouldnt have felt out of place to me at all it felt like just filler and didnt actually bring the plot point that much forward just some more random useless goons that die 

now the scene after that in the building with the overhead shot that was pure artistry",2023-03-29
the topdown section of the apartment sequence was absolutely brilliant,2023-03-28
i think this movie avoided action fatigue better than 2 and 3 the actions scenes were ridiculously long but i thought they mixed things up enough to keep it interesting like the paris fight going from the streets to the building to the stairs all with very different styles and environmental obstacles the only action sequences that i thought could be trimmed a little were the german night club and that final stair fight but they were only slightly too long whereas i definitely started to get bored during the catacombs fight in 2 and the dog fight in 3,2023-03-25
honestly i loved every sequence each one individually is  awesome,2023-03-25
agreed the berlin section also dragged like crazy,2023-03-24
yeah that was about when i was checking my watch lol,2023-03-25
i’m picturing you sweating buckets trying to hold the line ,2023-03-26
was it one of those  that are spiky in your  and get you hot and bothered,2023-04-03
dude i had the same issue i just went for a  at the end of the apartment scene and came back at the stair scene record time ,2023-05-10
"i love that all these comments about incredibly paced immediately contradict themselves in the next sentence by saying it dragged 

it definitely did drag in some scenes i was worried that he’d be fighting the elite high table guards the entire movie the escape from osaka dragged since it took like a minute to  each mercenary",2023-04-24
i feel asleep during the poker scene i loved the top down scene with the white phosphorus i think i’ll see it as a matinee tomorrow and see what i think,2023-03-25
"this is the thought i always have what are the pay rates for henchmen are there companies who specialize in henchman contracting

i was kind of hoping for one random you know what im not going to try to take on john wick one on one",2023-03-25
actually i saw a recycle henchemen from john wick 1 a big guy with a long beard hahahaha,2023-03-25
"how are there even any assassins left in the organization at this point or if they have so many that this is a drop in the pond how the  is there even anyone left to assassinate

are all of the assassins just constantly killing each other",2023-03-27
"i kept wondering about that like at some point as a henchman dont you go were going after  john wick nah man im gonna take a sick day today

if at some point john runs across a chubby dude with a hench 4 life tattoo id die happy",2023-03-26
lol we watched chapter 4 in paris this weekend and i told my wife at this rate paris is going to be crime free for a while at least in the wick universe,2023-03-27
a lot of orphans on the streets around the world   ready to be plucked and reshaped  most will be cogs in the high table machine  grunts guards  workers   a few will become formidable  caine zero nobody etc  maybe one in a million has the potential to be the next john wick,2023-03-25
can we classify john wick movies as horror that way deadmeat can  count them to find out,2023-03-31
i believe that in the john wick universe the underworld is indeed the normal world the people who arent in the game just happen to live among them,2023-03-28
maybe they are calling 1800henchmen,2023-03-27
i do not envy the cemetery crew of france,2023-03-28
im sure john wick has in movie killed every stuntman in the world by now ,2023-03-30
theres a reason they moved away from new york lol,2023-03-30
dearth of grunts and hit men…,2023-04-10
nah man werent you watching the movie if you  one theyll just put another in his place,2023-03-29
hes probably saving the money with all the new armor and weapons they have the technology is so good they dont need the extra bodies and wick is just thinning the herd without the future grubts being the wiser,2023-05-26
"i wonder if there was ever a point anyone considered it wasnt worth it anymore lol  

yeah they got to claim on his debt but  what a waste of resources after all that time",2023-03-24
what is he going to do  them all,2023-03-24
classic russian move though,2023-03-31
are we talking about the john wick movies or russias brilliant tactics in ukraine boy ruskis just having a hard time all over,2023-03-27
i agree with this monk ,2023-04-12
140 so 439,2023-03-25
i counted 118 when i watched though some of them seemed questionable where the person might not have been dead,2023-03-26
 theon greyjoy reek,2023-04-01
always  everything up,2023-03-27
idk i just left the theater and it was certainly in the hundreds,2023-03-25
but he only came to cash that card because john reentered the life he even says it in that movie and what caused john to return to the life… a dead puppy and a stolen car,2023-03-24
" the russian mob sent assassins to  john in his home before he ever made a move against them

the russian mob sent assassins to  john in his home before he ever made a move against them because they knew he was going to make a move against themfor killing his dog",2023-03-29
yeah it really started with that guy john hasnt stopped since then,2023-05-30
unironically the 3 dudes in wicks house at the first movie came the closest to killing wick after that he got mc status and by then its too late,2023-06-20
hadnt they already chosen pistols at that point so he knew the type of fight,2023-11-04
but as bill skarsgard explained to ian mcshane everyone who loses the duel dies even if they werent part of the duel,2023-03-29
i mean you’re 60 paces away from each other and you know you’re facing him directly wouldn’t be too hard for two professional shooters to aim in a straight line he also fired after john with the first two shots so he heard them,2023-03-25
he is one with the force and the force is with him,2023-03-25
crucifiedjust because youre not as upvoted as the user replying to you this is some bitterness lol especially considering that the replies are civil and they arent trashing you,2023-04-02
you have five downvotes stop crying about getting crucified,2023-03-27
"“crucified” is when people disagree with you it’s not exactly a realistic movie there’s a lot to criticize if you go by that angle

it’s also just not valid criticism when there’s an in universe explanation john shot first the dude has extremely good awareness it’s a straight line etc",2023-03-27
cmon man blind fighters are always superior to nonblind fighters in the cinemaverse,2023-03-26
same its not the most realistic film series and the action does force you to buy into some unbelievable  but i can get over things like a secret society of criminals and armored high table soldiers because the story requires me to but a blind man being able to shoot perfectly and  dozens of people pushes it into the realm of fantasy for me its kind of obvious they looked at donnie yens character in star wars and thought you know what would be cool and added him in without really thinking about how illogical it is,2023-03-25
this comment made me remember he played a blind dude in star wars lol,2023-04-05
are we sure he’s dead,2023-03-24
ah yes abel wick,2023-03-25
i thought it was after kwai chang caine,2023-03-25

holy  ,2023-03-31
oh ,2023-05-24
"yep exactly why can john wick fall off of multiple buildings get hit by like 20 cars dispose of a thousand bad guys and still make it out alive 

who  cares that’s why buckle up and enjoy the ride",2023-03-24
i was half expecting german peter griffin would be a pushover but holy  he could duke it out with the best of them,2023-03-24
every mob boss in john wick universe must own a cool nightclub,2023-03-24
also man people in this world have seen some  they were having an all out shootout and people just keep raving,2023-03-24
very similar in that regard to the red circle from chapter 1 and the scene in paris from mission impossible fallout,2023-03-24
and then in case you missed it they had the actual legendary bouncer of the berlin nightclub berghain sven marquardt play klaus the guy that escorts them over to killa,2023-03-26
it’s a john wick movie so i kept being like where’s the club scene oh i hear techno,2023-03-27
i want my next clandestine meeting to be in the mud directly in the middle of an elaborate dance being performed by swordsmen riding horses,2023-03-25
the building they came out of is actually just a smallish museum in berlin too so it was kind of funny to see them make that all that nestled inside,2023-03-27
those ravers must have been on some pretty heavy drugs cause they were completely oblivious to the people getting hacked up with a hatchet right next to them,2023-03-27
gotta love everyone at the club just kinda ignoring people dying around them just keep dancing or keanu is gonna beat us up next,2023-04-07
that villain was comically silly to me it started to take itself way too funny the last was over the top also but it went past a line to me that felt too cheesy,2023-03-28
yeah i didnt spend a second wondering where in paris they would fit that huge empty building that contains nothing but a poker table  nor did i wonder where they fit a huge rave center next door or how high their water bill is,2023-05-30
the poker wasnt poker   poker doesnt work without bettingbluffing,2023-06-05
"ya know  gonna hit the fan when youre near a club in a jw film once he got upstairs i was like right here we go club fight here it is

i mean all of that in a good way lol",2023-08-05
still odd so many techno heads didn’t notice all the  going on near them but you know … drugs,2023-10-22
or raising cain,2023-03-24
if he wasnt already excommunicado it probably wouldve been,2023-03-25
"that was something that annoyed me like this is obviously cheating i would have expected a rule that if anything happens to one of the parties to the duel before the appointed time everyone loses that itself could have been spun into a clever angle where it was used to set up john

but beyond that its just not generally interesting the duel is the next interesting bit dont put a load of stuff in the way of it because now youre just dragging it out it makes it feel like filler",2023-03-26
i think he said in an interview the script originally had him wear traditional mandarin collar and his name was chen or chan then he complained to the director about the stereotyping and they changed it,2023-03-25
hence the radio station name,2023-03-24
scott adkins was crazy in this one,2023-03-24
"i thought it felt like far too much of a ripoff of zatoichi i mean a blind master fighter with a sword cane a nod is a cool reference but this crossed the line into outright ripoff

although it also felt like they tried to cross him with chow yunfats characters from john woos films like if his character in the killer became blind and turned into zatoichi but with the sunglasses and general dress sense of his character from a better tomorrow",2023-03-26
that was my only gripe also which i mentioned in a review somewhere i dont see how it added anything if anything it just made things far less believable,2023-03-24
caine had a deal with the table where theyd give him a name and caine would  that person the marquis gives caine the card with johns name,2023-03-24
not anymore,2023-03-25
"one of the best opening set pieces i’ve seen in a while saw it in imax and it was loud
edit spelling in first line",2023-03-25
wow glad to know i wasnt the only one lol made me jumped a little,2023-03-25
no kidding those must have been the loudest punches i’ve ever heard was literally hurting my ears ,2023-03-28
 that honestly gave me whiplash in the theatre caught me by surprise,2023-03-26
it was nuts in 4dx the trailers didnt have effects and then it was boom sudden punch in the back,2023-03-31
the movie was giving me a headache at first tbh glad it calmed down later on i know the action got more extravagant but the sound didnt seem as painfully loud or my ears got used to it,2023-04-02
missed that because i thought there will be 30 minutes of commercials and trailers before the movie,2023-04-29
i might have been expecting too much my first dolby movie or at least first i was paying attention and aside from that scene i didn’t really deal the premium ticket value,2023-03-27
i thought if i would do that there would be no sound lol,2023-04-20
consider the fact that john wick 13 takes place over the course of maybe 3 weeks at most and 4 picks up maybe a month later yeah he has earned his rest,2023-03-24
not to mention the dog looking at something and whimpering i literally dont think they could telegraph it any harder,2023-03-30
basically every single gunshot for the whole 3rd act got a seat shaking effect it was wild,2023-03-24
dolby is so worth it you feel every one of those dragon breath rounds through your whole body,2023-03-26
they did such a good job of making us think it could be either way,2023-04-28
literally hotline miami,2023-03-24
honestly this series really evolved like a video game the first movie was generally speaking more grounded because the game was just beginning and john was low level but then he survived and levelled up so the second movie introduced upgraded armour and weapons and so on thats why wick was able to survive such ridiculous  in 3 and 4 he was a really high level vitality build,2023-03-24
yeah it was cod warzone resurgence map in ashika island with all noobs running fire breathing kv broadside shotgun until they nerfed it last week lol,2023-03-24
i leaned over to my buddy and said i felt like i was watching metal gear solid in live action so cool seeing incendiary rounds in live action was one of the coolest things ever,2023-03-24
if this was not a movie franchise it would make a  of a game series all the story beats are the same pretty much too,2023-03-24
especially with the fireexplosive shotgun blastsfelt like something out of duke nukem or doom,2023-03-24
the western vibe of the pistol dual at the end with the sunrise was very much like red dead redemption 2,2023-03-24
"this was videogame the movie killa harkan was a multistage bossfight with john injuring him at the end of every stage and the overhead one take was absolutely inspired by hotline miami 

the last act was one big callback to a movie called the warriors a movie of which the story is very similarly structured to a videogame having to fight a new gang in each new neighbourhood till they make it home john wick 4 also used that same structure in the third act 

you even have the classic coop formula where john and caine have to fight together to reach their destination only to have to fight eachother at the end of the game similar to double dragon streets of rage and tons of other coop games",2023-03-28
i don’t even think it was the only video game feeling scene the arc de triompe scene was straight out of twisted metal 2,2023-03-24
ive said it before just as pacific rim is the best anime live action take thats not even adapted from any specific anime john wick series is basically the best video game adaptation that wasnt even based off a video game property its wild so many live action adaptations of games fail to capture the spirit of the works theyre based off meanwhile john wick actually feels like how a video game movie should be,2023-04-02
it was likely modeled after the john wick game called john wick hex,2023-03-24
i kept seeing exclamation marks and hearing the sound from metal gear solid ,2023-04-07
made me think of the old ps game loaded,2023-03-26
i thought the exact same thing  i loved the through the walls action it was amazing,2023-03-26
the scene with scott adkins felt like a three tiered boss fight with minions between each round,2023-03-26
yeah felt like diablo with guns loved it,2023-03-26
exactly my sentiment as well this scene plus the arc de triomphe were my favorite,2023-03-26
especially that overhead sequence,2023-03-29
exactly my thought,2023-03-29
off memory here all of the major set pieces seemed to be reminiscent of video games complete with finishing moves,2023-03-29
"it dawned on me during the watch that this would make an excellent video game

then i remembered there’s already an unofficial vr video game called pistol whip complete with mentions of baba yaga",2023-03-29
was this cgi  it seemed like cgi in some spots,2023-03-31
the director said that scene was inspired by a video game called hong kong massacre,2023-04-01
idk how but it gives me diablo vibes,2023-04-02
it actually reminded me a lot of the john wick video game i thought it was an homage to that,2023-04-15
reminded me of loaded on the ps1 especially with those ridiculous  rounds he had,2023-04-19
hi if you’re reading this i’ve decided to replacedelete every post and comment that i’ve made on reddit for the past years  i also think this is a stark reminder that if you are posting content on this platform for free you’re the product to  with this ceo and reddit’s business decisions regarding the api to independent developers this platform will die with a million cuts evvaffanculo  mass edited with redactdev,2023-05-31
but wick character is the real deal,2023-06-01
a callback to the warriors i loved it,2023-03-24
hearing justice play as he was walking up the steps was so  good,2023-03-24
a fun tidbit was that the name of the radio station was wuxia which spells out the name of the chinese martial arts genre,2023-03-25
the warriors,2023-03-24
the dj was louis and the yakuza an awesome french musician,2023-03-25
the radio station call letters being wuxia got me real good,2023-03-26
with the worlds most renown club bouncer from the worlds my famous club playing as klaus,2023-03-26
i kept expecting them to play modern love by david bowie but i guess that might have been too on the nose for them,2023-03-26
the french version of paint it black was amazing,2023-04-15
the problem about scenes are too dark,2023-03-25
i feel like that scene is what jw3 should have been,2023-03-27
i kinda wish they used the original nowhere to run but otherwise  yeah,2023-03-28
the terrible warriors rip off,2023-03-30
the car fight sequence at the arc de treumph is absolutely nutty that and the apt scene are two of my fav action scenes,2023-03-24
every fight was so amazing i really couldnt pick a favorite  so well shot for me john wick is the only franchise where the movies just keep getting better and better  im not even an action fanatic but this franchise makes fast x look like well it makes it look like fast x lol,2023-03-26
film made crossing the road and climbing stairs the coolest thing ever its insane,2023-04-02
most unrealistic part of the movie people driving around the adt would go out of their way to run all those guys over,2023-04-05
arc de triomphe scene is literally a remake of frogger  and then the dragons breath scene is just hotline miami in real life just video game vibes all round,2023-05-24
this was my favorite part so fun,2023-04-02
man i loved all the shots in tokyoosakajapan so much  cyberpunk vibes,2023-03-24
one thing i kept saying other my friends through the film it is extremely well shot,2023-03-24
"so so so glad that this was my first imax cinema film it was visually stunning in so many moments big and small 
really liked the night  orange day glow used throughout ",2023-03-24
honestly this film series sets and action genre standard,2023-03-25
the filmmaking has been getting better and better with every chapter this film’s cinematography blew me away a masterpiece,2023-04-05
the sets  locations were absolutely insane,2023-03-28
it is award worthy imo,2023-03-26
"you got 999 up votes

im about to make it 1k",2023-05-07
yea  seriously it’s awesome it’s artistic,2023-07-14
"those are shotgun shells filled with white phosphorus  brutal

edit magnesium per uarmcha1rgeneral",2023-03-24
when the movie previewed those guns earlier i was wondering how john wick would be in trouble turned out silly me those guys were just mobs to carry weapon drops  upgrades for john,2023-03-24
i think they are called incendiary rounds that scene was very fun though,2023-03-26
"incendiary rounds  
iirc that  a warcrime",2023-03-24
my friend you should watch a lil movie called constantine,2023-03-26
"i love seeing wick just using the flamethrower gun thing that was  awesome and cool

this sentence is amazing",2023-04-08
pyro from tf2 irl lol,2023-03-24
modern warfare shopment ptsd intensifies,2023-03-24
it was shot from above brilliance,2023-04-04
check out the game called hong kong massacre,2023-03-24
"it was just nerfed a couple weeks ago in warzone 

dragons breath rounds were shredding people",2023-03-24
kv broadside ,2023-03-26
5head directing,2023-03-24
and they just look good being overhead you get to see the full cone,2023-03-25
the shots of him in the japanese continential against the neon lights and lit cherry blossom tree as the wind carries loose petals across the scene were  beautiful,2023-03-24
comparing different kinds of action is incredibly hard for me like how do you compare the landing scene in saving private ryan to the bathroom fight scene in mission impossible fallout or helms deep in lotr2 to the long take boxing round in creed 1 definitely is going in my top 5 shootout scenes in no particular order 1 matrix lobby 2 john wick 1 nightclub scene 3 heat shootout 4 collateral nightclub scene 5 this scene pushed out the fenway shootout in the town,2023-03-25
the way the scene seamlessly transitioned from a third person to overhead shot was fantastic,2023-03-24
which im in two minds about  but it was an amazing sequence regardless,2023-03-24
plus another scene in a club love the throwbacks,2023-03-24
i think it was something called a hydra crane,2023-03-24
it reminded me of a really cool topdown scene from malignant where the main character is running terrified through her house,2023-03-25
minority report,2023-03-24
its in 30 days of night with the tracking shot over the town when all the vampires are emerging from the darkness to attack people,2023-03-25
i rewatched the first 3 this past weekend and they look amazing on an oled tv given how colorful they are,2023-03-26
"smarter every day  dragons breath 

these are dragons breath shotgun rounds 12 gauge shells loaded with white phosphorus or magnesium ",2023-03-24
and all the reloads,2023-03-25
"thats how i knew that i could trust him through to the end 

he was fighting with respect and not just killing",2023-03-25
yeah thats the moment i figured he was either going to be a good guy or he wasnt taking it seriously yet and eventually when he does john is in trouble,2023-03-26
the only time he killed in osaka was the samurai fight and even that was probably not intentional,2023-03-26
good catch i was wondering why he wasn’t killing people in japan,2023-03-25
bit late here but he lowered them because he shoots based on sound since he didn’t want to  them he lowered it so the doorbells are not at head height,2023-05-23
told my wife it reminded me of that feeling when you forget to save progress in a video game and have to go all the way back to start,2023-05-25
now that brings back memories,2023-04-06
not gonna lie when i saw jw in your first sentence i thought you meant jurassic world for a second and was about to rage,2023-04-23
"he said  pok gaai ham gaa caan which usually means  you may your whole family die in cantonese

as the only one who understands cantonese in my theatre i laughed the loudest there",2023-03-25
pok  ham ka chan,2023-03-24
"he really got to show his range here he had great chemistry with other actors as well

also i’m pretty sure all the sunglasses that he wears are his donnie yen sunglasses line",2023-03-25
his fighting style was so fun to watch,2023-03-26
im cantonese and i died when he said it,2023-03-29
also that he lived,2023-03-28
everyone looked slow in action scenes compared to him hes such a mad lad,2023-05-29
lights out,2023-04-12
i dunno how much of it was stunt work but my guy doesnt move like somebody who is pushing 60,2023-05-31
just like are you kidding me im blind,2023-03-24
and when he picks up the cards and pretends to read them but then fakes everyone out because he actually does know what they are hilarious,2023-03-26
the dog  got a roar from my theater but thats the only big reaction there was,2023-03-25
"this line and the second flight of stairs sent my theater into and uproar

some guy yelled more when he continued to fall and we almost hadnt recovered by donnies arrival",2023-03-25
yep that line and then the subsequent death in that same scene had my theater saying woo lol,2023-03-27
there was only 8 ppl in our showing i was the only one laughing ,2023-04-08
i wish sanadas character wasnt dead either so he could return hollywood kept wasting him with suppprting or small roles but he could easily lead a film he got talent and charisma,2023-03-24
weird google says both marchese and marquis lol,2023-03-24
lmfaooo i read that as marchcheese and it rhymed with boneappletea,2023-03-27
no,2023-03-24
yes a lot of killing,2023-03-24
tbf when not even money or fame can buy you out of the ccps reeducation camps or seizing of all of your assets  lifes work just look at jack ma who was the 3rd richest man in china you tend to tread real  carefully when it comes to anything involving them and anything short of rampant patriotism can easily come at the cost of safety for the leverage you leave behind in china theres a reason why a ton of successful people from china had started divesting in ghost properties overseas to begin with,2023-04-03
i looked it up on google its not my fault ,2023-03-24
i’m pretty sure they used both in the film,2023-03-25
when theyre setting terms for the duel the marquis says he has a nomination and gives caines name when asked who thats why caine says nope not doing it after john and winston leave which prompts the marquis to threaten caines daughter again,2023-04-09
pretty sure i saw the same stuntman who fell down the stairs the first time come back up top only to fall down again,2023-03-25
slashfilm posted an excerpt of an interview that said it took 2 days to film the fall down the stairs and the stuntman vincent bouillon fell the full length of the stairs four times,2023-03-27
during the osaka scene you can occasionally see people hesitating or taking too long to attack happened against wick and the concierge,2023-04-16
what fiasco like disappearing weapons,2023-03-25
"there’s a part of me that questions whether john is actually dead

i’m not even sure death can  john wick",2023-03-24
"you didnt see him die you saw him slump over after and entire night of the hardest fighting in his life and bearing lesser wounds than this series canonically considers lethal you did not see his body and theres only two kinds of graves with grass old ones and ones that are not dug even the last philosophical discourse hints at this reality those who cling to life receive death those who cling to death receive life 

john wick is simply hiding from the enemies he made throughout his years in service he is veryuch alive and only he and winston know it

edit also consider ballerina is taking place between 3 and 4 but the post credit scene demonstrates theres clearly more going on with akiras story which obviously cant play out in the spin off john wick killed her father she will find him she will clue in the underworld for the 40 million dollar price still on his head which in theory remains open and in escrow despite the marquiss death 

this isnt over",2023-03-24
nobody’s ever really gone,2023-03-24
i dont buy john being dead didnt see an internment didnt see a body just slumped over one sec long buried the next also there is that one quick scene when the dog looks sharply to the left might just be a dog being a dog but they could have shown the dog being sad but they showed him looking away its small but im just not convinced theyd  wick,2023-03-25
was there a tribute to him in the movie i was  looking for one i assume since it was so close to the film premiere they didn’t have enough time to put it in post does anyone nnow,2023-03-24
saw the film before it came out and before lance died this scene was still in the movie,2023-03-24
"john is definitely not dead haha  


you think hes just going to fall over on some steps with a fade away camera and thats how he goes no way he totally comes back to defend akira at some point",2023-03-26
"im not convinced wick is dead there is no birthdeath year on the headstones yet i realize his wifes should have one but you could explain that away probably fairly easily 

his plot is reserved but hes not buried yet i assume",2023-03-29
the idea of john was killed much like pennywise’s goal he can now peacefully rest until he’s pulled right back in,2023-04-05
"he is both dead and not the director said its open for interpretation and reeves said he would be open to doing more if chad came back to direct

edit even if he is dead he can come back ion spin offs like a caine shimazu or marcus spin off or  even a prequel that tells the story how he got out the first time",2023-04-10
"are you sure he knew he was dead in real life though thats odd 

example i didnt know except i didnt laugh at the scene when i saw the death scene my husband told me out of the blue that he rip and i was like ohh",2023-04-02
he is confirmed to appear in ballerina that will be likely his last appearance,2023-03-26
john wick is the vibe that’s why the ravers keep dancing they think it’s some kind of obscure performance art,2023-03-25
“the vibe’s too wavy it’s too hard to ”,2023-03-24
ain’t no flow like techno,2023-03-25
john wick club scene is like daredevil hallway scene,2023-03-28
i seriously want to know what theyre on,2023-03-26
need a dope as soundtrack to go along with his  spree,2023-03-26
 i thought it was funny how people were getting hit by cars for like 5 straight minutes and traffic never stopped even a little,2023-03-26
and for sure the majority of those patrons are not just random public trying to find the hottest club  i would wager the mostly all are crimeadjacent in some way and are used to seeing  go down and on drugs,2023-03-25
,2023-04-08
is that what you said who are you quoting,2023-03-29
a lot of them reacted to what was going on and then kept dancing germans are just built different,2023-03-25
from the sheer amount of people who were assassins in the second one this is definitely an alternate world were things are different,2023-03-24
it’s the only time it’s made sense in the series,2023-03-24
i had a good chuckle at that one girl in the silver dress that was just giving it everything she got john wick was going at it with that other dude right in front of her and she just kept dancing away like they werent even there,2023-03-24
have to remember its a club scene and most of them are high  probably thinking oh wow is this like part of a show or something,2023-03-24
yeah pretty true to berlin club life ,2023-03-25
cocaines  of a drug,2023-03-25
i give it a pass knowing the amountkinds of drugs ravers and other dancers at high end expensive clubs like that are on during the night ,2023-03-25
when germans hear a techno song they like nothing is gonna stop them from dancing,2023-03-27
hated it  suspension of disbelief  gone,2023-03-27
i was truly shocked when i saw scott adkins character start fighting i know adkins himself is an action star but i figured his character was out of shape and all in the movie so hed just have to rely on his bodyguards looks like i was wrong lmaoo,2023-04-10
knowing the people that goes out clubbing in berlin it takes more than that to shake them out of their high,2023-04-03
molly,2023-04-02
also somehow none of these bystanders is hurt in the crossfiremayhem,2023-05-26
buddy most of them are properly high in the rave,2023-06-12
they really gave up on the whole assassins in the shadows thing there was basically a terrorist attack in paris with over a hundred people dead ,2023-03-24
"i miss jimmy

bring back jimmy",2023-03-24
"i like to believe that the high table has most world governments under its thumb and the world governments only care about civilian deaths 

even in scenes where there are crowds and gunfights or car chases care is taken to not harm bystanders",2023-03-24
"i think police presence can at least be explained  just by the “you working again” scene in the first film it implies that whenever  goes down in that world they’re told to be elsewhere  

doesn’t explain the nonchalant attitude of civilians but at least why cops don’t turn up",2023-03-29
i wouldnt be surprised if the police ambulance fire brigade etc are also all their own group of assassins in this world,2023-03-24
yeah you wouldnt be a cop in that world either lol,2023-03-26
there was a police boat in new york in the background,2023-03-26
it’s paris they’re probably on strike,2023-05-07
"im no longer convinced there are any cops im thinking jimmy in the first movie is part of a private police force for johns fancy neighborhood 

in this universe you pay for protection or you pay for vengeance hence the assassins everywhere its like a gig business serving people with grudges or grief",2023-06-02
yes the berlindancing and the pariscars both felt like something out of tekken,2023-03-25
that’s a flex from the high table they can just take that location from the public,2023-03-26
we’ll see it starts with john killing a bunch of people to escape then he kills a bunch of people to  one guy then he kills a bunch of people so he could get to the duel then he kills the bad guy and dies,2023-07-15
the nunchuck scene would like to have a word with you,2023-03-25
"once he got that viper it was really weird seeing john get attached to a weapon 

i’ve gotten  to him throwing pistols at people when he’s out of ammo",2023-04-30
"yeah
       john wick",2023-03-25
john and nobody both say yeah,2023-03-25
i feel like it’s never a surprise when a skarsgård is good in a movie,2023-04-09
"since the start he was protecting john making him harder to  so his bounty is eventually worth more and more and when he sees a good enough number go  him

he tried to  him at the end at paris but john saved his dog by shooting the marquis’ goon instead of shooting him that’s why he decided to stop hunting john and instead help him",2023-04-03
"nobody honestly was probably the only part i didnt really enjoy

i didnt really understand him at all  like just someone thrown in there to have a dog",2023-04-12
being around an insane amount of gunshots might impair your hearing,2023-04-30
i would love if they just pick up the story from donnie yen and rina sawayamas pov like the end credits show,2023-03-24
if they give spin offs i’m not mad at that but not another one i mean really what the  else can they do they did every form of violence i can even think of in as many ways as possible,2023-03-25
wasnt a 5th confirmed a while ago,2023-03-25
id settle for john wick before he retired show us the impossible task he had to pull off to leave and go marry helen,2023-03-25
id love a prequel movie of john getting out tbh it would be cool to see more of how these bonds john had grew in the past,2023-03-25
lol ambiguous  he gives a final dying word slumps over lifeless on the stairs while bleeding out and they cut to his  tombstone  did you need bones to check his pulse and say hes dead jim,2023-03-26
my bet is they make a 5th movie centering around a different maybe neweryoung assassin and as part of their journey they are  on the run and they find john wick who trains them to be badder than ever,2023-03-28
yeah it ended to where it would make sense if they made another within the story as he couldn’t be in hiding “who knows” but if that was the last john wick then that is also a very very solid ending to the franchise,2023-03-26
i loved all 4 john wick movies and they should stop here and quit while they’re ahead if they continue john wick’s storyline at this point it’s going to feel very cheap and unecessary,2023-04-09
not that ambiguous… they gave him the godfather 3 send off and included a gravestone scene ffs,2023-03-25
man i feel the exact opposite the last 3 minutes felt completely tacked on and i have no idea what we watched him fighting for in the last 3 movies if his freedom means immediately dying,2023-03-24
hes not dead,2023-03-28
the director has not confirmed anything he left it open for the audience,2023-03-26
why not the marchese took back the place of his nominated released him from all obligations midduel  was then killed all technicalities were fulfilled  followed,2023-03-24
even he found skarsgard insufferable,2023-03-24
"honestly i feel the opposite like john dying invalidates all the sacrifices his friends have made for him and the ones hes made himself to earn his freedom the deaths become pointless and to what end so john wouldnt have to be an assassin anymore but hes killing people anyway

idk especially considering the high emotion of the osaka fights and hiroyukis lines about owing john a debt not relegated to markers but also continuing to fight donnies character and claiming to be doing it for his daughter whats for his daughter certainly not fighting someone elses pointless fight you have to believe its for a higher reason aka standing against the table to help john dismantle it so akira doesnt have to live under those rules for that he gave up his life to give john the chance to escape because if not for that reason all the death in osaka is pointless why was john even there 

and i just dont think thats the type of man john is just letting friends die so he can stop by for a chat because he had multiple chances to  friends throughout and he never did he values his friends lives jw films arent just mindless action movies they literally revolve around emotional arcs and decisions as the driving points 

so if john is dead while the high table still exists then john knowingly put his friend in lethal danger for absolutely no reason and that just doesnt sit the right way with me 

anyway im team faked death john wick is still a martyr inspiring others to rebel and he still gets his freedom the loving husband died a long time ago as they said in the movie who knows where he is now",2023-03-25
whats the fifth movie him escaping from afterlife after killing everyone there,2023-03-30
i know this line from my peloton instructor,2023-06-24
"on the other side of the spectrum my best friend of 30 years basically stopped caring about me at all this year

that line  killed me inside",2023-03-26
idk man if you’re talking about the guy in japan he was a true ride or die for john lol,2023-03-24
similar message but i wouldn’t go as far as to say they’re quoting tolkien,2023-03-28
 its from tolkien headass ,2023-03-28
nothing to do with friendship,2023-03-29
lol when did he grab that i missed it,2023-03-25
lol yes you just knew that wasnt just a pencil and they were gonna use it well,2023-08-05
caine is what zero wished he was,2023-03-26
id agree with you but the stress of worrying if the dog might die during the entire length of the movie is too much for me,2023-04-01
"i wish theyd given him a backstory like having some huge debt he has to clear or a huge purchase he wants to make his own continental

otherwise i cant fathom how he thinks a 20 million bird in the hand is worth 50 millions worth of birds in the bush especially given that he walks away from it in the end there",2023-04-17
would have made more sense sad we didn’t get to see her again,2023-04-15
japan worked so well because the three big assassins got to show off just how cool they are like you feel that these guys are definitely the very best the high table can throw at you and the only thing it does is make johncaine exert effort,2023-03-24
"the berlin nightclub was hilarious and not in a bad way

there were ladies and gentlemen gyrating undulating floating gliding smiling and staring obliviously at the insane asthmatic guy throwing and being thrown around by the silent blacksuited assassin its tuesday for them

berlin nightclub guy was absolutely the secondlifebar boss i giggled at his why dont you die i was thinking it was this guy who would just never die",2023-03-24
but the nightclub had the moooooney slomo shot of john entering the rave through the fog and i swear they brought back some of the same techno from one the first movie,2023-03-24
"i loved how the intro to osaka only served to show the audience the layout of the coming action and was hardly even focussed on wick 

mostly on his friends mrnobody the marquis hand and caines abilities",2023-03-25
the apartment was unique cool and had me cheesing but i agree with japan it just felt like great choreography good ole action character introductions and even character deaths while the apartment had the fun with cinematography and insane gun,2023-03-24
i agree about the berlin nightclub the red circle scene in the first movie did it better imo still loved it though,2023-03-24
"	the only extended battle setpiece that didn’t hit like an alltimer for me was the berlin nightclub and even still that was a hugely entertaining scene

yeah that was the only one i think didn’t hit the mark for me the villain was comical johns fall would have almost certainly killed him and it just wasn’t as good as the other action scenes and it’s also a let down because the scene from the red circle in the first movie is still one of my favourites

thing is it was still far better than most other action scenes in most other movies it just doesn’t come close to the others in the earlier movies or this one",2023-03-24
the duel was so elegant and beautifully shot also i find it great that what eventually killed john wick was losing a duel to a blind man,2023-03-25
the visuals of falling water in the berlin club looked amazing though and of course scott atkins killed it,2023-03-27
the osaka scene really set the tone for the film it was non stop from there,2023-03-28
"arc de triomphe was good but mission impossible did a motorcycle chase in the same location so that was hard to ignore

very impressive how they shot that though really made sure his face is visible without ruining it",2023-03-29
the night club scene was top sequence in the movie for me with 1 being the house and 3 being the osaka continental the hand to hand with the axes was a nice change of pace just like the nun chuks in japan to the two the body one to the head gun stuff,2023-03-25
i just wish the world around them would react normally to what was going on,2023-03-30
yeah berlin was the weaker part i believe i feel like they couldve halved the time spent on it it really just went back and forth and left me kind of confused about the whole sequence,2023-04-03
nunchaku for sure was the most entertained and the hotline miami pov dragon breath shotgun was the most beautiful,2023-06-18
i didnt like the night club fight i know extras are just extras but still its super weird that they witness people fighting seriously right in front of them some dying and then just go back to dancing and stuff its not like the crowd is used as a stunt setpiece ala jackie chan either so they dont need to be there idk why they didnt just make the crowd panic and clear up the place from the start,2023-03-27
for some reason it had too many different themes and set pieces that it felt a little silly compared to the last ones i remember the twins fight with iron chef guy vividly and the mirror room from 2 but this one was like last samurai a over the top kingpin boss frogger fight and the cod fire shotgun fight then for a few dollars more ending it felt a little bit too all over the place with cheese for some reason not sure why it felt like that compared to the last and with the scenes of him falling down the entire staircase i thought the 3rd movie was better got a little over parody of itself in this one,2023-03-28
"guess im hard to please but i was not impressed with osaka scene

people fighting ar15s with swords and bows
is not my thing",2023-04-22
"i dunno man the stairs scene the inability of these henchmen to hit anything thats 20m away is getting to be a bit much   


also i didnt like the just lift my jacket up to my jaw and im bulletproof gimmick felt it cheapened wicks signature gunfu",2023-11-04
they couldve showed that 4 minute scene and rolled credits and i would be like i got my 14 bucks worth of cinema deuces,2023-03-24
100 video game moment and its ripped straight off hotline miami which is possibly the coolest thing an action movie has ever done ever,2023-03-25
i was laughing inside when i saw them trying out just thinking you know youre just giving john wick another way to  you right ,2023-03-26
yeah when they were prepping i was just thinking well that’s a bad idea for them…,2023-03-25
it was the most fun 10 minutes ive ever had in a movie theatre,2023-04-27
i dont think those rounds come in clips,2023-07-08
"i agree with everything with youve just said youre absolutely spot on in how each action scene looked and felt and this will be a very unpopular opinion but my  osaka and the arc de triomphe action scenes dragged on for a good ten minutes too long the berlin rave action scene actually felt like it was the right length it wasnt too long it wasnt too short same as the house and stairs action scenes

i was physically exhausted by the time the film ended i felt like i needed a nap there was no room to breathe i love the film and ill absolutely watch it again but theres no way i could watch it all in one go again or as part of a marathon 

honestly as much as i love these films as a whole i have to say that the first two are my favourites because the action scenes felt like the right length and to be honest the only parts about jw3 that i like were the first and third acts in new york i felt like once he got to casablanca the film grinded to a halt and i didnt like halle berry and her attack dogs as much as the armored high table soldiers at the end

and given how this film ended i kinda hope it really is the last one im really not sure where they could take it storywise and i just feel like the action scenes are gonna get longer and longer in an effort to outdo the last action scene in the film",2023-03-25
"for me i was getting a lot of fighting fatigue at the arc de triumph scene it didnt help that our theater i think over pushed the volume it was extremely loud i thought that act was a little excessive 

other than that loved it",2023-03-29
"they absolutely used the nfl superbowl camera system youre spot on

edit fixed the link sorry

x200b

",2023-03-27
i’m honestly still having a hard time comprehending that they actually killed john off  what a brilliantly fun action  franchise  i’ll never tire of keanu blasting dudes away,2023-03-25
then cut away for a short fight with another character then do the overhead long take again,2023-03-25
"it looked like single take but  im not sure it was i think each room was its own thing and theres breaks in the action could super impose the camera view of one room with that of another

still incredibly impressive",2023-04-09
haha yes felt so bad for that guy some of them got it way worse than others see nuts kills,2023-03-27
i was honestly expecting it to escalate into a full structure fire with the fight continuing on as everything burned down  a flaming hellscape would have fit right in with the other religious imagery in this film,2023-03-29
that gun shot trains from ,2023-03-25
i had this exact same thought,2023-03-29
my theatre laughed harder with each set of stairs he tumbled down,2023-03-24
reminded me of the beginning of kung pow with the baby,2023-03-24
it reminded me of the princess bride with the scene of wesley and buttercup rolling down the hill,2023-03-24
i could only see hot rod in front of me,2023-03-26
best rolls since lone survivor,2023-03-24
john sisyphus wick,2023-03-26
i was laughing definitely saw a set of stairs where you could tell the stuntman planted a foot and gave a big push to make the distance needed,2023-03-26
slinky slinky everyone loves a slinky,2023-03-25
hot rod,2023-03-26
,2023-03-26
that one scene from hot rod,2023-04-02
reminded me of that scene in hot rod i was dying laughing,2023-04-15
was literally the princess bride,2023-03-26
 that was so funny,2023-04-09
loved how he kicked himself some more speed down the stairs when he hit a platform,2023-11-04
which also had ian mcshane,2023-03-24
"me too   

and i think i laughed just as hard",2023-03-24
winston “you couldn’t beat a drum”,2023-04-07
first thing that hit my mind lol,2023-03-26
same,2023-04-02
reminded me of surf ninjas,2023-03-28
princess bride,2023-03-28
which also had ian mcshane,2023-03-25
it was supposed to be funny  everything is over the top including falling down stairs,2023-03-26
it felt something very necessary for the saga that we never had in the seriesever,2023-03-24
it’s a very simple but powerful line honestly didn’t expect it from a john wick film,2023-03-24
"i love how donnie yen isnt portrayed as a onedimensional villain whos completely blind pun intended to his mission of protecting his daughter from the marquis

he struggles with his mission because the target is the man who he considers a lifelong brother and even spent the time with him and even help him even though it risks both his and his daughters life",2023-03-25
legitimately just realized this might be why i occasionally talk out loud to people who are gone even though i’m not religious,2023-03-24
the added touch to that line with keanu losing his irl girlfriend makes it sting for me even more,2023-03-24
“it’s nice talking with a friend” too,2023-03-25
we couldnt stop snickering at how bad their acting is it was like they were having a competition on terrible line delivery,2023-03-25
yep  my guess is its the “way” they can bring him back for 5 by giving us the clue he is still alive,2023-03-24
maybe winston faked wicks death just in case the high table rescinds the deal  after all even though wick did  the marchese de gramont he didnt  the nominated caine as stipulated in the deal,2023-03-28
yeah,2023-03-24
we already have nobody with bob odenkirk,2023-10-20
duuude i thought hed fall a level or two down the stairs not the entire  way reminded me of that scene in hot rod when he falls down the mountain,2023-03-24
my theater cracked up at the stairs too especially when he started falling again,2023-03-25
someone yelled “back to level one” and someone else yelled “ gotta reload my save” i thought that was amusing lol,2023-03-27
and he had to do it twice,2023-03-28
the sound of his fist hitting in those opening minutes whew,2023-03-26
amd a smoker dont forget that part,2023-03-29
lol just got back from the movie that scene makes me think of neymar rolling dive meme,2023-03-24
it was definitely part of the intention i think it just went on a little too long and you just get amused at the dedication of the film makers to keep the rolling going,2023-03-24
all i could think of was hot rod,2023-03-24
its going to become a meme soon just watch,2023-03-26
it’s like when he got to the flat parts he kept rolling on purpose,2023-03-28
like a  family guy fight scene,2023-03-24
i was laughing my  off and then he fell down the rest of the stairs and i just kept laughing,2023-03-25
legend holds he is still rolling,2023-03-25
i laughed so hard  all i could think about was ace ventura and the slinky down the stairs,2023-03-27
reminded me of the surf ninja scene at the end,2023-03-28
i really loved that sequence of her repeatedly stabbing one of the big henchmen it was such a visceral moment one of the highlights,2023-03-24
screen presence is exactly the term id use as well as soon as she showed up as the desk clerk my eye was drawn to her because of how magnetic she was on screen i had no idea who she was or that she was a singer,2023-03-24
wish we saw more of her,2023-03-24
this was her first role wow,2023-03-24
"i liked how her and her father compartmentalized their work and personal lives specifically with the line that she setup dinner for him with his daughter and he wonders what he did to deserve such a thoughtful daughter

then at the end of the same conversation its revealed its just both of them its a very sweet scene",2023-03-24
"rina sawayama 

she was spectacular",2023-03-24
"shes a singer

she killed it screen presence and action
her acting and fighting she sold it

i just assumed she was an already established actress with action chops

i want a movie with her",2023-03-24
she was so badass i loved her outfit and hair,2023-03-24
me and my buddy had no idea who she was and was sad that she didnt play a bigger role although the previous movies also had characters who helped and then checked out,2023-03-24
if she did her own fight stunts like keanu does his than i am more than impressed just think back to the likes of rihanna or beyoncé in movies and this chick is leagues better than you’re usual pop star in a movie,2023-03-24
i hope they make a spin off movie focusing on kojis daughter seeking revenge against caine,2023-03-25
they did the same thing in the raid 2 with hammer girl who knew pop stars was such an untapped action star market,2023-03-24
yea same she could be the next big female action star,2023-04-01
common was great in john wick 2 as well,2023-05-26
winston just knows the rules and knows exactly when he can push and get his way he had the marquis by the letter of the rules and thus by the balls,2023-03-25
well ive always wondered why john being the greatest assassin to ever live never got promoted from the russian mob to being a high table enforcer  this would explain it,2023-03-27
he just wanted his hotel back lol poor guy,2023-03-26
whole theater laughed for me,2023-03-24
my theater had a laugh i think the one where he rolls all the way back down and donnie yen helps him up is definitely a comedic moment,2023-03-24
it gave me flashbacks to lone survivor which also featured unintentionally hilarious extended scenes of actors falling down hills,2023-03-24
i wanted to shout out as youuu wishhhhh,2023-03-24
laughing was the correct response my wife and i were discussing how we honestly find it baffling how many others dont seem to get the humour in the entire series and take it all far too seriously,2023-03-26
nah man i started laughing too other then when he hit his head on that one lamp,2023-03-24
my theatre started laughing when he got to the third set i thought it was hilarious,2023-03-25
rolling down a flight of stairs ouch continuously rolling down the stairs then roll down some more and when you thought its the end he rolls down another flight of stairs crosses the line and go back to being funny,2023-04-02
i thought of that too winston is the dad in that movie too,2023-03-26
there was a lot of laughter in the audience when i went to see it,2023-03-26
i thought they let it get a little to over the too in this one personally it kinda became a parody of itself in a way that i liked the last one better they had really  goofy villains in this one too that card scene was shot kinda stock photo looking with the lighting and wick should’ve been throwing all kinds of cards at people haha i do like they did a throwback to the pencil with donnie yen but why did they need another dog k9 fight,2023-03-28
whole theater laughed  hot rod is exactly what i thought of feels completely like a parody,2023-03-26
given how much of the movie seemed like a video game vibe it felt like him having to return to his last save point but yeah he really just kept rolling for far longer than expected,2023-04-01
i actually said you  out loud when the guy kicked him back down ,2023-04-05
it reminded me of kung pows intro,2023-04-19
"late to the party but i laughed too i chuckled when he was falling down the second flight and just started more and more the longer he just kept going lol

then caine came and picked him up and i welled up a little bit roller coaster of emotions that scene",2023-06-01
right after he had been hit by like 10 cars,2023-03-26
i would love to see caine stop her train her tell her that shes done training when she can  the blind man,2023-03-26
gessafelstein is french too,2023-03-24
don’t forget gesaffelstein,2023-03-25
daft punk would also have been a stellar addition,2023-03-25
gesaffstein goes so  hard  made me wanna get up and start fighting too,2023-03-26
oh  crystal method’s in this,2023-04-01
song names,2023-03-27
three sequels and none have managed to make a sequence as excellent as the red circle nightclub,2023-03-27
was it genesis i thought it was phantom pt one,2023-03-25
yes,2023-03-25
was it ever not,2023-03-26
dreams by zhunero,2023-03-27
i thought i did too in the fight with killa but its called blood code by le castle vania its so good,2023-03-28
im pretty sure that in the stairs fight scene we hear le perv by carpenter brut,2023-04-16
i don’t think there was a rezz song she not he btw  maybe youre thinking of the gesaffelstein song during the arc de triomphe sequence rezz is very much gesaffelstein inspired,2023-03-30
scott adkins was having the time of his life in that role and i was all for it,2023-03-27
hoohoohoohehehehe,2023-03-25
the other frame from the whale finally got released,2023-03-24
after getting up from the sofa he realized his potential,2023-03-24
“i need to know that i have done one good fight in my life”,2023-04-02
it was barely schmidt from new girl still had a blast,2023-03-26
the whale whailing,2023-04-12
so much speed in that kick its nuts,2023-03-25
if you havent watched stuntmenwomen react on corridorcrew you absolutely need to they sit down with scott multiple times and go over action scenes hes done,2023-07-08
 scott adkins more like buff penguin,2023-03-25
loved the throw back to the tracks from the first movie,2023-03-25
felt like they made a couple scenes the definitive versions of previous fights cause they knew it would be end  full circle moments fight in a more luxurious club  bigger fall from the 1st movie wick saving nobodys dog vehicle combat from 2 to all those cars in paris stair fight from 2 to the stairs in this one,2023-03-26
honestly the best club scene is from part 2,2023-03-25
if he was bald he would have looked like a comic accurate kingpin,2023-03-24
"it did look great only time i could tell it was a  suit was when jw did like a bear hug grab and the suit kinda shrank in

great mini boss type character",2023-03-29
i was a little surprised that they had the  dude that can still kick  when he wants to they let him be a semilegitimate threat to john,2023-06-01
hes the exact opposite of slept on though hes very well regarded as one of the absolute best in the business,2023-03-26
watch avengement someone definitely had that movie in mind when they brought in scott adkins for this one,2023-07-29
im convinced donnie yen is a jedi irl,2023-03-24
i am one with mr wick mr wick is with me,2023-03-24
“i am one with the force and the force is with me”,2023-04-04
i am one with the force and the force is one with me,2023-04-07
no he asked for the bilnd  to spice things up and i like his scene the most so,2023-03-27
except that unlike in star wars he actually kick major  here also as per the rules of wuxia kungfu films everyone knows that being disabled isnt a nerf its a powerup the main guy from condor heroes part 2 got his major skill upgrade after he lost his arm,2023-04-02
the stabs were so fast and smooth,2023-03-25
this i laughed so hard when i saw it since i am a big fan of the ip man series and its basically his most iconic move,2023-04-06
"i feel you his fighting style was sick but there was really no need for him to be blind i simply could not suspend my disbelief for that part
i’d say make him blind in one eye or missing an arm or something",2023-04-08
"if youre looking for realism the blind guy whos a trained assassin shouldnt be the first thing bothering you john wick should have been dead since chapter 1 or 2 when he got hit by multiple cars he should be dead from contusions or just broken spine chapter 3 ended with him literally dropping from a five floor building

and each time he fights with a gun the guy puts his arm up as if the bullets are just punches",2023-04-06
yeah felt like a typical kung fu trope shoehorned into the movie,2023-04-30
double tap,2023-04-30
but he dressed so well too,2023-04-05
this guy seriously has acting chops  when we first see him i thought how is he going to hold his own against lance reddick and ian mcshane but he definitely did  he was unbelievable as pennywise too  might be my favorite skarsgard after this,2023-03-26
i really wanted to see the marquis throw down too bad we didnt get that,2023-03-26
how about young dr doom,2023-03-24
 i would love this,2023-03-25
eater of worlds,2023-04-03
"alexa play get the gat

oh  the marquis is dead",2023-03-25
all of his get ups were over the top as  lol,2023-03-24
did i catch it correctly that he never had the same outfit twice,2023-03-25
stick to a windsor or half windsor knot though,2023-03-25
"its weird that stahelski has talked about all the plot threads and arcs that they had to cut out because almost none of the characters really do much nobody just wants some money and then he decides to let it go at the end because john saved his dog thats it they were building up the bowery king and how he has this big underground rebellion against the high table that hes trying to pull off and he stops by to drop off a suit give him a brief boat ride and thats pretty much it akira seemed like she was going to team up with john or something but just drops out of the film completely instead

this film just has no idea what to do with any of the characters",2023-03-26
"yeah i actually first learned about it in a call of duty game haha
",2023-03-29
i got a bit annoyed by that in osaka before caines fight,2023-03-24
a lot of the times also you can tell they were flailing around pointlessly while jw was busy with another guy waiting for him instead of using that time to attack him,2023-03-25
i mean i think the problem is that its pretty impractical for 1 person to beat a whole group at once no matter the skill level so having that happen on screen is going to pretty much require some of the participants to be useless for parts of the fight and take turns so the protagonist doesnt get instantly overwhelmed there are certainly less and more believable ways to do it and for the most part i think john wick does a pretty good job but i think its just inherent to 1 v many fight scenes,2023-03-25
"its still better than the earlier films where john bursts into a room grabs a guys gun holds him in a joint lock as he shoots everyone else then shoots that guy last then he takes the gun fires off a few rounds as he moves down the hallway and throws it away before repeating it again and again and again

or in 3 how they kept reusing the same basic moves with the dogs repeatedly

i think they run into a problem with the choreography where they come up with a few moves and then repeat them in overextended fight scenes they would benefit greatly from cutting them down into shorter tighter sequences with a lot less repetition",2023-03-26
literally every action movie ever  watch  bill vol 1  they are legit dancing around waiting their turn,2023-03-24
im not sure about 4 since i cant rewatch the scenes yet but i feel like scenes such as the knife gallery scene in 3 handle background enemies pretty well they are often struggling from wounds or trying to get up after a takedown granted they still come in groups of 2 most of the time,2023-03-26
i was doing this for this movie also the guy who kept hitting the large drum in japan was hilariously throwing himself into it while waiting for john to give him some attention,2023-04-01
thats just good life advice,2023-04-02
he rigged the hands fed them all exactly what he wanted them to have,2023-03-31
dune 2 will probably gun for that category again,2023-03-28
yeah but not really mission impossible was always quality but not this kind ofidk cyberpunkyish lighting quality to it this movie was just oozing drip all over,2023-04-04
i think there is a valid argument against a best stunt oscar regarding oneupmanship that said a best stunt choreography oscar could broaden it from just a single stunt to a wider set piece,2023-03-25
oscars be like sorry mates keanu did his own stunts so youre disqualified,2023-03-28
the sunrise at sarce coeur would be a cool desktop wallpaper but it looked a bit garish in the movie,2023-03-24
the problems with working with sunrises,2023-03-24
i heard they used vintage lenses for the film maybe it didnt mesh well with the cgi,2023-04-02
their stated reason for not having one is the concern that stunt performers would try to top each other in pursuit of the oscar and put themselves at risk with more and more dangerous stunts something like that,2023-03-24
when was the last time we saw the police in this franchise though,2023-03-25
i understand your point from a logical perspective but it is funny that people get flatout murdered at these clubs in front of giant crowds of dancing background extras and the background extras just keep dancing like there’s literally no tomorrow,2023-04-10
caines daughter is playing another piece on her violin somewhere in paris cain is slowly approaching her with a bouqet of flowers smelling it seemingly unsure wether he should go to her or not a hooded figure starts approaching him we see a frontal shot showing its akira she closes in on cain flicks out a knife cuts to black,2023-03-30
honestly thats what has surprised me about the whole series and i loved them for it somehow theyve continued to make the fight scenes more intense and its been amazing,2023-03-25
and even with higher budgets they still somehow are in the 100m or less group which is kinda impressive,2023-03-26
not enough stairs,2023-03-27
highly recommend the ip man series if you want some more donnie yen especially the first one but the sequels are still good fun,2023-03-25
spl killzone is another great yen flick and has one of the best knife fights youll ever see,2023-03-25
iron monkey thank me later,2023-03-26
"hes a fantastic supporting character in hero which is a  beautiful movie by the way flashpoint is also really good for a solo outing


he also did the fight choreography for blade 2 which hes also in for a hot minute",2023-03-28
yeah he did an interview recently about his previous works and he said he requested to be blind in rogue one to make it more interesting rather than just playing another stereotypical old kung fu master in rogue one,2023-03-24
wow that exchange where he says they didnt take my eyes i gave them hits differently with this context,2023-03-26
dennis reynolds,2023-04-30
no way i knew he looked familiar never attempted berghain but i love berlin,2023-03-25
loved the characters in this one,2023-03-24
yeah very strange humor put in for no reason but apparently one guy was on the floor laughing about it so i guess some people like it not for me,2023-03-25
why,2023-12-31
the the musical locket is straight from for a few dollars more,2023-03-27
the mc from the warriors,2023-05-15
my favourite was having clancy brown say “there can only be one” at the eiffel tower,2023-04-04
same,2023-03-24
what song and when,2023-03-24
hate or glory,2023-03-29
simple tech versus mission impossible tech,2023-03-29
john was out of ammo in that scene but yeah it was my favorite part of the osaka segment,2023-03-27
glokta you crippled ,2023-04-03
there’s an insurance company in paris that is  right now,2023-03-24
"the stunt drivers mustve been stressed throughtout the shoot not to hurt keanu the dog or any of the stunt people 

i just honestly got so nervous and worried for wick as he gotta dodge getting hit from the cars and assassins at the same time",2023-03-24
he fell from the 4th floor onto a car ,2023-03-24
good to see in paris people will fly 60kph through a roundabout at 4am and not stop after hitting you,2023-03-24
it was like frogger but all the frogs had guns and were trying to  each other,2023-03-24
he nearly always jumped so he was more rolling with it and knowing how to take a hit and roll with it makes a huge difference,2023-03-25
somebody needs to do a bit by car count in this movie it’s at least 30,2023-03-24
" cars must be built different

i mean technically cars especially european ones are built with pedestrian safety in mind",2023-03-25
idk what’s more impressive him surviving those hits by the cars or him surviving those high  falls or him surviving rolling down the whole set of stairs,2023-03-26
"my jack russell once got hit by a car she just walked it off if she could talk she’d have said “yeah but you should see the other guy”

jack russells are clinically insane though",2023-03-26
his suit is over the top now bulletproof is one thing and falling over the building was a little crazy in the last one this time he got smashed by frogger cars and fell off a building and fell down that staircase for 10 hours it was too much it got too cheesy this time,2023-03-28
honestly at one point in the cinema i thought i was gonna get hit by a car too,2023-04-01
they made  sure to reassure everyone that the dog is always ok and i appreciated that ,2023-03-25
the suits probably absorb a fair amount of the impact in order to stop a bullet impact of that bullet is spread throughout the armor itself instead of at the single point of impact for the bullet that usually happens so since they have suits that effectively can deflect bullets at near point blank range i imagine there must be some science shenanigans that would allow it to take a lot more punishment,2023-03-26
so many of them had series frame damage too like bone isnt stronger than metal i dont think,2023-03-26
its definitely an alternate world and nothing like ours  people dancing 2 feet away from john getting smashed by killa,2023-03-24
i think in general its just harder to  people in the john wick universe thats why theres so many double tap head shots,2023-03-28
the kevlar suit came equipped with airbags they just forgot to mention it,2023-04-12
"getting hit by cars is john wicks kryptonite like 95 of the damage he suffered over 4 films was from getting hit by cars

i laugh every time it happens at this point",2023-04-23

 after it looks quite easy for john wick to get up chidi the jack bauer of assistants is at the top and kicks john down i was dying when they showed him falling for the first few seconds but then they keep going like hes humpty dumpty ,2023-03-24
i literally thought to myself no way the next scene tops this and then it  did,2023-03-24
thank you i appreciate the sympathy,2023-04-12

the entire german club sequence was awesome in imax it sounded so good lol,2023-03-24
the true winners is the audience nice to see cruise and reeves holding it down for the action genre,2023-03-24
saw it in dolby and it was incredible,2023-03-24
i did that and might have hearing loss,2023-03-24
my greatest regret is not living nearby an imax theatre currently it was awesome on a regular big screen i imagine imax was amazing,2023-03-24
were any of the scenes actually filmed for imax i noticed the picture never opened up fully,2023-03-25
i did 4d it literally smelled like cherry blossoms when they were in japan crazy,2023-03-25
the movie was wildly loud the opening shot scared the  out of me it was  glorious,2023-03-27
i missed that for all of them hopefully theres so rescreenings in the future,2023-04-25
mifallout is the best action movie ever made imo,2023-03-24
not sure if i entirely agree obviously the mi movies have insane set pieces but the handtohand combat is far superior in john wick and mi has never come close to it in that regard,2023-03-24
 me but cruise is 100x the actor that reeves is,2023-03-29
i need both of them in my life,2023-03-24
" which is almost entirely gun fu shootouts

as much as i like john wick i have to agree at some point its not as exciting to see john shooting people in the head again and again with a pistol i think the reason the apartment fight in this movie was the most entertaining to me wasnt just the camera work but it was also that it was one of the few fights in this movie where he wasnt using a pistol the whole time",2023-03-26
"i like how mission impossible does stuff during the daytime
jw tends to hide a lot of stuff in the dark",2023-03-24
i prefer mi movies cause they have some kind of high stakes which is something wick will never have proper stakes in which i can root for the main character,2023-03-28
"fights always trump big set pieces for me

big budget action set pieces are usually the protagonists vs objects or the environment a well choreographed fight performed by people is more engaging

john wick this one in particular manages to marry set piece and some of the best action choreography in cinema nothing in any mi movie is as memorable to me as some of the scenes in the jw franchise i dont recall anything as good as that overhead sequence or anything getting as many reactions out of me as his entire journey to the church",2023-03-24
" it feels like mission impossible can do what wick does but wick never does what mission does

i love the mi movies and the stunts are incrediblebut the john wick franchise has much more engagingimpressive camera work imo and its not just the oneshots as awesome as they are they get a little experimental and creative with things like the topdown shot in the paris apartment

like you said though candy vs ice cream i watch mi for the spectacle and the 23 how tf did tom cruise do that stunts i watch john wick to see beautifully shotchoreographed fights",2023-03-24
"i think mi takes it just for the story telling aspects

i saw jw4 this weekend and i don’t think i’ve ever been as bored in a theater since mr baseball

i wouldn’t say jw4 was bad but it was very uninteresting to me they’ve basically given everyone bulletproof super suits and of a three hour movie it’s basically two hours of action sequences if that’s your thing fine but there’s only so much of john wrestling guys and shooting them in their neck when he gets close that i can take",2023-03-26
"arc de triumphe was choreographed like an mi scene

john wick focues more on the art of weapons  the high velocity arrows scenes were wicked

mi build tension around stakes effecting the team if mission fails  john wick doesnt have tension because of plot armor  but they killed charon to raise the stake with winston possibly dieing so writers are doing better",2023-03-30
"i enjoy an actual plot that pushes and drives the action so that there are rational reasons behind it and also there is a thread of realism behind the scenes and moves 

wick is nothing but a glossy video game  set that lasts 3 hours and 400 body count",2023-07-11
and runs fast,2023-03-25
"both franchises have become iconic for their lead actors going above and beyond to learn the skills their characters use and do as many stunts as they can without a double 

and it really pays off in both cases",2023-03-24

keanu has never been a good actor the wick movies have been great though because he doesn’t really need to be a good actor they instead surround him with great talent and most of the time he just kinda stands in the background or remains silent while everyone else talks,2023-03-24
his lines were so stilted even for keanu stood out even more when you heard other characters speaking really like a guy recovering from a  or concussion trying really hard to form and article monosyllabic words,2023-03-27
if you look on twitter a lot of people wonder if john wick is autistic the dialogue and acting does give off that impression,2023-03-27
which is why john wick is the perfect role  hes a broken man basically a revenant struggling to hold on to some sliver of a reason to live  speaking like a zombie is as much a character choice as it is an adaptation of keanus acting limitations,2023-03-29

exactly thank you,2023-03-24
i think thats sort of the point the guy has literally done nothing since birth apart from train to be a hitman and  people lol hes not the most verbose even if he is multilingual,2023-04-10
eh no one gives a  what religion tom cruise is other than reddit and twitter  he makes great movies and is a great actor,2023-03-24
we’re talking about movies buddy this isn’t an election cruise’s personal beliefs have no bearings on how we should feel about his movies,2023-03-24
that has practically zero relevance when comparing the two,2023-03-24
has cruise even publically talked about that in the last fifteen years,2023-03-25
did you stop at 3 i think thats the only way it makes any sense to say the others are average plenty of people consider fallout to be one of the best action movies of all time definitely one of the best of the last decade rogue nation and ghost protocol arent that far behind,2023-03-25
haha yeah you might be taking a bit of your napkin and sticking it in your ear for this one,2023-03-25
,2023-03-26
that’s what actually popped into my head first before hotline miami i think because the action in john wick is closer to hong kong massacre than hm,2023-03-25
same i was watching johns gun because i was so sure he was going to shoot the marquis directly instead he just held the shot brilliant,2023-03-26
i thought it was obvious he didn’t shoot not like ugh bad scene obvious just like oh  he’s gonna pull this off,2023-04-03
i only watched the movie today and it was the opposite for me my dad noticed and leaned in to tell me cheers bud,2023-04-21
i thought the guy getting pinned through his helmet to the wall was insane that is until the other guy got pinned by his knee and just ragdolled,2023-03-24

the sound design was just otherworldly,2023-03-25

"nah all he has to do is  for the rest of time 

everyone who says he is  are the people who cause the  the trail of bodies grow larger and everyone ignores that for no reason",2023-03-24
"i disagree with the director here

a system that forces a grieving man to go back into work is a system that needs to be tossed out  i like the direction they went but the best ending they could have ever given him was him going after the high table themselves and making sure what happened to him never happens to anyone ever again with an ending similar to this one",2023-03-24
he killed 300 people with his own hands  i don’t expect a realistic ending all of sudden but whatever,2023-03-24
also hes almost 60 and keeps getting hit by cars and falling down stairs on top of grief he isnt processing,2023-03-24
" if this guy really existed 

he built one of the most preposterous crime worlds in cinema history and wants a realistic ending",2023-03-24
yeah  john gets to live in peace with his dog andopens up a dog shelter for mistreated pups,2023-03-24
"i feel like it was a  way to end it to be honest not the concept of him dieing in general just how it happened he basically let himself get killed in order to spare the blind guys life why go trough all he did for that why get the osaka guy killed for his mission its just dumb
if they wanted to make him die achieving his goal they should have picked a more meaningful goal something above himself but his mission is get freedom for myself him dieing basically nullifies the point of everything he went trough",2023-03-27
perspective there are fictional characters mortals on earth no superhero stuff who have killed more and got a happy ending,2023-03-24
"nah when it was just john wick 1 and no plans for sequels i was fine with him adopting another puppy and trying to move on with his life  why would him just moving on with his life suddenly be unrealistic

the john wick world was smaller then so i guess they had to go for something spectacular like the main character dying but i felt the death made all the other efforts in the past previous sequel pointless as he fought tooth and nail plus all the characters that helped him to find a way out of his punishment for the act at the continental 

this movie gave him a solution in using their rules against them and then he just dies anyway which sort of ruins the cleverness of caine and johns plan to goad the marquis into participating before then i saw no other way for john to win his freedom without killing his friend",2023-03-27
"actually keanu reeves who made a movie called man of tai chi shouldve had a ready answer for that


yang luchan the man made tai chi nationally famous in the mid19th century gone through something very similar

he was an indentured servant for a family of wealthy merchant when he learned tai chi  when he was in his 40s the master died leaving at home only a widow very close in age to yang luchan  the widow released yang from servitude because two of them living alone in the house would invite endless gossip

yang then tried to make a living trying to teach martial art  the details are hazy but he either killed or seriously injured challengers and had to leave town to avoid trouble

he ended up at a home of a wealthy merchant in beijing  but several months later the families of injuredkilled challengers found him and tried unsuccessfully to  him

at this point he already at one point saved the life of wealthy merchant from 20 armed robbers  that merchant is wealthy because he supplies favorite picked vegetables to the dowager empress and other royals  the merchant told him the only way out of the dark path is to join the light path then hed be untouchable

he was introduced the house of a manchu blood prince  first as teacher to the household manager  lanting then to 8 royal princes and emperors own teacher  he accepted endless challenges and winning them all except one draw earning the nickname yang the peerless but no one tried to assassinate him again as hes the teacher of princes and nobles his other nickname is yang the 8 earl as he was the teacher of 8 princes

he was the boogie man of his day  so in modern day if john wick were to say recruited by the us government the underworld would not dare touch him as they part of the dark path need to stay in the dark the same way black widows organization had to stay far away from her when she became internationally famous avenger",2023-03-28
the clues were all there that and he mentioned about taking a long break to do other stuff after this,2023-03-24
"i get the idea but the first film started with him having left it all behind that was the entire premise

in general the first film and 24 feel like they belong to different series that just cemented it even further",2023-03-26
when you  all your enemies you do get to walk away though,2023-03-29
i kinda wanted an omar ending for john just some random nobody henchmen head shots him or something,2023-03-24
i personally thought john was going to end this whole business,2023-03-29
i agree its like jack bauer in 24 theres no happy ending for guys like that,2023-03-31
i guess hes not joel miller,2023-04-07
this made me think of that bit in in bruges where colin farrel says jeez he swears a lot doesnt he,2023-04-28
thats a pretty great reference secret shadow societies are a wuxia staple,2023-03-27
"otherwise he added little to the movie and his role was pointless

you couldnt be more wrong he saved john several times and the implication that john helped shape him",2023-04-10
most probably a nod to the killer chow yunfat watching the musician he blinded in the club the church scene is also a homage to it plus caine and john fighting together at the end and all the brotherhood themes are very john woo,2023-03-24
they were probably high off their ,2023-03-24
eh caine blitzes her easy dude was on the same level as john,2023-04-30
3 was better the shotgun blasts  killed my chest in that one still this was intense,2023-03-26
brandis was the bomb in sidekicks,2023-03-25
he saved his good friend so he could have a life with his daughter and his other friend so he could have a hotel self sacrifice is a cool way to end the story for his character,2023-03-24
hes not dead john wick appearing to die but going back into the shadows is a trope of the series,2023-03-24
does anyone actually think he’s dead,2023-03-26
is he dead tho we dont know he did survive almost the exact same wound in the first film,2023-04-10
theres already some bts of it around and youll see keanu doing all the driving but of course there was a lot of digital stuff added to the sequence,2023-03-24
yeah,2023-03-25
my head cannon is that he’s been hit in the head so many times he talks no good no more,2023-03-25
it’s so funny and endearing to me at this point john wick fits keanu to a glove personality wise and it doesn’t take away from the movie so i’m totally for it,2023-03-25
"so you  him or i will 

i understahhnd 

i love him but his readings were so weird",2023-03-27
i kept wondering if his character was supposed to have had a  most of his lines were like 12 words maybe 4 words tops and his delivery was really odd even for keanu like a dude recovering from a ,2023-03-27
"whats the timeline for these movies

i can see someone having the absolute  kicked out of them over the cause of a month or two having difficulty speaking",2023-03-25
i was afraid he could be having mental issues like bruce willis but i just saw an interview with him where he is speaking quite normally i was perplexed the whole time im going to need a gun,2023-03-27
"to be fair hes just endured 4 films of him being stabbed shot dropped sewn up burnt punched kicked recuperating from the brink of death

i could forgive the character for being short with his words",2023-03-31
he sounded like someone doing an impression of john wick lol,2023-04-03
they were just playing off the amount of head trauma that dude went through,2023-04-30
"literally my only complaint with the film not a lot of good emotion driven emotiondriven dialogue from john the whole people keep asking if im back and yeah im back is still a highlight in the series i know the whole series prides itself on the action and set pieces but it feels weird to not put a little bit more effort into the main actor dialogue 



still a great movie though",2023-03-24
that’s definitely what it felt like,2023-03-24
"in the first john wick keanu’s stoic and curt line deliveries were perfect for a grieving husband there was also this sense as the movie unfolded that he didn’t need to say much because he was a man of action when he exploded with rage at the end with viggo it felt like he’d been building it up the whole movie

in jw 4 you realize it’s just keanu being keanu lol",2023-03-24
"i actually thought hes written that way hes really good killer but a bit awkward when he talks to people or maybe its just keanu but i like it

yeah",2023-03-24
i disagree i think that the point of this movie is that wick is a complete shell of a man ever since the events of the second movie he has been getting more and more tired and in this one he just wants it to be over but wont let it be the ending is very satisfying in my eyes because he can save cainehis daughter giving someone else safety and family even though he cant have it,2023-04-03
dark knight all over again,2023-03-27
suffering from master chief disease  people remember their characters as stoic men who only speak in hugely impactful one liners but if you look at their first installments that’s not the case at all,2023-03-24
getting thrown off a dozen buildings and getting hit by a hundred cars will really do a number on your lung capacity,2023-03-24
he had the story arch of daryl from the walking dead started off an angry troubled redneck that could form sentences than turned into a grunting caveman that joined the hells angels,2023-03-24
or dont even speak just cast a stare that wouldve worked better than yeah,2023-03-24
i giggled whenever he said yeah it was like the movie was winking to the audience,2023-04-01
to be fair hes had a lot of head trauma since then,2023-03-27
pretty realistic considering the amount of bluntforce trauma his character has endured since the beginning of the first film,2023-03-24
"the john wick movies have done that for a while now

jw3 had the the good the bad and the  tuco guncustomizing sequence buster keaton is all over these movies and he appears on a billboard screen in 2 or 3 i think a ton more examples",2023-04-04
"


just in case you havent seen this yet",2023-03-29
and we even got the badass stairs twice,2023-03-25
i like how they left it ambiguous that way both sides can be satisfied,2023-03-24
"i’m torn between wanting him to be truly dead because it was such a perfect ending and then actually doing a 5th because if they did… i will be there opening night 

if they did i hope they wouldn’t run the series into the ground but they’ve really done a great job taking it up a notch without it ever getting boring or trying truly unbelievable stuff like the fast and furious franchise or something not that john being a one man army is super grounded anyway but they haven’t done anything too crazy if they did do a 5th with the same crew i would trust them to deliver",2023-03-24
i guess its just conditioning from years of movies but ending a character on a 4th film is soodd to me lol,2023-03-25
it would be nice but there is also  for 5,2023-03-24
what it comes down to for me isif they make more i trust them to do it right,2023-03-24
hes certainly not dead,2023-03-24
"nah  the perfect ending is john wick in a garage working on a car with a new puppy like he wanted at the beginning  he got out thats his resolution

thats what really happened here  hes buried john wick and moved on again with a new identity a new life   

and thats why its not over for him yet  john doesnt get a perfect ending  the table is still set",2023-03-29
same the doorbells manthe doorbells,2023-03-24
yep totally didnt expect he go bilndbilnd thats the difference between normie and choreography master i guess,2023-03-27
i didnt understand how it worked he was blind  like any other walking bur xould fight perfect h2h with the best and a marskman,2023-03-29
yes,2023-04-30
i believe that was a reference to the viper having fangs the bowery king said “up close its positively poisonous that viper has fangs” or something to that effect  so when john disassembled it on the stairs he “stabbed” it into a goon like a snake bite,2023-03-31
what you mean   ,2023-03-25
he can be the boba fett of john wick lol,2023-03-24
yeah his connection is that hes a merc with a heart of gold when it comes to his good boy  hes trying to make money but at the end not at the expense of his uhh values lol  thats enough for me because the more backstory characters get the more their plot armor thickens and i like the idea that anyone could die,2023-03-26
i really like that they showed there are multiple other people on johns level or close to it,2023-04-04
palpatine lives,2023-04-04
thought the same thing then was just like oh  its going to be that sunny episode with the thundergun express screening,2023-03-24
this right here,2023-03-29
you dont need jw5 just make spinoffs focused on those characters wicks story is over,2023-03-24
i don’t believe he is dead it was left ambiguous af,2023-03-24
i wouldnt be surprised if we learn about mr nobody in the ballerina spinoff,2023-03-24
 it even if john’s actually dead just have jw5 be about rina vs donnie and nobody doing his own thing wouldn’t make sense to call it john wick 5 but i’d still watch,2023-03-25
i wont believe hes dead until i see a hole in his head,2023-03-29
definitely some unanswered questions,2023-03-24
to give john another pseudoally who was more than just a port in the storm like king and winston are  he was fighting at johns side for a bit just to up the bounty and i loved that mechanic  and at the end johns love for the dog turned him around almost entirely,2023-03-29
that makes total sense,2023-03-24
yeah i thought so as well didnt she also had nuts command,2023-03-28
saw the movie at the beginning of march before lance reddick’s death it was exactly the same with charon dying in the marquis’s office i’m pretty sure they killed him because they had too many big names assisting john and didn’t know what else to do with them,2023-03-24
constantine 2 baby,2023-03-25
shut up and take my money,2023-03-24
here comes mick wick gordon,2023-03-27
i think people only thought that because they assumed that jw3 was about john hunting down the high table to earn his freedom only for the ending to nix that idea come to think of it jw4 does the exact same thing both jw3 and jw4 begin with the audience thinking hes gonna hunt down the high table but halfway through they go in another direction john working for the high table again and the duel,2023-03-25
i hope they dont show his impossible task because i dont think it will ever live up to its name when you actually see what happened,2023-03-26
rip the robots,2023-03-24
"absolutely

doesnt make any sense",2023-03-24
i like you,2023-03-25
i forgot that scene even occurred and i just left the theater,2023-03-26
right when i saw the desert i figured the first 30 minutes will be there lol,2023-03-27
i went to sacre coeur last summer i was disappointed john didnt stop off for a pint at the irish pub halfway up the stairs,2023-03-25
"i get it but at the same time theres only so far you can go with a story like this with fast and furious or mission impossible having ten and eight films works because each film is about the next mission with john wick each film is about him surviving another day from pretty much the start of john wick 2 its just one long fight for survival over the course of a few weeks maybe months now since they dont say how long its been since jw3 and jw4 the longer it continues the more ridiculous it gets and it starts to water the threat against john down 

ill settle for one more but im really hoping this is the last one now",2023-03-25
not saying he isnt but it could have been faked so he can finally have peace personally i thought they were going to show him when his dog seemed like he have seen something at his funeral,2023-03-24
"that smirky little who knows from winston practically screams out lol he aint really dead   

if he is then they went out on the highest of high notes if not bring on chapter 5",2023-03-24
i walked out before the post credits can you tell me what happened,2023-03-24
"it was the culmination of caine saying to her earlier when he told her to live ill be waiting for you  

he knew she would be after him again as soon as she had enough time to recover which means he knew that even though he was out from under the thumb of the table he wasnt out of the game",2023-03-29
did anyone see it lol,2023-03-29
"he will be truly missed 

“such is life”",2023-04-02

must not have gotten out everywhere yet as ours did not it will certainly be on the home release,2023-03-24
my theater had it at the very end after the post credits scene guess different theaters inserted it at different places,2023-03-24
ours didnt dolby at amc and i was waiting for something at the end too,2023-03-24
ours had it immediately after the final shot faded to black,2023-03-24
in my theater the after credits scene played then they showed the rating of the film and then after that they showed “in memory of lance reddick” i kept waiting for it and it was nice to see it before i left,2023-03-25
mine had one after the credits,2023-03-24
at my showing it was just before the end credits,2023-03-24
mine had it at the end,2023-03-27
our screening had it after the postcredits scene i believe,2023-03-29

my favorite action movie since fury road,2023-03-24
thats crazy what were you two doing then i always assumed she was a modelsinger from the get go,2023-04-19
just my opinion but it is hard to overstate how much better this movie is than 13 and i like those movies,2023-03-24
there are plenty of nods the warriors all the way through the franchise the bowery king is basically an older version of cyrus if he had lived,2023-03-24
isnt it a museum and not a nightclub,2023-03-27

that would be hilarious if this becomes a popular tourist activity,2023-03-28
with the added risk of hitting bystanders in the dark lol,2023-04-01
it is a huge power move to stop such a successful series here when these guys could clearly write another five of these but it also feels right these movies have ramped up and expanded with every outing and to keep going with wick would almost be like actively ignoring the dangers and stakes they would constantly have to be upping once it happened and there was no reveal that he was alive it honestly felt right,2023-03-24
there was just something off about the end that absolutely gave me the vibe he’s not dead feel like it’s one of those things where they could end it here or continue it if they wanted too,2023-03-24
,2023-03-24
a couple of things at the grace stood out to me one the dog perked up maybe seeing wick another is that the earth wasn’t disturbed which could mean some time had passed since they buried him or there is nothing under the ground,2023-03-25
they needed a better villain  the first one was so good because they killed his  dog from his dead wife this one he’s just trying to survive,2023-03-24
if you havent seen bullet train yet its also got some great hiroyuki sanada scenes,2023-03-24
berghain had no line but there was a queue of rejected people so we already had our hopes up at that sight we tried to walk up looking cool and then my friends assigned me to greet the hostess since i looked the most like the part aka wearing monotone colors however within a second of me going up to the chick she said sorry guys not possible tonight in such a nonchalant way after looking at us up and down with menacing eyes i thought it was hilariously insulting and refreshing apparently elon musk conan obrien and britney spears have been rejected before i guess clubs are more exclusive lol,2023-03-24
the i am klaus guy is literally an infamous bouncer of the berghain club apparently it wasnt make up in the movie he looks crazy like that,2023-03-31

" take there was a riot somewhere else in paris

honest take there is no authority anywhere in this world

its a fable a video game its the matrix there is no real human in this world as it has been proven movies after movies in this franchise

see the dancers at the rave party not reacting to shootings the arc de triomphes roundabout having an endless amount of car turning and turning without anyone stopping immediately after the first few ammo rounds or the lack of people and reaction at the sacré coeur after all the shootings in the stairs and the ten minutes duel without a soul wandering",2023-03-25
"i agree with that they made the ending ambiguous so that they can have him back for the next movie if they needed 
but for me it is best if his story is over whether he is alive or not should be left a mystery so that everyone can have whatever ending they like
they should start to focus on other characters",2023-03-29
thank you for showing some kindness im glad you enjoyed the movie ,2023-03-24
wanted to come back to let you know that though an interview its been pretty much confirmed that john literally dies at the end of the movie so yep there you have it,2023-03-26
"im gonna go in parts 

for starters thank you for such a thoughtful answer when i make big comments like these on things im passionate about i honestly expect the bare minimum to have someone read it all and respond with such a similar passion and proper thoughts is a breath of fresh air i see that controversial is the reason why my comment still got so much engagement i knew id get downvoted to  in fact i already was at the beginning so i didnt care but over the past day or two ive had a sudden surge of support and im finding a good chunk of people who agree with me which makes me feel less insane as i see major online presences still saying this movie is  amazing which sometimes still makes me feel like im insane for seeing it so differently 

i do want to also add i noticed a lot of toxicity toward this one reviewer who saw the movie before it came out grace randolph she has most of the thoughts i do and she got absolutely demolished in the comments by people who hadnt even seen the movie yet because it wasnt out its like people walk into it to watch it while already convincing themselves its the best thing ever so they ignore all these glaring issues 

regarding the armor i dont have much else to add beyond what i said and you said its ridiculous and even if we suspend disbelief the bullet sponge aspect of it is to the movies detriment its actually very interesting to read your thoughts as someone who had rewatched the first 3 before this one it just continues to cement this idea i have that the people behind this movie are either a completely different creative team or they for some reason said  it and gave up on realism and their continuity 

i had absolutely forgotten about the adjudicator its even more weird now that you point it out since for what i remember it was the adjudicator that kickstarted the raid on the ny continental so why is the adjudicator not present in osakas raid and where the  did the marquis even come from

i believe i said it in my main post but it bears repeating i am absolutely convinced the original idea was that yes the franchise would end with john going against the high table i feel like we all agreed that was the point especially after the third movies ending but it was between 3 and 4 that they decided this would be a franchise that expands so we already have the continental prequel and ballerina spin off now whats interesting is that the ballerina spin off doesnt have a set timeline but apparently john wick will show up in it maybe so what does that mean exactly is he alive is he not its so convoluted and weird if the high table dies the evil is defeated basically so now theyre like we cant do that yet we got 1000 spin offs to make 

edit i looked it up and apparently the ballerina spin off will take place between 3 and 4 

the problem is that they chose to do this even if it meant ruining the john wick story and they  did it anyway worst of all theyre being rewarded because most people dont give a  they think his death is poetic and amazing almost like theyre willingly ignoring the whole point of the characters journey so welp theres that 

agree with everything regarding the tracker i had someone try to justify him and his motives by saying no but you see in a split second moment as hes passing through his notebooks pages full of stuff youll be trying to look at in milliseconds there is a drawing of a house and his dog next to it so he wants the money for a house to live in with his dog 

like thats cool but how is this relevant to the movie isnt this john wicks story isnt every character connected to his past and being potential friends or enemies dont we have a big henchman villain and the marquis to be the ones to get on johns way why do we need a dude who adds nothing to the film other than comedic moments with his dog 

like couldnt bill skarsgard do some fighting himself even his character was pointless 

agree with the nightclub scene personally i was also paying attention to that all i could think was are these civilians why arent they running away or is this a nightclub for assassins and they just dont care its like theyre murdering each other for 5 minutes and its only 10 minutes in that people stopped dancing it was just very distracting 

the eiffel tower thing is dumb but i suspended disbelief over the idea that the high table has already been established to have a huge influence over the world correct me if im wrong since you rewatched them or maybe im confusing it with the warriors as you say but didnt the radio station briefly show up in jw3 or maybe im mixing up the warriors and the fact the women who do the bounties do show up in the third movie 

i assume youre aware but in case youre not there is a post credit scene where akira goes  caine she has a knife she intends to use on him as hes sitting at the park like in the introduction and the screen then goes to black so this already generates two dumb outcomes 1 she forgives him for absolutely no reason despite the fact he didnt actually have to  her father and couldve left after all he left her alive and the marquis didnt complain so it wasnt a no witnesses situation or 2 she actually does  him making johns sacrifice and unwillingness to  him an absolute waste of time 

so yeah i dont know you have a good theory as to why people enjoyed this one so much but at least i no longer feel as insane as i did seeing all the support while i kept seeing these very real and massive flaws",2023-03-26
man its been so long since the last ones that i dont think most ppl are gonna notice but you nailed it i honestly didnt gaf about anything in the movie the whole honor bs just get it over with,2023-03-27
"the tracker really wasnt flip flopping  you notice in the beginning he had a set of numbers in his notebook  that gave you the idea that it was how much he was thinking he would need to buy his way out which didnt really become evident until the poker scene  remember he would have to  john so much like the japanese dude from jw3 it was in his best interest to secure the  and manipulate the marquis to drive the price up

john issued the duel to  him and his defeat would make the high table look weak and make jw a saint  freedom was never a motivation after parabellum anymore  he wanted to grieve alone 

pistols i think brought the scene and the ending a bit more tension then a fight scene would have brought in my opinion  both were great shooters and you got the sense that they really didnt want to  each other  if you noticed the places that were hit were the same places the keymaster dr guy told john to hit him to make it look good  did you want winston to die or cains daughter to die how could this end and marquise be brought down within the rules

those are the only parts about your comment that i disagree with that being said i do agree that some of the falls and other things were way over the top but in a sense the fact that he did get up and how tired and beat up he was by the top of the stairs lent into the feeling that he was a force of sheer will and focus",2023-03-30
i think they can start thinking about crossover with fast  furious now ngl,2023-03-26
"the suits are apparently magic in this movie

 i hate the suits takes all the cool out of the fights that the previous movies had wick just lifts his jacket up to his jaw and is bulletproof just running into bad guys who cant hit  it looks   how he no longer has to dodge or take cover but just goes around a corner jacket sleeve first takes a few rounds on the lapel and then shoots everyone   


dumbest  thing ive ever seen",2023-11-04
also how did caine know what his cards were i still cant figure it out,2023-05-23
im looking forward to extraction 2 because the first one was one of those realistic action movies like what john wick used to be,2023-03-26
also the scene with ian mcshane and lawrence fishburne in the rain looking at the burned out continental had hilariously bad green screen lol,2023-04-19
"the osaka scene at the art room area is the worst offender 

i remember this point where he finishes up all the guys and then 2 more walk in and he takes like 23 minutes to dispatch them with the nunchucks and then two more comes in after that and he takes again 23 minutes to dispatch them so youre like okay its over right but then two more come in interminable and repetitive all with bulletproof suits 

regarding the second portion its as i said between 3 and 4 they decided to turn this into a franchise with spin offs so they couldnt do the epic john vs the high table movie since thatd end the whole universe they created so we end up with people somehow accepting wicks pointless death like what was the point of surviving 3 full movies just so he could  the replaceable marquis get his freedom and die uhhh i just cant understand how people can be fine with that especially when so many good people died to help him survive 

i do agree this movie felt very different to the last 3 i heard the one reviewer who didnt like the film either refer to keanu as out of it in this film and i kinda agree it felt like he was autopilot and barely even cared for some reason",2023-03-26
"they overused the bulletproof suits

it really bugged me that a lot of fights had lift jacket side up instead of creative ways for john to get to cover this really got me on the stairs what a predicament to be in if he wasnt wearing a bulletproof suit him ducking under the railing from side to side made me realize that scene could have been much cooler if they didnt have these suits",2023-03-26
the suits are the point not everyone can afford earn one which is why you didn’t see anyone other than john wearing one for until the third high table assassins get the bulletproof suits which is prob how john had one already in the first movie,2023-04-01
"absolutely 

the overhead shootout was one of the best things ive watched in an action movie hands down the first fight scene of caine in osaka was really cool as well as were some moments you saw him fighting further into the movie so many good details like him shooting over and over to a certain area after the person is already dead and so on feels like the best use of a blind character in an action movie 

i also liked the water raining down wick in the nightclub

but these fight scenes are not enough to fix the many issues with the action in this movie or the issues with the cgi and the story it was all too ridiculous and interminable as you point out

forces you too suspend disbelief massively and feels like this movie was made by an entirely different team we do know it was written by someone else when compared to the last three films at least",2023-03-24
"it looked absolutely horrible 

its crazy to see the exact same people who have been complaining about marvel vfx and other issues of the sort in other movies completely ignore how terrible the vfx is in the arc scene and especially the entire last act",2023-03-26
"i think the action was largely hit or miss my main issue with it were the bulletproof armor and suits that just made things lately repetitive and three way there were many scenes where characters were standing around doing nothing or shooting at nothingmissing badly 

usually those are things one can ignore but the issue is that the fighting drags out for so long and ends up so repetitive you reach a point where its all you can notice 

i also agree with the club being a waste of time even if i liked aspects of it and also doubly agree with the stairs scene just a ton of weird choices",2023-03-24
agreed about the length not sure about cutting berlin but i definitely think they could have shaved off ten minutes from the osaka action scene and at least fifteen minutes of the extended paris chase  arc de triomphe action scene too i think they could get the runtime down to a solid 2 hours 15 minutes by cutting a few minutes from the action scenes its weird because the action scenes move fast but they still feel too long osaka and the arc de triomphe were probably about twenty minutes and ten minutes long each but they felt longer than that,2023-03-25
"no idea what nobody’s motivation was 20 million is balked at how much does this  guy need 


dont they show him looking at a page in his notebook with 45 million or something and a picture of a big house and the dog",2023-04-16
" 20 million is balked at how much does this  guy need

think about the parisradiobefore dawn scene where the radio lady says the bounty is now twenty six million or something up from twenty  


the bad guys in this movie   


bounty 20 mil  i sleep  
bounty 26 mil  real ",2023-11-04
" i get you cant cut transit or make a scene like that in the real arc de triomphe but it was ridiculous drivers inside of cars disappearing cars still driving minutes after a shootout has started to take place








 but as far as this goes you noticing this during your first viewing of the movie concerns me this is the last thing you should be noticing during the insane gun fights going on in front of you the driverscars are all in the background you watching those things go on in the back and out of focus says to me that you were wanting to nitpick this movie for some reason

huh i noticed the disappearing drivers immediately and honestly whole arc de triomphe scene just felt way too fake and completely took me out i get it its all fake and suspension of disbelief whatever but it was just ramped up way too much in my opinion especially compared to the first john wick even worse was the stair fight it just got too ridiculous for me at that point like really none of these 100s of trained assassins can land a headshot without john having any cover 

i get that the series had to evolve from the first but there were better examples of how to do that in this movie already the hotline miami scene was amazing the osaka scene was great except when henchman just inexplicably come in pairs like 3 minutes apart 3 different times  apparently just to give john enough time to handle each pair more of that and less of the dragged out triomphe and stair scenes where wick is just running out in the open tanking and dodging bullets from hordes of stormtrooperass henchmen",2023-04-13
true i realized after i wrote it all but it doesnt change a point blank shot to the head would leave a large wound,2023-03-26
"its insane because you have so many people so many reviewers so many youtube reviewers so many online personalities shouting that this movie is absolutely glorious

and yet these issues are so massive and glaring i genuinely feel like they have to be convincing themselves and ignoring these issues willingly",2023-03-26
it being worthless is entirely the point it’s a greek tragedy about the cost violence and revenge john created a  of his own making and he had to sleep in the bed he made,2023-05-24
"what

link

all of the articles and videos i just looked up to confirm this dont confirm anything

the closest i found was this one which still has no conclusive statement",2023-04-02
"and most of all it is ridiculously entertaining from start to finish

in fact its dreadfully boring with the godmode bulletproof suit jackets and wick just running around lifting his jacket a little and becoming invincible",2023-11-04
"but overall my point is that the john wick franchise has always been about keanu killing people in semirealistic ways while looking as cool as possible

semirealistic is fine some suspension of disbelief is okay bulletproof suits a society that is mostly assassins with no selfpreservation instinct 500 assasins cant get a headshot fine 

but the end of the 3rd movie and at several points in the 4th movie they basically just make john wick into a marvel character why does he need to get hit by so many cars it is one thing to roll onto the hood of a car it is another to get hit full speed by a car into the side of a van 

why does cain need to be daredevil or his character from rogue one the doorbell thing was clever and they could have done some other clever things with the character but they just gave him superpowers at least daredevil and star wars have a radioactive accident and the force to explain the ability to see without working eyes and this guy supposedly gave up his eyes fairly recently seems to be doing well considering he can 1shot multiple people from across the room or up a bunch of stairs before they shoot him thankfully when there are hundreds of rounds going off and cain is expertly firing and slashing at loud noises he doesnt accidentally  john or nobody",2024-01-05
"20 million that gradually gets increased throughout the film

the whole point is that the wick franchise started in the exact opposite way  people who wanted a thrilling conclusion to the grounded an realistic world that was built in the early movies are coming away from this one very disappointed",2023-04-10
"i recommend organizing your thoughts on something youre passionate about its actually a very fun exercise and helps you either appreciate something more or understand further why you dont like it

the club fight where everybody in the background continued to dance and party as men were shooting and killing each other was pretty dumb

i think there is some kind of directors cut which will come out eventually that might make the movie seem a bit more coherent and give some purpose to their trip to japan",2023-03-24
definitely watch the first one its still probably one of my favorite action movies ive seen it probably 4 times and still enjoy it whereas i dont think ill ever voluntarily watch this one again a very disappointing end to a great series unfortunately also its been a while since ive seen them but id say 2 and 3 are worth your time as well though you do get bits in 3 that foreshadow some of the dumber stuff in this one,2023-05-12
"except it goes against what the first two movies established proper round counting getting hit hurts no falling off buildings and magically surviving and everything is done in secret to not draw attention to their society 

now guns have unlimited ammo wick brushes gun shots off like its nothing while the people with actual armor are reeling from the pain of being shot the secret world of assassins make no attempt to hide their existence the high table has been elevated to a  like entity with how much power they have etc 

the first two arent turn off your brain movies either because the lore remains tight follows its own rules you can count rounds and john acts hurt when hit the little things that are unrealistic can be easily ignored when everything else feels solid none of that exists in this movie and is largely lacking in the 3rd as well 

the director wrongly assumed the first two were only praised for their choreography and has watered the movies down to watch wick  a bunch of bad guys who all wait their turn to fight him because when 40m is on the line you dont want to accidentally hit a comrade 

also a blind assassin who kills people as easily as wick does and is expected to win a pistols duel are you freaking kidding me",2023-04-01
it felt more like the consequences of writing a new story each movie i thought theyd follow up the table plot but he just kills the middle eastern dude then immediately falls into some random mustache twirling villain plot wouldnt surprise me if jw5 is the final one for real and they wanted to stretch out the two movies to give room for the ballerina spinoff and hotel show,2023-03-24

i wish they could have brought cassius back from john wick 2 he had motivation and would have been a good fit for the looming threat thing",2023-03-24
third one’s kinda  imo but the rest are great,2023-03-25
sc was great until it went full cgi army in the final act,2023-03-29
it was im sorry lol im an uncultured white guy ,2023-03-28
not op but i agree with them they were using flimsy suits as bullet forcefields for half the movie im fine with bending realism for a movie but the suit thing is just so over the top it ruined the movie for me its not even like the suit was kevlar and they felt the bullet power they were just showing sparks fly off the suits like they were using water guns,2023-03-24
it made me mad to see those details being present a lot in the movie because it just shows that the movie has strayed away from realism unlike the previous movies were it tried to adhere to it,2023-03-24
"nonsensical pointless actions that follows the same tropes  yes endless amount of unnamed baddies going into the fray one by one for 5 minutes straight


the top down scene was amazing however the cinematography overall is gorgeous",2023-03-25
right thank you im glad im not the only one that felt that way awesome choreography dont get me wrong but i completely agree with what you said i didnt feel an emotional investment in this movie definitely not like the first one or even second or third,2023-03-27
"oh thats the fine print under the contract funny that this will work out with only the marquis man as witness while for everything else they need markers marked with blood to proof something eve for the other guy to remember that he is owed

while the idea of jw keeping his last shot for the marquis was clever it was impossible for them to foresee what the marquis would do especially that the marquis would let the blind guy walk before he steps in to shoot jw 

also why would the marquis be allowed to finish off jw legally if both duelists are still alive and the duell ended in a draw 

my expectation was that the blind guy would jw let him  him thus being able to legally also  the marquis and jw then being able to protect the blind guys daughter with the marquis gone but the way they went was unexpected

jw and the blind guy apparently collaborated but with jw at the end still dying apparently makes no sense",2023-03-26
but he killed dantonio without being excommunicado,2023-03-26
if i want to watch a fun movie ill watch big trouble in little china i expected something more of this movie than some  cut together action movie,2023-04-01
plenty of vfx and cgi if you watch the making of clips they arent shy about it,2023-03-24
what made you like the tracker so much,2023-03-24
"yeah i believe too

i was just talking with my dad about the movie and made a good point the whole point of the movie was that john was fighting for his freedom and his peace now he wouldnt do that just to die few minutes after recieving his freedom cause then whats the whole point of the movie if he were to die right after gaining his freedom then whats the point of going through such hectic and painful task of acquiring his freedom also his closest friend died because of it im sure all of it wasnt for nothing",2023-03-25
there is a speculation where his grave stone is meant to be his final retirement and him finally being free i could see that being a reason for still being alive we will have to wait and see whats in the run for john wick 5,2023-03-26
they were samurai masks,2023-03-26
"the first one is the strongest  the action scenes were quick snappy and didnt overstay their welcome 

the 3rd was the worst because it peaked in the intro and could not keep the momentum  the action scene with halle barry would not end the fake cgi blood was used way too much and the fights were poorly filmed",2023-03-27
id say 1  4  2  3,2023-03-27
"because the assassins dont bother civilians

that arc de triomphe scene begs to differ lol",2023-04-08
"yeah those looks both the knife and the pistol execution as he stares down his target later in the same scene are some straight stonecold moments that i just dont get from the newer movies the music was perfect too

despite the increasing carnage and body count its easy to forget exactly why wicks called the boogeyman  until you go back and watch scenes like this one its a tonal thing that i think just got lost somewhere along the way",2023-04-16
long sections couldnt go more then 3 seconds without a bunch of pistols shots started getting bored of constant gunfire,2023-05-21
well i’m glad someone else understands haha i really liked the first three movies he kicks  and takes names but they took this too far it’s beyond laughable it’s just dumb imo the guy falls from three stories high out of the church and there’s not a scratch on him and his suit is basically an iron man suit not just a bulletproof suit c’mon…,2023-06-11
why wasnt caine shot when it was said that both people on the loosing team will get shot,2023-03-26
chapter 2 had a pencil scene which was pretty brutal lol,2023-03-24
you mean his stunt doubles and cgi,2023-03-26
it’s not a comic book adaptation though glad you were able to stop analyzing and enjoy it though i enjoyed it more than my friend did but afterwards a lot didn’t make sense,2023-03-28
you just watch movie sequels without watching the rest is that a thing not even talking about the points you made but do people really just watch a sequel not to mention the 3rd without watching the rest hmm that might be a new thing i want to try there’s a lot of movie series i haven’t seen might try watching movies in reverse order,2023-03-28
"so many of those the worst one imho was when he was sitting on the windshield of a car that tried to run over him and the goon driving it still missed 56 shots like how there was basically only the windshield between his gun and john

as i said it was very hard for me to suspend disbelief many times still baffled by such a positive reception",2023-03-27
"thankyou ill pick a number out of a hat and see which one i should watch

edit its 3",2023-03-24
"the problem is that im going tomorrow at 1140am and i havent seen any of them haha

i started the first movie kinda didnt want to watch the dog getting killed so i had to stop that one  but ill definitely read a synopsis and check those movies out if i like the fourth one",2023-03-25
rip and tear until it is done,2023-03-25
i made the mistake of actually getting there early for the 30 minutes of credits so you know i was rushing to the bathroom  my urinating was longer than the  gun movie scene i didn’t care about the post credit scene at all i figured i see it on yt the next day but the end credit are so long i think i could have made it back to see it,2023-03-25
he was german,2023-03-26
they filmed that exact scene for movie and scrapped it based on audience reaction  would not be surprised if they release extra scene on blu ray,2023-03-27
it was fitting for his character,2023-03-26
a sammo hung style fight scene justifies itself regardless of story,2023-03-27
yeah i love mandalorian but this season a slow burner,2023-03-27
worse…i’m from chicago but even they would react to a gang shootout happening right before their eyes,2023-03-27
"im pretty sure all of johns friends have shot him at one point or another plus it was the only way that they could both make it out of that situation alive

i wouldnt assume that",2023-03-27
for real same as a card player myself i found several things leading up to the deal kinda sus but ultimately chalked it up to hey this is a movie so why not  never truly suspected cheating as a result will be interested on a freezeframe type rewatch if they pulled off some type of deck stacking which obvs occurred due to the 5 of a kind or bottom of the deck deal in some way,2023-03-28
well how did he get from the desert to japan to new york before teaming up with him,2023-03-28
i mean its not super crazy but were not talking about a bayonet here mans disassembled his handgun and then stabbed someone in the chest like is this a new thing and unique to this company or are there others like this,2023-03-29
"i always try to find showings with the least amount of people or biggest theaters imax by me and purposely wait until last minute to choose my seats to avoid as much as possible yet still it amazes me

maybe smaller issue butpeople coming in 40 minutes into the movie talking as mentioned little kids in brutal r rated movies and the phone stuff",2023-03-29
"  they really cant be having a blind person be this good at combat without explaining he is daredevil im sorry

yes they can

its an oldold trope",2023-03-29
theres no way youve never seen the blind weaponmaster archetype before in like a cartoon or anime or kung fu movie or something right,2023-03-29
"i assume since your comment has nothing to do with mine that you were agreeing and adding on a second comment

if so i agree

otherwise it looks like you commented that one the wrong comment p",2023-03-29
they started off simple and shallow  this is complex and shallow  they just keep adding silly contrived rules which is much different than man gets revenge for killed dog,2023-03-29
that’s the entire story though,2023-04-01
id love for him to come back as a mentor figure for a new series it would make the most sense in terms of retirement,2023-04-03
"i also thought i was the only one and so i had to ask here xd but yeah just to check i rewatched all previous movies and i can confirm there is a step down on blood and gore previous jw were not as violent as the raid 2 but surely on par with the original raid movie as in hardcore r levels of violence  and thats something i loved about them i have a few theories about why this reduction in gore all of them for the wrong reasons  


 post production suffered because of the pandemic and possibly some changes on the direction of the franchise so there was not enough time and resources to invest in blood effects
 there could have been changes in those involved in choreography and those people decided a good amount of gore was just not important
 and the worst possible scenario they are probing audience reactions to see if they can pull a pg13 rating for future installments a proof to support this is the dragon breath scene as a way to show something spectacular and flashy but keeping it tame to ratings boards if you think about this with just a few edits in certain scenes like the mr nobody hand stab and removing a couple f bombs this would have been a pg13 movie easily i hope this is not the case that would  the franchise for me for a saga obsessed with consequences i dont like to see portrayals of violence detached from its consequences specially in these kind of movies that glorify it

anyway any more thoughts or theories on this are welcome id like to know more",2023-04-03
interesting thank you,2023-06-24
john could have been equally free to how he ends up by killing himself though,2023-03-27
the big russian i gave a pass to only because the big guy threw a kick never seen that before haha but yeah it was a bit much,2023-03-25
i thought the exact same thing about caine if winston had to die if john lost why not cain when the marquis lost,2023-03-26
he was freed as part of his deal with the marquishigh table earlier in the film the marquis acknowledged it 5 seconds before he died and the harbinger 5 seconds after its a totally fictional ruleset we have no reason to believe that the rule about the second dying would take precedence over either caines deal or the harbingers discretion given the conflict,2023-03-26
"resurrections seriously shat the bad on the matrix franchise it also peaked with well the first one reloaded and revolutions were okish

jw is the better franchise simply because it doesnt have a  like m4 under its belt it also got better with each following installment",2023-03-25
i dont rewatch these movies sorry,2023-03-25
"oh i get that for sure but hes done shooting on horseback before i just feel like the scene would have worked a little better with three shots fired like he times each one for the perfect hit 

loved the movie though that sequence just felt a bit odd in context",2023-03-24
pencak silat the raid movies are set in indonesia and the characters fight with the silat martial art,2023-04-17
funny so did i  yet i thought that it was a fail  i perceived almost the same punch in the seats you did yet it always felt a halfsecond off from the audio,2023-03-28
the pick a plot line seemed more like pick a plot of land to be buried on considering where john and winston were when they had that exchange rather than a fourth wall break,2023-03-27
well said,2023-03-27
my point wasnt about killing the elder it was about recasting the elder it just doesnt really add or do anything,2023-03-27
"yeah the suits started to bother me too why dont they wear a mask or full ninja suit made of this stuff 

the other weapons seemed to exist purely because its cool to watch people fight with hatchets bow and arrows etc but logically it makes no sense",2023-03-27
that was another one i thought was a little absurd but every time i saw a bullet deflect off a jacket light it hit metal it just ruined it i think jw was downhill after 2 but everyone has their own opinion,2023-03-26
exactly john made a deal with cane basically told him he wasnt going to shoot and what does cane do he fires a   shot plus why would john spare cane like i get the fact the man is trying to protect his daughter but john told his friends daughter he would  him and then just doesnt cane did not have to  johns friend the dude was beat but he still stuck a sword through his heart and i guess john just forgot about it i didnt mind that john died but i didnt like how it happend it was lame i watched all the end credits in theatre and john is definitely dead although it looks like the daughter of johns friend is about to  cane in front of his daughter at the end so i guess i liked that also i felt like the movie was trying too much to be a comedy if u r an action  it had a lot of action but i personally prefer a good and believable story to go with the action,2023-03-27
"i thought this was less a john wick the assassin film and more a john wick the man film kind of like the dark knight rises  not a batman film more a bruce wayne film

for a nearly 3 hour film i was fine with some of the comedy i didnt feel like anything was out of place in that regard

i will say that the weakest part of the film for me was the desert scene  how he found the 3 guys on horses and then the subsequent  of the man above the tableit was done too quickly especially after how they were introduced in part 3 the man above the table was said to only be seen if he wanted to be that was quickly dashed in jw4 it should have been fleshed out better

the marquee de grammo was a cool concept  the antithesis of babayaga however also needed some fleshing out to bring passion to his purpose nonetheless i appreciated the scenes he had and he did bring an element to the forefront of the movie we hadnt seen in a wick enemy before  intelligence",2023-03-24
"lol imagine sharing an opinion in an opinionbased thread and a petulant child aims their feelings at you

reddit in a nutshell",2023-03-24
he isnt wrong  i still like the first the best but i can see how some people would prefer this one,2023-03-27
they kinda kept the playlist gimmick they played gesaffelstein and justice after it,2023-03-24
nice catch i totally agree,2023-03-25
ugggh i would sooo go see it in imax if my local spot had laser,2023-03-25
they also agreed on something like to the death and since they were both ok on that they didnt flip a card to see whose choice would be taken,2023-03-25
yep the matchcut to the desert sunrise complete with the lingering sound of the breath that made lawrence such an iconic shot,2023-03-25
and they say fans shouldn’t write movies,2023-03-26
hes 58 so yeah hes doing great for his age,2023-03-26
nah making him another daredevillike character with superhuman hearing would have  its so overdone it was refreshing to see how he actually had to adapt,2023-03-26
i realized during the first caine fight scene that i have never seen a proper action sequence featuring a blind guy that had difficulties fighting due to his handicap  seeing caine fire blindly at people and take time to prepare traps or line up his strikes when he started using his sword was so refreshing  like others have said theres too many instances in media where the blind guy is so powerful that they dont need eyesight at all but jw4 had me thinking jesus this caine guy must have been strong as  before he gave up his eyesight,2023-03-27
i mean the whole point of his suit is that it absorbs impact from pretty much everything the dress shirts not so much,2023-03-27
chapter 5 was cancelled and reeves has been pretty open in his interviews,2023-03-26
john wick 5 is old news they were initially planning to shoot 4  5 at the same time but that never happened,2023-03-26
"but they didnt  they could have easily left it open and ambiguous simply by rolling the credits after he layed down on the steps   no one would have complained and would have been kept people talking and guessing

the grave scene felt very shoehorned in and tacked on for some reason",2023-03-26
he wanted loving husband to be his epitaph not dog lover,2023-03-29
why would he need to pretend he was dead if his name was cleared,2023-03-29
but if he tells john about the duel rule i wick2 nothing wick three would have happened winston never gets adjudicated,2023-03-31
is that why seemingly most people who’ve watched these films consider 3 to be the worst i thought its action was some of the best on the franchise topped by 4 of course,2023-04-03
i hate to break it to you but,2023-04-10
"very true the silenced pistol he borrows shouldnt though haha  


let me know if you see any videos online about it before i do would love to get in on that ",2023-04-04
makes sense goddamnit,2023-04-06
the ammo is definitely not unlimited several times he runs out of bullets and they even tell you how many bullets he has and he checks the bullet count on almost all guns he uses,2023-03-25
you undermine your point by complaining about unlimited ammo a sizable part of the combat choreography is based around running out of ammo reloading or swapping weapons,2023-03-25
"the movie made clear that the high table is a system and killing its members would just make them being replaced by others

yes that was the  excuse the movie gave for why they didnt want john wick to destroy the high table in this movie for no reason that doesnt mean they couldnt have left that line out and found an excuse for why john wick could successfully  all of them or something

i know the real reason they wanted john wick to  them all in this movie and possibly be the last one then had to undo it because it would mess up the john wick universe for the multiple spinoffs the studio wants to do",2023-03-27
john wick needed to save a dog,2023-03-28
yea i feel like he could be cut out entirely and the movie wouldnt miss anything,2023-05-25
gotta have a character for the spinoff i guess,2023-03-27
and laughs during the high table duel and sips a beer like ,2023-05-27
i love that part everything about the paris apartment scene was crazy but yea after all the kevlar tuxedos i was hyped to see someone with the bulletproof vestbackpack combo in a fight,2023-03-26
you dont think the sidetrip to get john reinstated with his family was a total waste of time that whole sequence talking to the  crime boss guy i was pretty bored tbh,2023-03-24
yeah in 1 and 2 hes insane with shooting and uses martial arts if he has to in different scenes in 4 its kind of a combo but it looks sloppier and less choreographed for some reason i liked how well those fights in 3 were crafted compared to 4 when hes killing 300 guys with no craft to it and every shooting scene in 1 was iconic too when he killed 100 people about him being slow john was basically fighting continually from 2 thru 3 like a non stop fight so he was tired af but yeah 3 put emphasis on martial arts fights like the knife throwing battle and the slowness felt more realistic to me 4 was straight up a last samurai battle in a hotel which came off as silly and overproduced not like the raid which why didnt they bring those guys back then a kingpin boss fight after a cheesy fake poker game the club part was good but german guy was cheeseball i liked the fire gun fight but it was top down like a video game and the stair fight was fun but that henchman  and him falling down all the stairs was like the movie making fun of itself it took everyone out of it and the scene of winston walking for like 30 seconds straight then theres a duel at the end that takes from clint eastwood and feels out of place and not really earned for me,2023-03-28
but the rules have to be somewhat consistent across your characters if your protagonist has very obvious plot armor then you dont have tension cant build up stakes and the movie just devolves into a highlight reel of action scenes,2023-03-30
his obligation to the high table is over but what about that group he had to join just to be able to request a duel isnt he required to work for them now him faking his death means he wont have to work for anyone again,2023-03-26
i’m mexican it’s a funny detail calm down ,2023-03-24
no way is that generally agreed that’s nonsense,2023-03-24
thanks i really appreciate the answer im going to go tomorrow then,2023-03-24
thanks for your response i liked the others but with 3 felt what you described so much action it got tiresome and boring do you know if this one has more action proportionally than 3,2023-03-24
"i wrote this elsewhere so here you go 

so i think what it implies is that winston orchestrated in full the being of baba yaga john was an orphan but at a high table affiliate orphanage so it all just seems to be winstons planning on a much larger scale like everything else in the movie it also implies winston was never actually going to turn against john his son john himself wasnt aware of who winston was ofc but it makes alot of sense and it makes winston a bit of a  father but it also mirrors john the unparalleled killer to winston the brains to the brawns equivalent or whatever 


basically winston being his father john being an orphan winston put him in that orphanage and raised him to be the way he is and there was never a point where winston wouldnt have backed john he was his father so that speculation is thrown out of the window",2023-03-26
"interesting take i do agree he doesn’t add an overwhelming amount an average bounty hunter who is money hungry but he’s actually a good fighter and shot with a few tricks up his sleeve 
i think it resonates  brings full circle with the other movies 
such as john shooting chidi who was about to shoot the dog he knew the pain of losing a dog he sacrificed killing nobody to save the dog then the nobody character returns the favor and helps him out  
idk i enjoyed his addition even if it wasn’t too important caine was a savage fighter too which was cool ",2023-03-30
john dies he literally saved his  a few times the whole point of him as a bounty hunter was to save john wick until the contract value was higher and he could claim it for himself,2023-03-31
more memorable and original action pieces dogs knives horse bikes keanus performance in 4 is distractingly bad better pacing in 3 plot goes and comes in circle and the duel rule obviously shoehorned in there are positives obviously but i thought 3 was better in every way except maybe cinematography and even then,2023-04-03
yeah it was way overdone,2023-03-25
a completely flat playing card,2023-03-25
so he didnt lose but why is caine free then and why can he  bill skarsgard at that moment but not before im just confused,2023-04-01
i read the plot on wikipedia a few days ago and it says one thing then someone on reddit who saw the movie before today said it is left open at the end so im not really sure who to believe wikipedia or that reddit poster until i see the movie myself i wont know for sure,2023-03-25
even cap would of had a rough time taking that damage and hes an actual superhuman,2023-03-24
 thanks will probably have to see it again this weekend,2023-03-24
you deserve an a for your valid comment but i still suspect that the writers did it as an excuse to prolong the franchise in theory to me they still should’ve done one more movie and get some glimpse at the goingson within the high table there’s always ballerina but i hope it won’t jinx it and prematurely end the franchise then and there due to low bo returns,2023-03-26
i mean the grave and him dying on the steps very pretty convincing,2023-03-26
oh i was including that poker scene when i said the night club they could have said the marquis killed katias father and skipped right from john being hung up to john being branded,2023-03-27
"he represents the damage john has done to the high table

note how basically everything nobody does is in defiance of the high tables usual enforced style utilitarian clothes instead of suits leveraction guns and revolvers instead of the hyperspecialized raceguns everyone else uses and an attitude towards business that can be summed up as  you pay me

nobody is essentially johns living legacy the result of his legend showing the criminal underworld that you dont have to play by the  rules and you can just be like him instead he isnt a wildly important character in the movies plot events but he fills a thematic role that helps the movie and adds depth to the john vs high table conflict by helping emphasize the knockon effects john has had

e it also fleshes out why the marquis has such a hateboner for john for similar reasons hes everything an assassin under the table shouldnt be on paper",2023-03-28
 or heaven are probably super secret undergroung hospitals where you can resurrect from pretty much anything but in exchange of resurrecting you you have to do something for them in some touristic places one we havent seen yet so sidney rio or barcelona,2023-03-25

"i dislike the fact that they  the shooter instead of the shotcaller

this whole movie was about the high table retaliating against john wick all the movie proved is that they are untouchable

the ironic message of consequence at the end
technically 4 people die charon japan manager berlin leader and swagger suit guy because john wick went on this pointless vengeance
pointless because again he didnt  the shotcaller",2023-03-25
or he’s his dad lol,2023-03-24
thats what she said barump bump tish,2023-03-25
i didn’t like it i loved iti’m just pointing out how insane it is lol,2023-03-25
it is when the previous installments have been and one of the hallmarks of this franchise is the attempt to make the action as realistic as possible,2023-03-25

thank you,2023-03-25
ballerina takes place in between chapter 3 and 4,2023-03-26
exactly  so on the flip side are we supposed to believe he surgically hit those 3 bullets on purpose  just made no sense for the final climax,2023-03-26
doubt it got shot in same area as the doctor in wick 3 and the director just responded to the ending since people were shocked and he said keanu and him never said fully no to another its up to the studio  he liked the ending but the studio didnt so watch them get new director and pump out a fifth one lol,2023-03-27
the high table honestly feels like a decentralized shadow government but like in a comic book like i think they purposely dont reveal the high members at all because knowing their identities alone is such a huge secret or something,2023-03-27
also none of the wounds looked fatal for him,2023-03-27
i felt like they lingered as long as they should have if they were doing a john wick death everything went exactly as it should have imo,2023-03-27
but that makes no sense considering he is free of the high table after winning the duel anyway,2023-03-27
"viggo dies slumped over in the dark cold rain  
john dies slumped over by the sunrise",2023-03-28
is it good i heard its the matrix ripoff,2023-03-28
we dont know fully that he has sounds  but they always like to never make it 100 incase they want to make another film,2023-03-29
but what point is misleading the high table if he was already freed of all debts and obligations after winning the duel,2023-03-31
im guessing its the dj that was a reference to the warriors complete with the same song but i could be wrong  the original post was way too vague,2023-05-25
if you don’t know you’re probably too young to be bothered by it don’t sweat it,2023-05-16
i read somewhere that the movie is the 4th and 5th combined thats why its so long,2023-03-26
"its a great place to stop not least because of its endings the sparseness of the lore that was ever explained meant there is so much they could do with it as a franchise though they are already making the ballerina spinoff having just watched this john wick 4 i already want to see a prequel about caine and a sequel about akira

that said part of the appeal of the series has been that we didnt know that much about the world only the bare minimum that we needed to know and we could imagine the rest for ourselves thats why i think some people have been unsatisfied by the ending they might not have any problem with the demise of wick but it built such an intriguing world that it feels incomplete

its easy to forget that the series is called john wick  not something broader like star wars but would have faced the same problem if it had been called luke skywalker hes dead and the story is over",2023-04-06
wow yeah the director so far has only done the john wick movies whereas his codirector from the first one david leitch has branched out to a fast and furious movie the  deadpool sequel atomic blonde and most recently bullet train,2023-04-09
wiki though says the 5th is definitely on the cards,2023-03-26
i checked my watch and got disappointed that it was going to end soon,2023-04-02
yeah i loved it as well but i don’t see much else to really go from here with wick’s character unless you wanna go fast  furious level zany maybe,2023-04-08
i heard from a guy that did post on matrix 4 that the matrix and john wick some each have a 5th,2023-04-05
the 1st is the best and always will be,2023-11-04
yeah tbh having had some time to think on it i think if the arc sequence had been shorter id have also been fine with the stair sequence tho it did take the mick a little in places,2023-03-29
the thing that kept me going during the german club scene was the banging sound track,2023-03-26
i do think a bit of it was intentionally longer just to drive up how  exhausting it was like john at the end of the movie was like murdering people for what felt like several consecutive hours in world was probably something like 30 minutesan hour before dawn,2023-03-28
i really enjoyed the poker scene but the ensuing chasefight through the club dragged on way too long,2023-03-27
im just like how do yall think this bounty is worth it it keeps going up so you know he killing tons of ppl yall some arrogant  to think ur gonna be the one to cash in lol gotta be alive to spend that money,2023-03-25
people make this point about the uncharted games too at some point when youre like oh  drake killed the first 200 men i sent after him hey you guys go  drake your henchmen are just going to be like uhhhhhhhhh no,2023-03-26
this reminds me of the henchman who quit in ironman 3 after a few people around him were taken out his line was like “i don’t even like working here  these people are sooo weird”,2023-03-26
given we have militias in the real world and a lot of them im sure theres a henchman service yeah,2023-03-25
i mean the bounty on wick was 40 mil thats a solid amount of cash for a life time,2023-03-26
after john they are about to start asking for a lot  more  he singlehandedly created a job shortage,2023-04-04
i want to scene about the fallout of one of these massacres are there entire clubs that are just weirdly empty the next day because it was the hangout spot for 100 nowdead henchmen  do they all get buried in one long line of funeral plots  are there exgirlfriends just sitting around crying about how their bf and 50 of his friends all got slaughtered,2023-04-06
they recycle within the same movie shaggy haired bearded guys become clean shaven monks in other scenes and now they have storm troopers so they dont have to worry for those scenes,2023-03-26
john wick himself was also an orphan i think,2023-03-27
he is the boogeyman,2023-03-31
love this,2023-03-31
and the golden chainsaw for coolest  goes to anyone and everyone who got incinerated by the flame shotgun lol,2023-04-23
"i was thinking the same thing by the paris part i would be like “this is not worth even that much he has destroyed everyone” 

it almost would have been cool story wise if no one responds to the paris call and john is on edge waiting but nothing happens marquis freaks out",2023-03-24
40mil and notoriety of killing a legend is a draw for people,2023-03-26
it’s minor but the only thing i wished this one to have was more references to john wick’s reputation like i want the bounty to go out and a group just goes “john wick hard pass”,2023-03-26
"i know that i may not be a top tier deadly assassin confident in my abilities but if i knew all about john wick which everyone in this universe does and i got an alert on my phone that there was a contract on his head

i would simply put my phone away any not try to  the most dangerous man ive ever known about in the entire business",2023-03-27
yeah and the scene where that random tracker character and marquis haggle over 3 million,2023-05-26
i wouldve loved a scene where the assassins see the price go up realise that it means everyone who has gone after john has failed and decide that its not worth it,2023-10-20
yeah,2023-03-26
i saw 140 in another comment,2023-03-26
yes but he could have walked away like john asked him to in reality what did it was that he tried to  john after he killed his sister,2023-03-25
he was already his second though i dont know if the proxy can be someone other than the second,2023-03-25
yes,2023-12-31
bill freed caine after he grabbed the gun and stepped into the duel,2023-03-29
its funny that its his only gripe when he did way more unbelievable stuff than shoot straight in a duel,2023-03-25
that really doesnt matter theres no way for him to know where his own gun is pointing blind guy doing martial arts sure but shooting long distances not really in the realm of possibility honestly would be better if he had one eye or wasnt blind,2023-03-27
the problem is that it implies that either his aim is so insanely good he intentionally missed johns vitals on the first couple of shots or he was actually trying to  him and john was just really really lucky,2023-10-14
yesss,2023-04-03
with a stick,2023-04-05
"i don’t think so 
where he got hit at between neck and shoulder and left lower side above hip are the same spots the doc told john to shoot to make it “look like he fought back” 

we see the dog at the grave scene pick up a something 

and john’s work isn’t done the high table sent somebody after him he only killed that guy he didn’t get revenge on the high table which is his only motivator 

so i don’t think we have seen the last of wick yet he still has vengeance to claim",2023-03-26
"did john wick just die

you know it was really unclear",2023-03-27
"hes dead to the world of everyone else in the film  hes out of the game now while everyone else is still in it  even caine who wanted out still has an appointment with akira

but john is done  at least until the inevitable sequel where they pull him out of retirement for one last job",2023-03-29
the japanese dude is,2023-03-24
we are all damned,2023-03-25
"i think the name john wick is dead but i like to believe that the man is at peace in retirement finally 

maybe in a cabin in the middle of the woods with a dog some bourbon and a bunch of leather bound books",2023-04-05
i know someone in the industry who told me where would be a john wick 4 and 5 so idk the guy did post on matrix 4,2023-04-04
the other brother is,2023-03-27
might be since they used the kung fu bit about the branding  to mark the forearm in the same way,2023-03-25
the rule to fun writing is either giving characters wacky nonsense names or names that help you remember their purpose,2023-03-31
and let’s not forget how those stairs kicked his ,2023-03-24
my favorite thing is how in the last film the big twistfinale is that he got shot off the building but in this one he  jumps the same height and breaks his fall with a car funniest ,2023-03-24
"yeah it’s probably the closest it feels like “playing” a video game in movie form you’re john wick just mowing down guys with your skills and no matter how much you get “hit” you recover after a few seconds of inaction because that’s how video games work 

permanent damage is reserved for cutscenes",2023-03-24
yeah its basically a live action looney tunes movie  just dont take it seriously and have a great ride,2023-03-24
that fight scene in paris with all those cars like i was on the edge of my seat,2023-03-24
and they applied the same rules to the bad guys that main bad guy that was about to  the dog fell and landed on stairs only to show up at the top of the stairs in front of the church and john,2023-03-24
"yep exactly why can john wick fall off of multiple buildings get hit by like 20 cars dispose of a thousand bad guys and still make it out alive 

which begs the question as to how a single bullet to the abdomen ultimately caused his death",2023-03-25
you know why he gets out alive because hes john  wick thats why,2023-03-24
"hes got literal and metaphorical plot armor and he isnt afraid to use it

he also has the power of determination and friendship on his side",2023-03-26
because he is baba yaga,2023-03-24
he’s a man of focus commitment and sheer  will,2023-03-25
theres no fall damage in this game,2023-03-30
i need to watch movies with you  i get so tired of leaving the theater super amped and then one of your friends is like  his suit shouldnt have protected him he should have died right there it ruined the movie for me  like just enjoy the  ride,2023-03-26
kevlar suit ,2023-03-28
and apparently police and law enforcement in general just doesnt exist in this universe except for that one guy in the first two movies who kept showing up to johns house people are  killing each other all over paris and theres no police response the entire time i  love it lol,2023-05-24
no falling damage bruh,2023-03-26
to quote mr huey lewis thats the pooower of love,2023-03-27
one could say he didn’t make it out alive i think if he hadn’t been through so much  that night he would’ve survived his dueling injuries,2023-04-08
if you look up the film theory video about this movie on youtube he actually goes into the crazy injuries and science behind why he could survive some,2023-06-05
its about the suit read the graphic novel,2023-03-25
heres my pet peeve why does john wick get a pass for this but everybody clowns on the fast and the furious franchise for this exact same thing honest question i think both are  i have no horse in this race,2023-04-02
nice suit,2023-03-24
kevlar suits are good though,2023-05-23
he has a good tailor,2023-06-01
"the explanation i gave to myself to rationalize the absurdity of it all is that were watching a videogame

this is not a movie  theres someone playing a videogame using the john wick character and hes so good at it that he manages to defeat 674 enemies at once",2023-10-21
because hes john  thats why,2023-12-12
he also had the most brutal death in the movie falling right on his head like that,2023-03-24
that was  scott adkins of course he was going to be quitea fighter i didnt expect to see him like this haha,2023-03-24
that dude was 100 a weird german version of marvels kingpin,2023-03-25
i loved that  that his size ended up being a strength against john wick  because that  was brute force,2023-03-25
i was wondering who this random  german actor was and why he was so good at fighting before learning it was scott adkins in a  suit,2023-03-24
was watching that with a friend and all we could think was german kingpin and then he actually turned out to be a physical threat and we doubled down on it,2023-03-25
i sort of wish that’s how kingpin would fight in the mcu donofrio’s brute force is awesome but it’d be awesome to see a big man move that fast against daredevil or spiderman,2023-03-26
man was incredibly light on his feet for his size im reminded of all the videos ive seen of people his weight doing back flips or ballerina routines,2023-03-24
i really liked that fight he was a power fighter that could withstand hits because of his mass versus john whose a more agility and precise fighter who was having a harder than usual fight because the style was such a natural opposite to his,2023-03-24
it was the best fight on this movie,2023-03-24
he reminded me of a tekken character,2023-03-24
"fun fact they named him killa harkan which is kind of an ode to killa hakan a turkish german rapper born in berlin west germany before turning to music he was a 36 boys gang member and imprisoned for burglary bank robbery and wounding

hes often credited with making rap popular in germany",2023-03-25
"he kind of reminded me of sammo hungbut a lot bigger

take a look at donnie yen vs sammo hung splkill zone on youtube    for an amazing fight",2023-03-29
it’s scott adkins chad stahelski wasn’t about to cast his buddy and not give him fights,2023-03-29
that’s cause it was legendary martial artist scott adkins in a  suit lol,2023-04-15
german colin farrell’s penguin,2023-03-25
that dude could  kick  i was pleasantly surprised he wasnt just some pushover  also the main bodyguard boxer guy he was pretty sick too,2023-03-26
to me he looked like penguin from dc universe lol,2023-03-26
the peter griffin grabbing knee meme came to mind and  i lost my  hilarious ,2023-04-07
he reminded me a lot of  schmidt i couldnt not see it,2023-03-28
huge sammo hung vibes from that dude one of the best martial artists that ever graced the screen and an inspiration to all  and chubby dudes everywhere o7,2023-05-24
the actor is like a pro kickboxer irl so i assumed he’d put up a decent fight despite the  suit,2023-05-25
he literally had that bobfromtekken6 build,2023-03-29
you shot me in the  ,2023-07-05
filled with hundreds of people that must dance continuously despite people getting absolutely murdered 3 feet away from them,2023-03-24
the club dancers took so  long to react to the violence around them it had me in tears there were a solid 10 deaths and 15 minutes of fighting before they started to panic ,2023-03-24
every mob boss is also a competent fighter in their own right like viggo wasnt a slouch for his age,2023-03-24
"nightclub shootouts are a staple in john wick movies

the writing team was like “yeah that’s cool and all as long as there’s a nightclub shootout” when drafting the movies",2023-03-25
it makes sense it’s a high volume high cash business that’s easy to launder money through,2023-03-27
jw universe consists of nightclubs rooms full weapons displays elaborate lighting and weirdly empty historical locations,2023-04-01
i swear that nightclub had the same music as the one in john wick 1,2023-03-25
two has a great rave shootout too right after he kills santinos sister it leads nicely into the catacombs fight honestly if theres no techno rave doused in neon i start to wonder if im watching a john wick movie,2023-03-24
the chicken,2023-03-24
in any other movie maybe id agree but for me when you know the duel is the climax youre more than happy to see john wick do what john wick does best until that time comes and thats killing fools,2023-03-28
i mean if he’s chinese is it stereotyping for him to have a chinese name,2023-03-25
i did have a chuckle when it was that blatant,2023-04-03
scott,2023-03-27
basically laurence fishburne giving him a wrestling entrance,2023-03-26
yeah it was excessive no need to blow peoples ears off,2023-04-28
thats crazy the first time i got in a dolby atmos theater the difference floored me if its an action movie or any sort of audio visual spectacle im never going back to a normal theater,2023-03-27
i believe chapter 4 actually took place a few years into john’s oneman war with the high table based on how the flesh around his severed finger had healed up,2023-03-26
this was probably also mentioned but john was shot in the same spots he shot his doctor friend in the 3rd movie,2023-04-05
i had to remind myself to breathe during the osaka fight it wasnt just intense with the dolby it was kind of overwhelming,2023-03-27
captured the energy of hotline miami so  well i was just giggling that entire scene so good,2023-03-24
i looked up gameplay for hotline miami right after seeing it and got a trailer for john wick 4 before it lol,2023-03-24
they were 100 going for hotline miami with that shotgun spray,2023-03-24
reminded me so much of hotline miami and hong kong massacre it was a visual  treat,2023-03-24
yes i wonder if they stitched the seemingly seamless shot together from the black bars that momentarily obscured travel between the rooms so much fun,2023-03-24
down to the crawlers on the floor the way they introduced the incendiary rounds just to mimic the shotgun spray in the game chefs kiss,2023-03-24
i immediately thought of hong kong massacre,2023-03-24
if they would have gotten a track from moon i would have died right there,2023-03-25
didnt they use hotline miami soundtrack for the stairs fight,2023-03-24
we need that crossover yesterday,2023-03-25
i’ve had the yearning for a hotline miami movie searing my brain since i played it this movie was vindicating,2023-03-25
i always wanted to see a hotline miami movie in similar style to john wick not very serious minimal dialogue and just go guns blazing,2023-03-27
the director said it was inspired by hong kong massacre,2023-03-27
i am so looking forward to see the scene again,2023-03-28
this was exactly my thought too especially cool with the incendiary bullets,2023-03-28
john wick 4 is the best videogame movie ever made,2023-04-14
i’ve hung out with the writer for wick 1 before and told him he had to check out hotline miami it’s basically a wick game in terms of the action,2023-04-05
i always thought the stylized dialogue text on the screen was straight from max payne even the font style is the same,2023-03-24
my man legit jumped off a 3 stories building onto a car and just walked it off,2023-03-24
im surprised their not been a video game made yet where you play as a an hitman in the john whick universe yet,2023-03-24
and then its a scripted event at the end that gets him good lol,2023-03-25
he got his vigor to 60 and it shows,2023-03-24
in chapter 4 the full black armor enemies is literally bullet sponge,2023-03-25
i like that many of the goons are not 1hp and take many hits to  except headshots,2023-03-24
you could see the enemies leveling up too how many baddies had the same bulletproof suits as him having to get inside their armor was huge too,2023-03-27
how good is formal kevlar attire,2023-03-24
" the first movie was generally speaking more grounded because the game was just beginning

thats when it was best imo",2023-03-29
in this one the colors in osaka made it feel a lot like an animevideo game too i felt like they pushed the video game angle even more loves it,2023-03-26
there is a podcast called film reroll where they take movies and run them as pen and paper rpg campaigns they did john wick but came to the conclusion that john is too powerful so they all decided to play the bad guys and ran john like a force of nature it was awesome,2023-03-26
i really noticed the sidequests and bossfights in this one,2023-03-27
i can’t believe there hasn’t been a john wick game,2023-03-27
" this series really evolved like a video game

i had that thought watching this first time watching a john wick i usually only make the time for super hero films and mainstream blockbusters but with those slowing down ive been seeing different kinds of films this movie was jam packed with action this makes me excited for the penguin series i think that will be good the one character was like the japan pm i guess this is a sign my john wick power up is over",2023-03-25
although the final fight in jw1 is a boss battle even the camera moves like a video game camera as they get to it,2023-03-29
i havent seen 4 but is power creep an issue is he basically a super hero now,2023-04-20
" thats why wick was able to survive such ridiculous  in 3 and 4 he was a really high level vitality build

he repec his agi into vit between 3 and 4",2023-04-02
exactly my thoughts i was like ohh the doof doof,2023-03-24
were getting mgs starring oscar isaac hopefully they dont  it up,2023-03-25
the way he holds his pistol and blade reminded me of  snake,2023-04-30
,2023-04-30
a lot of very obvious references the warriors taxi driver but i aint mad at it great sendoff to the franchise,2023-03-24
yes the moment we see her i made the connection but as soon as she said “boppers” i cheered in my seat,2023-03-24
"callback is putting it mildly  

i half expected charlie to show up again and tell john to come out and playeeay",2023-03-24
i was super stocked when that happened i was like oh is this going where i think it was going it did it was awesome i would have died if they had a mines with baseball bats,2023-03-24
"more than a callback it’s like one big homage

the song the dj and things she says his “journey” across town

excellent ",2023-03-26
felt like the warriors with a little bit of the video game deathloop sprinkled in,2023-03-24
even better when you remember david patrick kelly was in the first movie,2023-03-25
 glorious,2023-03-24
its funny but i was expecting the nowhere to hide original to play i was kinda disappointedlol not a cover,2023-05-24
gessafelstein at the arc,2023-03-24
the ramp up of genesis up the steps was so  good some great sound editing there,2023-03-25
especially since the ed banger hq is right by those stairs,2023-03-24
i watched that assassins creed 2 trailer so many times in high school so i recognized it immediately lol,2023-03-25
i ascended,2023-03-24
threw me back to high school good tribute picking french artists but what a pick,2023-03-26
"i use to bboy to that song so as soon as i heard the first note i almost stood up to top rock  song for ppl interested

",2023-03-27
i mid 30s looooved this,2023-04-06
what song was it,2023-03-24
there was such a smile on my face as i recognised it they really punctuated the percussion with the action too,2023-03-30
i noticed that too and laughed,2023-03-30
lous and the yakuza is not french,2023-03-26
then the stair fight literally right after insanely solid third act best in the series imo,2023-03-24
not that it really matters but most of the japan shots were in osaka rather than tokyo,2023-03-24
righttt i think that has to be my favourite part right beside the paris apartment,2023-04-11
its funny they still set the lighting to racist level,2023-03-27
if you get a chance avatar 2 is straight up incredible in imax just not the same on the home tv,2023-03-26
make sure you saw it in real imax,2023-03-25
the only person whos not thinking  john wick with fire but  those people gonna hurt,2023-03-24
thank you for explaining that because while i was content to keep shouting he used a friggin fire shotgun over and over i like knowing the actual mechanics involved,2023-03-24
dragons breath about to cash in,2023-03-24
haven’t seen the movie yet but rambo final blood had that ammo and i thought it was  unreal that it was an actual thing lol,2023-03-24
dragons breath,2023-03-24
magnesium not white phosphorus,2023-04-02
im glad you guys brought this deadly weapon to him,2023-03-24
talking about guns did one of the dudes in the paris apartment scene carry some sort of modernized thompson smg,2023-03-25
especially since those weapons where specifically anti john wick armor and they failed,2023-03-29
100 just a beautiful movie,2023-03-24
maybe you don’t consider it a shootout and more of a car chase but that final chase in fury road with the dudes on the sky cranes was  nuts,2023-03-25
upvote for the collateral shout out,2023-07-24
 the berlin club fight was so fun there were so many callbacks to the original club scene in the first john wick and they even got lecastlevania to make more dubstep to play over it,2023-03-26
thats the one thank you so much haha,2023-03-25
i dont know if id say he was fighting with respect it felt like he was just toying with his food  like instead of punching someone he slaps them in the face,2023-04-01
he told him to leave and gave him a chance,2023-03-26
what about when koji and akira walk in both injured and they see all those dudes bleeding all over the floor with caine in the middle,2023-03-31
henchmen of his japanese hotel manager friend good men are hard to come by so he’s basically saving his friend’s henchmen,2023-03-25
his own people maybe or people he had worked with in the past,2023-03-29
same as a canto person here  it is so  offensive that translations didnt even do it justice imo,2023-03-25
"im cantonese my gf and i absolutely hollered i think no one else in the theater understood though

so many good references to asian action cinema like wuxia radio station",2023-03-29
"i was surprised by that too everyone in the cinema that i watch with laughed in malaysia i laughed too without sound since my lips were stuck i can still laugh now remembering the scene

the even more surprising part is when john wick repeated the same words i guess he really did used it in the right timing especially when he is blind and he guessed something that would never happen",2023-03-26
his line good but wick should had say something differnt but repeat,2023-03-27
" 

",2023-03-26
same thing with my group you can tell we were the only ones who understood it,2023-03-29
thats so much better,2023-09-25
that was just so out of nowhere that it kinda caught my theater off guard everyone was laughing when donnie said ,2023-03-26
let me guess five of a kind,2023-03-29
"yea i was bummed out by that

its a waste of his talent",2023-03-24
i think he was supposed to play zero in 3 but passed it up for his short scene in endgame still think i prefer the guy they got though he was hilarious and sanada wouldve made it very different,2023-03-24
marchese is italian marquis is french and english,2023-03-26
thank you so much totally misunderstood that scene,2023-04-09
this there even was a guy who got shot in the head and then moved his leg afterwards so john and his opponent wouldnt trip over it,2023-04-16
watch the throne room fight especially the guards it’s hilarious you can visibly see them waiting for daisy to look their way before they attack,2023-03-25
no way johns dead they already had plans to film jw 4 and 5 backtoback they said that theyre taking a break right now and working on the spinoffs but i have a feeling the major story beats didnt change all that much from the original vision of 45,2023-03-24
"the 4th film ended with him crumpled just like the start of the 1st movie

you see its like poetry",2023-03-24
if you watch it again watch his dog’s head during the tombstone scene  i could have sworn it turned like it heardsaw somethingsomeone,2023-03-24
i highly doubt it winstone reply of “who knows” with a knowing smirk basically confirms that hes still alive just faked his death “you will only know peace in death”,2023-03-24
itd be interesting if he werent really dead but could stay alive as a sort of mentor figure especially because itd show that he is capable of changing his nature i think this film really drove home how john wick is a sort of dark christ figure where instead of him dying for others sins others die for his sins the last act of the movie which took place in front of a church and featured a sunrise really felt like a sort of rebirth its possible that might happen in a more literal sense if he comes back in the future,2023-03-24
"they were very careful on wording it everyone but winston references john as mrwick john wick or his moniker never  john or jonathan 

he states prior if he were to buried hed want john loving husband not john wick a loving husband they beat it into him and us that the only true way out for john wick was death he died john lived",2023-03-25
if this is the end then theyve gone out on an  kicking high note  but yeah im thinking  be back,2023-03-24
"i’m not even sure death can  john wick

john actually died years ago death was too afraid to tell him",2023-03-24
now that hes free after winning the dualhis death is just a way for him to disappear back into a quiet life,2023-03-24
yeah when they were in the graveyard dog perks his head up and looks off to the left off screen with a little whine can definitely see a version of events where john is watching his own little memorial,2023-03-25
"after falling off multiple buildings getting hit by many many cars and falling down a lot of stairs i cant see how simply getting shot from 30 paces or less could  him

plus they have to another movie so akira can get revenge on caine",2023-03-25
the camera is focused on the dog it perks up right before it pans to them walking away he’s alive for sure,2023-03-26
john is dead but john wick 5 is gonna be him kicking  in  and shooting satan himself in the head,2023-03-25
"im willing to say the intent right now is for john to be dead but it was also absolutely presented in a way to easily say thats an empty plot and he faked his death to finally have peace 

i absolutely took the cheeky laugh after who knows where he is to mean winston and king knew he was really alive and they were paying their final goodbyes over the fake grave to play along

but if they leave john here i wouldnt be mad either",2023-03-27
i mean what else can they do i know he wants to  the high table but honestly him getting freedom and peace in life for a very brief time period and in death is honestly a perfect and fitting ending for his character because worst case scenario they make a 5 and 6 and 7 and they start getting stale and not very good well they gave everyone who wants to enjoy a nice 4 act structure a chance to get off the train with this films ending and im taking it hes dead and buried afaic,2023-03-25
i havent seen anyone mention this yet but at the duel john and caine say those that cling to death live those that cling to life die i took this as caine clinging to the life of his daughter along with his earlier line of dead people are gone and only the living matter john is of course clinging to the death of his wife with that and the post credit scene i fully think that john is still alive and caine will die,2023-03-27
no way hes dead,2023-04-02
i dont think he is winston was sly about that,2023-03-24
hes not,2023-03-24
john wick is dead john vick however just moved into a new house,2023-03-24
john wick 5 john wakes up in  and needs to become satans hitman,2023-03-25
the way they filmed that scene reminded me of cowboy bebops end to be honest it can go either way hes free to fake his own death cause the high table isnt after him anymore and winston owes him for getting him everything he lost back,2023-03-28
"john wick 5 he kills the high table 

or 

he fights his way out of  to make it to the great continental in the sky and be with helen enraged that  didnt forgive him satan you can give up your father or die screaming beside him 

maybe jesus is sky winston and blocks a knife attack with the holes in his hand wick throws a pistol it hits him in the face he turns his cheek and then he throws another pistol 

or 

maybe i had too much to drink at the theater",2023-03-29
i may be wrong but i actually have a strong feeling he’s not dead we just saw the death of “john wick” it was hinted at earlier in the movie,2023-03-24
killing of characters like john wick and james bond is just lazy story writing  the draw to them is that they always come back regardless of what the bad guys put them through it’s just asinine to end it by killing them off,2023-03-26
"john wick  death can have me when it earns me

",2023-03-25
"its like the matrix an hour and a half into the movie and hes saying hes not the one he better be the  one

he spent 2 and a half hours getting out from the table so he wont die just to  die angry face",2023-03-25
"either morpheus is hiding him somewhere

or movie 5 starts with john wick fighting his way out of ",2023-03-25
whether john wick is dead physically or not this part of his story is done and buried for sure he was able to leave this world once for his wife it pulled him back after her death and now he had finally freed himself from it and the next chapter can be focused on a new story instead,2023-03-26
"john is dead

x200b

but is john wick",2023-03-26
im pretty sure there is a contract for a 5th movie so i dont think hes dead,2023-03-26
they can bring him back but literally the only way i see him getting involved is if they do winston dirtykill him brutally and make an example john comes back for revenge surely,2023-03-26
when they were at his grave you didnt see the bowery kings dog flinch his head looking off to the left it was like he noticed someone,2023-03-27
the dog looks up at some thing off screen when they are talking at johns grave at the end i bet its john hiding out in a tree making sure his dog is taking care of,2023-03-27
john gonna rise and be zombie wick also they made it obvious he earned his death sure but not in a duel against a french kid,2023-03-28
i mean john has seen worse and lived his arm was grazed he got shot above the collar bone same place he shot the doctor at the beginning of 3 and just above his hip where he has been shot and stabbed multiple times over the previous 3 when he thanked caine i interpreted it as a thanks for shooting him in less lethal places maybe idk i went into it expecting a 5th so was kind of shocked it ended that way theyre just such good movies i want more,2023-03-28
he was dead all along really  these films have all been purgatory  and now he can move on  whether that means actual death or not is beside the point,2023-03-29
"probably not 

the marquis at one point says i think to caine that the point was not to  john wick himself but the “idea of john wick” 

this probably means that the grave is only symbolism for the death of the “idea of john wick”",2023-04-02
funeral scene has the dog in focus when suddenly their head shoots up to look at something offscreen,2023-04-05
when morpheus asked where do you think he is heaven or  i wanted the other guy to say for all we know hes in nepal or something like that,2023-04-05
then why did winston say goodbye my son quietly,2023-04-03
there was a dedication on the screen after all the credits and post credit scene were done,2023-03-25
to lance reddick there was one at the very beginning of the film for me with everything being digital now they can pretty much make changes until release date,2023-03-24
alamo did one before my showing last night,2023-03-24
though to be fair youre in the middle of a bunch of writhing bodies and pounding music possibly onnot on some kind of legalillegal substance youre not going to notice some fistifcuffs going on,2023-03-28

i was just thinking  paris has some very bad drivers,2023-03-29
i knew that was gonna happen as soon as i saw the teeth,2023-05-23
i cant help but wonder every time i watch these movies who is hiring all these assassins and how many people in the world require a talented hitman to  them,2023-03-25
"seconded on alternate universe the only police in the entire series are the ones that showed up to johns house because of disturbancesthe fire in the first two films and the only cop among them that has speaking lines is very much aware of johns line of work and treats it extremely casually 

every single character we see  not extras characters  is part of the underworld in some way except for three characters who exist to provide motivation for assassins johns wife sofias daughter in jw3 who exists only in a photograph and cains daughter there are effectively no civilians and no civilian authority to speak of the cops never show up to any of these gigantic fight scenes the only consequences that come from open violence are ones that come from other aspects of the underworld no one ever talks about hiding their activities from the police the concept of jail or prison seemingly does not exist nobody is afraid of it theres those clean up guys that hide bodies but considering how big the threat of reprisals from other criminals are its clearly more for their sake than for any legal troubles the high table is extremely powerful and is effectively the only real legal authority that is relevant in the john wick universe 

it really hammers home how difficult it is to escape this life because the very concept of a civilian life doesnt even get shown on screen or is ever relevant to the story it makes the underworld seem allpervasive and totalizing a normal life seemingly doesnt even exist hence why everyone treats it like its completely impossible to achieve every time you think youre dealing with the real world and john seemingly interacts with a civilian its revealed to just be another part of the underworld theres no regular ny taxi driver he takes continental coins and knows wicks name theres no regular ranting homeless guy they all work for the bowery king the camera never follows any panicking extra no goon takes one as a hostage john never speaks to one or finds out their names or what they want or how they sound and so many of them could be assassins in disguise waiting to pounce

you could even argue that the civilian world literally does not exist there is nothing in the films that actively contradicts that if you go in the films imagining this as a world quite literally and openly ruled by the high table  like theres no us government no eu none of that exists the world is actually run by some ancient mafiaassassin feudal system and the average joe is fully aware of this if not a gang member themselves  then so far nothing breaks that assumption",2023-05-17
"this is what i accepted after this one everyone is a hitman bulletproof suits cars that dont get damaged underground hitman society with hotels and currency retro tech but also modern etc 

doesnt take away at all imo i actually really like how little background they have for some things like caine their relationship etc

i have to rewatch them but this might be my top even as far as action movies the sequences were just too awesome",2023-04-07
oh yeah i was only half joking lol,2023-03-24
100 90 of those people are high out of their minds,2023-10-15
except the whole scene is followed by people casually with a slight jog getting into their cars and driving home,2023-03-25
 that’s not how drugs work you still understand violence very well especially axe to the face kind of violence,2023-04-02

dude they blew up a hotel in new york and it was of no consequence in  new york,2023-03-24
they’re operating out of the eiffel tower not much of a secret hideout,2023-03-24
"there was basically a terrorist attack in paris with over a hundred people dead 

during the roundabout sequence i like how traffic was kind enough to stop when wick was doing the doughnuts around the pile of cars whist shooting at them but once he stopped the cars resumed speeding around the car pile up and hitting henchmen",2023-03-26
right all i could think about while watching that scene,2023-03-24
yep  i was thinking where are all the gendarmes during that scene  great action scene though,2023-03-26
my head canon is that theres just an agreement between the conventional authorities and the high table they just dont get involved,2023-04-24
john wick spinoff idea its the shadowy assassin department dealing with covering up their increasingly ridicolous stunts make it like the office except theyre dealing with trying to sell you the paris attack as like gas explosion or something,2023-04-19
even continental being leveled i really love the first movie because it felt like an underground world in the shadows last three movies everything happens out in the open,2023-04-24
i feel like thats mainly a result of the writers changing,2023-03-26
“accidents happen all the time what makes you think it was ”,2023-04-09
i always took it to be more if we leave them alone they leave us alone,2023-03-29
they probably have diplomatic inmmunity or something,2023-05-16
its not even that its basically an npc machine running them into keanus gun and fists  its total trash,2023-07-11
the masked and armored high table soldiers in osaka are also like tekken force,2023-03-27
wow the entire plot in 3 sentences,2023-07-15
i’m specifically talking about that topdown scene,2023-03-25
"i really like the contrast of how practically everyone character in this movie is super witty or poetic except john lol

i absolutely loved some of hiroyuki sanadas lines

dont insult my gift to you or something that makes john give up at attempting to fight with him because he respects the culture

i forget but right before he and donnie fight he says something like if you think that you really are blind or something with that gist  help me out redditors hiroyuki had some really poetic lines",2023-03-26
i loved that scene three expert assassins forced into a poker game  briefly bonding over their host   theatrics and cheating  ,2023-03-25
right i followed that but he still seemed to just ride off into the night without a final word or request,2023-04-03
that’s literally why he was there the stunt coordinator really likes working with dogs,2023-04-30
donnie yen pov would be really dark movie though,2023-03-25
they can take down the high table,2023-03-25
john wick died  but the babayaga lives on  burning the table to the ground for all the pain its caused  calling it  you see his dog look off into the distance  john might be dead but the boogeyman is not,2023-03-26
i agree 5 would have to be even bigger than this and i cant see how thatd work out focusing on other characters lets them explore interesting ideas more freely without having to worry about topping the last movie,2023-03-25
i wouldn’t mind seeing sort of an origin story for john wick and how he managed to create these friendships seeing him do the impossible task would be rad,2023-03-28
originally they were going to shoot this and a 5th film back to back i cant help but wonder if the reason this film is so long is that they combined the scripts for both films into one,2023-03-25
i honestly think them announcing 5 was a way to keep the spoiler of him dying from getting out and gaining traction if anything if it is a real movie then that is just the working title of a spin off movie  not an actual john wick movie,2023-03-25
they were planning on shooting back to backbut honestly i think they just combined them and we got a super movie,2023-03-26
i think an animated movieseries of his impossible task would be cool,2023-03-27
yep need more of marcus too,2023-03-27
"doesnt he get shot in the same places the doctor tells him to shoot so it looks like he struggled but wouldnt be lethal we never see his dead body just slumps over from exhaustion according to reservoir dogs getting shot in the stomach takes hours to die from hes spent 4 movies not even bruising or getting scratched from blunt force trauma that is usually lethal if they really wanted to drive home a death they could have had him shot in the chest or head or had an open casket funeral scene if the deal was he was free to live his life and be left alone wouldnt faking his death make sense as part of that

",2023-03-26
have you ever seen any tv or movie series cause unless bones confirms he’s dead and then blows his head off on screen he can come back,2023-03-26
i hope he stays dead  yeah gary bettman does ,2023-04-01
if they want keanu to stay in this franchise till hes like 80 i wouldnt be surprised if he does end up in a trainer position or like taking over the continental maybe not sure how that would work but it wouldnt surprise me if they try to pull something like that,2023-03-28
that would be a godawful cliche,2023-03-26
there was a line about him having nothing to  for die for or live for he’s just… there the thing fueling wick’s life was revenge he was finally set free and could rest,2023-03-24
"yeah 100 i loved this movie to bits until the last 3 minutes it felt like i was being trolled the events as they played out felt really out of place really contrradictory to the rest of the movie what the  was the point of the duel if in the end all he got out of it was killing the marquis which was his plan before he found out about the duel thing anyway the only real answer to that is getting winston reinstated  his hotel back but theres so much wrong with that the whole your second in the duel gets a wish too felt completely contrived

it felt like the films were leading up to a revolution against the high table of some sort or at least a significant restructuring of the system with many characters in the story seemingly being very displeased with it but no all we got at the end was winston goes back to working under the high table john wick is dead his efforts in the last 2 movies were pointless and he might as well have died at the end of john wick 2 after killing dantonio at the continental",2023-03-24
tbh it feels like a pretty tragic and almost nihilistic ending john wick killed hundreds of people over the course of these movies and for what is literally anyone better off after all of that he didnt overthrow the high table and change the system he didnt save anyones life and he didnt achieve his wifes wish for him to live and find happiness again everyone who died pretty much died for nothing if this was a more philosophical series about the waste of meaningless violence it could work but feels wrong for a series like john wick i loved the movie but i feel like this movie threw out any thematic meaning to the wonderful action,2023-03-25
i agree also so much of the first two are about how john wants to live to keep her memory alive,2023-03-24
i assumed it would be a fake out,2023-03-24
but he died a free man with no obligations to the table he was always going to die but he gets to die as the man his wife loved the one who was out of the criminal world,2023-03-24
i agree loved the movie but the ending was very disappointing,2023-03-24
i feel so mixed like it’s john  wick how the  can my mans die it was a good sendoff but come on the allure of wick was because he’s “the boogeyman” and seems like this completely unkillable character and he goes out like that maaaaan that’s bogus even if he is dead i refuse to believe it,2023-03-24
"the first film and him getting a new dog felt like a life reaffirming to me everything fell apart but he was able to pick up the pieces and when everything fell apart he found something to love something to live for outside of the killing

and the third film ditches the dog and kind of ends where it starts

lawrence fishburn and ian mcshane were barely wicks friends in the previous films and he died for the freedom so they could what start more killing the high table cant replace bill skarsguard because of a duel the high table still exists its in the movie

the film chooses a ending where john ended up dying to continue the cycle of violence that started everything but its framed as a good thing why

i liked the action but this is the weakest john wick plot wise 1 and 2 both were very rich in theme and style and this film ends with the completely subtless is he in heaven or  idk 

probably  if you look at it seriously at all im no christian but the methods of execution of johns will far outway any good hes done and winstons continental will be part of his legacy that will probably do little good for the world

it will be good for the spinoffs tho",2023-03-29
whats the point in faking his death after he literally escaped the world of assassins weve spent four movies showing how much theyre obsessed with rules they told him hes out no reason to fake his death hes dead its the perfect ending bringing him back after those scenes on the steps would feel so cheap,2023-03-24
for the entire four movies i never expected anything other than it ending with his death nothing else fits,2023-03-25
him dying fulfills what winston was talking about early in the film they made a martyr a hero who shook the table that others can now attempt to imitate him being dead is perhaps better for the cause he can do as much damage as a legend as he could a man,2023-03-24
"also we’ve been building towards meeting and destroying the high table for the last 3 movies and then he just dies after killing someone he met 10 scenes ago the series doesn’t make any sense if he actually is dead

also where are the characters from the other movies they just show up and disappear by the next movie 

future movies can still save the franchise but for now without tying the movies together its just another soulless action franchise 

getting blueballed on this one",2023-03-24
he wanted to die a free man the man that helen knew,2023-03-25
"his freedom meant he could die as he originally intended  wanted for his life with helen out of the job and as a loving husband only beside his wife forever as keep in mind had he died on the job under the table he most certainly would have been made a guest for a dinner reservation and not get a proper burial especially since the goal was to ensure he didnt become a martyr

since everything else was taken from him this was the very last thing  the only thing  he could obtain from his ideal life",2023-03-25
"you think a man like that heals and goes and lives on a farm watching the sun rise on a grateful universe

even if marquis was obnoxious they hammered it in pretty well that there is nothing for him to really live for

hes an assassin sometimes the ending isnt happy

but the franchise prints money like the fed and there is a lot of universe intact bowery king new york is back osaka who knows",2023-03-26
i think there was multiple lines in the film that explained his situation pretty clearly to me tbh he’s lost everything and at this point really has nothing to live for the only way he’s “getting out” of this violent life is by dying and john wick is no saint but at least he acheived the one thing he’s really good at “revenge” and was buried next to his wife,2023-04-09
what other way out of it was there my man needs to rest 13 happened in the span of a week and a half,2023-10-20
chad disagrees,2023-03-26
"ive seen several replies with people saying the movies built towards an overthrow of the table and having just watched all 4 movies now john nor any of the other characters expressed a desire to overthrow the high table john broke the rules in 2 and for 3 and 4 he spends it all looking for a way out of the consequences with both 3 and 4 giving him a way out but having to  a friend to do so the elder asks john to  winston as well as pledge himself back in 3 and in this movie he has to  caine in a duel but 4 ends with a clever scheme that shouldve definitively gotten him out without having to  a friend but ends with him dying anyway 

otherwise i agree like if he just died at the end of 2 none of friends lives wouldve been at risk in the first place they even get  at him for asking for help or putting his assassin friends in the position to  him even akira gets  at him for even showing up",2023-03-27
"i think those are good points but the main thing for me is that john just wanted to die as a regular dude even if it’s dumb and symbolic that’s what he was stated to want he would have killed himself in the first movie if helen hadn’t gifted him the dog in the third movie he could hardly even make an answer as to why he wants to live so bad and there’s seemingly a theme of him fighting without a clear cause 

they also said in the movie that if john won the duel it would somehow shake the foundation of the high table i think the fact that john was able to break free no strings attached after killing the elder and wreaking untold havoc against the table is a huge message to others winston even said that john would do more damage by twisting the rules against the table than if he tried to  all of them",2023-03-25
it’s not the people it’s the value of relationship and attention when it exists they had their time in life hope you find new connections that reawaken that value of relationship in you,2023-03-26
"yeah i know that haha as a saying though im trying to understand it 

is it more like to most people friendship means little when it is convenient

i cant recall the context that made him say it and i only watched the movie a few hours ago lol",2023-03-24
the last scene we saw him in before he showed up for the stairs i think it was the meeting with the marquis he finished his drink as i recall set it down and his hands brushed by a pencil he grabbed the pencil confirmed what it was and tucked it into his inner jacket pocket,2023-03-25
he was sitting at a cafe in paris and picked it up,2023-03-31
who’s zero,2023-04-30
feels like he was delaying his death so that the price on john wick’s head gets increasingly higher in his first scene we see him with a notebook and a tiered bounty list with the highest being 50 million,2023-04-02
nobody was bob odenkirks movie too about special forces i was curious if this was any way related,2023-03-25
willem dafoe,2023-03-29
dead dogs just make for a john wick movie,2023-04-11
in his notebook is a page with a picture of a huge house in like colorado or something with a very large tensofmillions number next to it i think the idea is that he has a very large number as his goal which would let him retire forever,2023-05-02
i cant believe how much i loved shimazihiroyuki in such a short time frame proud girl dad man of honor good friend and no nonsense,2023-03-24
"the berlin club shows almost the same angle and cuts as the red circle but you can see the difference in johns face in jw1 he was focused ready deadly in jw4 he looks weary he knows he is stuck inside this endless samsara of violence which is another theme jw3 brought to us a whole lot of miles rivers of blood missing ring finger all for nothing back to square one 

which is why the ending is fitting to break free you have to let go",2023-03-29
"idk osaka has many problems 
there are atleast 2 fight scene about 2 guys vs wick where they wait way too  long for wick to punch guy b while keeping wide shot so we are forced to see lots of bad guys waving hands against air waiting for wick
also nunchaku really is just a bad weapon",2023-03-27
i was feeling the same way dude just didnt  die he had like half a neck and 2 bullet wounds the first encounter,2023-03-24
the guy was an absolutely unit fueled by an inhaler lol,2023-03-24
" there were ladies and gentlemen gyrating undulating floating gliding smiling and staring obliviously at the insane asthmatic guy throwing and being thrown around by the silent blacksuited assassin its tuesday for them

one of my favorite things about the john wick franchise continues to be this world theyve built where all of this wetwork can take place out in the open and the uninvolved public is completely unfazed by it yeah that guy got shot by that other guy do you want another drink

love it",2023-03-24
scott adkins doesnt go down easy,2023-03-24
the bouncer was sven marquardt who is the real life bouncer of berghain in berlin ,2023-03-25
that was my thought too about the berlin nightclub why wasnt anyone more than 5 feet away reacting then i realized it was a berlin nightclub they were likely on something and it was just another day,2023-03-25
i thought the visual of everyone dancing while they fought was so cool reminded me of an arena in a 2d fighting game,2023-03-25
" there were ladies and gentlemen gyrating undulating floating gliding smiling and staring obliviously at the insane asthmatic guy throwing and being thrown around by the silent blacksuited assassin its tuesday for them

it did make the whole everyone in panic leaving the club all of a sudden seem completely  though",2023-03-27
i saw a woman watch john wick throw an ax into a mans head react visibly and just keep on dancing,2023-03-26
best of all is that klaus is played by the most renown bouncer at berlins 1 techno club berghain,2023-03-26
i told my husband the dancers were like npcs who just keep doing their thing while the action happens around them,2023-03-26
i thought he was somehow still alive when john was taking his tooth ,2023-03-25
i thought it was hilarious in a kind of cheesy way that he was an over the top kingpin comic villain some of this movie started to stop taking itself as seriously as the last ones brought me out of it too much personally,2023-03-28
multiple songs by le castle vania in the credits  would love to hear him do a full score,2023-03-24
they definitely used one of the songs again i listen to it a lot because it slaps and i was so happy to hear it,2023-10-20
he was using his left hand right hand got stabbed by caine at the top of the stairs,2023-04-01
that’s been a thing in all these movies though regular people hardly ever react,2023-03-28
yeah definitely he would pick up clips off dead bodies it made me really happy because i wanted to see more dragon’s breath than just one clip and then they did it i was so pumped in the theatre,2023-03-24
someone didn’t watch the after credits scene,2023-03-25
agreed entirely on your assessment,2023-03-29
nice,2023-03-27
i think thats the one im thinking of too wasnt on the soundtrack but im eager to get a clip and id it,2023-03-26
i couldnt stop laughing at the end he straight up did the family guy death pose,2023-03-24
when he died i thought his body was going to start rolling down the stairs again,2023-03-26
the way keanu rolled down the stairs i could hear my theatre collectively roll their eyes felt a bit too forced to be as funny as it was aiming to be,2023-03-26
when that scene happened one guy literally yelled nooooo and everyone laugh it was hilarious,2023-03-29
man had to reload from his last save point ,2023-03-28

weird time for a joke though,2023-03-26
"yes i love what this scene and many others tell the audience that there was another story here that everyone knows within the movie that the audience doesn’t or at least doesn’t know completely makes the world really feel lived in and we’re just taking a peak in the middle of these peoples lives

john wick does it all,2023-03-24

same i dont believe there is an afterlife but i take great comfort in knowing that i might be wrong i really never fully realized this is the reason until john  wick 4 of all movies,2023-04-01
can you olease explain further what do you mean what did john mean whe he said maybe im wrong,2023-06-07

makes sense they need to resolve the conflict between the osaka continental managers daughter and caine,2023-03-24
this is the way,2023-04-30
his experience with the two elite henchmen of zero in the third film really shook him they could’ve killed him but literally helped him up instead he would never let that happen again,2023-03-27

haha right i mean in a movie with so many other callbacks i feel like that was definitely the intent,2023-03-25
i eagerly await the 10hr version of john wick falling down stairs   that was brutal,2023-03-29
i thinking the same thing,2023-03-26
that’s why i started laughing i was thinking no he keeps rolling past the flat part lol,2023-03-29
"same
haha",2023-03-25
that was my favorite moment in the entire movie,2023-03-24
that was the coolest death in the movie surprised it’s not one of the top comments,2023-03-25
like a spider so cool,2023-03-24
my wife who is not into violent movies laughed with me in that moment,2023-03-27
that part stuck out to me as well absolutely  metal,2023-03-27
my favorite scene,2023-03-26
with her magic knives that can  kevlar,2023-03-25
i wish she was there in place of mr nobody following wick around trying to find caine helping them etc he felt like a shoehorn random character that they just did for the dog,2023-03-25
so so so much better than the ruby rose role in the other film and shes an actual actress,2023-03-24
she was in the after credit scene i almost lef the theater having to  so bad but was relieved to see it was worth it and then relieved myself after lol,2023-03-24
we for sure will im pretty sure we havent seen the last of john wick but even if im wrong the end credit scene clearly sets her up for another turn at the big screen and given this movie is going to make money hand over fist its near gauranteed well see her again if not john,2023-03-25
hoping she gets a bigger role if they do 5,2023-03-28
pretty sure she does her own fight stunts the director said he stumbled upon her through one of her music videos he saw that she could dance well and figured that meant she could do fight scenes suffice to say he was right,2023-03-24
not just the stunts but her actual acting was good too you cant really tell shes a popstar if you dont know her youd think shes just an actress,2023-03-28
julie estelle hammer girl was not a pop star she was more of a modelactress although the raid 2 was kinda her first major action role,2023-03-24
julie estelle is also so good in the night comes for us i was thinking during this movie how i would have loved for her to have made an appearance in the series,2023-03-24
my headcanon has always been that he’s the father of johns deceased wife,2023-03-24
i got the impression that winston is actually his dad even if he isnt i will continue to think so,2023-03-24

i spotted the tattoo on winstons hand but couldn’t make it out what did it say,2023-03-28
i had a really interactive theater the pencil and dog both got some serious responses,2023-03-24
i mean no kick pack that much force for him to boost himself off 56 flat part of the stairs lol,2023-03-27
you must have told a really funny joke,2023-03-25
i  do think the scene in john wick was supposed to be a bit humorous,2023-03-24
or that scene in the rundown with the rock lol,2023-03-24
i was waiting the whole time for a banger song like robot rock or something,2023-03-28
hate or glory i specifically heard in the club scene,2023-04-08
its genesis x phantom from woman worldwide,2023-03-25

"nah just do what the  you want reddit is so weirdly conservative with tie knots lol 

who gives a ",2023-03-29
i’m not against fun knots for special occasions i’ve done the trinity knot a few times i tried to find the one he had but i can’t seem to find it,2023-03-25
i was confused about nobodys plot too he was supposed to deliver wick dead to marquis right or at least thats what i thought the phone negotiations were for but he just walks up with wick alive and marquis didnt seem the slightest bit upset,2023-03-27
i noticed this especially during wicks fight with the two armored dudes next to the drum the drum guy was flailing like an absolute rag doll almost comically as if to look stunned but it was just filler while wick was fighting the other dude,2023-03-28
its interesting because i always had the same thought but theres this video of a stunt where they pitted 3 olympiclevel fencers against a group of 50 amateurs i think part of the difference there is that youre dealing with people who obviously have no coordination or ability to work together so maybe random mooks but youd expect that many of these guys would have trained together and actually know how to work as a unit,2023-03-26
"hence my point

x200b

i feel hollywood should have found a solution to this problematic trope",2023-03-24
wouldve thought thatd be obvious when he got 5 of a kind haha,2023-04-01
i get what you mean its because wick was in japan and they incorporate the classic asia is really purple trope the dragon fire scene allowed the teal and orange to really come through as well,2023-04-04
i think its bs these people are professionals who put a high regard on safety no one is going to  themselves for an oscar,2023-03-25
"presenterand the oscar goes totom cruise  

vocie overthis is tom cruises 5th oscar in a row for best stunt",2023-03-26
best stunt choreography would be legit tie in safety as a requirement for eligibility so best stunt choreography that was shot safely and coherently,2023-03-26
"i’d like to see an open choreography with stunts and dancing folded into each other i feel like that would keep a lid on things


if they can do an oscar for hair and make up they should be able to do choreography",2023-03-28
before sunset could only film for an hour a day since the movie took place in real time as they walk around paris at sunset it’s a pain in the  for sure but it can be done,2023-03-25

i also recommend wing chun it’s an older 1994 kung fu movie with both donnie yen and michelle yeoh,2023-03-25
i love that he briefly gets to do the fast ip man punches during the osaka sequence,2023-03-26
flash point and i forgot which wong fei hung movie jet li where he was the antagonist,2023-03-27
is that when he german suplexes the guy in the outdoor dining area that was so good,2023-03-25

saying the stunt drivers were dressed to not hit the performers is redundant thats their job and they will always be stressed doing it",2023-03-24
wait surely they didnt actually hit the dog with a car right i just assumed that was cg,2023-03-24
theres a lot of noticeably bad cgi in the car scenes,2023-03-28
honestly at that point getting done in by a gut shot kinda seems silly like thats what got him,2023-03-24
i get stuck in traffic because a dogs licking its nuts on the side of the road and meanwhile parisians will just completely ignore an allout gunfight and hammer down harder,2023-04-05
"that’s an interesting thought definitely gives some realism to why he can so many hits from cars 

i know there’s a type of boxing technique where you snap your head back while a punch hits you to lessen the damage so that makes sense",2023-03-25
this is really all it is it looks really bad onscreen but in reality if you know how to fall correctly you can mitigate a lot of damage thats why he can take all this abuse but a few wellplaced bullets actually hurt him the only thing were truly suspending disbelief for is keanu reeves being a master of martial arts and having impeccable aim and timing,2023-03-29
those suits are made of pure vibranium,2023-04-02

man no joke  the theater i went to had it so loud it was difficult to enjoy during any extended scenes with music and gunfirewhich was many scenes obviously  i knew it would be too loud in the opening scene with john was punching the wood block and it hurt my ears with each connection  i felt like a fussy old man leaving the theater but i said something to the manager on the way out ive absolutely been to imax movies before and it was never cranked this loud  he just said some cheesy buzzwords big picture big sound and said they dont change the settings which are set to a certain specification  thats all well and good but im reasonably certain the owners can change overall sounds volume and likely do for opening weekends on blockbusters  my ears are still ringing louder and are uncomfortable from the movie last night,2023-03-26
no,2023-03-25
have watched action films from every era possible and i don’t think i disagree… and i’m pretty sure dead reckoning is about to top it,2023-03-24
the bathroom fight and final fistfight both on the cliff and in the cottage in fallout are absolutely john wick level,2023-03-24
"mission impossible is about insane stunts a throwback to big hollywood blockbusters

john wick is about insane stuntmen a throwback to the small wuxia films but with a hollywood budget",2023-03-29
pre fallout i’d agree but the bathroom fight cliffside brawl and final showdown between ilsa and solomon lane are as well choreographed and thrilling to watch as any of the fisticuffs in wick,2023-03-24
" but the handtohand combat is far superior in john wick

not even close john wick fights are all the exact same magic cloth protects bullets grab guy and roll around on the ground shoot nearby guy shoot wrestling buddy move on repeat 400x roll credits

in mission impossible you actually feel like somethings at stake",2023-03-25
the hand to hand combat in this movie is like watching a kid clash their action figures though one party cant get hurt no matter how hard the opponents try,2023-04-01
handtohandgunfu is far superior in wick everything else is superior in mi no wrong answers and both have great merits but mi is certainly more diverse in action,2023-03-26
honestly only the first two john wicks were a cut above these last two werent nearly as remarkable and as others have said fallout had some wildly impressive fight scenes,2023-03-24
i mean who’s gonna disagree i love reeves he’s a talented dude doesn’t have nearly the range cruise does you can see it in the franchises wick is a singular character hunt is much more dynamic,2023-03-29
i agree ,2023-03-24
were also getting fast and furious x this year and while thats a different and less serious type of action theyre still generally great summer action flicks its gonna be a good year,2023-03-25
the arche scene is the perfect blend of setpiece and gun fu inventiveness,2023-03-24
"you think mission has all sorts of creative camera direction i mean they have to just to film some of the ridiculous stunts cruise does the shot of him jumping out of the airplane that the cameraman did by jumping out backwards is the first that comes to mind but also the way mcquarrie films the chase scenes and whatnot are impressive too though maybe not as flashy 

i do think that wick having the most recent movie is going to mean it has the most flashiest thing one aspect no one’s mentioned that i’ll concede is that wick has the smaller budgets and that’s key",2023-03-24

"eh no one gives a  what religion tom cruise is other than reddit and twitter

i mean my parents are extremely offline and i was actively disallowed from watching anything with tom cruise in it when i was a kid because of him being a scientologist nutbar the first thing i ever saw him in was mission impossible 3 and i had to pretty much sneak it behind their backs

i feel like people are really quick to declare any opinion that they dont like to only exist on reddit or twitter regardless of whether thats actually the case

e guess i  off sea org get your hubbard bucks im muting this",2023-03-24
"eh no one gives a  what religion tom cruise is other than reddit and twitter

"the system didnt force him to get back into work because of the dog it was entirely personal

if he killed every high table member theyd just find new ones like it was said in the film john dying makes him into a saint which is way worse for the table thats why the marquis wanted to  the idea of a john wick",2023-03-24
"his death meant more than people are aware of he challenged the high table and won he died a martyr and now people know the high table can be beaten there are people fighting against them new york and osaka for example the harbinger says it best if the marquis loses it will be catastrophic for the high table because he couldnt  the idea of john wick

this ending was perfect john dies but the idea lives on",2023-03-24
"i think they foreshadowed the taking down of the high table in the future with how the older guy said “if wick wins the table is weakened” or something like that 

i think wick is dead but it’s easy to retcon “his name was dead” or “we faked it to help him move on”",2023-03-24
i think thats what makes the film good though  you cant beat the system  like they said he can  the marquis theyll just appoint another  he can the elder and there will just be another  it is a parallel of capitalism in our own society,2023-03-24
"you sir just pitched the one sequel concept i could actually get behind

in my mind john didnt actually physically die at the end but they held his funeral because hes effectively dead to them and that whole world  the john wick identity had to be laid to rest to keep any remaining vengeanceseekers from coming after him

hes now retired as he originally intended spending his days working on a classic car walking his dog and quietly mourning his wife and the life he never got to have  doing little acts of penance here and there and keeping his head down  he put up a good fence and a security system to keep drunken russian monsters from accidentally stumbling into his path again  

but try as he might something keeps nagging at him from the back of his mind  he cant find peace and it takes a former acquaintance stumbling into his life one day to reveal to him what it is that world still exists and it is still out there destroying lives  and he wont be able to rest until its torn down",2023-03-29
that isnt real life i like the way they did it much better it is a hard enough sell that john wick killed as many as he did but having him actually be able to eradicate an entire global conspiracy organization single handedly eh the way this film ended retrospectively added more weight to all previous films because each injury and energy expended start to matter more knowing where it ends instead it just him being actually indestructible,2023-03-26
" the best ending they could have ever given him was him going after the high table themselves 

i dont see this being discussed but it really seems like thats what chapter 3 was setting up and they scrapped it for this movie with what happened to winston and the bowery in 3 it seemed like they were setting up a complete revolution of the whole assassin world especially with the whole high table vs nyc theme 3 had going

him dying in this with virtually nothing changed and everyone else going back to the way they were before felt a bit unsatisfying to me what exactly was he fighting for throughout these final three movies

i did still enjoy it overall though",2023-03-29
they cant do that because itd end the franchise and they have several spinoffs planned,2023-03-24
did anything in the last four movies give you any indication that john wick is an administrator and a team player,2023-03-25
thats what i expected 4 to be in all honesty john hunting down the entire high table with his allies having another single big bad in the marquis was a little bit of a let down in that sense but then again all the talk of it being a many headed hydra kind of explains why they didnt go that way as satisfying as it wouldve been to see,2023-03-28
i thought that at first too but then you realize that the table is based off of real crime families and if the boss dies theyre replaced and hed have to wipe out thousands of people across multiple continents and even then chances are more heads of the hydra would just keep popping up,2023-03-26

as if in any world  someone wouldnt be like  these guys and their rules

john  and the osaka and winston conintenals showed its not that hard to take down the high tables goons

"i agree i missed the first scene so i assumed he was going to go and  the high table 

this ending fell flat for me and begs the question of what was the point of the entire film plot wise when he couldve offed the french  then been killed in the beginning same result 

anyway still loved it",2023-04-01
"he found freedom and peace in death if you wanna get spiritual with it you can even say he was reunited with his wife 

he went on a global killing spree hunting down people in positions of power those people had families and loved ones john would have to constantly look over his shoulder even if the high table was gone ie caine",2023-04-30
who,2023-03-25
john takes on some role at the continental  hes protected and happy the end,2023-04-01

next movie john wick will face his greatest enemy yet cte,2023-05-24
agreed he sounded weary to the depths of his soul which i believe utterly after watching these four movies,2023-03-26
he was kind of like this in the recent matrix movie as well very odd,2023-03-31
this one was about six months after chapter 3,2023-03-26
"i really do believe its a character choice  john has taken so much physical abuse over the course of this movie after only a few months to recover from the previous installments  hes a swollen mass of pain and scar tissue and emotionally dead by this point 

opening his mouth to speak at all hurts him not only physically but at a spiritual level",2023-03-29
"i get what you mean but if you watch interviews he has done promoting the movie he seems have normal tone and cadence 

i think he is just taking this schtick that he has had since the matrix and running with it because at this point him talking normally might seem weird",2023-03-27
i have a super exaggerated impression of john wick that i do for my friends  keanu in jw4 sounds like someone doing an exaggerated impression of my impression its just silly and weird,2023-04-19
"i disagree with this the first film has more emotions from john because hes still accustomed to being out hes fresh off a life where he could afford to show emotions and do things besides killing him getting less and less emotional during the series shows that hes sinking further back into the lifestyle that had him as a coldblooded killer johns back to being a robot with the sole mission of killing whoever he needs to

thats just my take anyway",2023-03-24
"“and your son stole that from me killed that from me a lot of people have been asking if i’m back and i haven’t really had an answer but now yeah im thinking im back” 

major props to the actor that played viggo too because his nonchalant attitude and then realizing the boogeyman was after him was awesome",2023-03-25
weird felt in line with the character stoic and laconic,2023-03-27
i think this is getting to why i feel the ending is a bit ambiguous i kind of feel like something about the ending was a touch anticlimactic and now that i think of it it could have been his delivery and lack of emotion maybe john wick was just tired or they kept it open for a new one in a few years,2023-05-12
"it felt like an snl parody of john wick or something 

i weirdly didn’t hate it it just felt like they leaned into his strange cadence a little more since if anyone had to try to “sound like john wick” they would sound like that",2023-03-24
not the fact it has been a long week for john,2023-03-24

wouldnt that make him ryan gosling,2023-04-01
i really got the feeling that they don’t know what the next move will be keanu is almost 60 he may not want to continue with these hugely physical projects they left it open for him to return or him to die they gave us a few interesting side characters who could become the new main characters if necessary too,2023-03-24
"its crazy what theyre doing with this series  i and probably most other people went into chapter 3 fully expecting it to be the end of the series because hey trilogies  i got to the end just to realize that nope theres going to be more  then i went into this one expecting that it wont be the end because how many quadrilogies are there out there not counting the trilogies that got a random sequel 20 years later  not many

i honestly dont know what to think  if this is the end to john wicks story great  im satisfied  i know theres more to this universe that well be exploring in the continental and ballerina and there could be dozens more spinoffs  but if we end up getting a john wick 5 and 6 and 7 etc ill be perfectly fine with that too",2023-03-24
"i’m fine if he’s dead but i also don’t think they quite completed his arc of “what would you be if you weren’t a killer” it didn’t feel like a full redemption 

but maybe that’s too hard at this point after 4 movies of killing bigger and bigger bad guys maybe he has to save someone in 5 maybe he has to not  people",2023-03-25

i have no idea what he wants the money for though his notebook had 485 million circled in it i feel like theres a reason we just dont know it,2023-03-26
yea im also trying to  ppl to afford a big house on the lake but its not working so far,2023-04-09
i had this exact same thought i just watched the movie,2023-03-27
yeah they can easilly name the next film something like akira a john wick story,2023-03-28
dont need but i want more john wick,2023-03-25
i wouldnt mind a john wick 5 if it focuses on his legacy and characters introduced in this just dont bring back john wick himself make the story about him and what he did but please dont make it so that he faked his death,2023-04-02
i also think they needed to make it even more personal for winston hes not a coward nor is he a turncoat hes aggrieved,2023-03-24
even though charon was the third main character hes also the least useful out of johns allies so killing him made the most sense cant  winston for obvious reasons although id have been  stunned if they had done in a good way and the bowery king can get john in and out of countries like hes running a  airline,2023-03-25
forever in our hearts and ears,2023-03-24
yeah and where were all the guy walking around selling heineken,2023-03-27
they have an entire fully unexplored assassin universe you could make countless new plots with that imo i imagine they will make a prequel series of john wick coming up in the assassin world as a green newbie and slowly building a reputation,2023-03-25
yeah but he beat the high table so faking his death after escaping the whole assassin world is redundant its much better if hes actually dead,2023-03-24
" not saying he isnt but it could have been faked so he can finally have peace 

i kinda understand that but did not make sense to have winston and bowery there saying yup hes finally dead he really is dead",2023-03-24
he was referring to if he either went to heaven or  not that he’s dead,2023-03-24

a change of shot reveals that the hooded figure is akira who clearly wants to take revenge she walks towards him the last shot being her knife flicking out as the flowerholding caine detects her in front of him and it cuts to black",2023-03-24

" these guys could clearly write another five of these

you see i dont feel like they can john wick 3 and now 4 have sort of confirmed for me that the writers really didnt know where to take the story beyond john being hunted by the high table for killing santino in jw2 thats not to say its bad writing but they did sort of paint themselves into a corner by ending jw2 the way they did 

but the problem didnt start with the ending of jw2 it started with the story for jw3 i honestly think they should have combined the story for jw3 and jw4 together the first half is john on the run the second half is john fighting to get to the duel at some point they were gonna run out of ideas of where to take the story theres barely four films worth of story here already let alone nine or ten films worth of story 

and thats not to mention the action scenes how do they keep the films fresh and exciting when each film goes bigger and bolder than the previous film when it comes to the action again at some point they were gonna run out of unique ideas for the action scenes theres only so many ways you can make a gunfight or fist fight or sword fight or car chase feel fresh 

i honestly think the best thing for keanu and chad could do now is just focus on the spinoffs and end the john wick series on a high note than trying to top the last one lets face chad can write his own ticket now and ill be there day one for whatever projects he does after this im really excited for his rainbow six film one thing will be for certain the action is gonna be awesome",2023-03-25
"exactly its better to go out on top as one of the best action series of all time then rolling the dice on john wick 58 and eventually going too far

though i thought there was talk of a fifth one at one point so maybe they decided to call the game now and combine ideas they had for 5 with 4 could explain the longer run time",2023-03-24
for me it was when king asked do you think hes in heaven or  and winston said who knows and they smirked at each other like they know something,2023-03-24
yeah when the dog suddenly perked up and looked off screen i thought they would reveal john still being alive,2023-03-24

its like a reverse 4th wall break",2023-03-24

yeah,2023-04-03
if you told me this information in jw 1 i would have merely dismissed it as a crackpot theory but now its going to be my goto explanation for whatever crazy shenanigans that happen,2023-03-25
"what a disappointing and meaningless end to his character arc died to save caine in a duel john himself requested knowing full well the marquis could appoint a challenger in his place and already had caine working for him all in order to grant his freedom from the organization he was fighting against so to die right after you gain your freedom is pointless he could have died in the beginning and saved everyone in osaka now hes dying to save a man who he knows is targeted by akira everyone who died along the way was a waste if he is going to accept death why did he endanger so many people around him

i think you were absolutely right about changing the original story to continue the universe in spinoffs maybe keanu didnt want to do it anymore either 

i read an interview with the director and he said that the excess of the fights was part of a gag that the audience is in on the humor of the ridiculous nature of the drawn out fights he mentioned how he wanted to subvert expectations with killa running away from john and not just starting a fight but then he ultimately fights john so that doesnt work 

from the interview i read it sounded like the director wasnt taking it too seriously and just wanted to have fun which is fine but its further proff that this franchise has gone into fast and furious territory where the writers and crew just want to make an over the top action movie instead of presenting a realistic depiction of this criminalassassin world i think the progression of the franchise is following fast and furious very closely with each installment getting more and more unrealistic until we have caine sword fighting some henchmen on the moon this isnt the direction i wanted for john wick as the films were enjoyable to me specifically because they tended to avoid the absurd action movie tropes though admittedly chapter 2 started to dip its toes into unrealistic and chapter 3 doubled down now chapter 4 makes 3 looks better 

as for john being dead regardless of what anyone says the character will come back when needed they went out of their way to not show a dead body only winston and the king at his grave the dog perked up wintson refusing to answer if hes in heaven or  and then they both laugh hes dead until they need him for the box office i wouldnt be surprised if he pops up in an after credits scene of whatever comes next neo died in matrix 3 and they found an excuse to dust him off for a 4th im certain we will get an old man wick movie in 68 years after some of the spinoffs fail to capture the magic",2023-03-26
grass growing on his grave indicating it was never dug  just saying,2023-03-28
just wanted to let you know i walked out of the theater feeling exactly the same way i was honestly stunned to see the reviews that praised the movie cinematography was undoubtedly amazing but everything else that makes john wick movies actually good was thrown out the window in particular that arc d’triomphe car battle sequence is where the movie officially lost me completely,2023-04-07
"just to a point of the adjudicator it seems that this part of the story is where things elevated past what the adjudicator does the marquis is the prime adjudicator if you will given the leeway to do as needed to  jw with the elder being dead as opposed to the other one

yeah it was kind of dumb to see a different elder and not get the ring back as someone mentioned before it felt like a loose end to tie up from the 3rd as he is now healed

so from a lot of your posts i get it your ability to want to enjoy the movie is tied to its believable action sequences and zero plot holes  there are some things i agree with some i dont  and i dont necessarily think that all of these are dumb",2023-03-30
thanks from me too for writing this out i very much enjoyed the movie but  i always come to reddit to find a comment which would put my uneasy feelings into words and your assessment was that this time the flaws you point out are valid and sometimes it took me out from immersion because of how dumb some of them looked for me the constant hiding behind the suit was too much the dog attacks got boring the 3rd time and you could see from miles away that the tracker will end up on johns side because of the dog the movie was interestingly less bloodybrutal than the previous movies no gut wrenching deaths only the usual action movie quick deaths did someone count the 3 minutes from the bottom of the stairs it felt more anyway i enjoyed it but the first two was the highpoints of the franchise,2023-04-10

its actually going to be a ff and marvel crossover jw is genetically enhanced with wolverines super powers,2023-05-25
hahah exactly hes pretty much his character from rogue one maybe he used the force to read the cards,2023-05-23
the problem i have with the changing of the killing the high table plot is that it would still be possible to make spinoffs or continue the story after john accomplished that after the high table is defeated there would be struggles for power and legions in the underworld something else would come up who knows we dont even know what the usual work looks like in this underworld like why are the assassins needed its never explored like others have said good action movie but   john wick movie,2023-04-16
i was literally struggling to stay awake during the osaka art room fight i was so tempted to skip ahead just wave after wave of the same stuff i think only a single bad guy realized you can shoot through glass ,2023-10-14
"the suits are the point

the point being making the fights look  great point and sure driven home hard",2023-11-04
i didnt notice any cg in the last act aside from the final green screen and one bad green screen isnt going to sully the thrill ride that was the previous 2hrs35 minutes of the film lol,2023-04-03
"fwiw i definitely agree on the bulletproof suits the choreography was generally great though some of the grapples looked odd or awkward but i wasn’t entertained much because the action lacked the brutality and efficiency that i think defined a lot of the earlier movies 

it just went on and on and because of the suits there is no tension and it’s weird that out of hundreds of bullets not a single one hit his hand or face it was also hilarious in the stair scenes several times he’s standing on a step reloading or looking around and you see bullets hitting the street lights and such and not a single one even glances him and he wasn’t even trying to hide or duck at all ignoring all the suspension of disbelief of the carsfalls etc 

regardless 90 of the fighting is holding his arm to his face and shooting the nunchucks were great but the shooting scenes besides hotline miami were exhausting and i had already scene hours of this in the entire series felt creativity in previous movies was a lot better not saying it was all slosh there were some entertaining moments but definitely not seeing it as some action piece masterpiece that some think it is oh well",2023-03-26
i think its because they take place in the exact same spot and not much else happens theyre very repetitive and so everything becomes a blur,2023-03-25
keanu rosetinted glasses maybe,2023-03-28
or maybe they just have different opinions lol,2023-04-03
i completely feel the same like is it the hype since it’s brand new or something i do not trust these peoples judgement if they don’t see the problems with this movie,2023-03-26
,2023-04-02
its the details that have the charm if it makes you question how did they do it its akin to a magic trick but when taken shortcuts even the most elaborate choreography feels shoddy i know maintaining congruency is hard when shooting over several days or several locations but fcking forgetting headlights is lazy af,2023-03-26
yeah i got that part when i was initially watching it but assumed otherwise since john seemed to have survived much worse getting to the place so to me it didnt really feel like i was watching a dying mans last moments,2023-04-03

that showdown between koji and caine removed all my doubts with stahelski directing ghost of tsushima also the beautiful cinematography and the vibrant color palette during the whole osaka sequence really matches among what i expect from the got movie that’ll make it a success,2023-03-27
there are tropes like that in old martial arts movies too considering its donnie yen thats more likely the influence,2023-03-26
it wasnt anime it was zatoichi,2023-03-25
"i agree with you to me the first half of the movie was more upclose and not as gun heavy and i thought donnie and hiroyuki were both great in these moments but keanu looked slow and a lot of the hand to hand combat early on looked scripted obviously it is scripted but good fight cinematography hides that

too often it felt like people we waiting for keanu to recover a more recent gold standard is a movie like the raid where its just relentless brutal and doesnt come off as fighters working through a dance

the 2nd half of the movie is a lot more gunplay and i thought it came off significantly better visually the setting of japan was awesome but the fighting in this portion left me a little disappointed",2023-03-26
have you watched any japanese or east asian in general cinema outside of anime,2023-03-24

post first movie everything went to sideways with suit over the top blunt force trauma over the top gun scenes and zero plot moving forward imo they could’ve made john came close or even killing one of the table explore how the table was so influential how the police generally stayed out to give audience a sense of forward motion 

this 4th instalment greatly underutilised bill as the main villain imo could’ve made him more over the top ambitious desire to rival napoleon more cunning more sadistic but he was flat rich white spoiled kid with no charistimatic viggo to balance out 

still i enjoyed it somewhat",2023-03-25
jw1 has a lot of subtlety in the beginning as they build up who he is,2023-03-24
well to each their own i personally loved the fight sequences but i get where youre coming from the gun fight sequences felt a little too long and repetitive sometimes so maybe thats why you didnt like it so much also yeah i have seen ip man and it is one of my favourite martial arts films,2023-03-24

thats still not what objectively means lol,2023-03-24
this might blow your mind but we have these things called “opinions” and everyone has different ones and none are right or wrong,2023-04-07
lol thats your reason that is literally guessing bro no wonder nobody noticed  its not like caine did anything to find wick bro literally just guessed and got it right first try,2023-03-25
the weird thing is that the elder just feels like such a pointless character since moments after john kills him winston is told that the twelve members of the high table granted the marquis war powers so he can finally  john the way they tell it in jw3 they make it seem like hes the head of the high table but in jw4 hes killed off and the high table is still a massive threat its very confusing as to what his role actually is,2023-03-25
yeah jw4 feels like a complete celebration of the genre the good the bad and the  was why he chose to have a main trio of characters for the film plus mr nobodys character is very inspired by the man with no name and all the duel stuff is very leone stahelski also cited barry lyndon as a influence for the duel and the epic scale and then theres all the other homages to lawrence of arabia the warrios the killer zatoichi sammo hung the radio station being named wuxia and on and on,2023-03-24
people are arguing with me that he is dead and its finalbut considering the amount of money that this movie will make lol he will be back,2023-03-27
ah i thought it was about this movie i hardly remember anything from jw3 but the video doesnt work sadly but what does the doctor say that john should be shot in those places he gets shot at,2023-03-26
you still can make it in a way where its not a call of duty port for the cinema,2023-04-23
first movie was low level goons these are top level assassins almost on johns level which explains them all having the suits,2023-04-01
yes i am depending on the wager,2023-03-29
well they kinda are meant to be superhero comic book styles in the sense of the world etc there is kevlar suits ,2023-03-26
"i can kind of forgive him being stronger in the beginning they do show jw training in the other movies he had been living a normal life with his wife for years and was out of shape in this movie i think they hinted at him having trained back into shape but that training scene is done pretty lazily and forgettable like just some shots of him hitting a pole with a rope wrapped around it

outside of that the fights were indeed lazy and repetitive though just send in small wave after small wave like 24 people at a time of mostly faceless mooks like some terrible version of wh vermintide",2023-05-25
they got their physics from videogames,2023-04-23
"technically correct i am wrong but can you see where im coming from 


we dont see him follow john anywhere  he appears at the places john is at when hes in the most danger at a convenient time


id argue that character was created as a deus ex machina  john is here how do we get him out they know that  is unsatisfying so they just let us know that hey guys our protagonist can get himself in unwinnable situations unlike the last movies because we wrote a character that will show up and save him 100 we didnt name him he has no past no future no story he has no personal emotional or motivational beats other than dog owner he exists purely to save john and even when he gets dragged into the plot a little more with the knife hand scene he still just shows up randomly in the correct place at the correct time to take the correct shot


only character actually using a ranged weapon at range he just breaks so many of the fun rules the franchise setup to make the action good can find john better than the godlike abilities of the high table john has never noticed this weird guy following him around with a dog when hes globe trotting he basically a  from the machine",2023-03-24
one more here i had to sort by controversial to find you but i found you one of the most boring films i have seen in a long time,2023-04-03
ive got to rewatch — did it sound like any particular region of france to you especially for an aristocrat or was it more general than that,2023-03-24
really valid point i got a similar vibe too i noticed a lot of scenes where a henchman couldve  gun or some something but instead kept falling around on the floor or took a second long to get back up the dancers not caring reminded me of the train station goers not caring at the end of the 3rd movie the fight scenes looked nice in this movie but they felt really surreal at times,2023-03-24

"theres probably something in the rules that lets the first take the place of his second the marquis did say he invoked the coup de grace rule so im assuming that means the first can tell the second to move aside he is taking over now

all we saw was john wick passing out on the stairs then we see a gravestone theres no proof he died my guess is he faked his death so that some new arbitrary rule could not be created by the high table to draw him back in or some person from his past with a marker could not force him to do their bidding",2023-03-26
i dont think clancy browns character was the marquis man i think he was a representative from the high table,2023-03-26

"what do you mean at worst they damaged a few cars but let’s be real in that world they probably have insurance coverage specifically for damage caused from assassins

yeah totally get it but me personally i really enjoyed leaning into some live action anime type beat i think he lived when he shouldn’t have in those too so i don’t feel totally betrayed but yeah he was getting into super hero territory,2023-06-11

if youre going to watch just one id recommend watching 2 most of the worldbuilding necessary to understand the new one is in 2,2023-03-24
then the card game scene what ever yens character couldve easily just shot wick and walked out,2023-03-26
his book is just a notebook showing that he knows about things like the marquis and the ruska roma he needs 50 million to buy his way out of service to the high table but decides to go for johns bounty when it gets to 40 million presumably because he thinks he can get the rest from easier bounties,2023-03-26
sure but it accomplished nothing plot wise which is why you write scenes in movies   john just killed him 15 mins after we met him so it had zero affect on the narrative   if they referenced later in the movie that would have been cool but it was pure throwaway,2023-03-26
so slow that most people are thinking “what is this season about” and we only have 4 episodes left,2023-03-27
the pistol is made by taran tactical specifically for this movie and was kept under wraps here’s their website,2023-03-29
no they cant just because its a trope doesnt mean all tropes work in all settings john wick is too good to have difficulty fighting a blind guy nothing about this blind person explains his capability for being able to keep up hes like actually blind not superpower blind guy,2023-03-29
i’m one with the force the force is with me,2023-03-29
oh i am aware of the trope its just doesnt work in this setting at all this dude is actually blind blind not like he has all his other senses sharpened like daredevil blind hes blind blind john wick can take on 35 soldiers and win out hes killing a blind guy very easily,2023-03-29
yes,2023-03-29
not in the first one,2023-04-02
not sure whether i want his return to be like that or back as the main characteraction star,2023-04-03
"i dont really have any theories outside the age rating in germany this movie had a 18 rating which is the highest one the raid 2 was also shown in cinemas here uncensored so at least here they wouldnt have had to censor anything

i would hate a watered down john wick nobody needs that when i watched the first venom movie all i could think of is how badly the venom character would need an 18 rating and show us the brutality that this character clearly has in mind i think venom would be a perfect candidate for a brutal and violent 18 movie but its not gonna happen and yeah i didnt watch venom 2 

one movie i didnt expect to love as much was logan and you know why because for once we got the violence",2023-04-03
"i mean yeah any story that ends with the death of a character would have ended the same way for that character if they just killed themselves on page 1

i agree it wasnt a happy ending for john everyone he met told him the only way he could be free was in death and thats what ended up happening give or take a few minutes it was a great story though imo and i think this death was a fitting end for his character

as for the rest of the john wick world i also agree that theres definitely more to tell and im looking forward to it through other characters",2023-03-27
well it was scott adkins,2023-04-05
"yeah its hard to care or be invested in a character that comes out of nowhere has no backstory no motivations no connection to the main story has almost no defining presence or characteristics doesnt even have many action sequences and is stylistically different from all other characters in terms of wardrobe dialogue and acting 

especially when we are also introduced to at least 7 or 8 other side characters in the same movie who all at least check a few of those boxes",2023-03-25
imo thats some bs if it wasnt caine then marquis second would get shot too thats what the stakes were that only john or only caine can walk away not both,2023-03-27
hes not had to shoot at others on horseback until now in chapter two he was the only one on a horse the others were on motorcycles,2023-03-24
yeah i agree also though i dont think john will be actually dead for good  i think they will make it that he faked death  keanu reeves said yesterday in an interview it was left open for a glimmer of hope  wouldnt be surprised if they did one final oneto address the glaring holes,2023-03-27
to be fair he didn’t agree to  him but said “i understand” when she asked him to take revenge,2023-03-27
did you mean subjectively,2023-03-24
if you said subjectively this comment would hold up a bit more…,2023-04-09
was the no quarter part about to the death,2023-03-25
but he already is that he sees everything anyway why not keep his vision and not make it too ridiculous at this point he felt more like blinkin from men in tights,2023-03-27
but thats literally caines character already so powerful it gets ridiculous,2023-03-27
yeah his death is pretty ambiguous anyways,2023-03-26
i wrote as well that implies that i wish he was rested with his wife and dog,2023-03-29
some people would seek him out regardless probably,2023-03-29
ooh i see what you mean challenging italian guy to a duel instead of killing him in the continental huh thats interesting yeah seems like a  haha,2023-03-31

his reward was that he was exempt from any and all duties to the high table no he wouldn’t have to serve them,2023-03-26
i’m black and mexican 0 white your comment was incredibly distasteful and saying you’re mexican so it’s okay and calling me a  is doubling down on stupidity obviously you deleted your comment for a reason maybe consider why you responded so defensively doubled down still deleted your comment and didn’t acknowledge anything i was saying to you instead of simply listening and using the slightest bit of selfawareness i only just now saw your reply ,2023-04-15
its not you need to sort by controversial,2023-03-24
enjoy it come back to tell what you thought about it xd,2023-03-24
although ive seen each of the first three films at least twice i really dont remember 2 or 3 very well the final hour of 4 is almost nonstop action and a huge chunk of the first two hours is action as well i assume the new one has the most kills i checked the clock on my phone to calculate how much time was left when i felt like the movie seemed to be reaching the conclusion and there was still another hour left,2023-03-24
"ah ok it’s your fan theory because he’s definitely not his father 

i thought from the first 2 films he’d transpire to be helen’s father ",2023-03-26
i got it im saying he had no impact on the plot and that he was put here just to have something to carry on with the franchise now that john wick isnt there anymore,2023-03-31
id have to go back and see but did he even know what the cards were i only remember him chuckling wryly and placing them on the table then the german guy identifying them,2023-03-25
"because winston dying if john lost was a part of the deal that bill included it’s not a normal part of the duel

he couldn’t  bill heh because caine was fighting as his champion so to say but when caine delivered what bill thought was the final blow he took over as the duelist to finish the job",2023-04-01
"you havent seen two movies since the first and somehow the fact that the fourth one doesnt make sense is because its like a child wrote it

more like a  childs logic here ",2023-03-24
well youve sort of solved it  its sort of ambiguous in a way where people can disagree on whether or not its ambiguous but the truth is effectively based on whether or not keanu decides to do a 5th movie if he doesnt then he dies in 4 if he does then the easiest thing in the world would be to write a sequel that says he survived,2023-03-25
pretty convincing shot of him passing out and telling winston to take him home not bury him and the dog sensing john at end of movie  ohand winston having the crest of johns house on his hand at end lol,2023-03-26
john wick 5 announced today offically,2023-05-26
"he represents the damage john has done to the high table

x200b

id agree if not for the knife in the hand scene that clearly showed that nobody actually had no control over marquis at all him bargaining is just marquis plans crumbling",2023-03-28
if that was the whole point it missed its mark but in their defense a bunch of stunt people made this movie so i cant expect sophisticated depth of story telling all i got out of that character was hey im an assassin too like cool,2023-03-29
"in the 3rd movie some guy from his past pulls out a marker and forces him to  someone which leads to john killing him in the hotel and invoking the wrath of the high table

in the 4th movie he has to deal with the high table not only that he is forced to rejoin the group he used to work for and even if he wins the duel he might have to work for them for the rest of his life

i think john realized the only way he could get out of this life was to fake his death then nobody could make him work for them anymore not the high table not the group he rejoined not someone from his past with a marker",2023-03-26
he was going to die that’s the only way to end this  he kills bill then there will be another and another that comes after him the point since jw2 was to get his freedom he finally received it honorably,2023-03-25
"i get what you mean

that being said he did  the the shot caller right at the beginning of the movie but it changed nothing as it was stated in the movie the elder and also the high table for that matter are like a hydra chop off one head and another one grows in its place so instead he had to use their own rules against them

and yes many people died because of john wick then again thats been the running theme throughout all of the movies hes not a hero hes an antihero at best a ruthless mass murderer at worst",2023-03-25
im your dad,2023-03-24
he got hit by cars and fell off of a building in the previous movies…,2023-03-25
jesse what the  are you talking about,2023-03-24
i dont see why i need to accept either of these two extreme interpretations he was blind but obviously highly skilled at combat and had to shoot someone he knew the dimensions of down a known straight line hitting random parts of johns upper body makes complete sense in the logic of the story,2023-03-27
yep john wick 3 wounds with the doctor not dying of wounds,2023-03-27
there are some similarities for sure but i wouldnt call it a ripoff imo the story and setting are less interesting than the matrix but the action is top notch,2023-03-28
i mean john killed a lot of people in the span of a few weeks  caine was also relieved from debts and akira went after him for revenge  you dont really get out of the assassin life unless people think youre dead  as we saw with the marquis despite all the rules not everyone in that society is honorable,2023-04-01
oh nice catch i havent seen warriors in years so completely forgot about that connection,2023-05-26
or you could just tell me would have taken the same time i can guarantee im not too young given the reddit demographics,2023-05-16
glad they got to tell their whole story plus the spinoff will probably be fun too its such a rich world they could make this go for a while,2023-03-26
i want some prequels and history on this whole hightable assassin continental,2023-04-02
honestly the first couple sequences and the osaka continental could’ve easily been its own movie but i prefer what we got here,2023-04-02
"totally makes sense

if you assume big assumption that their plans for 4 and 5 stayed relatively the same changing a few details of course and they just mixed them together into this movie you can easily see different setpieces that they could have cut at

osaka is a movieender already in terms of setpiece quality if you told me a draft of jw4 ended with john beating caine in osaka as the final boss i could absolutely believe it berlin ending with john reinstated into the family and challenging a high table member to a duel is a movieending plot point john fighting his way through paris could be expanded easily and made into multiple setpieces with differing styles and could make up much of a movie already",2023-04-04
"and most recently bullet train

late to the party but ooooooh  okay that does make a lot of sense",2023-06-20
wiki says a lot of things,2023-03-27
speaking of i need to find that paint it black cover,2023-03-26
makes sense because i was exhausted too,2023-05-26
i do love when you die in the arkham games and one of the thugs is like holy  i killed batman must be amazing to be that guy,2023-03-26
that would actually be a great plot twist for a movie have the henchmen get tired of seeing their buddies be sent out as cannon fodder  turn on the villain,2023-03-28
wasnt nadine literally like this at the end of 4,2023-05-29
according to fallen kingdom that could buy you like four dinosaurs,2023-04-17
the only movie i think does this well is the gray man where they show news stories about the shootouts and police showing up most just ignore the fallout and assume like a massive multi armed shootout with dozens dead that lasts like 20 minutes with no police showing up is just normal lol,2023-11-21
they reminded me of storm troopers too and oddly i think id confidently say john wick would  any number of storm troopers theyd throw at him  maybe even darth vader,2023-03-27
they killed the same two asian guys one has a mustache at least 4 times in this movie,2023-04-17
they shouldve had at least one assassin pick up their phone and see the number and look super excited then see the name cough and put their flip phone away and put on headphones,2023-03-24
"one guy at the high table was probably like

look i know he broke the rules but does anyone seem to notice how the only negative consequences seems to be because were going after him for breaking a rule if we left him be none of this would have happened wed be richer by like 100 million 100s maybe even 1000s of well trained body guard would be alive a hotel",2023-03-24
40 million is nothing to a dead person,2023-03-26
tbf i think john is kind of a mythic figure in this universe like yeah he did the impossible task but he retired after most of those npcs probably think thats just some old legend from the order,2023-05-16
this everything escalated after santino pushed john too hard at the point john has to  him on continental ground,2023-04-03
sure but were talking about why bill picked caine and you said he did it to make wick  one of his last friends but if caine died bill would have been killed too,2023-03-29
for real i couldn’t help but think of that scene from always sunny where charlie shows mac that guns beat swords,2023-05-24
you think one of the greatest assassins in the world wouldnt get really good a point shooting once he lost his sight,2023-04-02
its also worth noting that he was not born blind but he gave his eyes to serve the table which means he probably was already very good at shooting before becoming blind its muscle memory especially for shooting straight like nba players shooting free throws with their eyes closed,2023-06-09
blind people still have kinesthetic awareness we all do to some degree you can close your eyes and move your hand and know where it is,2023-06-05
i dont see anyone acting high and mighty though people have responded respectfully to your original comment thats a bit of nuance to consider,2023-04-03
glad someone else picked up the shot placement from parabellum i guess i see way too much evidence of his survival to understand how audiences fall for he died keanu reeves even seemed shocked that people didnt pick up on it in a qa,2023-03-26
but to combat that point the line who cling to death live meant he finally came to terms with dying and being with his wife  those last breaths he gives is all that adrenaline  anger wearing off  he finally let go moved on and was happy,2023-03-28
i think john really is dead as others have mentioned caine is deliberately named that because he killed his brother john he even calls john brother after the duel in a nososubtle nod to his name i guess the ending is considered ambiguous but i took it as final,2023-03-27
i agree may be a few years but we will get one more out of him,2023-03-26
he never really wanted any further vengeance after he killed the guys who killed his dog though  he had no choice because if he didnt  them theyd never stop coming after him but he got his revenge already,2023-03-29
in a few years we will see a movie drop out of nowhere called baba yaga and everyone will flip their  i cant wait,2023-05-12
" i don’t think so where he got hit at between neck and shoulder and left lower side above hip are the same spots the doc told john to shoot to make it “look like he fought back” 

what are you referring to",2023-04-10
i think they purposefully left in such a way he could be dead and it would be a good end to his story but they could easily have him survive with the lore of previous movies backing it up in case they want to make another,2023-05-30
theres like 12 members of the high table so at the least they can milk 12 movies out of this cash cow lol,2023-05-24
wait when did doc tell him that  first movie,2023-05-24
are you talking about cain or wick  wicks death was pretty much confirmed before the credits  i dont think the after credits means that cain is going to die his hearing is pretty  good he might have heard her unsheathing before reaching him  completely plausible he survives,2023-03-26
not sure too many people saw that i just came back from watching it here in germany it was packed but there were maybe 10  15 people still there for the after credit scene,2023-03-25
wait there was an after credits scene,2023-04-05
sanada deserves more than being called as a japanese dude i wish he had more screen time but was great as usual if he wasnt heavily wounded perhaps he wouldnt lose the fight,2023-03-24
if you do a quick google they said they were going to shoot 4 and 5 at the same time thats why im here reading what other ppl think because whatever asspull theyre going to use for the start of 5 is going to ruin what feels to be a complete story at this point,2023-04-16
i couldnt breathe he literally had the family guy death pose,2023-03-24
my screening were howling at the scene  i dont know if its because of laurel and hardy but anything that involves a person or item descending from the top to the very bottom of a flight of stairs just destroys me,2023-03-24
it straight up felt like the hot rod hill scene,2023-03-24
"watching that scene felt like watching link fall after getting knocked off some high cliff in botw but late in the game 

goes down two flights oh maybe  be able to recover nope nope nevermind oh theres a fairy gone and another and another oh more flights of stairs okay well there goes the rest of your fairies oh wait hes stopped rolling

 guy kicks him further down stairs  

oooooh oh but hes finally at the bottom annnnnnnnd hes dead wait miphas grace yeaaaaaa boi",2023-03-25
everyone getting hit by cars and getting back up was great too felt like they were making a point about how little it affected john in the previous films lol,2023-03-25
that scene was so comical  not in a bad way but it made me question if it was intentional or not  the way he just kept tumbling and tumbling i swear sometimes it looked like he specifically accelerated is rolling on the spaces between the stairs,2023-04-06
hello  ive had a bit of a tumble,2023-03-24
those high kicks were impressive,2023-03-25
i had to try my best not to shout out in the cinema during that part go slinky go,2023-03-25
the whole theater broke into laughter,2023-03-25
john wick thrown down stairs vs dicaprio on lemmons rolling down the stairs to his lambo,2023-03-29
"im excited to see that turn into a gaming meme like the chris farley one like the peak can be challenger  gets kicked down to gm then master then diamond its like its fine no more then down more till hes at the bottom 



",2023-03-29
there were a couple moments where you could see keanu throwing himself to the next flight  and i honestly didnt even mind  the dude is so  dedicated,2023-04-15
after falling down 10 flights of stairs i was expecting him to look up and reveal there were actually 2 flights,2023-04-02
read up on sisyphus and his punishment for defying the gods,2023-06-07
in order to inflict damage to john wick one needs to use stairs,2023-04-13
kicked his  badly he went down 8 flights 7 at once,2023-05-26
some aspects of the movie disappointed me since these are specialist assassins trained and some are the best there are out there but couldnt john slow his fall from stairs even a little bit or grab onto something it felt bad but it was also fun but it didnt feel like he roll with it to get less damage like when he jumped over a car but still gets hit,2023-06-18
in one of the earlier fight scenes there’s all the guys with black masks that look exactly the same and then there’s the big huskies all wearing the same grey suit it’s exactly like a video game lol,2023-03-25
you think hes really dead,2023-03-26
i assumed by the time he got to the duel he had so much internal bleeding that the shots really just finished him off,2023-03-26
"it is the responsibility of the movie to keep you  and your friend  in suspension of disbelief

and that is where jw4 failed quite a bit a lot of incredibly beautiful but utterly  scenes",2023-03-27
"yeah super beautiful sets and production but the fight choreographies  and the move from efficiency to ballet  pulled me right out of it at least a handful of times

the amount of times a bad guy stood still for seconds and then just positioned their head to be hit made it look amateurish to me",2023-03-27
it was a big oof but i feel like the  dude from the opening who just wanted to crawl home and regret his life choices while some japanese chick was climbing him with knives was a hard way to die,2023-03-25
the most brutal death was akira climbing up that dudes back with knives as he ascended the stairs imo,2023-03-26
we just got back from watching it my wife and several others let out an audible oooft at that point,2023-03-24
im very disappointed that his death wasnt an asthma attack after john crushes the inhaler just to add a new way for him to  someone,2023-03-30
my whole theater got collective owww on that scene ,2023-03-25
john punching his face for a good twenty seconds just in case hes still alive after all that was hilarious,2023-03-24
don’t forget the tooth extraction ,2023-03-26
rather than being shot in it,2023-03-25
question  was the locked expression on his face accurate for a sudden spinal destruction like that,2023-04-15
perfect way to go though you just know they and scott particularly were like whats the most spot on way to end the big dude all that weight on his head and neck from 30 foot up,2023-08-05
i love how they decided to give him the colin farrell as oswald cobblepot look the man looks completely unrecognizable,2023-03-24
had no idea that was him until the credits rolled  just figured it was some popular german actor i wasnt familiar with   fine job all around creating that character,2023-03-24
i remembered he was in the film but sort of forgot… until he started doing those kicks signature scott adkins kicks,2023-03-25
what  thats him  how is he a better actor in a  suit and prosthetics than in his regular form  i thought he killed it,2023-03-26
"whaaaaat holy  now i see it those filthy kicks make a ton of sense now

this franchise has legit gotten keanu to face some of the best martial art practitioners in the business daniel bernhardt scott adkins donnie yen cecep rahman yayan ruhian mark dacasos ",2023-03-26
i wonder if donnie yen brought him along adkins was the main antagonist in ip man 4,2023-03-25
"oswald cobblepot

i wasnt familiar with the actor before any john wick movies but looked it up before i went to the cinema was pretty funny seeing a stunt actor taking huffs of ventolin puffer",2023-03-25
i was positive it was steve coogan the eyes and  structure underneath the suit really reminded me of him as well as the comedic acting,2023-03-25
what brilliant makeup,2023-03-24
as soon as i saw him i was like theres no way they have scott adkins in this and dont make him an epic fighter so glad he was,2023-03-25
holy  i even said to my buddy after the movie that i need to see who the big dude at the rave was cuz he had some moves no wonder,2023-03-26
did not recognise him but he nailed that role,2023-03-26
no effing way,2023-03-26
i couldve sworn it was the dude from the mummy arnold vosloo or billy zane just because of the eyes lol,2023-04-08
i was sure that was tom hardy,2023-03-26
it was actually actionstar scott adkins wearing a  suit also explains why he looked like he was sweatin a ton before the fight even started lol,2023-03-24
because scott adkins is a ninja irl,2023-03-25
bob from tekken 6,2023-03-29
the way they just kept dancing like npc’s was hysterical,2023-03-24
the extras throughout that nightclub scene were comically bad masses of axe wielding goons are butchered by some devil chasing the 400 pound behemoth of a club owner and the witnesses instead of running away are hugging each other and crying lol,2023-04-13
with no police in sight anywhere,2023-04-04
that reminded me of the old mortal kombat movie those soldiers just firing their weapons inside the club and everyone just keeps dancing ,2023-04-06
i saw few ppl react but then they went right back to dancing it was fun to look for them breaking character,2023-10-22
its a dothraki marriage like situation lol theres gotta be some deaths to make it interesting,2023-03-25
i love how people don’t care at all just makes it all the more surreal,2023-03-25
i swear one of the scenes plays le castlevanias song for one of the shootouts from either 1 or 2,2023-10-20
it’s a saying meaning to cause trouble,2023-03-24
your louisiana is showing ,2023-03-25
one love,2023-03-27
in a movie about a white guy called john,2023-04-03
thank you just edited,2023-03-27
could it possibly be because i was sitting at the end of the row rather than in the center,2023-03-27
 those dragon breath rounds were brutal,2023-03-24
i never played hotline miami but i was still giggling the whole scene the absolute hilarity of just knocking out 20 dudes with fire guns was amazing,2023-03-28
the song that kicks in when hes climbing the stairs after may as well have been ripped right from the game too,2023-03-29
ive never giggled so much in a movie in my life,2023-04-27
i just looked it up on stream  its like a visually darker version of the game    thanks for the references  im going to check the games out,2023-03-28
my first thought too  then when i was thinking of how to describe it to my friends to get them to go i thought i might choose a more popular game like diablo but thats inaccurate  its 100 hong kong massacre,2023-03-26
saaaaaameee,2023-03-28
no but justice and carpenter brut do sound pretty similar,2023-03-24
honestly it’s really an homage to night watch in my opinion,2023-03-24
it’s not always available i just rewatched 2 from itunes  they swapped that for regular closed captions,2023-03-25
just a little bit of fall damage no biggie,2023-03-26
that was his second building he fell off one onto a pole and then onto his face with no damage,2023-04-07
oof ouch owie my bones,2023-03-27
his kevlar suit is pretty much all purpose flame retardant bullet proof and fall proof its so  ridiculous that bullets have been rendered useless in this universe because literally everyone is wearing it its awesome ,2023-05-24
superhot is probably the closest youll get,2023-03-26
theres literally a john wick vr game,2023-03-29
does intravenous work,2023-03-28
immune to all damage except friendly fire,2023-04-07
high dex too,2023-03-24
that sounds so fun,2023-03-29
yes he’s literally invulnerable unless he takes his suit off doesn’t even need to find cover when getting shot at he just tanks all the shots,2023-06-05
will kojima be involved,2023-04-30
"not to mention a  lawrence of arabia reference right at the beginning with the matchstick cut to that unbelievable long lens shot of the four horses against the sun

so many instantly iconic scenes and shots",2023-03-24
wick caine and mr nobody very much had a the good the bad and the  dynamic too,2023-03-27
i mean caine was just what if john wooera chow yunfat became zatoichi,2023-03-26
i felt like the “nowhere to run” song followed by the car chase scenes might have been a nod to edgar wright’s baby driver if they played them over the top of each other it would have been obvious so maybe they split them up on purpose,2023-04-02
what was the taxi driver reference,2023-04-16
also john woo movies with the flight of birds in the background,2023-04-18
"hate or glory was one of my fav  
quite surprised to hear it in the movie",2023-03-24
i literally did the wojak pointing meme when i heard that that song specifically will always be stuck in my mind for how unique and hard it sounds,2023-10-20
loved that needle drop nostalgic in a way but still feels modern and perfectly matched with this series’ aesthetic,2023-03-27
hearing some zhu was nice too,2023-11-29
if only thomas bangalter decided to drop by,2023-03-24
i think it was genesis from justice,2023-03-24
genesis by justice,2023-03-25
francophone,2023-03-26
matters to me thanks for calling that out,2023-03-24
that feeling when it starts off with a montage of some of the most notable sights of dotonbori and people still say tokyo,2023-03-26
i think the osaka continental exteriors and potentially interiors were actually shot in tokyo though  looks a lot like thetokyo national art centre in roppongi,2023-04-23
dragon’s breath is def not a way i want to go,2023-03-24
all we need to know is that its a gun that shoots war crimes wielded by a human meatgrinder,2023-03-25
except that guy was wrong dragons breath shots are filled with magnesium which ignites its not white phosphorus,2023-03-26
theyre not necessarily as cool in real life turns out its really hard to set people on fire with it but they do shoot out the fire theres videos of it on youtube quite a lot of fun to watch,2023-03-26
"final blood

last lol",2023-06-06
if theres one movie i regret not seeing in the theater its fury road,2023-03-28
the one scene in the film where it actually felt like he had unlimited ammo i thought it was a mistake but then i realized the song infinite ammo was playing as well so that felt like a nod to stereotypical gun fights,2023-03-27
i’m glad you mentioned it i was thinking about it during the whole scene lol,2023-03-25
disagree he took every effort to not  people who weren’t a part of the high table he beat up koji’s henchmen instead of stabbingshooting them he gave koji a chance to escape and he specifically didn’t  akita when it would’ve been so easy caine strikes me as a guy who doesn’t actually like killing anymore his contract was for john so that’s the only person he’s going to ,2023-04-01
he didn’t use his sword or gun to finish off any henchmen in osaka he did use them however with everyone else after that,2023-04-02
you can see a clear difference when he was fighting the japanese men vs the other goons he didnt  a single japanese dude but he killed almost every other dude he attacked,2023-04-04
he also was really unhappy to do so,2023-12-16
they were high table enforcers not continental guards,2023-04-01
"yeah the first movie too when john pops the head of the russki kid the translation was it was just a 

what he actually said was иди на хуй idi na hui or go  yourself",2023-03-25
i think the translators localized the translations to make it more fitting for the audience they did something similar in shang chi with the mandarin the chinese is a lot more poetic and proverby but the on screen translation means the same thing but is more poetic in the english sense,2023-03-26
" wuxia radio station

appropriate since ive long felt that john wick is essentially a modern take on the wuxia genre youve got the outlaw john wick themes of revenge conflicts regarding honor the fighters with their own unique code and operating under their own laws fishburnes homeless people network being similar to the beggar sect in wuxia like jin yongs works and of course youve got the badass blind dude",2023-04-02
whats wuxia radio station,2023-12-16
just came back from a screening in malaysia yep that bit got plenty of laughs,2023-04-02
plenty of malaysian know cantonese,2023-03-26
,2023-03-26
im from singapore where many people understand cantonese and when he cursed him out as a cheater the whole theatre roared and then some more when it was repeated,2023-04-08
true the ramen bit and  did get small reactions as well but the dog peeing killed lol the rest of the movie was so exhausting to get through just near constant action that it was nice they spaced a few jokes out to add levity,2023-03-27
"saturday night 1 week after release cinemas was nearly packed and a large majority of them actually clapped when the marquis was shot i was so surprised

also got some great belly laughs and winces such a fun time",2023-04-03
the rock climbing  was so good one of the best ive ever seen has there ever been something similar,2023-03-30
"each to their own i guess but i couldn’t imagine anything worse than people cheering or clapping in the cinema laughter sure can’t help laughter but that’s the line 

british things i guess",2023-04-17

"i interpreted it as john wick is dead but the he is still alive

they also hinted at this with his family scene imo",2023-03-24
"this is the 4 and 5 backtoback in one film thats why its so long those were the precovid and pre matrix delaying the release date plans

everything chad has said recently in interviews denotes that this is the end they wanted but its not like story is that rigid a factor in the jw series so theyll come back when they feel like it and money talks 

i doubt john is dead but them wanting a break and chad having a lot of other projects to get to is probably the bigger reason why jw5 is less likely by the time they feel like getting back to it keanu will probably be in his late 60s and the only way they could go about it is one final old man wick or and a passing of the torch",2023-03-24
those plans were scrapped after covid i feel like they combined 4 and 5 into this film it seems chad is done with it and wants to focus on his other projects now,2023-03-24
i don’t know these movies are known for doing things the right way and having john on the steps mirroring the start of the first film with footage him swimming in memories of his wife kind of a perfect ending would hope him coming back doesn’t take away from that would love to find a couple more dedicated actors an audience can get behind like they do with keanu to continue it on,2023-03-24
" they already had plans to film jw 4 and 5 backtoback 

i assumed they then combined the events into jw4 hence the long runtime",2023-03-24
"i really hope they dont a 5th would feel like toy story 4 sure it could still be good but why spoil a perfect ending

plus keanu cant do this stuff forever",2023-03-24
john wick is the flagship of lionsgate they literally can’t afford to end it,2023-03-24
i’m thinking they blended 4 and 5 together after stihelski and reeves decided to take a break and that john wick dying was originally going to happen at the end of 5,2023-03-24
no way he is dead this has to be something similar to the dark knight rises john’s car is still being repaired and no way they left that out so he probably is living peacefully somewhere else maybe in monaco or something like bruce wayne,2023-03-25
they have it set up so they can explain how hes back and what the film will be about the rat king mentions how he already had a gravestone and his quote made ahead of his death so its to reason wick took that advice and is in hiding after doing the same akira is still alive and got revenge on caine and winston seems to be in the know of where john is,2023-03-25
so fake death and living remotely maybe they will pull an old obi wan  old luke on him,2023-03-25
given the line about where john would end up strongly gives those indications i am inclined to agree,2023-03-24
they better not take long though keanu is aging,2023-03-24
it is possible that the plans were abandoned the ending is fairly unambiguous about his passing,2023-03-25
feels like whatever was supposed to be 4 and 5 came together as just this one epic movie,2023-03-25
after this ending he really should be dead and im saying that as maybe the biggest fan of this franchise,2023-03-26
jw 5 might focus more on akira her storyline was never tied up and caine says  be waiting for her so it definitely seems like theyre going to meet again,2023-03-26
" john wick is dead  thats not him

main baddie you didnt hear  he killed death with his own scythe his own  scythe",2023-03-26
felt a bit like they were setting up shamier andersons character tracker for a hand off or a spin off because of his double act with the dog brought back bubba memories,2023-04-04
maybe jw5 could be a prequel i wouldnt want them to mess up that ending him being dead is such great closure ,2023-04-04
"what is there left to do for his character

i’d take a buddy cop movie where he teams up with the cop from the first movie",2023-04-03
"on the other hand i feel it makes more emotional sense  if j is dead 

jw says to winston before leaving the boat to put loving husband on epitaph he was going to die anyway after caine took the third shot and jw didnt but planned to  mdg with the third bullet to have his freedom from the table to me it feels like jw wanted to have freedom at any cost even in death and thats the only way he could go back to being a normal person or a loving husband even if he is dead he is still free and can return back to being a loving husband which was also his wifes last memory of him  a free man away from the underworld of crime 

x200b

i really hope jw5 doesnt bring back j from the dead a side story or a prequel of sorts is still good with jw action sequences but this ending of jw4 is very well rounded and conclusive in terms of storyline and philosophically as well",2023-04-01
"yh no body no death

they also set up the revenge arc for that japanese girl which could lead to chapter 5",2023-03-28

i think he is dead but that they will make another one and keanu will continue to reprise the role in flashbacks,2023-04-03
it could be a prequel,2023-04-03
this is a good point but what more story is there for john wick i feel like this film tied it all up hes free now,2023-03-24
i mean they literally buried him next to his wife unless they put a fake body,2023-03-25
"yeah i initially thought oh  they offed the character guess keanus stepping down from these movies  but then i realized well we never actually saw his body go away

its kind of like when gandalf dies at the end of fellowship  if you dont see the body dead never say never",2023-03-26
i think this was 4 and 5 condensed into one movie the original cut of this movie was nearly 4 hours,2023-03-26
they also set up that john winning the duel would have fundamentally damaging implications for the table itself so there’s loose threads if they want to pull them,2023-03-26
looks like they are making a prequel instead i’d be okay with that since this movie would end the franchise on a good note,2023-03-27
if a 5 movie happens it should be a prequel to 1 i don’t want john’s death to be a fake he’s survived a lot of crazy  even though he was only human a prequel of young john would be great especially if they build up to his wife’s eventual illness to bridge the events of the 1st movie,2023-03-29
unless its that dreaded of dreaded things  a prequel,2023-04-15
the reason 4 is so long is likely cuz they combined the two movies i dont think there will be a 5 with john wick i thought maybe that he’d  everyone at the high table but they made a point saying it was pointless because like a hydra theyd all get replaced immediately,2023-04-24
perhaps with 5 we get to find out how many bodies he had to bury for viggo,2023-11-26
yup and because they ended the same way it lays enough foundation for john to make a potential return if they choose to continue his story but otherwise its conclusive enough that they can put a stamp on it all here smart way to do it,2023-03-24
jar jar is the key to all of this,2023-03-27

for caine those clinging to life dies thats why hes now the one being hunted
for john those cling to death lives by faking his death he can now live his life peacefully

i may be overstretching this but i really do hope that john gets the peaceful life he deserves",2023-03-28
bond is recast able  wick is not,2023-03-28
 i hope not it was a beautiful send off for mr wick i wouldn’t want to see him die any other way he went out in a blaze of glory just like he came in with the first movie ashes to ashes,2023-03-24
was it in the film or the theater,2023-03-25
i would be fine accepting that logic if it was consistent but having some people react some of the time was really distracting,2023-05-25

honestly the most realistic portrayal of paris drivers ever in a movie,2023-05-07
i think it’s like batman the existence of high level criminals creates  the need for high level body guards which creates the need for assassins which creates the need for a regulatory body to oversee all of it and make sure it doesn’t get out of hand,2023-03-25
superb writeup thanks for that,2023-05-18

they could have played it off as a demolition of a condemned building,2023-03-24

"being literally dead is a good solution to avoiding being hunted by assassins for the rest of your life i imagine that the king and the manager would be ok with covering for him shave off the beard and get a hair cut and then live the rest of your life in peace

wasn’t the whole point to  the evil high table,2023-03-24
"everything he did was for his wife she wants him to live find something to love again to have him die is to let her down

he was living alright after jw1",2023-03-24
"thats just something the villain of this film says to convince himself  win johns own words in chapter 3 is that he is desperate to keep living as long as possible in order to remember his wife and the love theyve had that is his purpose to live

im totally content and fine with john actually being dead here but him faking his death to live in total peace would also work very well for the character based on his own motivations",2023-03-27
he became a devil because he had to we were the ones who put him up to it in the end when he had finally been set free from this  we were about to bring him back for more but i think its time we let him rest,2023-03-24
facts all 4 of these movies have been a reminder that if john keeps going on this path he will end up dead one way or anything the story is about struggling against futility because everyone around him including himself knows that theres no real reason to be doing what he is doing besides revenge john doesnt have a plan to uproot the high table he doesnt have a plan to change anything hes just going on a  spree i feel like during 3 he started to slip back into his mindless killer mindset and thats why hes so monotone and sounds like hes not all there in 4 his revenge was accomplished in 2 then the high table went after him he was trying to find meaning in his struggle for life and thought he would find it while taking on the high table i dont know if im overanalyzing but i do feel like 4 presents so many philosophical metaphors that it could actually be dissected,2023-03-31
"honestly i wish they would have left out the grave it makes no sense for his story to end here and even less sense if he is faking his death leave him on the steps bleeding out

his story needs to conclude with the high table its been the emperor palpatine in the background the whole time as the evil puppet masters to have him not go after them and dismantle or rebuild it is just insane",2023-03-25
"without the duel the high table would still go after him however the duel meant he had to go up against his friend and  him the trick at the end was to goad the marquis into participating himself which gave john the opportunity to get out avoid killing his friend and killing the marquis consequence free

but then john dies anyway so the high table in the end got what it wanted",2023-03-27
"exactly how i feel thanks for writing it out john wick has always been an absurd escapist fantasy so to  him off without a clear accomplishment just feels so wrong either have him die successfully dismantling the table or just let him survive you dont need to give him a super happy ending or anything just let him go off to be free doing whatever  

it really feels like the only reason this ending was done was because someone really didnt want to make another one and thought this was a good way to put the nail in the coffin",2023-03-25
"  but he gets to die as the man his wife loved the one who was out of the criminal world

i dont see how you can feel youre out of the criminal world after you just killed 500 people ",2023-03-24
going out like what in his own terms that’s the most suitable way for him to go out lol,2023-03-27
totally agree  and not once has john put on a disguise in the movie to hide from other assassins  don’t think he’d want to start now,2023-03-24
i mean with the first john wick with no expectations of sequels everyone was perfectly fine with a simple revenge flick with him adopting a new puppy and trying to move on at the end,2023-03-27
" nothing else fits

nah i thought of a pretty good alternate in the theater

if during the duel his right hand his gun hand got maimed and was no longer functional with this it would be the symbolic death of the boogeyman but not john wick himself",2023-04-08
did you guys not watch the movie if he killed the members of the table theyd just replace them john dying makes him into a martyr which is much worse for the table,2023-03-24
 imagine watching these movies and thinking they’re just another soulless action franchise,2023-03-24
i dont know if the movies were building up toward uprooting the high table after the ending of 2 everything has been about john being free from the consequences of that i dont think he ever expressed a want to overthrow anything,2023-03-27
he never once said that was his motivation it wasnt even implied you can make an assumption but the film does nothing to give the audience that intention,2023-03-25
helen wanted nothing more for him to live a simple life with a dog and thats how the first film ends,2023-03-29
"no way with that box office opening weekend 

	last week director chad stahelski told the hollywood reporter that “in our minds keanu and i are done for the moment we’re going to give ‘john wick’ a rest i’m sure the studio has a plan if everyone loves it and it goes kooky then we’ll take a quiet minute”

source",2023-03-27
i feel like john and co had made several comments about killing them all which to me translates to all those in power aka the table maybe not an over throw but certainly making them suffer just killing the marquis who even at the end was trying the tables patience if the harbingers words meant anything seems like a cop out because he wasnt even on johns radar till the final movie so what had john been planning up until this guy interfered with his two oldest friendsthe only real things brought about by johns rampage were winston getting his hotel back and caine winning his freedom and arguably the first wouldnt have been necessary if john had died at the end of 2 i just dont buy it chad and keanu put a lot of thoughts into these movies not just the action and it just feels a bit incomplete to me but i enjoyed the movie as a whole and thays just my take,2023-03-28
that means a lot thank you,2023-03-26
it means true friendship ride or die with you or friendship during inconvenient times is worth the most  they are there for you through thick and thin even when its inconvenient and you value it the most during tough times,2023-03-25
it is easy to be friends when its convenient its hard to be friends and therefore more meaningful when it is inconvenient such as when you have to  each other its very hard to be friends and also  each other,2023-03-25
"we are friends through the best of times and the worst of times damned the consequences 

thats the jist really",2023-03-25
it just mean that real friendship is proven when it requires you to sacrifice something you can say youre a friend now but will you still be a friend once that friendship cost you something or will you drop it because you dont want to pay the price eg your friend lose his house and need a place to stay will you help him until he gets back on his feet or will you turn your back,2023-03-25
"its an  thing to say to guilt someone into doing a favor for you

if youre the one doing a favor for them though and they feel guilty about it thats when friendship means little when its convenient hits because then youre saying dont feel guilty youre my friend im here for you through thick and thin",2023-04-04

yes oh man i kept thinking ‘why do i care so much about this character have i really only just met him’ character development was excellent,2023-04-29

"another story here that everyone knows within the movie that the audience doesn’t

what do you mean this is from the first movie",2023-03-24
its great how his dialogue is handled though imo in this one in particular they had serious westerns influence and i think they take inspiration from those with how he uses his words doesnt say much but no ones ever left wondering what hes thinking,2023-08-05
can you please explain further what do you mean what did john mean whe he said maybe im wrong and what is the reason as you stated,2023-06-07
yeah,2023-04-03
no it wasnt that graves mean nothing but rather he bought his tombstone years ago something many people do irl which allows him to control the narrative of his death epitaph which is very important to the bowery king he would not risk having that title ever taken away from him either in life or death,2023-03-26

thats what they want you to think",2023-03-24
yeah theyre clearly setting her up to be in the spinoff with donnie yens character,2023-03-24
"wait what the 

there was an after credit scene",2023-03-24
the what now ah ,2023-03-25
she was one of the big highlights for me im invested in her revenge arc against donnie yen would make for a great movie premise,2023-03-28
its not just that she dances well theres a fight scene in one of her music videos,2023-03-24
"yeah she isn’t the biggest pop star so i can see general audiences not even knowing who she is 

agreed on her acting too from what little we have of her she does a great job hope we get more of her not just in this series but in film in general",2023-03-28

"it was more symbolic and not literal as winston adopting him was meant to mirror the other family bonds john gained by the end of the film that john either never had in his life parents since he was an orphan or that he had lost family

he gained a family ruska roma he gained a brother caine he gained a father winston and he gained the title of husband back again as he wanted to die like he would have in his life with helen but being underthetable means his burial wishes might not have been honoured and he would have been made a dinner reservation guest he wanted to die as the man that was with helen not the man he was before her he gained everything he wanted in the end not just freedom",2023-03-26

it was the same cross john has on his back and that was engraved over the church in berlin so i think yes,2023-03-24
if i recall correctly it was the same cross that was in the notebook and above the belarusian church,2023-04-11
wonder if john learned  with a pencil from caine seeing as how they made it a point to show him putting it in his pocket,2023-05-30
there were a few homages the start has a direct one to lawrence of arabia match sun,2023-03-24
it almost certainly is in the same way john wick gets hit by like 20 cars in both john wick 3 and 4 and how in one scene in john wick 3 he gets thrown through like 10 identical glass panels in a row its almost a confirming wink and a nod that facilitates the world building but in a way that many for example marvel movies fail to dothose winks dont undermine the conception of the world itself thats why many people are growing tired of disingenuous comedy in action movies this element present in john wick definitely works on some subconscious level i was just thinking about this actually there are some over the top action movies that i cant stand and its because they dont take their world building seriously at all john wick somehow tows the line between tongue and cheek and serious very well when he gets hit by a car thrown through a window or off a building your brain goes ah hah but then the filmmakers are there to remind you they know what you are thinking and that their world doesnt play by the rules of your preconceptions,2023-03-26

“chad said that it was going to be more of an ensemble movie where you’re toggling between different stories” editor nathan orloff told indiewire

and even earlier than that it was supposed to be two films shot backtoback

i completely agree about the osaka part it was so totally unnecessary like it was still probably my favorite part of the film but it added absolutely nothing to the story and made even less sense than the rest of it

honestly it would have been even better if they cut the filler fights trimmed out the repetitive elements from them and delivered a lean 90 minute film",2023-03-26
"and what was his entire deal to begin with hed been stalking john for a while anticipating that the price on his head would keep going up they only showed the pages of his notebook fairly briefly so it was hard to parse it and tell what his scheme was not to mention how did he assemble that information to begin with

it seemed like he was going to end up trying to play both sides against each other more had some larger scheme in mind or something like the whole thing with the knife definitely hinted at something deeper going on from his introduction on it never felt like it was actually just about the money

and why the dog

my thinking was that he was likely involved with the bowery king he had a kind of homeless sort of look and the dog really fit in with that it would make sense that he was involved in whatever the kings larger scheme was",2023-03-27

this is actually why my favorite 1 man army action set piece in the past decade is the batman warehouse scene from bvs he gets shot in the head from behind which is ridiculous but it was at least a step forward in addressing that there are goons that can just come up from behind you and end it like he also gets dragged by his cape by 2 goons and stabbed in between his armor plating where it meets the shoulder that’s cannon fodder taking advantage of his two biggest weaknesses other than straight up shooting his mouth but it is a movie after all lol gotta keep it going",2023-03-27
"crazy they go from 3v50 to 3v9 before the olympians start dropping conservation of ninjutsu in real life

 one ninja is a deadly threat but an army of them are cannon fodder

the first 41 were useless the next 9 were effective and then at 1v2 they finally lose i would love to see this done more than once with different fencers",2023-04-12
"not only japan when johns car gets hit and turned on the side he fights a random good in the now sideways healights screenshot there and you have a wallpaper now repeat for almost the entire movie its just so screenshot worthy all the time

bit of a different thing when that’s the conceit of the whole movie versus a single segment of a larger installment in a franchise though not much reason to bust your  on it when that money and time can be spent doing something else for the movie,2023-03-26

people complain about too much cgi all the time but they have no idea how much invisible cgi is right in front of their eyes  like the horse chase in chapter 3 the animal safety officer said they had to lay down thick rubber mats to protect the horses so every time you can see the street its digital  the road the yellow  white lane lines the rain the reflections from puddles every bit of it is cgi,2023-03-24
could people really not tell lol its not that it was bad cgi but the dog was obvious,2023-03-24
don’t worry they went through an extensive trial and error phase until they found a way to hit the dog with a car without killinginjuring it,2023-03-24

the bathroom fight is so top tier i love all wick movies and dislike tom cruise but that man just keeps on outdoing himself and dead reckoning part 12 seem to be just more of it,2023-03-24
the fallout fights are absolutely incredible and help make up my favorite action movie of all time but i will note that as long as you are able to accept that mi2 doesnt fit in with the rest of the franchise at all and just watch it as a john woo movie the climactic fight there is ridiculously fun,2023-03-25
"i mean im actually with you in mi movies at least the ones ive seen being better overall spectacle but im still not sold on it being able to do what john wick does

i mean just this movie alone mi doesnt have donnie yen for the hand to hand stuff granted his work in this film isnt his best but i saw some brief flashes of the classic donnie yens stuff that isnt really replicable in mission impossible

and i agree about the bathroom fight being good but i dont think llsa and solomon is even close to the john wick choreography 

fallout also doesnt have the bullet proof shenanigans or the fire gun  that adds a unique pulpy flair",2023-03-26
i can see why you would feel that way about john wick fights however to me they feel fresh every time they almost always use a different takedownthrow when grappling and they get better every movie the reloads always look great something no other movie ive seen manages to do and all the other details in a fight such as disarms and strikes while grappling just feel unique and weighty compared to other action movies,2023-03-26
is is especially true in 4 outside of the fire breath and blind guy scenes,2023-03-26
agree i love the wick movies but mi  007 are in a higher more timeless class of action movie especially the recent entries,2023-03-25
i actually much prefer the story and world building  jw all the movies feel coherent mi is like 3 or 4 different franchises though the last few have been very good,2023-03-26
did we watch the same john wick 2 and 4 i cant think of anything 2 did better than 4,2023-03-25
"i agree but it’s also the most mission impossible that the wick series has gotten 

i honestly think the two series’ have pushed each other in really great ways they’re at the top of the genre and when another action film has a stunning set piece it usually makes me think of either wick or mission",2023-03-24
"definitely could be recency bias i haven’t watched fallout since it was in theaters which holy  was 2018 felt much more recent thinking more on it maybe in addition to the cinematography it’s also just the overall visual tone of the john wick movies that i prefer 

especially 24 they’re bordering on like cyberpunk 2077edgerunners with the moody neon cityscapes it’s just a really unique look for an action movie that really fits the adrenalineinducing scenes",2023-03-24

by all accounts hes a pretty great person,2023-03-26

no it means i’m not wasting my energy on celebrities real lives because they aren’t important to me   i’ve got better more important things to worry about than this junk,2023-03-24
id still watch the last of us,2023-03-24

"i didnt really get why that was worse for the high table  wick wasnt some ideological leader the dispute between him and the high table only came about because he killed someone in a continental

x200b

wick being dead shows that even if youre a master assassin who can defeat all the other greatest assassins in the world single handedly the table will still get you no matter what the cost",2023-03-24
" the system didnt force him to get back into work because of the dog it was entirely personal

it did


john wick 1 wasnt why the table hated himit was john wick 2

that dude calling in his markerto  a member of the high table  after the same high table   said to johnwe will never bother u again if u complete an impoosible task  which he did for them

so on one hand  the ht is likehere  complete these taskand u can go free

but then on the other hand itswell sorry you have to honour this guys markerwho actually ordere the death of one of usand then pushed it so far u had to  him on continental grounds",2023-03-28
"the system did force him back into work specifically because of him choosing to fight the men who killed his puppy  this was a whole scene in the second movie

if he kills every high table member there is a power vacuum  the friends who he has made and kept can fill this vacuum and work on instituting a better system",2023-03-24
the director worked on v for vendetta and there is a call back when the club guy asks why wont you just die and i think it relates to this because beneath john wicks suit is more than flesh and blood beaneath the suit is an idea and ideas are bullet proof,2023-03-24
so i guess the 5th jw movie is one without john ,2023-03-24
or hear me out we get to see hitmen trying to construct another world with better rules complete with similar politics to the likes of this movie,2023-03-24
no he’s the guy the administrators send in to  destroy the system so they can make a better one,2023-03-25
that’s such a stretch i’m gonna need you to meticulously explain how tf you were able to get that from my comment,2023-03-24
he should have made a believable beginning and middle if he wanted a believable ending,2023-03-25
i thought that too but i think the point is that the freedom is less of the stop  up my life and more stop  up other peoples lives and so he can briefly live and die as a normal man not just dying at the hand of some professional assassin organization for coin,2023-04-02
agent 47 for example hes alive  happy doing what he does,2023-03-25
would be perfect,2023-04-02

buuut the guy was hit by no less than six cars fell off at least two buildings from a height that would killgravely hospitalize anyone in a single night then went on to duel his equal level assassin buddy like a gentleman his body was wrecked inside at the beginning of that last fight those bullet wounds werent what killed him

im just glad he didnt fall down the stairs at the very end",2023-03-24

john being so fixated and full baba yaga also makes it hit way harder at the end when he quietly asks winston to take him home,2023-03-25
i highly agree john wick is literally told twice that him at his very core is a killer something he can not escape or run from so it makes sense that hes so cold,2023-03-24
seems like a reasonable interpretation wick kills with such regularity and brute force that he’s become something of a blunt object of a human being it is definitely a stylistic choice to give reeves lines of no more than 35 monosyllabic words and your idea makes sense from a thematic perspective though i almost take it as being a bit intentionally comedic first and foremost these movies aren’t actioncomedies in any explicit sense but they definitely do weave a kind of dry and dark humor in,2023-03-27
"thats one way to think about it but if that was the choice it sure as  doesnt make for a compelling character 

im fine with john wick being a shell of a human where actiondeath just happens around him thats kind of the point of the movie but if keanus performance had any personality i think it wouldve elevated the character further",2023-03-24
ill agree with you john is less vulnerable here and more purely going for revenge the stiff delivery was fine to me,2023-03-25
i like this take,2023-03-24
on this we agree,2023-03-28
i dig that,2023-04-08
why does he get fetal alcohol syndrome between movies tho,2023-11-04

"right imagine jumping from jw1 to this and seeing how the style and character has shifted jw in jw1 was a real albeit shallow character and it was the villains that had mythologised him as baba yaga which was cool to see  normally we only see villains mythologised to make them seem scary for our protagonist

now its like the writers actually present us with the mythological version of jw",2023-03-24
yeah i feel the same for me it feels like this film should have been part 3 i love part 3 but i honestly think it was a bit pointless story wise it ends exactly how it starts with john wounded and on the run from the high table nothing changed at all in part 3,2023-03-24
theres a japanese actioncomedy duology called the fable about an legendary yakuza assassin who has to go one year without killing anyone but then is forced to fight off the rival gangs creatively and nonlethally when they catch wind of this and come for him,2023-03-26
"thats why i feel like theres at least one more left in the chamber  we havent yet seen what he does when hes truly free

last time he got out it only took a couple of drunken russians to reel him right back into that life  true redemption  would be if something like that happened again and he didnt respond by going all baba yaga on their whole organization

only when someone elses happy life is on the line will  drawn back in",2023-03-29

to retire and get out of the game he constantly says so through the film and killa lays that out one wants to serve his way out one wants to buy his way out and one wants to  his way out,2023-03-26
it was to retire at a lake side cabin that was why he had his dream house sketched in on the page with the price needed to buy it and his way out,2023-03-26
his notebook also had a picture of a big house on a lake i imagine that is what he was saving the money for he just wants to buy a house away from everything for him and his dog very relatable,2023-03-27
yeah need to be winston or charon and charon is just a less powerful version of winston so it was a nobrainer,2023-03-25
i meant more in terms of johns story theres only so far you can take his particular story but i wouldnt be opposed to them fleshing out the world and focusing on other characters,2023-03-25
yeah its more fitting the whole series is framed like a sort of greek tragedy you have an old warrior who very much wants to be left alone to live in peace being forced to fight once more all he wants is his freedom and he finally attains his freedom but at the cost of his own life so hes technically free but he doesnt get to enjoy that freedom its poetic and really the only way his story can end,2023-03-25
thats what puts the nail in the coffin for me too  if he were alive theyd at least know and if they knew they wouldnt act like they didnt know to each other at the gravesite  unless they knew they were being watched and thats the opening scene in jw5 but its a bit too farfetched  i loved every single jw movie and im okay with him dying in this one because i feel that if he did die it was keanus choice to leave the role because no way in  theyre letting him leave for any other reason because this franchise is laying golden eggs,2023-03-26
to me the laugh felt like he was breaking away from the hypothetical question like obviously neither because hes not dead or possibly just how is retirement good heaven or bad ,2023-03-25
well written ,2023-03-24
thanks for this there was a couple talking thru my entire screening so i left as soon as the main movie wrapped x didnt want to listen to them any longer,2023-03-25

even the freedom he won for caine was totally hollow caine was already free until a high table bigwig decided to coerce him into service by threatening his daughter theres nothing to prevent that from just happening again,2023-03-27
"keanu absolutely didnt want to continue anymore the interview has the director states that when they brought the idea to lionsgate they outright said are you  insane which makes sense since john wick is one of their flagship franchises at the moment 

says him and keanu smiled and said yeah we want to tie it all together  because at some point this has got to end man  i just find it so ridiculous that the only way they couldve thought to tie it all together was to have wick die pointlessly couldnt he have escaped elsewhere what was the point if hes going to die without generating any major changes in the world theyve created 

apparently the original ending on lionsgates orders showed the grave scene but the dog looked up insinuating maybe wick was alive and he was there as well but the people watching the test screenings did not like it so the amazing idea they had was to make it clear hes dead and in his words we thought we nailed it the first time and to the studios credit they didnt even blink suggesting that they brought the idea of john dying originally got backlash from the studio had a vague mysterious is he alive ending and then due to poor reception they just took the feedback as assuming its best to go to the original idea and make clear hes dead 

but yes not amount of money is too much so who knows",2023-03-26
john didnt even know about the duels he seemed taken aback at the appointment of cain to take the marquis place  he didnt care if he died he just wanted a clean way to  the marquis and have the high table realign without having to just keep getting his friends killed,2023-03-30
"personally i’m the oppposite i loved the escalation into rrated fast and furious territory with each film that’s just delightful to me i like the element of this being a very serious violent cartoon it’s a wonderful dynamic that i love

"weird the arc d’triomphe car battle sequence was my favorite part it was absolutely ridiculous but hilariously so and just really inventive and fun  got tons of audible reactions in my theater

i hear you guys about the “realism” of jw1 being thrown out the window but that left the station in jw3 we’ve already established that jw is nighsuperhuman and that the fights are more balletic dances to see who can get a head shot first previous movies established that shots to the suit falls from decent heights and standard car hits don’t  or incapacitate people here this movie turned those up a notch but didn’t break those previously established rules",2023-04-24

the issue is that this is the 4th john wick movie and i expected it to have the same quality and care as the last 3 

it did not",2023-03-30

i tracked only second ascend and it was app 3 minutes,2023-04-12
and then knowing what killas cards were i was like huh  also i agree about the reloads that detail was one of my fave parts of the john wick movies bc it made it feel more realistic,2023-05-23
"i dont care about the realism i dont care about how many bullets come out of his gun before reloading and i dont care about trying to find flaws intentionally just to be able to say something sucks but howbout we have some real stakes so that i can actually get invested in the action  its pretty clear during the entire last act in paris that john is just going to survive whatever encounter until he gets to the final duel so at that point it just becomes purely about the action and choreography 

and yes i can appreciate the choreography of the actors but by hour 2 it wasnt doing anything interesting  in terms of action that wasnt already done earlier in the film and series this movie had no reason to be dragged out for as long as it was

i see no reason why couldnt we have had less bad guys and more meaningful encounters with them instead of hordes of mindless boring  henchmen that just throw themselves at john wick so that he can grab them and body shot them 

the hotline miami scene was a perfect example of an awesome and unique action scene and was easily the best part of the movie let me be clear that i thought overall it was a decent movie i loved the soundtrack donnie was cool i liked some of the action set pieces and the ending but there was a lot of  around it that could have been cut",2023-04-13
right like i enjoyed the movie but also agreed with a lot of those criticisms what i dont agree with is  on others who enjoyed it as if they actually shouldnt have its fine to have a different opinion,2023-06-06
"a part of me feels that it has to do with them really wanting this movie to be good dont get me wrong i also wanted this movie to be good but these were issues i couldnt ignore 

so many franchises in hollywood are in trouble lately maybe they see john wick as one of the outliers in terms of quality consistency and yet its clear the quality is drastically different in this entry when compared to the past 3",2023-03-26
"theres nowhere in that article that says hes dead

there was a different way to do the funeral scene and we wanted it to be a little bit more mysterious that’s why you see the puppy look up at the end during the funeral scene

"the killed him with a pencil line was just something to express how versatile he was with his killing 

and when i say it took itself seriously i mean that the action scenes werent ridiculous suspension of disbelief moments with the exception of the silenced gun while walking end to people moment in the second movie 

but here you have some ridiculous scene where theyre fighting for minutes in a cgi car riddled arc de triumphe where cars dont stop driving until the tail end of it all cars stop and drivers disappear from inside and cgi rag dolls fly about 

did we watch the same movies",2023-03-24

yeah and with the long run time i felt like japan was extremely unnecessary its where he ended up after the intro but then played no role later i thought at the very least we would get more akira in this movie,2023-03-26
if you can do check out the good the bad and the  the most recognized movie featuring the man with no name a lot of american cinema is rooted to this movie even the final duel between john and cain is a probable homage to that movie’s ending down to the soundtrack,2023-03-25
bills character was just a french version of santino,2023-03-28
i dunno i really wanted to have a good time but the pacing of the action was just nonstop repetitive like you said it didn’t have any ebbsflows oh well,2023-03-24
lol yeah thats a good way of thinking about it to be honest it wasnt a huge deal with me i just noticed it easier than most i assume narratively it was good i just think it couldve been polished more,2023-04-01
are we talking about the same scene  im specifically thinking about the one where he drives  drifts in circle around a bunch of guys and traps them between their cars that shot was crazy felt like he was using a cheat code,2023-04-02
well the tracker did help john escape multiple times in their first encounter so i think john just figured he was a problem that he could deal with at a later point,2023-03-25
well if im john i take the help i can get in the moment even if he gonna come after me later possible angle imo,2023-03-25

"i was not okay with the overthetopness of 3 because it came out of nowhere at the end

but 4 i was like ok they are going all in and just enjoyed the  out of it",2023-03-27
"the club scene from the first one is still probably my favorite set piece from all four

it doesnt have some big gimmick to it or anything its just john moving through a crowded space and  a bunch of dudes up but everything about how its shot and presented just has so much flair to it the long take of him moving through the bath house area with think in the background going into iosef running through the crowd with john slowly advancing towards him like a  t800 and led spirals playing going into the big blowup where shots fired kicks in its just perfect absolutely firing on all cylinders its a simple idea executed as perfectly as humanly possible

the sequels have some really good  in them too and 2 and 4 are both better movies overall but neither of them manage to quite hit the levels of pure kino that for about 56 minutes the first one managed to",2023-03-28
theres a lot of gunfire going off in that scene with no regard for collateral damage haha,2023-04-08
he didnt release him no he just said he is free now but that meant because he believed that caine made their team victorious but according to those ancient rules of the duel caine lost because marquis has lost,2023-03-26
if he kills john he has to deal with mr nobody who wants the bounty and the german and his henchmen who also want him dead same for everyone at the deal who would try to take him out theyd have to deal with each other hence the card game for the right to see who kills him,2023-03-26
he wouldn’t have made it out alive since they were gonna  them all anyway,2023-03-26
"at that point in the film i think donnie yen has realized the marquis is an  who will always be able to threaten donnie into a job by threatening his daughter even if donnie kills keanu the marquis who changes agreed deals several times in the movie will never let donnie actually live in peace 

john does the same thing in jw3 he cuts off his finger and vows loyalty to the elder and goes off to  winston and remember donnie yen also kneels to the marquis in service but they both realize theyre just going to be a  as long as they follow orders",2023-03-27

yes they can",2023-03-29
"skipping past the but how could the blind swordsman trope exist in real life stuff  

it seemed like a major point that caine was chosen because they knew that john would be hesitant to  him no one else the high table could leverage into fighting john had that kind of armor against him

i also think the movie implied that caine wasnt blind back when he was doing missions and had maybe blinded himself to force the high table to consider him too useless to force to keep working until the john situation happened",2023-03-29
"yeah i totally agree with your takes on venom and logan they are just characters that allowed allowed to fully shine with an r rating and thats why i also fear that deadpool 3 will not be that good as the previous ones an regarding john wick all we can do now is wait for sequelsspin offs or a blu ray release to see if there is added blood effects or not  


in any case if you enjoyed the raid movies i suggest you check out the night comes for us   and headshot  they are not as good as the raid but they sure are bloody as  and if you have similar recommendations id like to know them lately there is so little interesting to watch for us hardcore r action fanatics",2023-04-03
"but my issue isnt it being unhappy my issue is that johns actions were effectively pointless and he should have known they would be he didnt achieve anything which would be fine but thats not even the message the film attempts to display with his death




if in death johns actions have meaning and it does inspire others to take action and things to change in some capacity then i feel itll feel less superfluous and meaningless to me 



 hopefully future films do some interesting stuff with it",2023-03-27

i mean yeah thats how it was set up but john or maybe john and caine together found another way its what made the scene interesting imo  i would have been disappointed if it were just a straightforward duel",2023-03-27
i would interpret it like that,2023-03-25
whoops,2023-03-29
"yall werent listening to much dialogue or went  during plot points lol

john wicks family holds a seat at the high table they have to issue the challenge and then put john in as the representative there was no reason for the family to issue a challenge against the antagonist of jw2 and no reason for winston to tell john about it john wasnt the highest bounty on the planet fighting against the entire high table at that point he was having a fight with a dude he gave a marker to and the fallout from that no one not even winston expected john to blow a dude away on continental grounds especially not a seated head family member of the high table 

in irl sense the writers came up with it after jw2 we arent even introduced to the concept of john being part of a family until jw3 even still him being told wouldnt make any sense in the events of jw2 at that specific time so it still fits in lorewise for that point in the overall story the writers did a good enough job making it make sense considering how crazy the john wick world got from 1  4",2023-04-01
agreed that whole aspect of jardani has always been pretty thin im totally fine with john wick being an exmarine who became a hired killer and leaving it at that,2023-03-24
thats the narrative reason yes but i think it could have been written more elegantly and the sequence itself been executed more efficiently it was a lot of wheel spinning for little overall gain imo,2023-03-24
how do i know something about a movie before watching it  john wick 1 had none of these flaws i was hoping for a return to form,2023-03-30
you’re  soft tell that story to a group of mexicans and they’ll laugh it’s baffling if you are actually mexican and think this way don’t come to la you won’t like us ,2023-04-15
he did say farewell my son and it does go along with how shifty winston is same hair style being helens father would make a ton of sense though glad we got to see her,2023-03-26
but he did have an impact on the plot lol,2023-03-31
"ahh so that part i missed he actually took over as the duelist and got killed hence why john and winston won

im not sure if that was clear in the movie or i clearly missed it

thanks for the explanation",2023-04-01
ok i would still like to think he died and this is the final movie because it was a very fitting end for him,2023-03-26
"i think youre misunderstanding my point a little

im not saying nobody is some secret player who actually had control ofdestroyed the high table himself im saying his existence is more or less a knockon effect of all the damage to the high tables reputation and power john has done

john building his myth even more than it already was over the course of the movies creates more assassins like nobody who dont properly respect the high table thats the entire problem the marquis is trying to nip in the bud by having john publicly killed

the knife in the hand scene kind of plays into this compare how nobody reacts to it extreme annoyance that turns to fear when his dog is threatened to how everyone else in the series with a high tableinflicted mutilation reacts to it respectful if unhappy acceptance nobody doesnt look at the high table as his masters he looks at them as a bunch of psychopaths with money and the prospect of everyone looking at the table like that resulting in them having no real power beyond what they can shoot scares the   out of them",2023-03-28
in jw3 he fights to survive so he can remember his wife he even seeks out the elder and recommits himself to the table in order to survive,2023-03-25
"i wouldnt mind seeing a pointless fight with a hydra then they make a deal of truce or whatever

rather than fighting with the hydras pet minions 

i just assume the way it was set up it was gonna be like the storm the castle kind of movie but it was more like a knock on a door that the doorman answer",2023-03-25
"how many cars did he get hit by in previous movies was it 45 cars at full speed within minutes of each other

and the fall off the building at the end of the third film was the worst part of the movie and a very disliked part of the film to double down on that kind of damage is a very bad move for the franchise 

in jw1 they showed his injuries realistically and it affected the plot",2023-03-25
if it was a real duel john could have just ducked and shot him  hes friggin blind,2023-03-27
"not honourable sure but still followed the rules laid out to everyone even if he didnt like them

i feel like the chapters 2 and 3 outline pretty vigorously that the rules are meant to be followed and consequences as well as rewards will be honoured accordingly",2023-04-01
i’m not really holding out for anything more from the franchise tbh these films have been great but i don’t care for spinoffs with hot chick flavour of the month types,2023-03-28
same  thats what i loved so much about john wick 2jw1 was such a tightly plotted movie that didnt really require any additional expansion but they did it anyway and expounded on the world in such a satisfying and successful way that i ended up liking jw2 even more than the first which is arguably a narratively perfect movie on its own and to me jw4 was just as good as 1  2 combined 3 only took a bit of a step back but in the context of 2 and 4 its a great bridge movie,2023-04-02
theres a show called the continental that is supposed to air this fall it focuses more on the continental and the high table and takes place in the 1970s ill bet that they develop more of the story of the high table stuff in there,2023-04-03
the osaka sequence was insane i lost my  watching because i couldnt believe it was the opening to the movie the entire time it had final level of a video game vibes even the unnamed characters were all hyper competent,2023-04-04
an amazing endcap to the seriesjohn wick 1 through 4 are pretty much a perfect quadrilogy in my eyes  the fact that they were able to fit so much worldbuilding in each movie and still leaving us want more is testament to that,2023-04-02
maybe they’ll continue with caine teased by the post credit button,2023-04-17
bro i got so hype for john killing to that song when i heard it,2023-04-03
thats the npc achieving sentience,2023-03-26
"they don’t turn on the villain but some of the henchmen do this in iron man 3 i think it was

they’re just like oh  this",2023-03-28
theres a scene in early venture bros where brock sampson kills a  of henchmen and then gets to the big henchmen who just throws up his hands and says hes not paid enough for this while walking away,2023-04-26
"for forty million dollars i’d try my luck and hope i get a lucky shot 


i mean i’d 100 end up just as dead as the rest of them but i get it",2023-04-18
i was waiting for at least one guy to have some common sense and nope out,2023-03-24
"maybe cliched but for this underworld i believe because theyre kinda npcs or red shirts like they literally have no motives or backstories

i guess that was established in the second movie that this was some sort of alternate reality where people who arent in the game just accept that there are killers everywhere",2023-03-28
"theyve spent hundreds of millions of dollars had to replace many high ranking members and lost some of their best assets  

their roi is horrible and i hope someone at the high table spoke up about it",2023-03-24
the obvious consequence of that would be that every two bob assassin with access to the continental would feel emboldened to do whatever they want they uphold the rules for everyone or not at all,2023-03-25
i was also thinking didnt he got tricked by the italian guy in the second one to killing his sister wouldnt that be enough reason to get pardoned or something or at least have a fair trial or that challenge but from someone from the italian guys family i ll have to watch it again,2023-05-16
its not about the money companies do this in real life as well spend hundreds of millions of dollars to prove a point for example strikes,2023-06-18
but 40 mil and the notoriety of killing john is a  of a draw for high level assassins  everybody does at some point even more so in this line of work,2023-03-28
caine didn’t die because marquis pardoned him right before dying,2023-03-25
making wick  one of his last living friends would make him hesitate tipping the scales in bills favor,2023-03-29
you know any world class assassins that are blind,2023-10-14
"hes not actually dead  only a headshot would have sufficed for john wick  

but they buried him because hes effectively dead to them now that hes out of the game and theyre not  and at any rate he has to fake his death to keep anyone seeking vengeance for his thousands of kills from coming after him",2023-03-29
"i think its because frankly it would be reallycheap to bring him back winston and the bowery king saying goodbye john having beaten the table and cleared his name everything seems like it ties the story up nicely kind of like what they did with sherlock it would cheapen a sweet moment 

i think john needs to rest he deserves it more than anything else hes been on the run for what months killing and fighting and nearly dying 

if hes alive i hope they only show it as a brief glimpse in a spin off id love to see sawayama helm the series and maybe keanu floats by in the background somewhere",2023-03-26
i noticed too but it helped that i just rewatched chapter 3 yesterday haha,2023-04-02
i’m late to the discussion but what qa,2023-06-01
plus he has a cane,2023-04-05
the end of part 3 and beginning of part 4 he’s fully in revenge mode  he just doesn’t get it though,2023-03-30
"they kept his ring 

dude killed an entire mob boss faction over a dog that was a gift from his wife

and the high table made off with his ring the truly last gift he got from his wife the only person who gave him peace 

think the guy is going to take on the world for that honestly",2023-04-11
"third movie 
john’s about to run out of time and does before his bounty is allowed to be taken

the doc went over on the clock and also helped john with meds 

to try and make it look like john forced to doc to help him he had john shoot him in very specific areas 

i think it’s around the 30 minute mark",2023-04-10
"the way it ends is open enough that he could survive if they want to continue 

the way winston says “who knows” coyly 

it works both ways  if this is the last one it’s a great ending if they want to make another it’s entirely possible that winston helped him fake his own death as that’s truly the only way he could be “out”",2023-03-26
aww  i left before the after credits scene really has to  hate that i have to research if there is going to be a after credit scene for every movie,2023-03-26
just  around bro ,2023-04-04
"watching hiroyuki sanada is always a treat i wish he got to do a scene with ian mcshane he lit up the room every time he was in i loved his chemistry with keanu donnie and rina

i wish we had more time in osaka as well  it was my favorite location in the series by far 

shoutout to the cinematography team they had some absolutely gorgeous shots",2023-03-25
honestly when hollywood needs a badass japanese guy they go for either watanabe or sanada it’s like two actors really not hard to learn their names lol,2023-03-25
sanada was a  badass he did a great job i really hope they do a spin off with akira or mr nobody,2023-03-27
whats the family guy death pose,2023-03-24
laurel and hardy piano stairs reference you win today,2023-03-25
it was definitely intentional humor,2023-06-07
"just watched this last night  i agree with you  the first 3 had a ton more story a lot more exploration of this underworld  ridiculous fighting but more interesting story surrounding it  jw4 jumped the shark  

the scenes in between the fights were boring and then the fights were just stupidly over the top  no real storytelling

in jw3 he nearly has to  himself to get to the elder in the dessert in 4 he just… tracks him down  

in 3 it’s at least maybe a tiny bit surprising at first even though we knew it would be the case that he survived the fall from the continental  and then he had to be rehabbed in the new bowery  in 4 he’s nigh invincible

in 3 the big fight in the continental with its intermission and all was an incredible piece and still kept putting good storytelling in throughout the fight itself wick basically calling a timeout when fighting the students to catch his breath “hey that was a really good fight right”  in 4 they tried to do that with every fight and failed

there was no reason why this needed to be nearly 3 hours long",2023-06-19
she looked like she was simultaneously climbing a mountain and riding an elephant it was so amazing,2023-03-28
great comic relief character,2023-03-25
im pretty sure that was him loosening the tooth,2023-03-24

but keep the kicks lol",2023-03-27
make up was pretty good really hard to hide scott adkins in a  suit and make him look capable,2023-03-26
they definitely stand out boyka boyka,2023-03-25
this was his best acting ever forsure mindblowing,2023-03-26
boban marjanovic also,2023-03-27
how do you become familiar with these people seems like a cool thing to follow,2023-03-29
really going to need to see him team up with iko uwais at some point now complete that gareth evans cameo reel,2023-04-03
nah he’d worked with chad stahelski on a few movies and was on his mind pure coincidence he ended up paired with donnie again,2023-03-29
that’s who i was thinking of thank you i was completely stumped when i checked imdb and had never heard of the actor at all i was absolutely certain it was steve coogan,2023-03-26
he reminded me of that episode where alan partridge got ,2023-04-02
me too i kept hitting my friend and whisper yelling its scott adkins its scott adkins,2023-04-01
they both pull off a great  english mobster character,2023-03-27
what i don’t get about the ninja films is why they dub over mika hijii when she can speak perfect english,2023-03-29
"every so often some of them would look upon the fights with confused disgust

but the drugs and the beat are too good to stop dancing",2023-03-25
so many things in this franchise feel like video game elements and that is one of them,2023-04-06
and they only stopped and started panicking at the end of the misson,2023-04-01
they reminded me of background npcs from street fighter or tekken,2023-08-24
i figured everyone was drugged out,2023-04-13
in paris there’s gendarmes everywhere and i was like where are the police are cars just doing hit and runs with no police anywhere,2023-04-07
there’s like two one in the entire franchise i think the assassins have pretty much free reign in this universe,2023-04-10
he speaks mandarin in the movie he’s from china idk not weird for him to have a chinese name,2023-04-03
i doubt it every time ive been in one the speakers are absolutely knocking ive been in normal theaters next to a dolby and i would still feel my seat vibrating a little the blacks are also insanely deep compared to normal theaters its like the difference between an led and an oled tv so the picture quality is also significantly better could be that theater isnt actually set up to the standard but idk i wasnt there with you,2023-03-28
my understanding is that they dont really do much in reality they just look cool so its nice seeing them get a chance to actually pay off the idea of what they would do,2023-03-26
all time top tier gunfu movie scene,2023-03-27
my only complaint is im pretty sure his barrel should have been glowing by the end of that,2023-03-25
justice  genesis an absolute banger,2023-03-29
hotline miami 1 and 2 are exceptional must play games the soundtrack is stellar too,2023-04-02
"wow that’s amazing thanks for the article share

it really did feel like a real life“nextgen” version of hong kong massacre and i was all for it 

now i feel like i’m taking crazy pills cause everyone is saying hotline miami haha",2023-03-26
ive never heard justice anywhere other than spotify and it was something special to recognize it,2023-03-25
and thats a homage to comics,2023-03-24
isn’t more a homage to man on fire,2023-03-25
pistol whip is more like a john wick shooter,2023-03-29
id argue max payne 3 or splinter cell conviction,2023-03-29
feel like there was even the matrix and raid references they really went all out on this one it is pretty bloated but again if they are ending it might as well go big,2023-03-24
the use of nowhere to run is a nod to the warriors a movie that is essentially just a series of chase scenes,2023-04-03
the overhead one shot,2023-04-16
since i first heard that song ive always thought of it being played during some awesome action sequence in a movie and not 5 minutes before it played i was thinking how gessafelstein would be great particularly because hes french as well then boom,2023-03-24
i had my fingers crossed for robot rock,2023-03-27
to be more specific its the genesis x phantom remix from woman worldwide,2023-03-24
the station and train shots were from journal square station in new jersey kinda odd tbh since osaka has no shortage of metro and train stations to use,2023-03-26
it matters to you but you didnt catch that they mentioned it so many times even the writing continental osaka was shown,2023-03-26
for most people tokyo is the only japanese city they can name  you could have shots of the glico man and people would still say ah tokyo  i say this as someone who lived in kyoto and kobe for a decade,2023-03-28
yeah though they definitely looked better and more impactful in the movie than they do in real life maybe it’s because of the low lighting,2023-03-26
both war crime gun and human meat grinder sounds like awesome metal band names,2023-04-18
i was wondering i was like wait isnt that a war crime not that it would have stopped anyone in this universe but the branding sure didnt fit that vibe,2023-03-27
"ill look out for that next time i watch

if thats true its a great detail the difference is that the osaka henchmen he fought were just men loyal to the osaka continental and to koji defending their hometurf the parisian mooks were all just random criminals heading out to hunt john for the bounty the osaka guys were just playing defense after a sudden high table attack the parisian guys specifically chose to go out that night and hunt john",2023-04-04
and i got an implication that caine killed them himself in order to remove any witnesses so he could let koji and akira escape because if they were around he wouldnt have been able to spare koji and akira like he wanted to,2023-04-04
i had a feeling that line felt familiar when i rewatched it after hearing about the coast guard that defied the moskva,2023-04-02
the scene in the first movie where wick sneaks up on kevin nash’s character and they’re talking about how much weight he lost nash says something that sounds like “kilograms” but it’s translated as “pounds”  i’m guessing that’s an americanspecific translation,2023-03-30
you could say that fishburnes character bowery king was their version of the  leader of the beggars,2023-04-03

you right we got there in the end,2023-03-27
i knew that one from sleeping dogs x,2023-06-08

ballerina takes place between 3 and 4 and therell be a keanu cameo,2023-03-24
i thought he already confirmed he was appearing in it,2023-03-24
if its a hit theyll already have filmed a postcredit scene for it this guy time travels,2023-03-24
its already known that wick has an appearance in ballerina so i doubt itll be wasted on end credits,2023-03-29
cringe lol thank  redditors arent script writers,2023-06-06
100 i went to a 330 showing this afternoon and it was pretty much packed i don’t think i’ve seen a turnout like this for a thursday afternoon since avengers endgame,2023-03-24
even if there isnt a 5 ill be happy this is a great ending to his story and lets us decide if we think hes dead or not and if he truly gets to be with his wife or not they did a phenomenal job with this movie and if they mess it up with a 5th one then ill be happy that i can pretend it doesnt exist,2023-03-24
yeah thats exactly whats gonna happen it might take another four years but we will see a new one,2023-03-24
i think the kings fishbourne hinted at this in the boat when they talked about what they wanted on their gravestone he said i ordered mine nine years ago when he clearly wasnt dead yet i think its foreshadowing john wick doing the same so he has a chance to disappear once and for all,2023-03-24
so he is jardoni again,2023-03-24
i sort of thought the same thing he said that he wanted his grave just to say john if he died but he didnt  he just left it behind,2023-03-24
"john wick is dead and at peace with his beloved wife

the baba yaga however well maybe the marquis was right",2023-03-29
yes but you wouldnt put loving husband on it though if it was the assassin john wick that was dead,2023-03-26
heros get remembered but legends never die,2023-03-25
a lot of people have mentioned that and it’s definitely possible but i’m sure they at least had a rough plan of where to go after john “dies”,2023-03-24
man i would love a rocky style mentorship like in the creed franchise for wick i feel like nobody could really learn a thing or two from him and we didn’t get to see his full potential and his backstory he moved great in the apartment scenes when he was taking out the baddies would love to see him get more shine,2023-03-25
i’m sure it’d be great don’t know how i’d feel about it until i saw a rough synopsis but as long as john wickadjacent movies like ballerina and atomic blonde are coming out i’d be fine with keanu hanging up the suit for a while,2023-03-24
they may be banking on saw x making big money this year and regaining its place as a cheap reliable cash cow franchise,2023-03-24
agreed ive loved all 4 movies but i think its run its course  best to go out on a high note,2023-04-01
someone missed the end credits scene ,2023-03-29
"a character seeing their own gravefaking a death to live a different life is a super common trope lol punisher spectre dark knight rises nicky fury in the winter soldier

this movie just screams the classic question did they show the body and they absolutely intentionally did not show a body",2023-03-26
"well except gandalf actually  died   deader than a kennedy   

he was just reincarnated and sent back",2023-04-01
"the two movies being combined into what 4 eventually became is entirely speculation at this point 

with how well jw4 did financially i’d say there’s a 8090 chance we get jw5 with keanu",2023-04-24
he said who knows which is much less open than that,2023-03-26
lol bruh his response the dog clearly looking at someone off screen and an after credits screen make it beyond certain he is alive were reaching and grabbing handfuls of proof,2023-12-31
it looked like the beginning of the film to me,2023-03-25
i thought it was quite funny that the building was shown to be still standing in a later scene just a blackened husk of a building on a street corner nothing special here,2023-03-24
thats what i told myself when watching the movie,2023-03-24
but i saw people coming in and out a few days ago  the hot dog vendor across the street,2023-04-05
wouldnt you need permits and advance notice they did it in one day,2023-05-26
yes  that was one of my favorites  i just have a memory of a goldfish,2023-03-29
i love this line so much,2023-06-06
the only line to make jw give up lol,2023-04-01
"they have tho in this very same movie katia is in the high table the elder in the 3rd movie and this one are supposedly leaders of the high table council and finally the two siblings gianna and her brother santino dantonio who uses the marker to have wick  her and take her seat are part of the high table

we have however never seen them in a council together",2023-03-25
would be kinda cool if they make donnie yen the main character and have him go after the high table make it like classic kung fu movies where each high table member is a master of a different martial art or something,2023-03-28
"i thought this was the idea and why they were originally going to shoot 4  5 at the same time the ill  them ill  them all line from 2 at least to me meant this isnt over until the entire structure of power that made me do this is irradicated 

my suspicion is that they realized if they have john fully uproot the entire set of rules their world goes by that makes all their other spinoffs not really work or at least theyd require big retooling",2023-03-24
"that’s what i thought i thought the entire point of these movies turned tk be him finding the table and turning it over by killing them all honest to  i won’t be surprised if we find out a few months ago they brought in a second crew for reshoots and  whole different ending because they decided to say  it and end this wick thing i think the original plan was to move him to a fifth movie with a clean slate so he isn’t reactionary killing his way through a movie but a fifth moving being like shooter where he goes for the high table as the true bogey man 

then it ends with him going to winston and saying something like…

“so i heard you might have an opening for a new concierge”

then we get john wick 6 bell boy",2023-03-24
"thats how i saw it too then winston in the boat talked about how he just burried his friend the way i see it it was a redemption arc and wick didnt want others to die by his fault 

so he decided to cut ties with the high table at the same time the marquis talked about how wick winning would open a new sect so  many we could a story building where wick gets a following and goes against the high table dunno 

i love the ending because it gives john a perfect death but at the same time its open ended",2023-03-25
sorta but we learn that thats impossible  like a hydra another head will just grow in its place  the battle wouldve been everlasting,2023-03-26
yes which was quickly forgotten about after the first 15 minutes that’s why i dont think he’s dead that and the dogs reaction at the grave site,2023-03-25
yeah i wanted him to completely decimate all of the high table then die dying after killing a low level lackey essentially feels wrong,2023-03-26
"no the point was to be free of their influence  being free means he could die the man he was with helen and not the man he was before he wanted to shed that life represented at the end when he could finally discard all the items on him of that life that was weighing him down  ammo and even his belt 

consider that if he died while working his final burial wishes might not ever be honoured no eternal plot next to helen rather he would simply be made a guest of a dinnerreservation especially since the marquis explicitly said he wanted to  the myth around him and so erecting a tombstone would only add to his martyrdom",2023-03-26
he did but their members just get replaced “hercules and the hydra”,2023-04-30
agreed,2023-03-25
my interpretation of the post credit scene was that the daughter was being set up as the protagonist for the final chapter restarting the cycle of violence as she avenges her father john wick v the v is for vengeance,2023-04-01
he already killed 3 members of the ht before the events in osaka,2023-04-30
"you missed the point of my post if john wicks mission in going against the high table after the events at the end of the 2nd movie was to  a whole bunch of people coming after him  a random person in charge of those coming after him then die himself then he didnt need the duel

he wouldnt have needed to  his friend either he only needed to do that because he picked the duel option he could have just done what he intended to do before winston convinced him to do the duel   the marquis solo the duel was supposed to get the high table off his  but dying after killing the marquis would have done that anyway lol rendering everything he did after the end of the 2nd movie pointless the only thing he accomplished after killing dantonio is get a bunch of his friends killed for no reason",2023-03-27
it feels like they tacked on the death at the end because they wanted to ensure the series doesnt drag on and milked it was a perfect ending until then,2023-03-27

he lost a pistol duel to a guy who literally cant  see ,2023-04-16
hes also a very simple guy too he doesnt really make clever plans like winston the director said as much during a recent video i saw the franchise isnt really about outwitting the audience the only reason people debated the end of the third movie is because they overthought it,2023-03-24
that was before it was made clear hes taking on an ancient global order of assassins,2023-03-27

"right but and hear me out maybe they just dont write it that way that rule wasnt established until this movie so maybe just let him  the high table members since that would be the satisfying ending 

actually even going by the rules of this movie why not challenge each member of the table to singles combat for their seat at the table he could fight any of their challengers and then assign his own allies to the table one by one 

that would at least bookend these movies better we went from john wanting to desperately survive in jw3 so he can remember his wife to him accepting death after earning his freedom and killing a guy he didnt even know existed until 2 days ago not quite what is call good storytelling",2023-03-25

weve gone from having one mildly unbelievable bulletproof suit jacket to literally everyone and their mum wearing fully bulletproof tuxedos but still bringing small arms to shoot each other

weve gone from john nearly dying of a single stab wound in the first film to doing multiple 100ft drops onto solid objects and then walking away like its no issue",2023-03-25

maybe hes just there to show that its not just about money for some of these folks that seeing jon fight for love and his freedom inspired him too and he spared his dog so maybe he sees jon as more than just a bounty to collect idk the more i think about it the more confused i get lol",2023-03-27

" wick being dead shows that even if youre a master assassin who can defeat all the other greatest assassins in the world single handedly the table will still get you no matter what the cost

not really it showed that even though john died people can still fight back against the the high table its not so much about beating the high table its about showing them that youre not willing to take their  anymore 

look at from the perspective of a real world left wing rebel group something like the ypj in syria they might be outmatched outgunned and outnumbered but they still fight everyday to topple a tyrannical regime the high table is basically another bashar alassad all it takes is one person to fight back to show people that it is possible to fight back even the bowery king said he was inspired by johns act of rebellion and that was a man who was content just keeping the status quo intact two films ago",2023-03-24
wick wasnt an ideological leader but he represented that the high table wasnt so high he represented that the high table could be  with essentially he touched what was supposed to be untouchable,2023-03-25
"a bit of a late reply but the idea was that anybody with similar skill to john could now see what he was able to achieve and next time they are put in a position to choose they might just go like  and take their chances as we can see throughout the movies there are plenty of people with almost equal skill to john mr nobody caine the dude from chapter 2 girl with dogs from chapter 3 etc  


so the high table wanted to make sure he doesnt get a happy ending at all but since he did whats to stop another assassin with nothing to lose from just going wild and making them waste money and men on a chase again",2023-04-04

"you know id agree with them that the franchise has got to end and i would have been fine with this being the last john wick movie i just wish they would have done a better job at wrapping it up in my original reply to you i had written an even longer response but went over the character count by about 3500 characters so i had to trim it donw but there is just so much to say about why this movie is a disappointment to fans of the franchise thus far

i still dont understand why it ended the way it did it feels so disconnected from the previous movies why did john fight so hard the entire movie and  so many people to get the duel if he ultimately was going to let caine win john accomplished nothing in this movie and in his death he killed a man who up until this movie we had no idea existed and everything is basically reset to the way it was at the start of the movie except now john is dead it doesnt really feel like a satisfying end to the journey 

that interview you quoted is so depressing it sounds like they didnt put much thought or care into the ending and perhaps the poor feedback was due to the purpose of johns death and not his actual death itself like i previously said im fine with john wick dying in this movie i think its strange to end johns story on the 4th installment and not the 3rd or 5th but im ok with it i just wish they actually had him die for something meaningful i wonder if the test audiences felt the same way but the studio didnt pick up on that or want that maybe if they had established early on in this movie that john wanted out so he could die a free man id at least be able to say that his motivations throughout this movie made sense but watching chapter 3 and then chapter 4 the story is complete mess

i didnt realize it until after watching the movie but the original creator and writer of john wick 13 derek kolstad was not involved in chapter 4 in an interview i found from 2 years ago he said it was not his decision to no return so basically he was forced out of his own franchise and the reigns were handed over to one of the writers of chapter 3 and some one new in hindsight its completely obvious that chapter 4 is missing derek kolstad while chapter 3 certainly dips its toe into the unrealistic i suspect it was derek who held it back from what we got in chapter 4 

i think without derek kolstad the heart of the john wick journey was not there perhaps his plan for the story was ending the high table and collapsing the criminal underworld and like you said lionsgate wouldnt allow that whatever the reason i think this movie suffered from his lack of involvement

obviously the action is still there in this movie but i think the new writers dont seem to understand that a john wick movie should be about john having too many allies and adversaries that can  people with the skill and style of john wick make john look less special it started in chapter 3 when we saw sophia killing groups of people with the same moves as john and now everyone can fight waves of henchmen like its nothing that was supposed to be johns special ability and they have passed it off to eneryone else at least akira and caine used different weapons from john and had somewhat unique styles of fighting but others in the movie were just too overpowered and the script spent too long highlighting them over john john was supposed to be the man that when you got a call that your son stole his car you panicked now youd expect the same reaction if your son stole the car of anyone from chapter 4 and that makes the character of wick so much less special

hopefully lionsgate realizes that without john and his storymotivations these movies are nothing but generic action movies i dont want spinoffs and tv series that follow other characters in this world the world that was built is unique and interesting but only as a backdrop to the story of john everytime its explored in more detail it loses its magic and i suspect the more they expand the less interesting it will be and obviously the more action and fighting the include without john wick involved will just diminish his legend",2023-03-27
"im super late but to maybe offer the people above an explanation why this movie is getting so much praise

 the points they make are totally valid and in hindsight i agree with them but your argument is key here i think most viewers werent expecting realism or looking for gci or wondering why you wouldnt stop driving when theres a gunfight in the middle of the street i know i wasnt 

and if youre in that headspace the action is so fun and entertaining that the story around it can be serviceable at best and you will still love the movie",2023-05-28
my mistake then should have known they will watch out for it thanks,2023-04-12
yeah this movie was so much more like a cliched action movie than a john wick movie it felt like they just wanted to do things to make it look cool instead of doing cool things that made sense to the story,2023-05-23
"i think you’re right people want to believe in it and they do and compared to other movies come out recently it is incredibly good 

sometimes i wonder if the storyline consistently questions i ask in my head in the movie just don’t occur to the average viewer not that i’m even smart but millions of people will watch this and maybe they are genuine uncritical consumers",2023-03-26
"well the director speaks about him and keanu talking to the people at lionsgate about ending the john wick story to which they replied are you  crazy because john wick is their most popular franchise at the moment 

they replied to that by saying we thought this has to end eventually so we wanted to wrap things up properly 

seems like lionsgate was against killing wick so they tested an ending where the grave scene is more ambiguous but it tested poorly which isnt explained well but i assume people didnt like wicks death but they took it as them not liking the ambiguity 

so they changed it back to their original idea which was that wick dies period and the director says that they didnt really bother them again so they took that to say their original plans were right after all things ending with part 4

that portion of the article seems pretty clear to me about wick dying i dont know what else to tell you

the article you linked does seem to be more recent but this article still remains as factual information the director shared",2023-04-02
"you’re seriously thinking too hard while watching a john wick movie the action was still done really well in the arc de triumph sequence even though the circumstances were more over the top but that’s the final action sequence of a multimovie series it’s supposed to be a big bang

the first movie was more grounded because it was the introduction first movies are almost always that way did you want more pistol close combat for the end of the 4th movie they wanted to show you something you haven’t seen before and they delivered on multiple counts just enjoy it for what it is

edit to clarify i totally get what you’re saying about the action itself being realistic being conscious of needing to reload etc is why i initially liked the first movie i’m just saying they understandably wanted to up the ante with the 4th movie if they kept showing the same more realistic combat of the first move people would be complaining about being more of the same

my initial comment about them not taking themselves seriously was with the writing it’s always been selfaware and a bit cheeky with itself and the drama i agree it took the realism of its action seriously for the most part",2023-03-24

" i also think the movie implied that caine wasnt blind back when he was doing missions and had maybe blinded himself to force the high table to consider him too useless to force to keep working until the john situation happened

they did outright say this in the movie which makes it worse he blinded himself to be useless to them as an agent yet somehow hes the 2nd best combatant in the whole movie 

john was hesitant to  him maybe but they should have shown that by john whooping his  easily but not finishing the job john outright loses the first fight and is saved by marlos character and in the further fights hes at best evenwith a blind guywho wasnt blind until recently 10 years at mostto be useless as an assassinwithout superpowers",2023-03-29

marquis looks back to john who has raised his pistol still loaded with the unused final shot john fires hitting the marquis in the forehead killing him instantly  

the marquis originally named caine as his second and by right of combat was allowed to have caine fight in his stead which he does the act of coming over and taking the pistol from caine put him back in the duel",2023-04-01
okay tell me what happened in chapters 2 and 3 then in detail,2023-03-24
thats fine but i just dont think hes dead  they also announced john wick 5 in pandemic era but canceled due to delayed filming  im willing to bet we will get a 5 in like 2028 lol,2023-03-26
john wick 5 announced today officially,2023-05-26
"john building his myth even more than it already was over the course of the movies creates more assassins like nobody who dont properly respect the high table thats the entire problem the marquis is trying to nip in the bud by having john publicly killed

i mean its hard to disprove your point but my feeling is that the john wick universe always was full of bizarre characters and not every one of them is a friend of the high table or even care that much about it considering they put out a bounty on peoples had implies that a lot of the assassins are freelancers and do not really are directly employed by the high table like caine is then there is the bowery king who basically always hated the high table there is also perkins who didnt give a  about high table rules whatsoever 

x200b

so yeah there is enough evidence of people who never cared about the high table",2023-03-28
oh i agree and hes definitely alive imo  will probably hurt the box office too,2023-03-26
"yea i get that though ultimately in my opinion it was always going to end in him dying and he went out in the best possible way gets to help his friends and gains his freedom even if only for a minute he achieved his goal and then he gets to rest and return to his wife 

if this continued it would just continue and he would be a rat in a maze just trying to constantly find a way out this was his way out and in my opinion a beautiful way to go out

he was never going to get an opportunity to grieve they took that away from him in the 1st film second best option is be with his wife in the afterlife",2023-03-25
he changed his mind on that film after winston asked who hed rather die as john or the baba yaga,2023-03-25
"yea john wick 2 he got hit by multiple cars back to back the fall in john wick 3 was a lot further also if you noticed they conveniently bounce wick off of the environment before he hits the ground just to ease his way down to the ground lol 

sorry it took you out of the film i accepted what they were doing with the character this was never saving private ryan and this is not going full blown fast and the furious or marvel it sits in the middle",2023-03-25
"fortunately it was a highly stylized movie duel in a really good story so that isnt how they resolved it lol

however i could also totally imagine that dodging would be against the rules of the duel but they just didnt verbalize it in the film because it wasnt relevant",2023-03-27
hey there my point was that there are ways around the rules like how the marquis was technically allowed to try to  john before the duel  theres nothing in the rules that people cant touch john just that hes relieved of his duties and the bountys removed  others can still go after him regardless for revenge or any other reason like akira going after caine,2023-04-01
ana dearmas is great you’re tripping ,2023-04-13
reeves is confirmed as not just a cameo but a real character in the spin off,2023-08-28
“please let me go i don’t want to work here anymore these guys are weird” i’m paraphrasing,2023-03-30
well they all work for money in an unforgivable field of work and 40 million is a lot of money,2023-03-25
like the two dudes in chapter 3 that just go to sleep when john gives them an out to not die,2023-03-27
none of this is tax deductible have you seen our insurance premiums and dont even start about health insurance i get it were the big evil globe stretching bad guys but if nestle does costevaluations so must we does anyone here think were more evil than nestle exactly,2023-03-24
i wonder if its the case of it not being about the money but the message the principle you dont get to be above the rules just because youre a good the best fighter,2023-03-25
i appreciated at least the marquis right hand man had the position of yo so i dont think murdering hotels really adds to the solution at all here,2023-03-27
i get that but trying to  john wick made them look weaker than shooting some guy just cover it up,2023-03-25
every two bob assassin wouldve died by the end of the first film thats the type of goon that john kills in buckets,2023-03-28
was bob supposed to be bit,2023-03-26
"not tricked forced john basically retired by forming a marker with the italian guy the italian guy said that so long as john does not work as an assassin again he will honor his word and will not use the marker however due to the russian thing in the 1st movie john was technically working again and the italian guy considered it fair game to call john back into the life and gave him his sisters name 

john was excommunicated because he conducted business on continental ground at the end of the 2nd movie by killing the italian guy out of anger that he forced john back into the life 

the 3rd and 4th movie is basically him trying to shoot his way out of the situation that he brought himself in at the end of movie 2 he couldnt but at least on the way caine got out",2023-06-20
"it wouldnt even be brag worthy only to the lowest forms of intelligence 

congratulations for killing a guy who has killed hundreds of people taken beatings stabbings bullets falls car wrecks while not needing much sleep or rest or nutrition without getting much of if not any break 

thats like someone at full energy challenging someone to a 100m sprint at full after that person just ran the berkeley marathon or just finished  week

sort of makes me lose respect for every other character in the movie especially winston and the old guy who seems to be the new spokesperson for the high table with the scar on his face and snaps his fingers at the end",2023-05-26
yeah he was released from all his obligations and given complete freedom which really feels very short sighted but the marquis was definitely set up for an egotistical exit,2023-03-26
"hiring a blind guy who couldnt see who he was shooting at so john might hesitate was tipping the scales more than hiring a guy who could simply shoot someone in the head from 20m

its fine it was a narrative decision in a movie thats just for fun but i thought it was funny",2023-03-29
do you know any guys who  400 people for a dog this is a movie this is fiction john wick has taken 200 bullets over the course of the franchise and only 3 of them  him weird thing to suddenly break your suspension of disbelief,2023-10-20
i think clearing his name killing his adversary facilitating the rebuild of the continental and saving his friendfriend’s daughter is the best way john wick could ever hope to die a headshot would be awful storytelling imo,2023-03-30
when the king asks if hes in heaven or  winston says who knows i took that to mean hes probably alive,2023-05-30
"i thought they left it in a nice place for either wrapping up the series or bringing him back for more ie does keanu want to do more i thought shamier andersons arc ended flat enough that i wondered if theyd continue the series from his perspective i loved him right up until the end when he was just there

eta regarding the cheapness of bringing him back i bet they could play it off as needing it to look as real as possible to let wick be outout",2023-03-27
"those who cling to life find only death and those who embrace death live  


i dont remember the exact quote because it was weeks ago that i saw it but thats repeated multiple times in the movie",2023-04-10
sherlock faking his death to beat moriarty is part of the lore its the solution to the final problem,2023-04-29
id like for keanu to play a background character with his back facing the audience and as hes turning his head the protagonist moves back into the shot,2024-03-26
lol we literally finished 3 and headed out the door to head to the theater for 4 less than five minutes later,2023-04-10
"the dog’s ear’s perking uphead tilt definitely makes me think that they’d be ablewilling to bring john back if the story demanded it

but the more i think on it i’m good with this this is good",2023-03-26
i think its because at that point he had nothing to fight for any more for the first time really in the series he won and like nearly every character in the series had been telling him he was nothing with out that life so instead of fight on and force himself to keep going and survive he just let it happen,2023-03-26
"it definitely would ruin this movie as an ending but i think caine dies after the postcredits scene ends and that that means john is alive their last exchange was the man who clings to life dies and the man who clings to death lives

caine clung to life hoping he could escape his damnation to live with his daughter again so he should be killed by akira 

john spent the whole movie with people telling him he would die eventually he accepts his death telling winston what he wanted on his tombstone since he spent the entire franchise clinging to and bringing death he should still be alive",2023-03-26
"only to die because of a single belly shot an arm shot and a shoulder shot

well theres also all the physical trauma from the rest of the movie he didnt exactly arrive to that duel unscathed",2023-03-27
what i really hate is how hard it is to figure out without somehow seeing a spoiler for the movie youre about to watch i guess best we can do now is just turn our phones on and immediately google it after finishing the movie or wait,2023-04-02
i figured after the animated credits stayed after those and when it went to regular credits the lights came on so i figured we were done,2023-04-16
you had to  why not just go back after you did you didnt care if there was an after credits scene you left because you wanted to,2023-04-04
i leaned over to my brother in the cinema and said its in hiroyukis contract to have at least 1 samurai scene in all of his movies right before he faced caine haha,2023-04-03
we already have nobody tho,2023-04-03
,2023-03-24
i’m very sure,2023-03-26
you cant handle the tooth,2023-04-06
i ended up watching some of his youtube videos  the way he played his character in jw4 was perfection  the sleaziness of it the way his grin flashed his yellow teeth it was like the penguin on crack in the best way  i think a lot of it has to go to the director he has an incredible eye for these shots  im going to be looking forward to more from him i think hes doing a ghost of tsushima adaptation next,2023-03-26
"mostly by watching a good number of martial arts movies most of the guys above became popular outside of hollywood since theres a good amount of martial arts movies being made in foreign cinema donnie yen is one of hong kongs top action stars and newer actors like cecep rahman and yayan ruhian got their big break by featuring in the indonesian movies raid 1 and raid 2 which is absolutely insane btw worth watching for the crazy fight choreography

scott adkins was super popular for playing the villain yuri boyka in the undisputed film franchise and went on to have roles in movies like ninja expendables ip man etc essentially since there arent too many actors that have the acting chops  physicality  martial arts background needed for movies like john wick that emphasize fight choreography you tend to see familiar names being casted

scott adkins has an awesome youtube channel with a playlist called the art of action where he interviews fellow martial artists that have featured in hollywood and elsewhere heres a link if youre interested in this kind of stuff ",2023-03-29
that would be insane throw in joe taslim as well ,2023-04-03
ha i am glad i am not the only one and you saw that as well i was like wow this is kind of inspired casting oh wait  did coogan work his  of to get this fight choreography down,2023-03-26
i was paying as much attention to the extras in that scene as the action saw several people look at the  going on in shock and horror then go right back to dancing hah,2023-03-25
i like to think its a nightclub for assassins they are like man i dont want to deal with work right now ugh,2023-03-25
i thought this too that or its an assassins nightclub perhaps and they arent phased,2023-04-19
its cantonese and people from hong kong with english that good always adopt an english name,2023-04-08
the magnesium needs oxygen in the air to combust so it wont be that much hotter than usual use,2023-04-08
yeah max payne 3 was done in the style of man on fire max payne 1 and 2 were stillframed comic book style,2023-03-27
"oh for sure

which matrix references did you spot for me the most chillinducing one was the speed ramped scene of him punching scott adkins’ character in the pouring rain

 it was almost overwhelming for some reason it really called back to his fight with agent smith in revolutions i felt",2023-03-24
oh i haven’t seen the warriors in ages,2023-04-03
awesome tunes but it really felt redundant the second time around,2023-04-03
and to be even more specific it was genesis x phantom remix from woman worldwide going into i believe pursuit by gesaffelstein,2023-03-24
thank you,2023-05-23
probably for logistics perhaps,2023-04-03
i was just responding right after seeing the movie on the train duly noted though,2023-04-07
they did have a shot of the glico man,2023-03-29
ngl took me a while to realize that it took place on dotonbori until i saw the glico man and especially the giant dragon statue which makes me realize that its sotenbori of the yakuza games which makes me remember the original location that inspired sotenbori lol,2023-03-31
meanwhile people who played yakuza games will do the leonardo dicaprio finger pointing meme when watching the iconic dotonbori scenery,2023-06-01
cgi  lots of it in that scene but still worked well,2023-03-26
due to how phosphorus burns it wouldnt be ideal to put it in a shotgun itd be a lot more dangerous to the user if anything goes wrong vs these dragons breath rounds its not stuff you want to  with which is why its a war crime to use it,2023-03-27
dragons breath is intended as an emergency signal to show your location in an emergency like if youre lost while hunting youll have kept a few rounds of it in your kit to shoot in the air when you think someones nearby,2023-03-29
he was also loose with his stabbing finger during berlin,2023-04-04
charon and winston turn up too,2023-03-24
which never made sense before but having seen jw4 we now know why,2023-03-24
hey i didn’t know  mybad,2023-03-24
two spinoffs as we are getting a continental tv show as also,2023-04-03
most deff just replying with a dumb assumption of what  say not what i want,2023-06-06
the director has even said it the continuation of the franchise always rely on people wanting to see more and after 4 i demand moreee,2023-03-24
thats crazy for an rrated movie,2023-03-24
i went to the 1210 show and my theater was pretty packed as well,2023-03-24
"i went to a 300 imax showing and everyone was cheering clapping and flinching it was awesome and this is arizona so everyone also went wild everytime the dog did his thing
also my edible shot kicked in during the house scene in paris so it was a wild ride at the most insane part of the movie i was in heaven lol",2023-03-25
this 100 i went to see it on a friday at 11am it was packed i live in a smaller town,2023-03-25
"absolutely same thing here i went tonight sunday and its easily the most packed ive seen a theater since covid hit that wasnt opening night as avatar was packed 

movies always hit so differently when more people are there felt so good and made going to see this so much fun holy jesus this was such a good movie 

scott adkins was fcking phenomenal the dragons breath scene was nuts and amazing such a great time",2023-03-27
i think the only movie ive seen with more people in the seats was the black widow movie because people were excited to see a marvel movie in theaters again,2023-03-26
hi from a month later theatre was packed yesterday though theres only two theatres showing the movie right now due to the mario movie taking all the screens,2023-04-24
i could very well potentially see the fifth film being a standalone prequel depicting the “impossible task” john undertook to leave in the first place — to have the end be the beginning in a bittersweet fashion,2023-03-24
and if they do a sequel we can get a godfatherlike scene of john wick saying they keep pulling me back in,2023-03-25
i was hoping the end credit scene was john surfing off of some island in the south pacific,2023-03-27
agreed,2023-03-24
the king is such a great character,2023-04-04
will it though i feel like i remember spiral not doing too hot,2023-03-24
my brother in christ they made that movie already its called john wick,2023-04-01
tbf that is still very open,2023-03-26
ok you can tell yourself whatever makes you feel better,2023-12-31
the damage is not too bad as long as the foundations are still strong we can rebuild this place it will become a haven for all assassins and dogs of the underworld ,2023-03-29
we let that stand in dallas for like 3 weeks one time failed demo th projected ads onto it,2023-03-29
fair enough you remembered more derails than i just seems like weve talked so much about the council but spent so little time showing them in action directly,2023-03-25
weve also seen the marquis and the harbinger who are its handlers apparently and we know that the tarasovs must have been part of the high table as well because they got john wick out by asking him to do a job we know that only the high table can give people that kind of freedom so it stands to reason tarasov was part of the table,2023-03-26
didnt katia say they were under the table,2023-03-27
totally different movie and one that’s been done to death including by yen,2023-04-30
the intro scene of wick hunting down the elder in the desert and how it did zilch in stopping the high table was quite telling and definitely set the tone which was reemphasized by winstons hercules vs hydra analogy later on,2023-03-25
actually i think youre onto something if they do another one it has to end with the status quo still in place,2023-03-24
i kinda feel like they answered that when winston was talking to john at charons plaque john insists that  just go  marquis and winston just interrogates him on where it finally ends and that the high table is just a hydra to his hercules to win he must beat them at their own game,2023-04-07
"i thought this was the idea and why they were originally going to shoot 4  5 at the same time the ill  them ill  them all line from 2 at least to me meant this isnt over until the entire structure of power that made me do this is irradicated

but after he reunited with his family in berlin  isnt he part of the hightable himself now",2023-03-27
i agree i think john realizes theres no point in trying to beat the table so instead he shows you can beat the system by winning his freedom and caines by extension and in death he becomes an even bigger legend that really disrupts what the table has going on so just like his coming back to life in the first movie set things in motion his death can also do the same,2023-03-26
yeah i feel like the point would be killing the entire table itself would be killing the heart versus any of their heads,2023-03-27
but we don’t actually know that since we’ve haven’t really met the hydra the high table,2023-03-26
he did  members of the high table we see three killed on screen problem is they just get replaced,2023-04-30
he beat the high table and died a martyr one man can’t overthrow the system but he can definitely start a revolution,2023-04-30
"sure but it seems strange to continue the john wick story without john wick 

and caine is a more similar character to john wick the only reason he was involved was because the high table had leverage over him with his daughter just like john was forced back in by a marker they are forced into doing things they don’t want to do but must do it anyway all while resentful that the table is making them do it i think akira and caine will have a common enemy by the end but john should still be involved it’s his story",2023-04-01
ahhh i see in that we agree it felt totally pointless like a movie until that final minute and then he died roll credits made me and my friends just go what lol i mean i still highly enjoyed the movie,2023-03-28
no he won the duel hes free to go by their own rules,2023-04-08
hed have to  every member of every family of the table at the very least and we have no idea how deep that goes,2023-03-24
"and then the 4th movie opens with him killing the one who sits above the table

you dont do that if you arent interested in severely  up the organization as a whole",2023-04-08
produced by the the codirector of the first wick movie too,2023-04-09
did you not see them penetrating walls and skewering the bulletproof armor they were definitely special arrows,2023-04-02
bro regularass arrows have crazy  and a lot of bulletproof armors may as well be wet tissue paper to them,2023-05-14
the body of kingpin but the agility of spiderman did you see those kicks,2023-04-01
dont forget the guy who actually took an arrow to the knee in osaka too,2023-04-02
,2023-05-31
"i can suspend my disbelief for a lot of stuff ridiculous is fine
the universe they build around his character makes the beatings he takes and walksstaggers away from sufficiently reasonable even the 7 cars hitting him within 15 minutes was not a problem maybe apart from the fact that it made me and my friends actually start counting them

but when it is clear that you force yourself to keep rolling down stairs that is a completely different thing rolling all the way down would have been fine but they made it look like he was trying to roll all the way down bad choreographyexecution

same problem with lots of the fights where the bad guys are way too obviously playing into the hits the efficient violence that made john wick a bad  was turned into a over choreographed  and super obviously telegraphed  fight ballet that just makes it look dumb",2023-03-27
"caine john and koji with the old guard assassin vibes where there was honor and respect amongst those in the business vs the new blood who just are out for the cashnotoriety was really cool to see its a nice contrasting world build which is pretty dope addition to a franchise thats done a rather insane job at world building 

really sad to not see more of hiroyuki sanadas character but nice to know donnie yens is alive for now",2023-03-28
i agree now after ten days,2023-04-03
yes and its a normal thing to do and doesnt mean wick wasnt dead if anything it just reinforced the attachment the bowery king had to his empire  title and showed that johns final wishes were honoured,2023-03-26
no…why would i be,2023-03-24
marvel since over 10 years ago i dont know when this trend actually started but even the super mario bros movie has a postcredit scene lol,2023-06-13
"lol 

marvel has conditioned me to check before any franchise film just in case at least you have a great excuse to watch again",2023-03-24
"not sure why you were downvoted  i agree with you 

but its interesting that your theatre turned on the lights the theatre that i went to kept the lights off so everyone stayed for the after credits scene",2023-03-24
"its socially agreed upon

no it isnt",2023-04-03
this thing is a bot that is programmed to  every 30 minutes  or it’s a seriously deranged person that the fbi should be watching,2023-03-25
that’s why i always google when lights turn on,2023-03-25
ah i see this is your first sequel,2023-03-26
i agree not to say the first one’s “style” is better than the more recent style but the difference was jarring to me for a bit took a while to get used to the more typical actiony stuff,2023-03-26
who cares lol it’s fun and has great cinematography they aren’t making casablanca here i would much rather have good characters and a fun movie than realistic action for this type of film,2023-03-26
absolutely right  the first was great because it wasnt what the sequels are,2023-03-26
the bulletproof suit was never just “mildly” unbelievable,2023-03-29
i was thinking that too and it still may be true,2023-08-05
i think the only other thing shed be good at would be singing roles which is why she was pretty great in pitch perfect,2023-03-26
well you just gave away all of it jk kind of,2023-03-25
a head canon based on what,2023-04-01
he speaks in russian because he is speaking to john who is russian dont overthink it if wick was japanese hed be saying sayonara,2023-03-26
winston isnt russian though so it would make sense his wife isnt either,2023-03-25
this is a learning point for me while belarus and russia are separate today is there a distinct cultural identity,2023-03-26
not the same iirc the tarasovs were a strictly american operation that had no european presence,2023-03-24
they didnt get the joke shame the damage the ff movies did to viewers ,2023-03-31
ive just brought you back up to a 1 ,2023-04-03
didnt know that thanks for the info,2023-03-26
yeah most people dont seem to watch those  i find it fascinating seeing stuff like that with keanu being pulled around on a motorcycle prop by guys in head to toe greenscreen suits,2023-03-24
that had to be a satisfying day at work lol,2023-03-25
"to his credit fella looks noticeably tired after each long fight sceneshootout

as far as his training 

now look his groupings arent perfect hes no master marksman but hes fast and mostly in the a zone there for most of his shots

to my surprise a lot of celebrities have went shooting at taran to better their skills in action movies so its a great phenomenon for all moviegoers that chad wanted keanu to train for real here",2023-04-03
disagree its my least favourite i think set pieces were great but something about this one just didnt hit like the others,2023-03-29
"and even then arrows could sometimes  depending on a variety of factors but yeah armor without the smooth curved deflective qualities of full plateaka modern ballistic armordoesnt help much against arrows if the archer is equipped with arrows designed to pierce armor more slender shaft diameter hardenedsteel tip heavier arrows 

but a heavy compound bow using regular field tips or broadbeads will not  class iv plates they will go through soft armor all day though",2023-03-26
its been years since i saw the first three but as far as i can remember the only real issues people have with the high table stem from backing wick after he shot the guy in the continental,2023-03-24
honestly thought mr nobody would become the new marquis due to his tracking abilities in finding john and actually getting  done himself,2023-03-30
whod be the main char i wonder,2023-03-24
john wick has literally been about a dude going after people who abuse their power since the first movie  it would be the logical conclusion for him to go after the people who let such abuse go unchecked despite claiming to have rules,2023-03-25
the director’s own words are “if the guy really existed” you’re interpreting his words incorrectly,2023-03-25
he takes down targets hes a hitman literally born and bred for it he defines the art and the art defines him,2023-04-30
"yeah i definitely see your point they should have gone more insane like shoot him into space maybe

i dont know how they could have done it and still kept the tone they needed to though

im not disappointed because i cant think of a better solution to that story vs action problem at the end 

but i can certainly see how it is disappointing to you",2023-03-24
enough time for fishburns face wounds to heal,2023-04-02
he’s flamboyantly unassuming it’s noticeable and endearing that john speaks really strangely and doesn’t have a lot to say it’s his aesthetic in a world where others are louder and brighter,2023-03-26
im not asking for quips they did john wick with the appropriate amount of personality in the first 3 movies he came off as a guy that just had a lobotomy in this 4th movie,2023-03-24
yep thats the only possible solution to his really stilted dialogue,2023-03-25
and hes older too not a spring chicken anymore hard injuries take a bigger toll on you as you get older john and his friends are just built different,2023-03-28
"ehhh i feel like if you wanna talk while watching a movie watch it at home 

you might want to discuss a given moment but that doesn’t mean the ppl sat near you do",2023-03-28
"the guy i was sitting next to had clearly seen it before because he kept saying the things they were about to say two minutes before it happened kinda ruined it for me tbh

give me a name",2023-03-31
ok lol,2023-03-29
the only one crying here is you  stop embarrassing yourself,2023-03-25
"its absolutely got to do with the lack of derek massively so as you say in your comments this movie feels starkly different to the first three and outright disconnected 

you bring up this very interesting point i hadnt thought about which is how wick started as this mystical figure who can  anyone which is expressed through the action in the movies but then you bring many people who can basically do the same making wick seem like just any other assassin in this world 

i think its like you say this wouldnt be as much of a problem if the other assassins were starkly different with their fighting or at least visibly less good but everyone is a killing machine even a literal blind man 

you know i knew this movie was to a very bad start when they  lance reddicks character who was someone everyone in the fandom absolutely loved and he dies pathetically with a goofy shocked face before hes shot felt like they were already  on the franchise with that you know we  this character who was so slick serious and capable as weve seen in the past 3 movies and we do it like its nothing 

to further  on his grave winston gets his continental back like its nothing so what was the point we know lance has unfortunately passed now but this movie was filmed and written before his death 

if this movie had a better ending and they had handled things better to continue keeping wick as this ultimate assassin id be excited about the spin offs but now im not who cares if john shows up in the ballerina spin off it takes place before 4 and after 3 we know where hes gonna end up 

and then we got interviews or  showing up like akiras actress would like a spin off nobody spinoff caine like so jw4 was just a movie to pointlessly  wick and create more spin off potential 

dont people hate  like this nowadays why are they suddenly okay with it maddening",2023-03-27
the problem is it was the second ascend after he already fell down so the whole going up the stairs was much longer,2023-04-12
yeah exactly i think worse part for me was killing off you know who so soon in the movie i didnt like that lol,2023-05-23
" i feel like im being consistent in what i liked and didnt like and i said the movie was decent overall i mentioned that i actually did like some of the action set pieces specifically the hotline miami scene the club fight with the  dude and most of the tokyo continental stuff that was all memorable and enjoyable 

we both can agree that there are no stakes because we know hes going to survive and this isnt game of thrones and because there are no stakes it becomes purely about getting enjoyment out of the action setpieces which we all expect from this type of movie but it felt like for every memorable fight scene there was also an equally unmemorable dragged out action scene that did not need to be in the movie and didnt bring anything new or interesting in terms of action dude this movie was nearly 3 hours long whereas the previous 3 were 1h40 2h and 2h10 like i could have easily skipped the entire paris fighting sequences including the stair fight fast forwarded right to the duel for example",2023-04-14
the funniest take ive ever seen about movies if people disagree with me its because they are lying to themselves and want to pretend their opinion is valid but really my criticism is the law of the land,2023-10-03
"thats not how the movie actually views at all the grave scene was ambiguous you literally cant tell me we watched the same movie if there was any clear indication that he died 

his story may have concluded but again theres nowhere explicit in the director comments that hes dead",2023-04-02
"im not thinking too hard im pointing out the things that got on the way of my enjoyment of the movie when you notice something you simply cant let it go ive been watching marvel movies lately and the cgi has been awful so its made it easier for me to point out when the usage of it is bad 

that scene is amazing in writing but it was executed sloppily it did not feel real just completely over the top in a fast and furious kind of way from getting ran over like three times in that scene alone and brushing it off to the amounts of cgi cars with disappearing drivers the flying cgi rag dolls disappearing bodies and the fact you could tell they simply were not there 

this was never the case with past wick movies they always filmed on location because they never did these insane over the top scenarios they couldnt even do the final scene at the sacre coeur on location its just them in front of a green screen and it shows it was really hard to pay attention 

maybe you and most people are okay with over the top indestructible john wick but thats not what made me love this franchise and character i do not watch fast and furious i do not watch ridiculous over the top action i like realism and meticulousness you know what made john wick such a revolutionary action franchise 

and even the close quarters combat here was made sloppily for the most part",2023-03-24
use the ranime way what the spoiler is about content about the spoiler,2023-03-27
what it happens literally after all the credits play,2023-03-29
its wrong for them to take your l  thats your property  not theirs,2023-03-28
so then what marquis said wouldnt release him from the duel no they were still fighting,2023-03-26
"it absolutely is a superpower universe have you been watching any of the movies

how many times has john wick fallen from heights now that would turn anyone into a mist",2023-03-30
"
agreed its not a superpower

hes just that good",2023-04-01
"maybe im remembering wrong but wasnt john pointing a loaded gun at him when caine asked are you dead john and couldnt tell where he was

most of my favorite stuff with caine was stuff like him still firing in the general direction of stuff after opponents were already down but he didnt seem to know that i had a fun time with it personally and i wasnt too bothered by the oh no its not realistic if they dont have actual super powers aspect",2023-03-29
" marquis when choosing cards making a demand that winston and john will be both killed

nah he reminded winston of the rule that the second would also be killed it wasnt a onesided condition of the duel",2023-03-27
no one’s trying to impress you dumb  it’s sharing a story,2023-04-17
didnt  anybody important did you miss the part where he killed the marquis main man the guy who was slapping john wick around the stairs,2023-03-31
they cancelled because the director said no reeves has been pretty open about what’s happened and while we probably all wish it wasn’t the case thought it was a fitting end for the character,2023-03-26
did you seriously go back 2 months of conversations to do this,2023-05-26
"i understand but he didnt really help anyone if he was going to die why drag it out he got the manager of the osaka hotel killer and now his daughter is out to  caine the man he died to save so ultimately he condemned multiple friends to death in this film 

i think the more fitting end is wick dismantling the high table or at least inserting his allies into positions at the table seeing as his vengeance against the table has been his driving force for the last 2 movies the marquis is not a member of the table and john didnt even know of his existence within the organization until winston told him in this same movie",2023-03-25
"sorry but this is absolutely fast and furious levels of make believe at this point 

he has always been shown to suffer real injuries and consequences frok injuries yes he has taken a knife to gut and continued on but he also required a doctor 

youll have to remind me of the multiple cars he got hit by in jw2 i just rewatched it last week and dont remember back to back cars hitting him he was driving a car and got hit while inside a car and he got knocked out of the car when another car hit his car and a car came directly at him but he rolled out of the way if there is a scene of him being hit by multiple cars please share it with me 

falling 3 stories out a window and hitting a car on the way down is not something any one can walk away from and that was the least ridiculous of his injuries",2023-03-25
"well the other guy decided he could just jump in at the end and shoot john while hes on the ground  so who knows  

basically it was the dumbest possible endingclimax to conclude john wick saga if that truly is the way john dies   but if hes alive in jw5 then all is good",2023-03-27
except no one tried killing him when there wasnt a massive payday hanging over his head free of the high table  no contract  no bounty hunters or waves of lowlevel assassins gunning for him,2023-04-01
wasn’t the ana de armas spin off the bond one is she also doing a wick one,2023-05-12
it didnt reach 40mil until the climax of the movie though in the original they were all committing suicide by wick for just 2 mil,2023-03-28
they gave him two chances at rematch tho and then he gave them both a chance to live and they used it d,2023-04-09
that was probably my favorite part he couldn’t beat them they knew he wouldn’t quit he is inevitable so they gave up,2024-01-14
it means nonplayer character in this case that would be those that are no assassins,2023-04-06
i read this in ian mcshanes voice,2023-03-24
amazing,2023-03-25
thats entirely the point of it all is it not if you let wick go then it gives a green light to any fighter who could be just as good,2023-03-26
well they explicitly said it’s about the message and following rules that’s what the entire 4th film is about what are men if not for rules no,2023-03-26
they explained it is that in the movie,2023-03-27
he wasn’t his right hand if you’re talking about caine,2024-01-14
"i think it would be more chilling let john be the man who won let the next guy wonder if theyre as good as john wick let that be the bar 

oh you want to break the rules of the table one man did he killed 400 people he burnt down a hotel he hunted down the marquis do you think youre as good as john wick because thats the only way you survive this",2023-03-26
you get he’s an arrogant  from his lines but i love that the movie sets up how much a rich  he is by having him doing the most rich boy  every single time he’s reintroduced it’s so funny,2023-03-26
i also think caine knew john never fired so knew what  about to unfold hence asked to be released from his obligations before handing the gun,2023-03-28
he wanted jw to see him give a pardon to the man that defeated jw to see the freedom that jw could have had but lost,2023-05-02
a blind guy who cant see what he is shooting at is really underselling the character lol,2023-03-29
your examples have justifications there is none for caines abilities they reference wuxia but incorporate nothing from it,2023-10-20
i think that he is most likely dead i think that there is a chance that they retcon it because of the financial success of this one but i interpret the ending to be that he found redemption and hope in the fact that he had saved cainehis daughter,2023-04-03
at the very least keanu clearly likes playing this character and will probably return if the paycheck is good enough and its not going to destroy him physically  he could just as well transition into a mentor role,2023-06-08
isnt that exactly what happened caine got knifed and john ,2023-05-23
it is also a retcon since conan doyle hated writing the character and wanted him dead,2023-05-23
"yeah he basically has to have a motivation to keep himself alive helen knew this thats why she gave him the dog then it was to  tarasov for vengeance then the italian guy gave him a mission then he needed to avenge his betrayal then he needed to clear his name which involved helping and being betrayed by winston and then finally when he clears his name he dies

no more motivation hes a man of sheer  will but theres no more need for it so he just accepts that hes done",2023-03-26
that was referring to the fakeout they pulled with the dueling pistols john lived by faking death and taking the life of the marquis who would otherwise have been the living winner of the duel,2023-03-27
those stairs alone would be plenty,2023-03-28
haha whats your  problem lol,2023-04-04
it prob sucks to always be shoehorned as samurai dude,2023-04-07
his maniacle laugh cracked me up,2023-03-26
i thought you meant scott adkins for ghost of tsushima and i’m just like … who would he play lol,2023-04-15
yesss,2023-04-13
i was thinking if the german guy just called out to his dancers wick would have been outnumbered and people started evacuating the club after the german was dead,2023-05-09
"im 99 sure the punches from the main henchman against john at the arch de triumph were the same combo agent smith gave him in the subway fight

the club punches into chest combo",2023-03-25
the rain for sure and also the subway scene gave me big matrix vibes,2023-03-24
for matrix waiting for the train,2023-03-30
there was a great callback to the first matrix all the assassins entering the building after wick similar shots to the cops and agents going after morpheus and crew after the dejavu happened,2023-03-26
hate and glory i had thought,2023-04-05
was reddick able to film the cameo for that already,2023-03-26
"elaborate 

i dont know anything about ballerina lol",2023-03-24
longest movie of the franchise and its probably the best one since the first granted a lot of the fighting was exhausting but i think that was the point,2023-03-26
"i think it ended pretty well and gave john a good way out to finish his story bringing him back for the sake of
sequels would just devalue everything that’s been done",2023-03-27
not only was my showing packed but i’d never seen the parking lot that full since the first avengers came out over 10 years ago,2023-03-25
2pm and 3pm shows over here were crazy packed today too only seats available were the undesirable front seats  this movies gonna  it in the box office,2023-03-26
very odd everyone else here has said their showings were nearly full which can be good or bad luckily the audience at my showing was fairly respectful,2023-03-27
i kinda wish they would make the end of this movie final and make the fifth film a prequel finally showing us what the impossible task was,2023-04-09
aye keanu is getting old cant keep doing this but i can see him as an underground king,2023-03-27
borabora,2023-04-01
spiral came out fairly soon after the covid vaccine rolled out but a lot of people were still being cautious about going to theaters then even with all that it made its money back 406m on a 20m budget with the resurgence of theaters after last year id bet this one will do better than spiral did,2023-03-24
nah,2023-04-01
i dont need to buddy its obvious for anyone that can add 22 sorry you need things spelled out for you why would they have an after credits scene to establish the next movie if the character the movie is named after is dead,2023-12-31
one of the conditions for the duel was that they rebuilt it with money from the table lol,2023-03-24
"she did

one of the ruska roma sits at the high table hence the family challenge but it is unknown who",2023-04-02
maybe im just going based off the wiki tbh but in order for jw to be able to challenge in a duel he needed to be in a family of the table so i figure she was at the table after her fathers dead,2023-03-27
"there are lots of ways to leave the status quo in place while still letting it feel like john wick actually achieved something 

john kills off a generation of seats and leads to the reshuffling of the organization the high table still exists but the 12 main seats are held by new familiesorganizations including the ruska roma or maybe john kills a few seats duels some actual members and achieves a status as standing beside the table as an independent check on egregious abuses by the 12 seats or any number of other options 

instead he kills off some random mook and doesnt even get to enjoy his prize and it was a prize that didnt even feel like what hes been fighting for during the past 3 movies just something he decided to settle for since everyone kept telling him that revenge was impossible",2023-03-27
they dont really need to just set up revenge plotlines much like the end of this film,2023-03-24
was that crime family connected to the one he killed in the first movie,2023-04-30
"i agree i think john realizes theres no point in trying to beat the table so instead he shows you can beat the system by winning his freedom and caines by extension and in death he becomes an even bigger legend that really disrupts what the table has going on so just like his coming back to life in the first movie set things in motion his death can also do the same

did john actually have beef with the high table though the only reason for the high table to be against him is because he killed on continental grounds john said hed  the entire high table but realistically there is no reason for him to do so",2023-03-27
heracles beat the hydra by cauterizing it i think john would have to do something similar,2023-04-30
they’ve had multiple high table members show up,2023-03-26
you do because winston told us  the audience  that’s how it works,2023-03-27
yeah precisely i still enjoyed the vast majority of the movie the cinematography was brilliant i just think the duel thing was pointless and his death in that manner kinda ruined the point of the previous movie,2023-03-28
if this universe had any common sense itd have been after jw3 that being draconian in their laws is not a very wise thing to do the organization thins themselves out but at the same time there are infinite assassins and i dont see the directorwriters thinking about that anytime soon,2023-03-24
lol,2023-05-15
i was thinking the exact thing big boi knocked john around with a couple head kicks thats some flexibility right there,2023-04-01
"paraphrased from memory definitely worsewritten than the actual lines

caine he doesnt have a marker on you you owe him nothing

koji youve fallen far if you think a marker is all that matters

just great stuff worldbuilding the old guard in contrast to the new kids",2023-04-04
maybe the daughter will get a spin off and we’ll see more of hiroyuki sanada,2023-03-28
it is but it’s meant to put the idea in your mind that he might not be dead,2023-03-26
to mess with people but thanks just looked it up,2023-03-24
even marvel is usually mid credit not completely at the end,2023-11-04
ive been watching more movies and noticed that even outside marvel nearly half of movies have a mid or post credits scene surprisingly common but popularized in pop culture by marvel,2023-03-25
what was the scene i left,2023-03-24
agreed everyone knows the rules  i waited until the lights came up then left  i should’ve known better  not cool alamo,2023-03-24
"not sure why you were downvoted

i think its the it was socially agreed upon assumption when it never was",2023-04-03
thoughts ideas and connections,2023-04-03
head cannons don’t necessarily need to be based on any evidence,2023-04-10
"is he not i know he only spoke russian over wicks gravestone i just assumed i guess

how do we know winston isnt russian",2023-03-25
there is but a lot of eastern europe culturally crosspollinates especially with the soviet unions bygone efforts to build a singular identity across their member states keanus family spoke only russian though despite the belarusian descent,2023-03-26
now i wonder how john ended up working for the tarasovs kinda hope they make visual novels or comics about a little of johns life when he was still part of the whole high table community,2023-03-24
i guess it just highlights mcu fans from actual comics nerds,2023-03-31
people hold onto some weird fantasies about the stunts keanu does not do stunts he doesnt take big falls or do the dangerous bike things his stunt double does it keanu does most of the fight scenes,2023-03-24
john has the cheat code to disable fall damage,2023-04-04
i dont think we see anyone else having any issues with the high table because thats obviously not the story being told but i always got the impression from the bowery king that certain people werent particularly happy about having to serve the high table i could be wrong but his actions and words speak to him in particular not liking the high table,2023-03-24
this isnt true the bowery king didnt break any rules and didnt help john after he killed in the continental but was still censured by the high table for helping john  one of their members,2023-03-27
the high table’s issue is more than a few people chose to back john wick over them,2023-03-25
there are several options akira caine mr nobody,2023-03-24
"not really hes been all about revenge from the start he doesnt care what people do with their power he cares about people wronging him personally and he goes after them

its been pretty clear from the start that he has no interest whatsoever in power himself and just wants to be left alone the only reason he fights is that he doesnt give up and doesnt let anyone wrong him

the marquis said it perfectly john has nothing to live for nothing to die for and no particular  for killing once he runs out of scores to settle john has nothing whatsoever to live for

so him dying at the end of the movie was the only fitting end",2023-03-25
so in his happy ending he’s still a hit man,2023-04-30
"i think the way he died was very deliberate the movie sets up clear rules surrounding death and injury rule 1 when a character succumbs to their injuries we either see their lifeless stare charon and killa or hear their last breath koji rule 2 shots to the head and chest are fatal charon the marquis while offcentre shots to the lower abdomen are survivable akira

the fact that johns death breaks both rules was done deliberately to leave the door open for him to come back in the future probably if the spinoff movies underperform if they wanted to  him theyd have him collapse on the stairs staring upward",2023-03-25
robocop style execution probably or a very clean headshot it doesnt need to be over the top it just has to follow the rules it set out,2023-03-24
"honestly you may have a point there 

it might be protagonist syndrome but with what little keanu seemingly gives to john i feel like hes a very likeable character and its very believable when people in universe like and respect him too",2023-03-29
hes exhausted lol,2023-03-26
…yeah…,2023-03-25
yeah if all 4 movies take place in a year dude has been through the ringer the amount of blows to the head probably took a toll,2023-03-29
i had that impression too all throughout the movie kept thinking did i miss something about the character or actor having a  or severe concussion and not being able to talk properly is keanu okay it was noticeably odd to me as i watched the movie,2023-03-27
i dont agree with you but youre entitled to your opinion,2023-03-26
,2023-03-31
you were the one saying no one saw it lol its one of the biggest movies of the year even if it was mid,2023-03-29
redditors when presented with facts,2023-04-08
yes i was honestly expecting that to be part of the final act when it happened so quickly and without much effort i realized that the stakes for the rest of the movie were extremely low,2023-05-24
yea i’m saying it didn’t play for me also the trailers before the movie were all from late last year was weird for sure,2023-03-29
nice try cutie pie,2023-03-28
why wouldnt it release him he said i want to finish this your debt to me is paid,2023-03-26
he was working for the marquis after he cut his hand the marquis doesnt know his name for the same reason the ceo of my company doesnt know my name we know he already was a hitman for a few reasons one he already gets texts with bounties from the table two he knows who criminal underground celebrity john wick is and three his motivation is to earn money from bounties to buy his way out of service to the table,2023-03-26
thats bending and shattering our sense of disbelief yes but there is no actual super powers john getting up from stuff like that is described as sheer  will in the first movie not this guy has the superpower of invincibility,2023-03-31
he had a sword fight how does he know which direction the sword is coming from to block at the right angle if the sword swing is coming in like i and he blocks  hes safe but if its i and he blocks i hes  dead blind guys cant fight without a supernatural explanation,2023-04-01
"i dont think his gun was loaded but regardless the biggest issue is the hand to handsword fight combat

the gun stuff is whatever you cant dodge a gun well even if you can see it so just randomly juking isnt that much of a leap

but when the sword duels are happening there is no possible way for this blind guy to know at which angle the sword is coming at him he cant feel or hear good enough clearly since he couldnt hear wick breathing in that scene you mention so its not like he can hear the sword cutting the air or any of that nonsense",2023-03-29
gun wasnt loaded the barrel is protruding from the gun indicating he was out of bullets hence why he looks to his right and tries to get the other gun without alerting caine,2023-03-30
so then it makes even less sense then why caine walked,2023-03-27
why’d you delete it did you realize how cringey it was,2023-04-17
doesnt change much,2023-03-31
the director didnt say no lol  lionsgate halted production  the director said yesterday you will never hear reeves and i say that that we are done with john wick  its up to the studio to decide  there was also an alternate ending clip i believe showing john alive  wouldnt even be surprised if they release the blu ray with that clip  im gonna bet that lionsgate sees the large returns from 4 and greenlits five with a year,2023-03-26
sure did ,2023-05-26
"if you look at the story structure from a thematic element the only thing that works for the script is for him to die his peace was the five years with his wife he is a man of death death was ultimately going to be the only answer again thematically 

you can sway away from that but the characterization built within the scripts for each of the films should lead to a death for the protagonist because death follows him dante’s inferno is a huge influence",2023-03-25
i mean they didn’t have a fight scene in space lol,2023-03-25
that could change because of all the new people he killed  just like how no one was after caine but now there is akira either way safer to just disappear,2023-04-02
maybe both ,2023-05-12
suicide by john wick  thats good,2023-04-11
"i like to think that was the “john wick can’t be that much of a badass dudes overhyped let’s get an easy 2 mill”

a mountain of corpses later and it takes 40 mill to get people interested",2023-04-30
were a thousand year old and youre telling me we dont have some bylaw we could use to let him off the hook cmon also while im here is it just me or isnt our currency just   a night in my hotel 1 gold coin fine baseline 1000 but the starbucks in the building 1 gold coin for a coffee who thought this was a good idea our own currency love it great idea but gold coins why not cryptocurrency or anything divisible lower than 1000 also whos the   who didnt issue armour piercing ammo everyone uses body armour so maybe we use 303 or 50  christ a m1 carbine would be better than glocks and what training in the world has our bodyguard close distance with the worlds best gunfu artist,2023-03-25
,2023-05-26
"that bar is possible caine was basically as badass as john and he was kinda nerfed because he was blinded prime caine would be able to pull through the same thing john is pulling through 

most everyone who gets out got out by making a deal with the table aka playing by the rules john by the marker with the guy from the 2nd movie and caine by a life for a life it was only at the end of this movie that both john and caine were given unconditional release from the table probably the marquis was their last ditch at eliminating john before they themselves go bankrupt 

beside we see from the movies that one really good assassin can  1000 average one keeping the leash on the like of john and of caine is a million time more valuable than having 1000 average assassins who are just cannon fodder 

and now other cainejohn recognize that they can get out by just beating the  out the high table that its possible to wage war against the table and get out of this world with no string attached",2023-06-20
i died laughing at the glitter suit absolutely hilarious,2023-03-27
"i was so delighted by what they had the marquis doing every time i was so entertained by it

having pastries in a huge versailles hallway populated only by his bodyguards yup

standing around while pretty ladies practice fencing against each other on horses circling around him like a choreographed dance yup

renting out apparently an entire museum so he can recline on a fancy couch and look at an incredibly famous painting yup",2023-04-04
the tie knots lol,2023-03-27
i kinda like how the movie doesnt show his rich boy side from the get go,2023-03-27
we had a whole 5 minute segment about how he had to use motion detectors to be able to figure out where people were to shoot at them,2023-03-29
plot twist he couldnt save caine from kojis daughter,2023-04-11
john kept fighting for life for 4 movies and found only impending death he accepts death in order to live in peace finally,2023-05-25
also those  stairs man dude had to have the adrenaline of a  to live through those,2023-03-28
remnants of a bygone era of hollywood,2023-04-30
and of course you got donnie yen referencing ip man with his rapid wing chun hits in the kitchen and his blind rogue one character chirrut,2023-03-25
we already had the same actor that played the keymaker in matrix as the doctor in jw 1 and 3,2023-03-24
take my upvote and get out,2023-05-14
"he was announced as part the cast about 6 months ago and the film appears to be mostly shot

like most of the returning jw cast it will probably be a quick cameo that was filmed in a few days",2023-03-26
it was announced as a john wick spinoff set between chapter 3 and 4 with appearances from keanu reeves ian mcshane and lance reddick now jw 4 is out we finally know why it was explicitly set then,2023-03-25
"yeah not really sure if john wick 5 is such a good idea the mans finally at peace with helen let him stay there

a cainakira flick in paris though 

inject that  into my  veins winston",2023-04-01
jup this is a perfect end to a story of john wick,2023-03-29
he received all survivable wounds the ending definitely leaves space for jw5,2023-04-06

not for me it didnt the discussion on the boat was about their last wishes john got his and the bowery king established he would not risk other people messing his wishes up and  with his title his entire character was about how strongly he felt about his title hence his anger at the high table threatening to take it all away from him,2023-03-26

"so because he said not to wear mask for like two months due to a shortage so hospital workers would have supply its his fault

if you ask for downvotes then i shall oblige,2023-03-24
could you specify what thoughts ideas and suggestions lol,2023-04-03
"they generally require some sort of thought process i wanted to know what the thought process was behind this head canon 




regardless a head cannon is a very different thing and a dangerous one at that",2023-04-10
i think the implication is that winston started like john an orphan or street level operative who rose to where he iswas at the continental taking john in along the way possibly because he was from the same crime family,2023-04-07
wasnt it slightly different theres definitely some significance to the tattoo shown though if it was the same symbol then im buying into that theory,2023-04-07
umm did you not pay attention to the worldbuilding the assassins and alike are basically multilingual individuals,2023-03-27
there is a john wick comic book as a point of interest exploring john’s official induction but there is only one volume so far,2023-03-24

caine kinda died in the after credits,2023-03-25
"i want to see john wick fight his way out of  haha

id really doubt hes actually dead though",2023-03-25
"exactly

john wick barely talks and when it does its only whats necessary

but when he interacts with others hes always polite always thank yous and well dones and polite requests for what he needs the fact that he barely talks means what he says hits harder when john wick thanks you for your work you know you just impressed a genuine master of their craft

no wonder all the service people throughout the whole series adore him from the bartender in jw1 to the shopping sequence in jw2 to the doctor in jw3 its like if you i dunno brought custom art supplies to da vinci and he looked in your eyes and gave you a genuine thank you if you dedicated your lifes work to like carving artisan paintbrushes and a master appreciated your work hot ",2023-04-04
"year my dude im pretty sure they take over the span of a two week period at least the first 3 movies i am sure take around 7 to 10 days but i couldnt judge accurately how much time passes after 3 to 4 because it didnt transition seamlessly like the previous two movies did


but yeah im pretty sure its another week tops between 3 and 4",2023-03-30
yeah i agree i expected his death to be meaningful or not at all but never to be so sudden like that and imo if they were just going to do that they might as well have had it happen in the last movie and maybe let the character die a hero or something,2023-05-24
"and way earlier in our discussion you were being very pedantic and questioning every single move john made in the plot the characters and who they were saying the marquis himself was a waste saying the continental dying and lance dying was a waste

i see whats going on here im not the op that you replied too and i didnt say any of the above things 


but also you contradict yourself here

i meanobviously hes going to make it until the end every hero makes it until the end of the movie what else is going to happen or you can  them and then its the end of the movie get what im saying but then the twist came at the end with the duel when he didnt end up dueling the marquis himself and the way they had the actual duel happen like do you want john to die 45 minutes in and then swap to someone else for the remainder of the movie

to

and i disagree here because i legitimately thought he might not make it to the duel and wondered what would happen if he didnt given the marquis displays of what violence previous to this 

and im sorry but theres absolutely no  shot he was gonna die before reaching the duel the movie was literally set up for the final duel and he was either going to die at the duel or be alive by the end of the movie",2023-04-14
"yeah but that doesnt mean he is released from the sacred duel with the sacred rule of losers dying 

if winston was dueling instead of john and then john said to winston that he is gonna give the final shot and john got shot do you think winston would go scott free the rules of the duel still applies to them in short there is only one winning side not one and a half caine was still part of marquis team and it was said that when the duelant dies his partner dies with him and caine was still the partner of marquis that wasnt revoked marquis deal with caine is not the same as dueling rules marquis has the deal with caine but they both still fall under the duel rules and they lost both of them so caine should not be walking away from it",2023-03-26
well he dies otherwise lol,2023-03-31
interview i read yesterday was the director saying he was asked to simultaneously shoot 4 and 5 and said no and that him and reeves felt this was the last outing so i dunno ,2023-03-26
im fine with wick dying but his final acts in life should be meaningful and purposeful this movie didnt give him a meaningful death,2023-03-25
hahah not yet but that was fast 9 give wick a few more movies and well be there,2023-03-25

imma be honest i legit don’t know how you missed it it’s stated i believe 4 times that the hotel will be rebuilt once when winston makes the demand once when it gets reiterated by the marquis once when clancy brown’s character reiterates the terms and once more at the end,2023-03-26
i didnt expect to see ip man scott adkins neo and nobody sit on the same table playing card,2023-05-25

"all assassins are in service to the table to quote the adjudicator from the third film everything is under the table

not being in a family just cuts you off from certain privileges like getting tickets and challenging others to high table sanctioned duels if you can pay for a room the osaka continental using the tables gold coin as currency youre under the table",2023-03-26
well whatever the case i think what i read was from the reactions to 4  i think its a good indicator that we will get another one even if years from now  granted reeves is almost 60 and he will have to give it up sometime but i just want one more to answer high table etc  we are getting the ballerina movie next year though so thats awesome  for all we know they could put an after credit scene etc,2023-03-26
