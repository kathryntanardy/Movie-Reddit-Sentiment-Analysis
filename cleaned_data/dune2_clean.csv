lady jessica went full crazy bro lol,2024-03-01 04:54:30
feyd looking impressed and sexually aroused every time paul stabbed or shouted at somebody had me howling great character,2024-03-01 16:01:34
paul stomping his foot in front of the emperor to kiss the ring was like a gunshot in the theater,2024-03-01 14:25:42
the worm ride scenes were absolutely incredible  this whole movie was just stunning  i also would do whatever florence pugh told me to do,2024-03-01 03:30:39

can we talk about how  wild paul taking florence pugh as his bride right in front of chani was i swear everyone in my screening gasped at the audacity of that it was so funny,2024-03-01 05:48:47
that movie was made to be seen in a theater unbelievable,2024-03-01 03:13:25
say what you will about the movie but denis did an amazing job of getting casual fans on board for dune not a 11 adaptation cuts needed to be made but seeing my parents excited for this movie sparks a certain unexplainable joy in me  bless you denis,2024-03-01 04:32:55
"how exactly did paul  feydrautha at the end did he pull the dagger that he was stuck with out and flip it around on feyd it was all pretty bangbang for me

also idk if anyone noticed but that sequence was basically foreshadowed when paul and gurney were sparring in part 1",2024-03-01 03:22:45
"minor detail but i loved the reflections of arrakis on the underside of the emperors ship as it was landing


also the nukes with the raining debris this film did such a good job of expressing the scale of massive objects",2024-03-01 04:21:21
one of my favorite scenes was paul using the voice against the reverend mother and the cut to feydrautha looking like  bro,2024-03-01 03:15:35
"the scenes of the harkonnens on giedi prime are the best portrayal of a futuristic “alien” world i’ve ever seen due to how distinct and unlike reality they are 

the way the planet is lit so harshly yet has a “black sun” that saps the colour from everything reducing the world to a diegetic greyscale the complete lack of flora and fauna the completely smooth and hairless inhabitants and the horrifically beautiful black “fireworks” that are unlike anything i’ve ever seen all worked so perfectly to create this unimaginably alien and inhuman environment 

absolutely astounding",2024-03-01 03:15:33
the scenes on giedi prime were absolute genius so creative but also so seamless just incredible,2024-03-01 03:31:08
also every time there was a worm present on screen or someone gave a long  speech in the fremen language or christopher walken blinked slowly i was kicking my feet and giggling like im so happy to be alive and seeing this  on the big screen guys,2024-03-01 04:11:06
lady jessica getting increasingly more dripped out almost every time she’s onscreen was awesome,2024-03-01 03:38:27
"someone freeze me in time and then thaw me out when dune 3 drops

edit
dune not dine xd

edit edit spoiler warning

the last few lines of the movie are some of the best of all time when paul looks at stilgar and tells him to lead them to paradise and you see the freman boarding the ships to attack the great houses you realize the gravity of what is about to happen to the rest of the universe paul has become what he swore to chani hed never be someone other than his true self and he prays hes right that she will come back to him and when jessica and alia have a convo and alia asks whats happening jessica says your brother attacks the great houses the holy war begins you feel helpless because you know paul has unleashed something that even he cannot stop now

watching it a second time i picked up on more of the dialog between the characters and some small lines hit so much different lets hope i win the pb and throw all the money at dv so he makes this asap

lisan algaib",2024-03-01 03:22:21
"stilgar is the greatest hype man since paul bettany in a knight’s tale 

it’s a shame denis villeneuve will never release a “my duke cut” of dune with all of thufir hawat‘s scenes that were left out of the movie",2024-03-01 03:16:27
"one of my favorite details in this film is in giedi prime in the day it is drenched in white and the fireworks are black and in the night the fireworks are white 

thats a brilliant visual idea and i love how the fireworks are like blots of ink",2024-03-01 03:04:10

"some differences from the novels ending for those curious

jessica gives birth to pauls sister alia who is a two year old holding adult conversations alia possesses the consciousness of all bene gesserit reverend mothers past and present she is captured by the sardaukar brought before the baron vladimir harkonnen and assassinates him with the gob jabbar poison needle she is depicted in a brief scene as an adult by anya taylor joy in the second film 

thufir hawat survives the initial attack on the atriedes during pt 1 is captured by the harkonnnens and becomes the replacement mentat to the baron he is fed poison in his food along with an antidote to keep him effectively captive he is instructed by the emperor to assassinate paul with a poison needle and in the crucial moment reveals this treachery and sacrifices himself to the withdrawal from the antidote dying 

the spacing guild navigators who depend on spice to operate and predict safe paths through the universe are threatened with the destruction of all spice on arrakis they are compelled to communicate with the other navigators of the fuedal houses hovering over arrakis waiting to pillage it and compel them to stand down and depart

the bene gesserit have their royal breeding conspiracy publicly exposed by paul and jessica and their leader denied her power by pauls near omniscience

chani has a son with paul who they name leto he is killed in a firefight with the sardaukar she supports paul  muaddib in his plan to strategically marry the emperors daughter princess irulan paul publicly affirms her status as his royal concubine  the same position jessica occupied with leto 

fayd ratha tries to poison paul during their duel get shanked in the brain

the emperor is forced to not only concede his thrown and his daughter but his shares in the spice trade to paul and control of caladan to gurney halleck arrakis to stilgar

overall i think its a great adaptation faithful to the spirit of the book and streamlines the perhaps overly dense plot to make it more accessible",2024-03-01 21:59:58
jessicas conversion of the fremen was the most ruthless thing in this movie,2024-03-01 03:07:44
i had my reservations about butler but him doing a stellan skarsgård impression the entire time was wildly entertaining,2024-03-01 03:08:27

"your mothers warned you of my coming  paul atreides 



i forget the line immediately after but it also had me in stitches internally",2024-03-01 03:08:30
"i thought chalamet was too boyish for the first movie and the first half of this movie but i was wrong extremely impressed with how genuinely authoritative and scary he seemed after drinking the poison 


great performance",2024-03-01 03:58:10
"this was this generations lord of the rings

also javier bardems character was surprisingly funny in this

the lisan al ghaib is too humble to admit that he is the chosen one",2024-03-01 03:56:52
 she smacked the  out of him,2024-03-01 03:26:32
i like how jessica was eventually totally cool with the eldritch horror growing inside her,2024-03-01 03:08:37
"paul  “will you please listen i’m not the mahdi”    
stilgar “he’s the mahdi”

every time he says lisanalgaib or he’s the one whenever paul did something everyone in the theatre was bursting to laughter especially the line when he says “the mahdi is too humble to say that he’s the mahdi which means he’s the mahdi” javier bardem fully embraced the role",2024-03-01 03:03:44
the scene where paul walks in and tells everyone to “shut the  im him” was  awesome,2024-03-01 03:04:03
even at 25 hours i would’ve done another hour,2024-03-01 03:20:19
"i loved how pauls voice became deeper and had a tinge of ‘the voice’ in all of his big speeches after drinking the water of life

attention to detail was unreal 1010 movie…just wow",2024-03-01 03:21:41
i really enjoyed how princess irulans costume evolves both representing her development from nearly free in the imperial palace only the top of her head covered to literally being imprisoned with in it at the end and forshadowing the coming and evolution of the godemperor,2024-03-01 07:00:40

sooo…we’ve seen them get on the worms but how exactly do they get off the worms especially when they’re shuttling a reverend mother carriage,2024-03-01 16:26:18
the scene with the black and white lighting from the fireworks flashing through the windows is one of the most stunning things ive ever scene ,2024-03-01 03:09:52
worm riding scene was the loudest  thing ive ever experienced in a theater 1010 would destroy my hearing again,2024-03-01 03:30:33
when you’re cool with just being mouse jesus but everyone and their mother and unborn sister want you to be space christ,2024-03-01 06:24:10
"the inverse of the “mentor” archetype was really  cool in this movie  
  
i think traditionally brolin and bardem are supposed to be wise sages for young paul but dune turns that character archetype on its head  
  
gurney is so bloodthirsty and ready for revenge he pushes paul into war immediately after having just reunited and stilgar though wise enough to guide paul early on becomes so engrossed in his fanaticism to him it’s almost blinded him in a way and he’s become this dangerously religious zealot  
  
not to mention paul’s mother who at times feels like is filling her own agenda it just feels like maybe these people aren’t the best role models for paul and chani is the only one who notices that i love how complex these characters are",2024-03-01 03:07:30

"timothée went from an absolutely suave young man in the first act to a completely believable figurehead of religious fanatics

visually there was some incredibly inventive use of color palettes or absence thereof and it was an absolute treat

zimmer left a lot of his extended ideas for this film he really enabled the music to transport us to a new soundscape

i can’t wait to go again",2024-03-01 03:07:44
incredible to see timothée chalamet become a legit superstar right before your eyes,2024-03-01 03:20:50
paul’s first worm ride was insane in imax  felt like a virtual roller coaster at times  one of the most transporting scenes i have seen in theaters  it is funny they gave away a good portion of the scene in the first trailer and it didn’t at all take away from the scene in context,2024-03-01 03:04:03
well were definitely getting dune messiah after that ending,2024-03-01 03:46:43
the movie was a treat for the eyes cinematography and color were off the charts heck everything was amazing about this film,2024-03-01 03:22:51
"paul i’m not the messiah

southern fremen he is the messiah",2024-03-01 03:02:25
changing chani’s characterization to represent a moral opposition to paul’s increasingly fatalistic decisions was such a great call and worked doubly in providing actual character depth for her and externalizing the “to be or not to be” conflict that in the book is entirely inside paul’s head,2024-03-01 04:02:41
i was extremely impressed austin butler stole the show i had a realization that josh brolin and javier bardem shared a couple frames since no country for old men but they were fighting together instead of against another and i thought it was extremely wholesome soundtrack was amazing i’ve never been in an imax that shook so much,2024-03-01 03:03:34
they made the right decision not have child alia running around and stabbing people as i feel there would’ve been no way that would have transferred to screen without looking ridiculous,2024-03-01 03:04:18
"the battle outside arrakeen was done so incredibly well the sheer size of the emperor’s ship the explosion of the shield wall and the sandworms immense i am not upset about the lack of alia running around the battlefield  it would have felt out of place 

huge round of applause for chalamet and his performance as paul the subtle way he changes his face his delivery of lines even the way he stands as his prescience grows was so well done austin butler crushed it as feyd too 

have a good feeling about messiah getting greenlit pretty quickly after this one and the dune story turning into a trilogy",2024-03-01 04:15:19
"still massively processing and my eyes sting from 6 hours straight of imax but the one conclusion i have so far is that once they are all out for me watching the dune movie trilogy backtoback will be the first true equivalent in experience to watching the lotr trilogy backtoback possibly the highest praise i could ever give to a movie series honestly 

just so absolutely  into the world and story here in a similarly epic allabsorbing spectacle sort of way 

oh and i’m seriously regretting having doubts about austin butler in this film man fing killed it to the point of almost stealing the show",2024-03-01 03:07:12
i feel like in part 1 denis adapted dune but in part 2 he reinvented it the book is one of my favourites but i think it will be hard to go back without the experience of the movie affecting the way i read it villeneuves take on the characters resonated with me in a way that the originals never did,2024-03-01 03:33:19
man i knew how that final fight was gonna end but it was still so  tense and well done,2024-03-01 03:10:33
whoever did the art direction and sound direction for this movie deserve a huuuuuge raise,2024-03-01 03:08:12
when paul stomped the ground in front of the emperor i was hoping he would creake a massive crack in the floor as an homage to lynchs ending in 1984,2024-03-01 03:50:39
timothée chalamet’s screen presence is absolutely astonishing in this movie especially in the third act of the movie that “silence” voice was bloody loud in the imax theatre my seat was shaking and scene where he is addressing the fremen and declares himself as lisanalgaib absolute chills he  nailed it as paul muaddib atreides,2024-03-01 03:02:50
"i spent 5 years in a job in the mojave desert about half of that time was outdoors exposed to the elements  i enjoyed the respect they gave to the desert   we had those small delicate mice also   you would be in awe of them and strangely disturbed because you realize you couldnt survive 2 to 3 days in that environment but they survive  

i like the natural lighting or at least the appearance of that  the beauty i remember from nighttime or mornings  part of my heart will be always be there",2024-03-01 06:24:59
"there is no one in this room who can stand against me

the best scene of the year for me and it resonates on two levels
1 the audience doesn’t realise the character had it in him to be capable of this uprising and
2 the audience doesn’t realise the actor is capable of such a performance

as a result we are taken aback on two levels great casting great acting and great writing",2024-03-02 00:09:15

"timothee chalamet and austin butler stole every scene they were in the whole geidi prime sequence is still stuck in my head with the black and white fireworks
rebecca ferguson was scary as   her talking to unborn alia was so eerie 

you could feel the whole theatre vibrate with the sound when paul said silence and even when the sardaukar encounter the worms

brilliant film and experience over all  1110  will watch it again when i get the chance to",2024-03-01 03:34:06
"anyone here feel the 3rd act battle etc could have used another 10 minutes to feel more earned

edit 20 minutes",2024-03-01 16:03:13
"really enjoyed it exceeded expectations  i think its a definite you need to have seen part 1 but its shocking how well this movie packs information in without feeling too rushed

as a big fan of the books i actually think how chani is treated was inspired  that will be reevaluated ifwhen we get messiah  however i think in general the changes made by villenueve show a real understanding of the material",2024-03-01 03:34:57
"one of the best cinematic experiences i’ve ever had genuinely in awe it’s hard to put into words how good that was as a book reader though i will say that i kinda do wish they had included my favourite bit  

was quite looking for to the ‘spice ’ and how he would pull of the almost dmt like trip with infinite visions and molecules and atoms breaking down not the end of the world though it would have been hard to pull off  ",2024-03-01 03:08:14
"please go see this in imax the entire thing was incredibly immersive

also they made all of the right choices when it comes to diverging from the book specifically with paul’s sister my wife and i kept joking before seeing the movie about the spice baby glad it was handled well",2024-03-01 03:29:05
"that shot of the fremen riding atop the sandworm while bearing the standard of house atreides might be my favourite from the entire thing


dune part two was nothing short of a religious experience",2024-03-02 07:14:04
"this   rocks i went into this with really high expectations and it somehow blew them away i cant wait to see it again 

i think the thing that makes this special is that you can engage with this on any level and still have an incredible time if you dont give a  about dune you can basically just tune out the story and let the sound and the visuals wash over you and youre gonna have a good time if you want to engage with the story youre going to be thoroughly entertained if you want to dive into the characters and explore their motivations and allegiances there is a ton to unpack if you want to dig into the world building and the political scheming there is plenty to find there if you want to look at the themes of faith and power and corruption you will be deeply rewarded if you want to apply those themes to real world events there is a lot of commentary to read into 

most movies demand that you meet them on their level to fully experience and this is the rare movie that is happy to accommodate you wherever you are i cannot say enough good things about this just one of the greatest experiences ive ever had in a theater",2024-03-01 03:06:26

so i loved it and i didnt mind the changes from the book  however can someone check me on this item  alia doesnt appear to have been born in the course of the movie  does this mean the timeline from the duke letos death to the emperors abdication is under nine months,2024-03-01 03:35:29

rebecca ferguson as pauls john the baptist was  terrifying,2024-03-01 04:04:00
one thing that i liked that the toprated comments havent already said much about is the costume design whoever was making irulan and the bene gesserits costumes was having a lot of fun and the contrast between irulan and chanis outfits does half the work in characterising the two the harkonnen aesthetic vs the fremen aesthetic was excellent as well,2024-03-02 09:28:45

"i saw it at the lincoln square imax just a few hours ago it was an absolutely awesome experience there’s so much to talk about but one of the smaller things i enjoyed was how certain scenes in part one are recontextualized 

in the opening to part one we get chani’s voiceover with some shots of the same the fremen in the rock alcove shooting the spice harvester and then these things actually happen in part two so for 25 years we’ve been watching it as just an exposition things which it is but now we know we were also getting a glimpse into the future",2024-03-01 03:06:40

"my favorite working director made one of my favorite books ever and he absolutely knocked it out of the  park thats instantly a top 5 all timer for me the visual work was incredible the sound design was incredible the costume work blew my  mind i legitimately think frank herbert would have loved it the small changes it made really captured the themes and message perfectly

the absolute combination of rage and heartbreak in her final scene was beautifully acted",2024-03-01 03:50:41
"dune 2 is a movie for the theater unlike any i’ve seen in a looooong time i walked out absolutely stunned  from the opening scene of paul speaking to alia to the scenes on giedi prime wow 

ratha dueling the atreides prisoner and the duel at the end are two incredible fight scenes so impressed by the choreography and javier bardem’s performance as stilgar stole the show for me",2024-03-01 03:09:34
it’s a stunning spectacle and the finest possible adaption of frank herberts art even with the changes just incredible it will certainly be nominated for best picture but it should be more than just a token acknowledgment this should get actual consideration i genuinely cannot think of one issue i had with it i was worried messiah paul would be too big for chalamet but he was literally herbert’s paul incarnate butler was actually in some ways more sadistic than the book feyd i’m so excited to see more of pugh as irulan and anya as alia i think lord of the rings is the last time i’ve been this excited about a fantasy world and i’m absolutely a book fan so i’m not new to it just amazing stuff see it and see it again,2024-03-01 03:58:17

"it’s obviously not as fleshed out as in the books as the movie seems to condense 2 years into less than 9 months… but stigar’s plunge into religious fanaticism while providing some fun moments of levity in the movie is meant to be tragic especially since he helps lead a literal holy war in paul’s name

one of my favorite passages from the end of the dune book

 in that instant paul saw how stilgar had been transformed from the fremen naib to a creature of the lisan algaib a receptacle for awe and obedience it was a lessening of the man and paul felt the ghostwind of the jihad in it i have seen a friend become a worshipper he thought",2024-03-01 14:52:10

the detail that blew my  mind was this near the end when paul is using his space binoculars to check out the enemy positions he switches magnification a few times and the sound effect is a weird squishy sound thats because in the book the binoculars use oil lenses presumably oil can selfform into a more perfect lens than glass can also i just reread the book last week and i think that not a single change in the adaptation was a misstep,2024-03-01 10:34:53

"that one scene where jessica spots the fremen group peeking at her from around a corner and she starts speaking internally to her daughter about how shes going to convert the nonbelievers first though fear

im genuinely not sure ive ever seen anything like rebecca fergusons acting in that scene it was  astonishing it was just like a full 60 seconds of her staring straight into camera with a moreorless neutral expression that barely changed and yet there was still a visceral shift in her that went from friendly to  terrifying what the  man how did she do that",2024-03-01 09:26:17
i’m 100 sure everybody’s  in the theater room was so  clenched as mine was in the final fight i mean  i’ve read the book a while back and knew how it would it end but it was perfectly tense that it made me forget my memory for a minute there loved it beats any film of 2023 for me,2024-03-01 03:58:49
i loved it mvp of the film was austin butler as feydrautha such a sick performance wish the movie was longer so we could have got even more of him as a huge fan of the book i think denis did it complete justice and im with with the changes i think he handled the alia stuff really well and having paul be the one to  the baron was the more emotionally resonating decision  is the movie beautiful,2024-03-01 04:16:54

"what villenueve did with chanis character is one of the most substantial bookmovie changes ive ever seen

one of the few faults or just gripes i had with the book series was the way herbert wrote chani and generally any of the women besides a handful of the bg to me it never really felt as if chani was an entire character moreso pauls partner and mother to his children but not chani desert spring after the events of part 1 in the book the spotlight is largely only given to her when child bearing is the topic of conversation and by the end of it shes basically reduced to a vessel for pauls children the lack of interest or maybe just inability to effectively fit in a plot line or provide depth of her own on herberts part made her quite the forgettable character in the books

denis however completely flips this on its head the amount of agency chani is given displays in part 2 renders her practically a different character from her counterpart contrary to the yes woman i view her as in the book she is the stand in for the ideological opposition towards pauls mission and in a broader sense the bene gesserit as an institution chani is the pillar left standing the way denis positions her as the grounding figure for paul her existence is what tethers him to the world without her what ties does paul truly have left to humanity specifically his humanity

i cant think of a better way to have ended the film i view the final scene as a representation of forging ones own path creating ones own way directly in spite of what the world around you believes the true way to be im leaving part 2 with a lot of thoughts and feelings but i can say with certainty what im most excited for is chanis journey in part 3 her path has diverged and villeneuve is free to forge her a new one",2024-03-03 22:13:43
"thoroughly enjoyed this the ending circumstances left me bewildered

paul now has the entire fremen behind him and all of arakis resources he has the emperor hostage and his daughter hostage heir apparent who has sworn herself to him he is heir to house atredies resources has harkonen blood and proof that the emperor massacred his family not to mention control of the spice fields

"i loved this movie so much and agree with all the praise but did anyone get thrown by a part near at the start of the third act

after the north freman place was destroyed everyone is going south paul says he doesnt want to go has the vision that he needs to drink the water of life but then still tells chani that she should go without him 

then theyre all riding on sandworms paul looks over at chani and then the overhead shot shows pauls worm splitting off from the others the next scene is him taking the water of lifethen chani shows up in a thopter 
it just felt kinda disjointedor maybe i blacked out and missed something",2024-03-01 06:35:49
"i haven’t read the books so forgive me for just going by the film content but i felt that the reveal of paul’s harkonnen lineage wasn’t impactful to the film’s story at all 

he drank the worm  realised rebecca ferguson was a harkonnen but didn’t really have an identity crisis or conflict about what he was doing he just affirmed his identity as an atreides and killed stellan skarsgård stone cold what was the point of the reveal",2024-03-01 03:56:10
"saw it a second time today after seeing it last sunday here are some things i noticed my second time around

 after paul drinks the water of life and is explaining that he sees a path to victory there is a half second cut to paul’s knife in feyd a small nod to the fact that paul is already foreseeing exactly how he’s going to win 

 paul’s method of winning the fight against feyd was a nod to the first film when he trains with gurney “look down my lord you would’ve joined me in death” 

 there’s a moment early on when chani says “arrakis is so beautiful when the sun is low” and paul stops and stares at her for a second that’s because he has heard her say that in one of his dreams before she says it in the very beginning of the first dune and then it cuts to paul waking up 

 another thing i noticed on second watch is how much feyd respects paul there are multiple shots of feyd examining paul and austin butler does such a good job of having these faces of admiration and respect even when he says “he’s bluffing” at one moment towards the end he has this sly smile on his face like “yea this mf is a formidable opponent”",2024-03-03 02:10:57
this movie could easily have been an hour longer how they cut it down to 245 amazes me,2024-03-01 04:14:28

"one little thing i loved about this movie was the nice subversion with rabban hes this big hulking guy who  just through visual language  we associate with badass yet he tucks tail and runs twice hes forced to be submissive and then when he finally does decide to fight he thinks hes a badass but then gets killed in like three seconds flat

just on a level outside of the film itself i think thats part of why i like dave bautista so much compared to his wrestlerturnedactor contemporaries because you can see theres not a single drop of ego on screen hes able to separate himself from a character in a way that allows his character to lose to be weak to be truly vulnerable and pathetic if for instance the rock had had his hands on these movies rabban would be the badass who never loses and wed be subjected to a 15minute fight scene between him and josh brolin at the end and thered never be a moment like rabban having to kiss feyds boot

i just absolutely loved this movie and so much has been said about it not just in this thread and elsewhere that i agree with but the bautista element is just something i wanted to take a moment to appreciate where the rock makes me groan bautista makes me sit up and pay attention and i look forward to seeing his work with villeneuve and others continue to evolve",2024-03-04 21:00:14

"man this one is for the books i think this absolutely nails the tone and weirder elements of the dune universe for a nearly 3 hour movie i was never once bored it’s so  good and sticks the landing in the process

really loved that we spent time with both paul and feyd for a little development of their respective situations in the beginning i feel like a general audience shouldn’t have much trouble figuring out what’s going on the first movie often felt like newbies might get lost by comparison

and it seemed like a perfect setup for future installments i hope that happens i love the dune world and story and really would be happy to see it get appreciated as this generations next big scifi franchise",2024-03-01 07:04:09
i think i havent moved or breathed in the last 3045 minutes,2024-03-01 19:14:53
"it’s been awhile since i’ve read dune but i feel like villeneuve’s take on jessica’s character is more explicitly villainous  which i really really liked

i remember when part one came out reading criticism for how jessica was portrayed  many thought she cried too much in her scenes when the reverend mother was putting paul through to gom jabbar test and that she should be more stoic and in control but i thought the pay off of that relationship in the final scene from jessica cringing and cowering like a kicked dog to smugly staring her domineeringtyrannical mentor down who acknowledges her as a reverend mother on equal footing was very satisfying it recontextualized jessica’s actions from changing the  of her fetus with duke leto against her organization’s plans onwards to be about power grabbing and upwardly moving through ranks of the bene gesserit",2024-03-02 23:01:41
"literally just got out of the cinema for a duel screening of dune part 1 and 2 still gathering my thoughts but here are my main takeaways

as someone who has not read the books not yet at least both movies are super dense but in very different ways the first movie is very information heavy it does most of its job through set up and great atmosphere it very much fulfils its role as a part one because it is setting the ground work for the future story

this movie is dense because it is super fast paced whether or not that is good or bad ill need to watch it again i was too caught up in the awe of it all it felt like this movie had a lot more to cover after the way part one ended there is only one real place i could see the movie ending if they wanted to cut it short but even then that wouldnt feel satisfying as a viewer as i said part one is basically build up to part two doing this would make some of the decisions in part one not feel like they are properly paid off

in the end that meant this movie was fast way faster than the first one it does not waste time getting to story beats and once it hits gas its full speed until the end also there is a lot more action and fight scenes in this one which probably adds to the fast pacing

all in all i liked this movie a lot i will see it at least once more and maybe finally pick up the books not sure i like it more than part one yet but ill see",2024-03-01 03:17:27
one thing i loved about this movie is the fremen having different cultures based on their geological location i feel it’s so rare in sifi for alien planets to have that they’re all homogeneous in their beliefs and cultures having paul convert the northerners first because the south is already fundamentalist is just so interesting and believable james cameron is doing something similar with avatar and i love it there too,2024-03-01 23:56:32
one of the best modern day blockbusters i’ve ever seen it will go down as an alltime classic,2024-03-02 01:17:43

"late to the party

the last scene was truly poignant so many were what in the first thing the fremen do after finally liberating their planet they literally rush to ships practically tripping over themselves to abandon arrakis and wage war determined to enforce paul’s mandate across the galaxy with a fanatic zeal

i couldnt help but chuckle at the grandpa reveal i was like  star wars really took everything from this lol,2024-03-07 14:11:34
why did paul say “begun the dune wars have” at the end there weird phrasing,2024-03-01 08:54:10
the cinematography on the harkonnen home world was breathtaking  im struggling to put it into words but the scene with the fireworks over the bridge felt like an alternate version of metropolis mixed with a dream you can’t quite remember all of when you wake up,2024-03-01 03:44:45
"people are raving about this but i kind of liked part 1 more the fall of house atriedes had a sense of emotion and tragedy that i felt was missing from this one some segments were weirdly edited too the whole paul drinking the holy water felt rather rushed 

the final fight also ends rather quickly after having been built up the entire film sardukar dying offscreen like disposable thugs also felt a bit underwhelming after seeing how awesome they were in part 1 which made duncan idahos last stand that much more badass

i liked the exploration of religious fanaticism but maybe the ending couldve taken some more time for the weight of pauls actions to be fully felt i think the movie wouldve benefitted from cutting some of the scenes of him becoming fremen and letting the finale breathe for a bit longer",2024-03-01 14:20:37
"just realized the massive irony of denis villeneuve having to doctor strange his way through the infinite multiverse of potential  he could have made since beginning to storyboard this film at the age of 13 all to find the one possible future where he made dune –industry cliché of the unmakeable movie– to standards of nearuniversal acclaim

" with dune part i i thought the book was better simply because it included more detail but with part ii i think the movie vastly improved the book i cant believe this ends on an even bigger cliffhanger than part i but rip thufir hawat i guess

edit some further thoughts but oh my  timothee chalamet was so good i thought as many others did that he was a bit too cold in the first film but when he actually takes up the mantle as lisan al giab it was very chilling and ominous i also cant believe chalamet and zendaya actually had chemistry in this the romance in the book was just there so i didnt expect much from the movie but they actually made me care and makes what happens in messiah more impactful",2024-03-01 03:26:41

"aside from everything thats been said one thing i really loved as a fan of military tactics history and of war movies is two things



 they made an effort to make different sides have completely different ways of fighting choreographywise the sardaukar and to a lesser extent the harkonnens are disciplined soldiers fighting in formations with strong footing and all kind of like roman legionaries the fremen on the other hand like duncan said in the first movie fight like animals in the less pejorative way possible very agile jumping everywhere hiding in the sand and discarding formations for very aggressive charges and vicious brutality in pitched battles and overall both tactics disciplined formations and subversive tactics are definitely worth each other in a pitched battleas shown in history battle of teutobourg comes to mind with a good leader and proper tactics the barbarian hordes can definitely kick the empires  which leads us to



 the tactics overall kind of made sense especially in the final battle sending the nukes to show that you have them in addition to using the debris as some kind of artillery barrage to break up the sardaukar formation and discipline as well as leaving littered debris to hinder their ability to regroup and form a line forcing then to a headon charge in which they were disadvantaged not to mention the psychological impact of that and of the  huge sand worms charging at them i still think the sardaukar should have tried forming a line instead of charging headon against the fremen fundamentalists but eh it wouldnt be a hollywood movie without two armies charging straight at each others",2024-03-03 11:20:21
"young paulcult paul is a brucebatmanlike character theres enough of a distinction between the two that one actor can excel at being batman but not as bruce and vice versa like the batman franchise the dune adaptations suffer the same issue with both maclachlan and newman being heavily slanted toward being better oldpauls than young pauls i had the same reservations going into the first dune film and pretty much 23rds of part 2 that chalamet wasis a great young paul but had serious doubts whether he could pull off oldcult paul

the cave scene removed any any all lingering doubts i am paul muaddib atreides duke of arrakis the hand of  be my witness i am the voice of the outer world i will lead you to paradise the transformation post water of life is just phenomenal that he was able to maintain a clear commanding and authoritative presence throughout that entire scene most of which involved jabbering a fictional language and without it coming off as tacky was just a sight to behold having seen it twice being able to pull that off im convinced chalamet can literally play anything",2024-03-03 13:02:57
denis villeneuve is the greatest canadian director of all time,2024-03-01 03:06:44
some of the images they cut in this film will forever be cemented in my mind along with the scifi greats  for me its the harkonnens ascending the cliff in a line chani teaching paul to sand walk in step and the sandworms towering over the sardukar in the final battle,2024-03-01 08:50:23
the scene where paul takes the mantle of messiah was phenomenal not only for chalemets sheer presence but the fact he could carry almost the entirety of that scene with a fictitious language that hes babbling essentially verbal nonsense but can still project such force and authority was sheer brilliance,2024-03-01 23:01:56

i loved how near the end of the film after paul took the water of life whenever he spoke chakobsa it was just venomous and full of power in the meeting with the other naibs he spoke with power and gravitas and then later when he confronted the emperor and told the fremen to bring everyone to the residency and  the sardaukar the way he spoke those lines came across like a snake hissing and was just plain badass that moment especially was some capital grade a acting from chalamet,2024-03-03 01:25:29

i feel like that quote is super emblematic of the movie as a whole im only vaguely familiar with dune lore so its interesting to see this story isnt a pure tale of good vs evil every feature character has their own agenda every single one sometimes those agendas overlap or align but nobody is entirely on the same page and thats so fascinating not to mention all the manipulation and machinations going on behind the scenes",2024-03-05 14:58:57

anyone else notice that chani’s sequence in the end battle was shot almost identically to paul’s vision of himself fighting in part one,2024-03-06 21:19:32
"i dont know how it goes in the book but i thought that ending on chani was a great idea it drives the point home that what paul had to become to win isnt all that triumphant

same for the shot of stilgard leading the battle with the atreides banner at his back to me it felt like paul succeeded at corrupting the fremen to his own cause",2024-03-06 21:54:10
"just watched it again and its still as good as the first time around i even noticed a couple of things i didnt before

i dont know how or why but i completely missed feyds cannibal pets the first time around it made the harkonens seem even more gross

after paul drinks the water of life theres a quick image of someone being stabbed and i could tell it was from the duel at the end i didnt even remember seeing that before

when feyd heard may thy knife chip and shatter he repeated it like it was the coolest thing ever and he was gonna steal it after dealing with paul i found that pretty funny

also paul kept looking at chani while he was fighting feyd it was like he wanted to check if she still cared about him even though he just demanded another girl marry him in front of her  and everybody else

he stabbed me chani arent you worried about me baby dont you still love me  was so diabolocal it became funny

im really looking forward to a sequel and whatever the  theyre gonna do with that demon baby",2024-03-06 22:09:50

all in all an excellent film  ive been a dune fan since a relative first giving me the book as a kid in the 80s  ive read all the frank novels several times over at different points in my life  this film although deviating in a few points was somehow closer to what a imagine when reading them  it was mostly all very good with fergusons performance the highlight for me  its a horribly beautiful movie that really drives home herberts main themes  i like to think he would have approved,2024-03-01 22:11:28
"my favorite little bits were the barron lying helpless on the stairs as the nuke goes off everyone surrounding the emperor staring at the door while he lays alone staring longingly at the throne with this sense of maybe if he could just get the strength pull himself to the top then he could wield all the power he’s always wanted but he is so close but has completely failed and now will die pathetically all of that was conveyed in like 2 seconds based in how the shots were composed just truly masterful 
 the other thing was the ambush scene when dave bautista flies out with his troops to try to deal with the freman himself and  just goes from confident to unsteady to silent horror to just everything being so  up and total terror reminds me of the loot cart sequence from got one of the last great scenes though it had its problems they took our perspective away from the protagonists and put it with the antagonists and just showed how absolutely horrifying it would be to be on the other end of everything we have been rooting for this entire time we feel horror watching the fear and suffering of the bad guys but also exhilaration at just the sheer power beheld by the people we are rooting for",2024-03-02 01:21:52

positives

 loved loved the geidi prime scenes just absolutely beautiful and so unique with the black sun and the blot ink fireworks reminded me of metropolis mixed with alien such great cinematography i got chills when the bene gesserit walked into the light and their robes turned from black to white gorgeous 
 timothee chalamet really impressed me here especially in the final hour when he became a much more ominous and disturbing character and you almost felt uneasy about what he was saying and doing the switch from charming young prince to a messiahlike figure was very believable and it was a pleasant surprise because i had doubts that he could pull it off
 rebecca ferguson everything about her her acting her costumes everything the absolute highlight of the movie and such a disturbing almost villainous performance her space burkas were awesome
 really enjoyed the special effects and the worm riding scenes were very well done and exhilarating 
 whoever designed florence pughs outfits deserves an award the costuming in this movie in general was fantastic 

negatives

 christopher walken was too old to play the emperor he had no presence and felt out of place wasnt believable as a villain at all maybe walken 20 years ago could have played it but the emperor should have been played by someone in their 50s or 60s he looked like a janitor
 i feel like there was a bit too many scenes with the fremen it was great but the movie could have diverted to some attention to other plot points would have liked to see more of semievil messiah paul because he played that part so well

overall a 9510 i really enjoyed it it is substantially better than the first movie in almost every way except that its missing oscar isaac eye candy",2024-03-05 07:09:50
the black and white scenes were so stunning i swear this is the type of movie that reminds you why you love the cinema,2024-03-06 17:18:22

"i was a friend of jamis

no matter what the legacy of this movie series is denis velleneuve has brought arrakis to life in a way that feels real i’ll always admire him for that 
 saw this at the fan first event at lincoln square amazing experience it’s so visually stunning excellent use of imax screen as well i thought i was so over giant cgi monstershipsbattles but turns out it’s still possible to do that right i thought there was some excellent acting javier bardem had a standout role as stilgar especially once the evangelist angle got turned up to 11 

sadly there are some rough parts that feel like entire plotsscenes were left on the cutting room floor honestly wouldn’t be surprised if there was a 4 hour cut out there somewhere

i don’t want to play the “i didn’t like the changes from the book” card because i truthfully only finished reading the book after years of trying because i was excited for the movies but still i do think some of the punch of the book was not felt here and that’s a shame 

denis there’s still time to film the “i was a friend of jamis” scene and make that the conclusion of part 1 in a special 2 part bluray…

so excited to watch this tomorrow in 70mm imax i’m willing to bet it will be the theater event of 2024 for me",2024-03-01 03:07:35

"i gotta say this movie was hyped the  so i was nervous it wouldn’t live up to it but i think it surpassed it 

i called anya playing alia since it was confirmed she had a role after the premiere still a nice moment when she shows up

i genuinely could’ve done without the many cuts to the fetus in the …i respect denis’ vision it’s bold not many directors would’ve done that u think but…also creepy as  

i seriously hope we get a bene gesserit voice off between jessica and paul next movie because  it’s still scary as  

get you a hype man like stilgar was for paul  with as much hyping as javier was doing no wonder paul went from 0 to 100 like he did but that definitely will come back to haunt him in a future movie…

i do wish irulan got more to do florence got like 6 minutes of screen time and i wish she got a little more but iunderstand they had a  load of stuff to cover here and she’s not in the novel much anyway

"i’m 41 there are few things that make me feel like a kid again i saw dune 2 in imax last night have felt that childlike sense of awe and discovery you get when you encounter something new and thrilling i thought the film was close to over shortly after the 23 mark but that last 13 was like its own film and then i think about how many different scenes we got and how the story was told slowly and thoughtfully and right when you think you know what scene will come next it surprises you 

people have compared it to empire strikes back other than them both being the second in the series i am not sure i see the parallels i feel this film was more focused on one planet and slow storytelling but it was one of the most beautiful if not the most beautiful things i’ve ever seen and heard on the big screen it makes you look at other films and say hey they’re kinda being lazy huh the amount of genius and manpower poured into each frame gotta hand it to the teams and denis",2024-03-07 10:41:12
what a phenomenal film everything and everyone just absolutely firing on all cylinders and giving it their all that speech near the end where paul solidified timothee chalamet as one of the best actors working today in hollywood imo this was one of if not the best imax experience ive ever had too and i cant wait to eventually see it again,2024-03-01 03:52:15

and i remember feeling bad for gurney because it seemed like something he really needed and his character was denied that closure but in the movie i could not wipe the smile off my face when he killed rabban giving his character some much needed closure 

the one thing i dont feel the movie really captured about gurneys character from the book is how much of a legend he is everyone knows gurney halleck friends and foes alike so when my wife noted how easily he seemed to take out rabban i almost told her hes gurney  halleck of course he whipped his ",2024-03-03 21:34:01

anyway it just so happens that one of my main triggers is getting even a slight sense of vertigo from vast wide open spaces in reallife or from seeing them on big movie screens im so sensitive to this that im having to keep my  together just thinking about it and writing this at home the next day

because of my anxiety i had a horrible time with this movie i was having a panic attack nearly the whole time literally could not stop fidgeting and squirming in my seat closing my eyes for a lot of parts and grabbing my girlfriends handleg it took a lot of determination for me to stay in the theatre and i hope i wasnt too disruptive to other people watching fortunately our theatre wasnt that full

but i made it to the end and i walked out of that theatre yes incredibly relieved it was over but also hyped as  i still loved this movie despite having probably the worst filmgoing experience of my life watching it by no fault of the film itself whatsoever i was texting my buddies in the parking lot like lisan al gaib afterwards and im still hyped about it now

"i just finished watching dune part 2 for the second time after watching it the first time i was slightly conflicted there were 3 major changes to the film compared to the book
1 the time jump doesnt happen
2 alia is not born
3 chani and her relationship with paul is not as strong at the end

the first two changes i completely understand its extremely to difficult to put a two year old all knowing child into a film however the relationship between paul and chani is critical to dune messiah part 3

their relationship at the end of part 2 was completely different compared to the end of dune the book the only way to justify having them end like that in part 2 is to have a part 3

part 3 needs to start with the crusade across the universe then show paul and chani reconcile and fall deeply in love followed by a time jump 20 17 years later after the time jump we see the events of dune messiah

dune part 2 became significantly better with that in mind i wasnt watching part 2 thinking that i was seeing the end to dune i watched it thinking it was the middle of the story the bridge between part 1 and 3

if denis and the cast and crew can stick the landing with part 3 which i absolutely believe they will i think it will be held in high regard similar to the return of the king

the way scale is handled in this movie is so cool like in the scene where paul names himself lisan al gaib the amount of people there was insaaane and the shot of him walking up to the army and lifting his sword before the battle some lotr  the worms the huge ships everything on the harkonnen world and their massive army mobilizing with the backgrounds full of extras doing stuff very very amazing,2024-03-06 03:54:22

"just got back home super late on a sunday before work and that was worth it for sure beautiful visuals that shot very close to the start where the harkonnen troops were dropping out of their ship in silhouette was unreal very ominous feeling 

ferguson was terrifying chalamet was pretty good bardem was great though some of the comedy moments with him were a bit forced feeling but holy  did austin butler  it…i didn’t even know he was in this he was fantastic that maniac laughing in the gladiator scene was so different to his band of planes character haha 1010 for him

i felt that it could have possibly been a bit better paced for paul after he drinks the spicy preworkout maybe just ten minutes of him blending his reluctant saviour angst with his purpose of being a savior but instead he is pretty sad a lot vows his love to chani and then takes a sharp left on his worm and drinks it and storms into the temple and is immediately this really brutal religious leader dude just felt a little transition between these two personalities could have been more subtle…but perhaps that would have been a bit tropey it was certainly hard hitting

great film and an evening well spent i want to read the books now 

i was wearing a light grey hoodie fresh out the wash and dropped a twirl bite on it during the trailers as i was reclining my seat and didn’t realise for 25 hours went out at the end with a huge melted chocolate stain on my stomach cool

also the last two films i saw in the cinema were saltburn and poor things it was awesome to watch a proper huge effects space opera on the big screen again after those two weird films haven’t experienced that feeling since top gun maverick",2024-03-18 01:19:56
"only been a few hours since i saw this in dolby cinema and already i am feeling that this might have been the most memorable cinema experience of my life every facet of this film from the cinematography to the sound design to the costumes and the editing and everything in between was absolute perfection

it seems that each generation has one great trilogy that defines the art of film for that place in time my generation had lord of the rings and my fathers had star wars now through the brilliant vision of denis villeneuve we have the dune saga

the wait for part three will be bittersweet but i look forward to visiting arrakis through part one and two often while i await the finale",2024-03-01 03:17:23

what i didn’t like was my theatre experience don’t go to the theatre much anymore and today reminded me why the dude behind me was sniffling loudly every 1015 seconds almost right in my ear it was so annoying this one guy in front kept getting up to change seats was friggin weird people always this crazy in theatres now",2024-03-06 02:54:12

"what a  spectacular film holy christ on a cake surpassed the first on every level but especially with the writing and acting this movie had so much more emotional weight personality texture and soul compared to most of the first which in hindsight feels like 25 hours of beautifully shot exposition 

this movie brilliantly took the building blocks set up by the first and then set them in thrilling motion often upending them in harrowing tantalizing fashion the near 3hour runtime went by in a blur and more or less every scene evoked a sense of awe this is what i wanted from a dune movie by villeneuve and im so happy i got it kudos to everyone involved for helping denis fulfill his dream and tell this story how he wanted to

more thoughts

 i thought timothee chalamet was fine in the first movie but he really was  impressive this time around i have no doubt that the paul material in part 2 was the real litmus test for casting him his transformation from a reluctant humble outsider nevertheless hardened by the events of the first film into a fearsome fanatical warrior was enthralling my favorite scene in the movie may well be the moment where he declares himself the messiah before the fundamentalists it felt like a largescale cult initiation made all the more disturbing by how much his own mother was reveling in it

 javier bardem as stilgar was the highlight of the movie hilarious and soulful in equal measure he was such a dour character in the first film so im so glad he was given more to do here and that the writing incorporated more of bardems natural charisma into the role

 rebecca ferguson was already my favorite performance from part 1 but she was so good here fantastically creepy as the reverend mother in the first film we were told more than shown that she was a bene gesserit so it was thrilling seeing her in full cultpriestess mode this movie

 its no surprise that the visuals of this movie were again  stunning but part 2 in particular made great use of gigantic crowd shots that filled and dotted the screen like a pointillist painting the world of part 2 felt a lot more alive and populous compared to the drab sparseness of part 1 and lent a lot more scale and gravity to the story my favorite crowd shots were 1 the harkonnen gladiator fight and 2 the aerial shot of paul making his way through the crowd of fremen in the south

 so this is what it took to get austin butler to finally stop behaving like elvis what a magnificent performance he gave here i found it interesting that he just chose to go with stellan skarsgards accent for the voice but it worked im sure his role on once upon a time in hollywood prepped him well for playing another sadistic psycho dude has amazing range

 zendaya also got to show off her incredible acting talent throughout this movie and the betrayal chani felt as paul got deeper and deeper into his messiah role was beautifully heartbreakingly portrayed the most emotionally impactful moment in the movie for me was when paul told her after the duel that he will always love her at first it sounds like a simple reassurance but you realize its more of a preemptive apology when he then asks for the princess hand in marriage in front of all the fremen jawdropper love that the movie ended on a shot of her too

 speaking of the princess i thought florence pugh was pretty underused in this movie i havent read the books but i assume shell have more to do in the dune messiah film if theyre covering pauls conflict with the houses seems to be villeneuves casting pattern introducing major actors in one movie and then giving them more of a chance to act in the next loved her costumes throughout the movie though they looked gorgeously ornate and regal in a way that still felt consistent with villeneuves sleek minimalistic aesthetic

 the feydrautha gladiator fight shot in infrared was  rad loved everything about it from the transition to black and white to the triangular arena to the ocean of people in the crowd 

 the final duel between paul and feydrautha was even better i thought the fight between paul and jamis at the end of part 1 was a tad anticlimactic and not as visceral but this one was  outstanding and after two movies of bloodless pg13 violence im glad villeneuve let them bleed a bit and leaned into the brutality in the final fight certainly made it feel more climactic

 josh brolin was so so great in this similar to bardem he was a bit stiff in the first movie but he really got to let loose this time around and the gurney character was given more emotional range and depth the drax vs thanos rematch at the end was over a lot faster than one would normally expect

 imagine if after brolin explained that destroy the whole planet was a figure of speech he said half the planet maybe im glad i didnt write this movie

 i havent read the books so the twist about jessica being harkonnens daughter was a real shocker didnt seem to have too much bearing on the wider story though but on a character level you could say paul and jessica unwittingly emulated the harkonnens by becoming increasingly ruthless throughout the movie

 im watching game of thrones for the first time right now and i found loads of parallels in this movie of course grrm was more than likely inspired by herbert everything with paul and the fremen felt exactly like jon and the wildings but with a shade of the daenerys mhysa worship thrown in paul like jon was even got spoilers given a plot twist about his true lineage and stilgar like melisandre was cheering on pauls messiah status the entire time feydrautha reminded me of ramsay bolton even down to he and paul jon getting a final duel though this one was more morally grey the duel scene of course echoed the famous trials by combat in got and chani like ygritte becomes disillusioned with paul for straying from the indigenous peoples best interests even the bene gesserit scheming to  feydrautha into their control felt like what the tyrells were trying to initially accomplish with joffrey himself a psycho

 watching got also helped me settle into the pace of this movie very quickly since im already used to both the medieval palace intrigue and the pleasures of watching such a loreheavy story build out in serialized format i could immediately feel within the opening moments of the film how much more interesting it was now that were familiar with the characterssettings and get to watch them get expanded upon and given more texture the writing definitely helped too  the script of this film was a lot stronger wittier and expressive compared to the fairly stilted dialogue from the first which is odd given that the great eric roth had a hand in the first but not the second",2024-03-18 08:49:54

"i know it was envisioned as a two partner but it should have been a trilogy just like the books first one is setting the scene dune second one is paul learning to live within the society muaddib last one is him rising to take over his adopted people and use them  the prophet 

would never work because the second would be so slow and more political intrigue then people might be happy with but  it 

the whole moment between paul deciding to go south and taking the water of life felt like it cut 20 minutes of the film and the ending felt rushed 

could easily have ended up the harkonnens coming in and slowly gaining control back from the fremen and forcing pauls hand to go south nice bad guys win kind of ending the third film would have been him slowly accepting his need to change how he operates and slowly become what he didnt want to become with power corrupting him slowly and finally ending in the big battle and eventual win 


i do like they made chani a more interesting and believable character kind of combined her with the stilgar of the books  not sure how that will impact the story going forward if they decide to make another movie",2024-03-02 23:07:52
what an astonishing film can’t believe we get a film with both this much spectacle and this much artistry,2024-03-02 23:14:10

i cannot believe how incredible this film was everyone in the theater was mesmerized i’ve never been in such a quiet theater i thought the first dune was great but this was something else entirely first action film since the dark knight that has made me want to go back and see it in theaters again and again this is everything an action film should be 1010 exceptional,2024-03-03 21:21:11
it is viscerally upsetting to me that i cant just go see these films in theaters anytime i want for the rest of my life the new standard for a theater experience im not one of those people that can watch the same movie back to back i need time between viewings but  watching this again in a year on my  tv just wont be the same,2024-03-04 05:27:10
"wow

action scifi is back

a lot of people are drawing comparisons to lotr but this even surpasses those movies i would put it more in the realm of alien or planet of the apes but with heavy influence from classic war epics the worldbuilding is a challenge for some if they have not read the books but the movies do a lot to catch people upthere are numerous scenes where i found myself smiling ear to ear the first time paul rides the worm is one of my favorite scenes in theatres in a long time also that harvester ambush scene was incredibly wellplayed on top of those are the battles and that arena scene with feydrautha the epic scifi spectacles we have not seen in a long time

i want to add the whole scene around the water of life extraction was really interesting that woman who played the worm tamer is such a great addition it could have been glossed over but the pacing felt special it felt like something out of a kurosawa movie this sacred ritual that in other hands would have fell flat

performances are great austin butler may have been my favorite here but bardiem carries your passion for paul and has you cheering him on chalamet is really expanding here and it’s great to see fergeson actually brought me back to her role in doctor sleep with how unsettling she can be pugh seydoux brolin they don’t have massive roles but their impact is felt i would say my only critique would be zendaya she has some scenes where it feels a bit off mainly the intense scenes i just think everyone else around her is nailing it and she is trying to catch up

it’s not a perfect film it does have its faults there are some issues with the pacing and a bit repetition but that’s to be expected given the source material and just how dense this world is i want to add that i have read the books a few times so that may fill some points subconsciously as i watch the movie

seeing the nonbook fans and what they have been thinking has been interesting",2024-03-04 15:39:39
im too in love with this movie to say much but i will say that the first raid on the spice harvester was one of the greatest action scenes ive ever had the pleasure of witnessing that little breath as the ornithopter is about to hit the ground as theyre running and then boooooom fire and debris was just everything i wanted and more,2024-03-06 10:42:00
"saw it 2 days ago in imax and i cant wait for sunday when i will go again i cant believe that 2 days after ive seen it i already feel the need to see it again

i think this movie will haunt me for a long time and im fuking here for it what a masterpiece had literally chills all the time watching this on big screen just paul walking as a messiah before the fremen looked so bad  best movie of the last decade for me,2024-03-06 21:51:25

"spectacular

need to see it again asap the book nerd in me was distracted by some of the changes but more often than not it made more sense in the movie replacing gurney’s assassination with an attack on tabr as the catalyst for paul taking the final step makes a lot more sense as the thing that pushes him over the edge 

same with how the baron dies – did i want to see alia sure but realistically how would a two year old assassin work tonally here 

as a solo story the change with chani at the end really works as a tragic twist in paul’s rise but curious to see how it’ll affect part 3",2024-03-01 03:35:14

i haven’t read the books but something in this movie tells me that paul is not the all benevolent savior that will lead the fremen to paradise that he’s portrayed as by the prophecy… it did seem very noble of him to lead them to freedom by defeating the ruling empire but for that millions must die as he sees in his “visions” and he mostly did that for vengeance… incredible story all in all,2024-03-03 04:15:48
you know it’s a good film when a runtime of almost three hours doesn’t seem like enough i would’ve loved even ten more minutes of jessica and paul going on a vision quest after drinking the water of life incredible film and one of the great masterpieces of scifi film if i’ve ever seen one,2024-03-03 05:12:33

questions i have 
 is it clear already what the bene gessirit’s endgame is it seemed to be breeding the lisan al gain to travel through space and time but now why are they playing emperor games 

 and did lady jessica basically secede and go wifey bc they didn’t tell her she was harkonnen’s daughter 

  and why wouldn’t the great families accept paul’s rise to power since the whole reason they killed leto was bc the atreides were posing too much of a popularity threat and it was said that the great houses wouldn’t stand for the emperor genociding one of them so paul does as expected of a kid whose very popular and almost getting there family was couped and they don’t accept his fair play at the throne ",2024-03-09 07:49:59

"“lead them to paradise” is a line that goes so unbelievably hard

2 hours and 45 minutes go by real quick 

i thought the adaptation was fantastic the visuals are stunning and much better than part 1 the score is fantastic the dialogue could have been slightly better the movie could have benefited from an extra 1520 minutes honestly gurney and rabaans fight was underwhelming the weight of pauls decisions could have held more depth if you have a bit more time to process them specifically the throne room scene pauls choice to drink the water of life and just a bit more of paul and chani together would have been great 

my only big issue with the movie i wanted more paul and chani love that spans space and time but can be destroyed by mere petty revenge and personalpolitical greed zimmers score for them was moving it wasnt given enough depth it feels more like teenagers fighting instead of rebels and lovers that can lose everything in a war of destiny they could have delved a bit deeper into their relationship 

with that said multiple moments in the movie i found myself grinning from ear to ear one of the best experiences ive had in a movie theater in a long time overall great film ultimately my only complaint is that i wanted more

genuinely blown away by butler but zendaya also gave probably her best performance yet that last shot of her is just devastating,2024-03-01 04:31:39
it was so satisfying seeing paul use the voice to silence the reverend mother ,2024-03-02 00:55:44
"i really liked how much attention was paid to the nuances with the harkonnens especially the intro from the harkonnen patrols perspective the conscripts terrified and nervous and vomiting in the dropship rabban and feydrautha having major character arcs i love rabban as an overcompensating bully whos a coward at heart the constant fear of all of the barons servants feydrautha is a complete sociopath but it goes to great lengths to get across how he and his ascendancy to power are more like paul than hed like to admit 

also feydrautha is a really great multifaceted character with some redeeming qualities even if they dont ultimately make him any less evil hes a sociopath who seems to actually respect if not empathize with his opponents and is a more effective villain for it during his downfall he actually seems quite taken backimpressed that muaddib is even more ambitious and ruthless than he is hes not even really all that mad

plus i really love the commentary on messianic figuresreligion stilgars progression from someone so desperate to believe in anything that its played for laughs to fullblown fanatic is great",2024-03-02 08:35:07
as an arabic speaker i couldn’t help but notice how much influence the fremen language takes from arabic the inflections and pronunciations are literally the exact same and you could tell the arab actors apart like chani’s friend and the elder ladies from the others by how natural they sounded when speaking,2024-03-03 09:56:16
"to warner bros marketing department

i write you with a humble request 

please stop putting your films’ best visual moments in not only the trailers but also all of the ancillary advertising materials by the time i walked into the theatre i had seen the most thrilling cinematic moments from this movie hundreds of times every time i opened my phone or watched sports on tv for the last two weeks i was treated to visual delights that should have been experienced for the first time in the theatre it completely sapped the energy from the film it’s not the first time you’ve done this either i had the same complaint about ‘the batman’ you could have promoted this movie without spoiling the ‘worms’ sequence

"having seen it sunday its easily been on my mind all week those three hours flew by and i cant wait to see it again now tomorrow with a bit more time to process some of the real standout moments for me were paul and chani sandwalking together and the whole fremen war with the harkonnen mining operation coming off of helldivers 2 these scenes were incredible and felt so starship coded they were terrific

paul ascending as mauddib in a crowd of thousands challenging their warriors to no rival i thought was captured perfectly possibly will be the most memorable scene in adapted media for a long time",2024-03-01 07:19:00
"i really enjoyed it it was amazing to see in imax

jessica going darth sidious made for some great scenes especially the ones when shes using the voice 

everything on geidi prime was captivating those ink blot fireworks were so cool also you can just imagine the harkonens got some nasty mutated animals and monsters they probably display in the gladiator games i cant forget that weird spiderperson from the first movie 

during the geidi prime segment ill admit i kept expecting thufir to show up especially after it was revealed the prisoner hadnt been dosed was expecting some big reveal of thufir emerging from the shadows to stand beside the baron but nothing 

i liked how gurney got to confront and  rabban speaking of gurney as just a fun character him being a mentor so bloodthirsty is just a fun twist on the classics mentor trope with gurney being one pushing for revenge violence immediate action etc brolin killed it 

as well as paul being the one to call the baron grandfather and killing him worked rather well here timothee killed it as paul his rallying speech to the fremen his fight with feyd his closing sceneline about letting the fremen lead the other houses to paradise i thought just expressed so much 

during the final battle scenes i liked how denis had us with the emperor and crew so we didnt get to see any of the fighting we were just locked in with the others who had no idea what was happening until the doors opened 

its been awhile since i read the book so i cant remember how vivid the visions were showndescribed but i got to admit it was unintentionally funny how paul kept going about visions when he sees billions die and then you see the vision and its like what 10 people i thought maybe that couldve been tweaked

austin butlers feyd was really surprising in a good way judging from the trailers it looked kinda one note but i thought butler did a lot of great acting without speaking just with certain looks or expressions including watching paul  the baron and his choice for how to speakuse his voice also helped him stand out 

all in all great film which i cant wait to see again",2024-03-01 18:58:20
"so first off this film is incredible i saw it 4 days ago and all ive done is think about when i can go again i got to go to a double screening of part 1 immediately followed by part 2 let me tell you the fastest 6 hours of my life the pacing in this sequel is off the charts

im interested to see the difference with only watching part 2 but i can guarantee whenever i rewatch this at home it will be back to back it just feels right 

absolutely incredible achievement everytime i think villeneuve might have hit his peak he keeps going what a time to love scifi and film",2024-03-01 22:24:14

"its hard to describe just how impressed i was with this movie i was enraptured the entire way through the sound design was phenomenal the score was incredible the whole design team killed it with the costumes explosions in both dune movies are incredibly visceral and felt immense the usage of the voice is very well done the harkonnen planet was a visual feast pacing was very well done all the actors were on top of their game and timothee especially did an amazing job especially once he embraced his role 

just wow  i am impressed by every level of this movie",2024-03-03 02:34:54
obviously beyond incredible i watched in bfi imax  it was utterly immersive  except when people coming to and from the toilet would run across arrakis geidi prime or the emperors face  some people had to deal with their bodys moisture and thats okay i went twice ran like shaihulud was behind me,2024-03-03 16:57:39
"if you havent seen it yet do not go to anything less than imax

if youve never read the books or even if you havent seen any of the previous movies or maybe dont remember much from part one id argue that its digestible enough to follow whats going on while still having a good time

saw it last night if im being honest i havent been particularly hyped until a few days ago when i decided i could swing treating myself to a night out and started paying attention to all the buzz i was seriously ready to wait until i could stream it at home and man am i glad i didnt put it off longtime book fan and i have a few criticisms but they really do pale in comparison to everything villeneuve got right not sure id go as far as all the headlines putting it right alongside lotr but kull wahad that was the best movie experience ive had since lotr

most notable for me

the entire giedi prime infrared sequence is one of the most entertainingly chilling things ive ever seen in film also can we please talk about how austin  butler totally nailed feydrautha

the music and sound effects with paul controlling the worm took that scene to a whole nother level especially considering it was a scene abouta kidriding a worm

personally i loved how they used jessicas pregnancy

stilgars humor was just subtle enough you could still laugh through serious moments without it feeling like forced comic relief

something about when muaddib popped up in particular really hit just how welldone the cgi was

from the perspective of having to translate book to film i can appreciate the choice of chani going all moody at the very least paul prophesying that shell eventually come around softened up her character flip and added some interesting tension

would have liked to see princess irulan and emperor shaddam fleshed out just a bit more but i think they at least managed to explain their roles wellenough and the actress who played the princess owned what she was given",2024-03-03 17:31:30
lady jessica was on the highlights for me in this movie especially some of her cinematic shots of her as revered mother made me really think man i wish id be as cool as her dune from a technical view is a masterpiece in anyway but the way they portrayed some of the characters is just so good,2024-03-03 20:20:23
i thought it was so funny that out of all the crazy action in the movie the one time everyone in my very packed theater audibly gasped was when paul said he’d marry irulan  like how are you gonna do our girl chani like that ,2024-03-03 20:28:36
"i went to see hans zimmer live last year and i think the music he did for this film is some of his best

i thought when bautista’s character didn’t do much in the first movie that we’d get some big epic scene with him showing his fighting skills this time around i love that they subverted my expectations and just made him a cowardly little dirtbag,2024-03-05 02:34:31
"man i was hyped and almost worried this movie wasnt going to live up to that but nope this movie is awesome

denis has somehow made a better movie than the first one in the cinema which seems to be in a bit of a drought not just in money but films of this level there is finally a movie that is just really really good

everything is good all the craftsmanship and work that goes into films like these

denis might have cracked the code on bringing film to the masses but its too early to tell when i watched it the opening was 80 million but not sure how its entire run is going to i hope it does well

what a great movie i understand there might be some people who might not like slower more detailed crafted movies like this but i hope most people can enjoy this i would at least recommend you try it

seriously great movie i could mention one person but they are all good everyone and everything explosions vfx acting cinematography sound music writing

maybe just happy to see a great film by denis villeneuve again",2024-03-05 04:35:16

"these two movies are what childme thought we were going to get back in 99 when the phantom menace came out a dark story about the fall of an ancient regime at the hands of a corrupted youth the tone is perfect

big parts of the original star wars movies were dark and gritty a little like dvs dune the desert feels like an unforgiving and alien place that we see through an almost documentary lens farmers struggle to make a living civilians are executed and stacked up and burned by uncaring fascist shock troops informants slip quietly through dirty alleyways and grungy smugglers dont hesitate to shoot first when theyre cornered in divey bars all of this lowlevel grounding helped sell it when crazy fantastical  like the death star showed up the prequels and sequels largely turned it into a brightlycolored kids series and by tlj we were down to prank calls yo mama jokes and marvelstyle quips

these two movies did it right though im glad we got them best theater experience in a long time",2024-03-06 21:49:51

i loved paul walking into the gathering of fremen screaming “no man here can stand against me” bro had his shoulders going and swagger made me think he was about to drop a rap album diss tracks against baron harkonnen,2024-03-17 20:32:26

"i was literally in awe of austin butler the entire black sun sequence was just so overwhelming and that hallway with the fireworks    i felt transported it was so sinister and beautiful  how did he channel skarsgaards voice so flawlessly though to the point that i thought they did some digital enhancement to it it was scary good 

i also felt violated because i found him strangely seductive and kind of sexy even though hes not same with paul when he goes full messiah and ferguson scared but seduced me 

im confused",2024-03-20 01:12:59
everything about paul riding the worm for the first time was legit perfection  almost made me cry feel like we’re living in another star wars moment and it’s incredible,2024-03-24 02:08:58
"paul’s rise to power felt fast but believable loved that the tension was not in the potential for him to win but paul’s emotional reluctance to face the consequences of defeating his enemies

everything after he went south felt like a power fantasy fever dream all in a good way and as it should

i wonder what people think while theyre voting this a 1 or 2 what are they trying to accomplish,2024-03-01 07:48:51
"i watched a dune 1  2 double feature which was a whammy and left me dazed
it was a fantastic experience and dune 2 is an absolutely gorgeous and amazing movie




some great parts


 filmchani and the relationship between her and paul in contrast to the book because now she feels like her own character and their relationship a lot more real and believable


 the sandworm rides so fantastic i love it


 the giedi prime scenes gorgeous but utterly terrifying


 timothee has some pipes i didnt know that and i dont mean that for the voice but his normal voice during his speeches to the fremen


 everyone brought their alevels to their acting




some of my criticism


 the emperor while he was okay he seemed very bland and without a lot of agency and i feel his fear regarding leto and his subsequent actions could have been more pronounced


 stilgars fall from more mentorlike figure to zealot follower it would have hit a lot harder if he hadnt been used so much as comic relief yes it was funny eg hes the mahdi but imo it took away from his downfall


 the role of spice in pauls future war and during the forced abdication of the emperor a line about spice was literally the first line in the movie even before the studio logo but its meaning controlling space flight and how paulthe fremen can basically isolate whole planets and systems now was a bit shunted to the side imo 


conclusion i really need to watch it again",2024-03-01 08:54:54
what a visual spectacle that was,2024-03-01 12:00:14

i loved this movie so much that i bought 2 extra tickets to see it two more times in imax,2024-03-01 20:51:46
"one of the best flatout movies ive ever seen my only miniscule desire would be to see more of feydrautha sp being a pure menace and showing why he deserves his reputation especially considering the ending but thats a minor nitpick the film is incredible

i thought it would just be a visual spectacle it is and progression of the story from part 1 technically it is but its so much more the ascendancy of paul to a complicated protagonist the expansion of the stakes and the world set up in the first movie the superior production design etc and the visuals from the harkonnen world to the sandworm stuff are somehow even more striking",2024-03-01 21:20:00
really enjoyed the few scenes slipped in there where the desert sands were moving as if they were ocean waves,2024-03-01 21:38:29
missed the first one on initial release and wanted to hold off to see it on the big screen so watched it for the first time last night and then watched this tonight…two amazing movies…credit to all involved  only change i would have made was making gurney’s return a surprise by having his helmet blacked out and paul say the footsteps line when he takes him down,2024-03-01 23:11:54
i really enjoyed seeing a movie in imax that actually filled up the entire imax screen for the whole movie instead of multiple aspect ratio shifts,2024-03-02 01:19:32
probably the first movie in a theater that gave me anxiety that it was going to end i thought it was so good,2024-03-02 03:07:50

also i know he wasnt in the movie but i was randomly thinking about how its so many centuries into the future and there was someone named duncan idaho lol",2024-03-02 03:19:35
my only complaint is that it wasn’t longer amazing amazing film,2024-03-02 03:24:03

alright i was so so with dune pt 1 but dune pt 2 was leaps and bounds ahead im still thinking about it and scenes have been drilled into my head lady jessica drinking the water of life was great to see villeneuve get creative with interpreting a psychedelic experience the buildup music visuals on that were spectacular same with the harkonnen arena fight black and white high contrast and using inkblots as fireworks  total eye candy,2024-03-02 20:44:51

baron and rabban felt like they didnt have much impact in any of the scenes baron is either floating with his balloons or taking an oil bath and rabban aside from his first scene he is being threatened or getting his  kicked lol,2024-03-03 00:28:34
absolutely love both the movies but does anyone else wish the battle of arrakeen was 10 minutes longer would have been nice if there was more fighting  action scenes overall,2024-03-03 03:26:35

i loved it so much felt like i was a kid again watching it in imax they nailed so many scenes i was looking forward to the massive sense of scale for everything just  you into it feels like this is going to be a classic for a long time to come,2024-03-03 05:42:25
they also did a good job of conveying how despite the powers and prescience of paul hes really also just along for the ride on a narrow path true to the theme of the books that theres no fairytale victory theres only navigating past mostly horrible possibilities set by forces so much vaster and more profound than can even be grasped by a  leader,2024-03-03 06:50:10

"so i watched this movie on the biggest imax screen on earth yesterday which on itself was already mindblowing little video to convey the scale and my  if this wasnt one of the best things i ever had the pleasure to watch

1010 truly spectacular in every capacity

i was blown the  away by literally every piece that makes this whole

the visuals are fantastic the sounds and music topnotch hans zimmer also imo delivered some of his best to date the story well its dune so of course its good but its also adapted very well to fit the medium and audience without hurting any of the source imo the acting is superb by really everyone and the pacing lets every scene and every story beat shine and speak for itself

i wasnt expecting how funny this thing would be at times as well stilgart created moments where the whole room was laughing

and the action was fire i will be thinking about the worm riding scenes and the final assault a lot and even the final duel had something about it that just really made it pop

ill be rewatching this movie a lot",2024-03-03 21:15:47

they say lisan al gaib so much in the movie you could get destroyed in a drinking game

i just saw dune 2 and i thought it was great i just had one question early in the movie stilgar has paul perform this strenuous test of going deep into the desert and then returning back to them to help prove that paul is the one in the prophecy they build it up to be this huge ordeal  that will really test paul paul goes and there’s maybe 1 very brief scene where chani meets him out there in the desert and helps him sandwalk then in the next scene paul and chani are fighting in a huge battle with paul seemingly having successfully crossed the desert and returned and it’s never mentioned again just wanted to make sure that i wasn’t missing something maybe some scenes were cut or something just the crossing of the desert trial seemed to be a little bit underdone after such a buildup,2024-03-05 01:27:43

"second comment about this film but ive been watching all the review and reaction videos on youtube and reading a lot of articles about it  one of the points that ive heard is that this is a very oldstyle film hearkening back to cleopatra and ben hur and those other old swordandsandal epics not just because it takes place in the desert  this is a starmaking movie where the performers can feast on and savor the material that theyre given where there are long lingering closeups of the performers  if somebody really went to the effort of reediting it this could almost work as a silent movie given how good the direction was  so even though the action really shines in this there are so many scenes to connect with and discuss the human consequences of that action  to sound like an old fogie they dont make em like that no more 

the really interesting point that i heard too is that when those epics from the 50s and 60s were being produced it was being done as a response to television drawing peoples eyeballs away from the movie theaters  that the size and scale of the old epics were a way to give people an experience that they couldnt get at home  and that we are kind of in a similar situation today  that tv shows havent quite caught up to movies but they can definitely make a case that theyre very close with the funding behind them and the talent sometimes involved  so the big immersive event films like last years barbenheimer and now dune are the direction that the industry should take in order to remain relevant  whether its realistic to expect hollywood to output material of similar quality to this is a completely different story  since the opening of this has been so huge despite the heavy material and because the industry has mastered giving people more and more of what they like it might be a good sign that hollywood is going to give us more like this  at the very least the actors and actresses are going to want their roles in other movies to borrow style and substance from this  just thought it was a really interesting thought process",2024-03-05 03:46:45

"just got back from my 3rd viewing when paul rides the sand worm for the first time we see him without goggles the entire time he has the hooks in both hands when we see him stand up on the worm his goggles are on glaring continuity error literally unwatchable  s


on a serious note every shot in this movie is a work of art the scenery and cinematography are unbelievable i love this film so much every use of the voice had me shook and when paul and jessica are speaking before jessica travels south the way she said “all of us” emulating alia’s voice was freaky as  

again the giedi prime sequence is as gorgeous as it is harrowing loved it 

one of my favorite parts i caught in these rewatches are right before the atomics are shot stilgar and his army are calling worms 1 it was almost a mini homage to the beacons are lit scene in rotk the way the camera was panning over each thumper and 2 the way zimmer masterfully scored that scene the thumpers are beating out of turn with each other then slowly builds into a crescendo of in time thumpers that beautifully transitions into the epic score leading into the attack jaw was on the floor 

i will be back for a 4th viewing this time in imax again",2024-03-09 04:36:24

yes",2024-03-09 06:26:02
"as someone who hasn’t read the books and only seen the movies i think the scene with the hand inside the box and then they show the psychic women discussing how to control him was super important in the first movie that happened but i think they didn’t show the discussion on how to control tim and it’s because they couldn’t 

once he gained the power of foresight humans are at the mercy of him being benevolent or a tyrant he has become omniscient the prophecy is bs but he can follow it and use it as a tool to achieve the vision he wants cause even if you can see all possible futures doesn’t mean you could rule the universe but he had the perfect storm on this planet

as they say those who control the spice planet controls the universe",2024-03-09 10:18:43
"1 i had constant goosebumps watching the film i say it’s even better than the first one i loved part one too but i also felt it was more like a tv series like watching lost a lot of things were going on but i also thought that nothing really happened now part two is much more of a traditional film but i think it also comes down to the director’s master plan part one was world building setting us on the journey part two is where the actual history begins if i can say that

2 rebecca ferguson is insanely good lady jessica is by far the best acted character out of all i admit i never really seen any other film with her in it but i’m absolutely a fan now she is the best in both films

3 foundation needs a villeneuve dune style film adaptation i still got chills watching the apple tv series trailer but that was the only good part and the pilot after that the writer’s never really trusted the viewers ",2024-03-09 11:45:33

not a lot of movies can do that these days great stuff",2024-03-09 14:24:47
"man if you have the chance watch this  in imax because holy  this is probably one of the best movies you could experience that format with


the scenes in geidi prime were  gorgeous and the ink blot style fireworks were insanely breathtaking


the entire cast killed it so much and timothy chalamet javier bardem and austin butler in particular all played their parts perfectly


that scene with paul in the end telling his fremen followers to lead everyone to paradise is so chilling hes become everything hes dreamed about in all his visions this leader of a cult of personality and you just get the feeling thats its all over now the holy war has finally begun and paul has become this person who chooses to cause a war that destroys so many lives and theres nothing he can do about it",2024-03-10 13:24:33
my favorite thing was this one dude kept trying to make funny remarks in the theater when austin butler showed up he screamed “ you elvis” half the theater screamed “jesus christ shut the ” really broke the tension when people on screen got their throats slit,2024-03-10 23:51:06
just got back from watching this my  the ending just left you empty inside amazing film 1010,2024-03-13 09:58:28
"to get the filmee stuff out the way it was shot beautifully the cast was top notch and the music in this one was heavy dark and atmospheric amazingly well made film with a clear visual vision and amazing execution 


now am i a bit disappointed the ‘weird’ aspects of the book were toned down a bit was christopher walken not a very good emperor also yes he lacked that big royal presence i wanted charles dance to take the role and i still think he would’ve been the way to go 



now with those admittedly minor complaints out of the way i loved this movie  paul’s character arc was equal parts interesting and sinister the movie does a great job making you both hate and understand lady jessica and fayd rautha stole the show i also absolutely loved the religious imagery and ‘vibes’ of the whole thing especially having studied islamic history both from a government propaganda pov i come from saudi arabia and a critical historic pov paul’s rise the fremen’s dedication to him the portrayal of ‘miracles’ and the whole rising conquerer vibe of the movie was amazingly handled and i loved paul’s reluctance to accept his role as their messiah until he finally accepted his destiny embracing the propagated image created for him the movie also does a great job of stringing you along with the whole “paul is a good guy” fake out form the first movie until he drinks the water of life and things go for a sinister turn been a long time since i left the theater for a 30 minute walk in silence",2024-03-14 01:32:26
"the final battle scene with the fremen riding the worms was peak cinema loved the film and how crazy weird it gets with the talking fetus worm milk psychic people etc raid scenes and hand to hand combat scenes were great   

give denis villenueve all the money to adapt more scifi books thanks",2024-03-14 18:35:21
"this movie was a 910 with only one thing needed to make it a 1010 then we got it it happened 

gurney halleck played the baliset i can die a happy man",2024-03-26 16:32:03
"i feel like it was rushed what i love about the first movie was the atmosphere and this sense of underlying foreboding part 2 didn’t have that same feeling for me things just kept happening one after another with no space to breathe apparently the things that happen in part 2 actually occurred over years in the novel so why did they compress it to months 

if they had made part 2 focus on paul integrating with the fremen earning their reverence bonding with chani building up the legend of the muadib and then ending with a crucial attack that makes him wrestle with the decision to drink the water of life to protect them i think i would have liked it better and then part 3 could’ve fleshed out paul’s changing personality and focused on the political machinations needed to get his revenge and spend more time on the decision of the fremen to carry out jihad",2024-03-28 16:34:35
"absolutely astounding film this must be what it felt like to see star wars in 1977

villanueves worldbuilding is insane the fremen feel like such a deeply real culture in every aspect  from costumes to customs superstitions to language they make this film feel alive

cheers to the art directors the set pieces and sense of scale achieved here will be referenced for generations

super impressed with the script as well  paul’s heel turn felt believable and driven by motivecircumstance very hard to achieve in a two and a half hour movie got couldn’t do it in 6 seasons

must see this on the biggest screen you can find",2024-03-02 20:44:57
"there were like 116 different times were i thought “that shot is  awesome”

1010 maybe the best movie i’ve ever seen",2024-03-04 03:01:54
watching paul ride the sandworm in imax was so  cool,2024-03-01 03:18:05
you know the feeling after you walk out of a theater realizing you’ve just seen a masterpiece yeah i’ve been feeling that ever since i left the theater two hours ago phenomenal film,2024-03-01 04:07:52
nothing has ever made me appreciate “cinema” more than this film,2024-03-01 21:20:19
the entire geidi prime sequence was just incredible man the way that society is imagined being maggotpale poisoned vulgarians beneath a black sun appeals in a deeply liminal way the gladiator sequence through the love scene lol just superbly imaginative and brilliantly designed,2024-03-03 06:07:12
paul refusing to  stilgar saying “to deny his talent in the upcoming battle” was the exact thing his father said in the first movie and paul wasn’t around when leto said it he really is a great leader like his father also possibly eren yaeger but we will see how that goes in the 3rd movie lol,2024-03-06 04:45:49
i was expecting the spacing guild to play a role in this but austin butler going going to be in everything and he was fantastic as feyd,2024-03-01 03:33:58
reading the book i always had a difficult time visualizing exactly how getting onto the worm works so i appreciate the movie for finally making me understand it now i’m just wondering how does one get off the worm,2024-03-01 04:25:10
really solid movie but i can’t help but think of the sandworms as giant uber,2024-03-01 04:34:58
im speechless an all time movie going experience,2024-03-01 06:16:48
"feyd’s intro sequence was sooo cool 

i did expect to hear an elvis accent though",2024-03-01 06:36:17
that scene where paul was walking through the sea of fremen and they just moved out of the way like he was moses went so  hard,2024-03-01 10:30:26
masterpiece,2024-03-01 18:29:56
the scenes on geidi prime were the highlights for me such a fascinating planet almost made me miss it when we got back to arrakis,2024-03-01 21:19:51
pauls stomp made me jump so hard in imax,2024-03-01 22:20:24
i am familiar with arabic i understand where the auhtor got a lot of his inspiration from so it was personally a surprise that i only realised after seeing both parts that holy war meant jihad but i guess because of the modern negative connotations of the word it wasnt used,2024-03-02 01:09:31

a surprising amount of non  kissing,2024-03-02 22:41:07
 that was spectacular way better than the first part imo i really feel for chani though heartwrenching ending,2024-03-02 23:00:06
this was probably the most immersive movie i’ve ever seen the sandworm ride in particular was amazing,2024-03-03 00:02:59
saw this at a true imax theater and my jaw was on the floor it was such a masterfully crafted film watching a filmmaker at the absolute height of his powers true scifi unimaginable scale the final blade battle is already in my all time favorites,2024-03-03 03:31:05
yeah it’s rough but paul is doing what he has to do it’s the the only “narrow” way to overcome his enemies it’s either free the fremen and get revengehonor back or allow the fremen to become extinct and wither away with them,2024-03-03 08:20:43
my boy paul reminding me of eren yeager all over again,2024-03-03 15:01:40
"watching this film was a very emotional experience for me i first read dune when i was about 14 or 15 ive probably read it a dozen times since then seeing the characters and situations i love come to life on the screen was something ive waited for my whole life and this film did not disappoint while i love lynchs 1984 adaptation very much villeneuves adaptation while deviating from the book in significant ways will always have a special place in my heart

that said there was one scene that was not in the film that i really wish denis had included  that being the ritual of dividing up jamis belongings when paul sheds water for the dead its a very touching and emotional scene and important to the process of paul being adopted by stilgars tribe i realise that elements of this scene were used in other parts of the film but i really would have liked to see it portrayed more closely to the book version",2024-03-03 15:22:55
"all the hes the messiah made me think of life of brian

for real tho  loved it 1010",2024-03-03 15:43:08
"wow that was a lot

i loved it

i think it was also a lot more palatable to non readers",2024-03-03 16:43:54
man i feel like this is obvious but its hitting me a day later early on in the movie jessica tells paul that his father never wanted revenge but paul says that he does this makes more sense when we find out that jessica and paul are actually part harkonnan as well so that desire for violencerevenge comes from there,2024-03-03 18:46:04
"so that is pretty close to perfect

the only small thing is that it may be hard to understand what people are saying in parts just something i noticed",2024-03-04 00:41:35
"walk without rhythm and you wont attract the worm

walk without rhythm and you wont attract the worm",2024-03-04 01:32:05
i watched all of the first movie and waited until halfway through this movie before i realized stilgar was played by javier bardem i kept feeling this odd sensation of recognizing his voice but not being able to name him during the first movie i feel like he really sort of melded into the character,2024-03-04 09:19:42
"wow i had stupidly high expectations and it surpassed them  i did think the second d half felt a bit rushed and i felt like they glossed over pauls visions a bit compared to part 1


but what a spectacular achievement  villenue has successfully pickled up where peter jackson left off with epic sci fi fantasy filmmaking  everything was just awesome  the sandworm riding scene wow",2024-03-04 13:45:06
the costume design in this film is maybe the best of any scifi or fantasy film that ive ever seen everything looks real and worn and practical while staying within its own culture and also being beautiful and elegant to me its one of the most impressive things about it it really helps in the worldbuilding,2024-03-04 21:32:30
someday i hope i love anything as much as denis villeneuve loves that shot of chalamet walking from the mist center frame with his cloak billowing to the side,2024-03-04 21:40:42
i saw this movie on friday and was blown away i just saw it again in imax 70mm and it was one of the best viewing experiences i have ever had a masterpiece,2024-03-05 02:38:13
"i never saw the name of the planet being dune coming like at all

1010 movie holy ",2024-03-05 02:53:58
one of the best movies i have ever seen hands down,2024-03-05 03:11:18
what an amazing movie the world building was phenomenal and unlike anything i’d seen before definitely a theater experience and genuinely one of the best movies i’ve seen ,2024-03-06 04:19:59
rewatching part 1 before my second watch this weekend and man it’s crazy how i loved part 1 before but i love it even more after my first watch of part 2,2024-03-06 19:57:17
reading all the comments of people saying their theater busted out laughing at stilgar glad i didn’t get that experience really would have taken away from the moments of his joy of the prophecy although i did laugh when he said he would be too humble to say he’s the messiah and made me wonder if denis is a secret fan of life of brian,2024-03-06 21:14:54
is anyone else wondering how exactly will paul lead the fremen to fight against the great houses in the next movie the fremen are only formidable on arakis because they can control the sandworm and they know the terrain but i highly doubt any of them are skilled pilots or warriors in space,2024-03-07 09:13:09

was vibing with the no country for old men reunion with brolin and bardem,2024-03-08 23:00:56
watched the movie and all i can say is wow i’ve never read the book and was literally blown away by part one so much i’ve watched it over ten times no exaggeration saw the second one in theaters 3 hours ago and i was in simple awe there’s just so so many thoughts running through my mind that i don’t even know where to begin i’m glad to see other people needing out to this like i did this movie legit makes me want to read the book now,2024-03-08 23:33:57
"what a completely captivating movie i felt like i was both barely holding on to the sci fi world it was on and also completely understanding every beat and turn regardless you know you’re watching quality 

favorite parts paul riding the worm and the gladiator scene what cinematography",2024-03-09 06:53:23
watched the movie at the big screen today its the second time after avengers endgame that i felt so happy in a cinema,2024-03-09 18:02:08

eating an edible and seeing this in imaxjust wow one of the best and most impressive cinematic experiences i have ever had i honestly dont know if i can think of one that tops it,2024-03-10 14:14:34
as an avid fan of the books these two firdt movies have blown me away in their adherence but also their creativity to me everything they did makes sense i am only sad that ee will only get three of these i really wish a fourthfifth would go into the events of the third book honestly i just wish they would go on forever,2024-03-10 19:24:28
one of the best movies in the past few years,2024-03-11 04:42:24
"just finished my second watch my immediate thought after was that this will be my first movie that ill watch 3 times in theaters unfortunately my little town doesnt have imax so im debating making the 2 hour drive to the nearest imax theater  this is such an incredible story hans zimmer has solidified himself as one of the greatest film composers of our time the scale of these films feels unprecedented not just in terms of the size of things like the ships the sandworms etc but the themes as well 

just a few random thoughts

paul riding the sandworm for the first time gave me chills even more so on my second viewing

the mahdi is too humble to say he is the mahdi even more reason to know he is made me laugh out loud

the way stilgar says lisan al gaib after the fight with feyd is so funny to me the relief in his voice the way it sounds like hes saying i knew it after thinking he was about to watch paul die 

 such an awesome movie",2024-03-13 04:53:26
am i the only one who thought the baby sandworm was kind of cute and i was sad when it died,2024-03-13 16:40:56
i need a hype man like javier bardem in my life,2024-03-14 22:51:05
"i loved the visuals and general cinematic experience but unpopular maybe opinion it felt somewhat hollow paul didnt feel like an actual person  the interiority of his character was entirely lacking beyond vague dont wanna go allusions to the jihad and the south  his experience with the spice was also allusional and his transformation exact and sudden chani and stilgar were better characterised but they also had no arc it felt a bit almost stale

the emperor was so one dimensional he also is in the book but still as to be essentially dull the baron was a non factor raban did nothing but be replaced by an equally bland and displaced character well acted performed imagined delivered but there was nothing beneath the veneer",2024-03-16 02:36:48
this movie was a huge masterpiece and my theater was not able to destroy the experience being a small theater in a small town they presented it with  black bars to the sites because they dont know how to get their movies to fill the entire screen and the speakers were totally overwhelmed with the sound but it was still a rich movie experience,2024-03-20 00:58:01
since rise of the planet of the apes trilogy ended dune is the latest one to capture that scifi epic i know avatar way of water came out 2022 but plot made their world small  redundant,2024-03-28 01:49:55
"didnt feel this movie as much as the people in this thread it is a far cry from lotr thats for sure lotr had a lot of heart i would even put got ahead of this since the characters were more intriguing and the politics was more complex and engaging dune is just too weird and part 2 gets even more so

still the weirdness felt unique and dune 2 did feel like a breath of fresh air however the cold tone very common in villenueves movies and quick pacing prevent dune 2 from being an all time film imho the film puts us at a distance from the 2 main characters of the previou film paul and his mother instead chani becomes the emotional core of the movie moreover the water of life thing wasnt well explained paul just becomes op within minutes and he is able to steamroll the emperor as well as the harkonnens within seconds no resistance whatsoever became all too simple

i must say visually this movie was a treat for sure definitely worth it to see in theatres but i dont think this is a cinema classic i still think br 2049 is deniss best scifi film and from what i have read dune 3 whenever it comes out will be even weirder man i was glad when the credits rolled because the bleak world of dune is tough to sit in for more than a cople of hours",2024-04-01 18:06:07
really liked the movie overall austin butler was the best part along with javier bardem my only complaint is that it felt like timothy and zendaya had like zero chemistry also both of their dialogues at times felt too modern and out of place “hey what are you guys laughing about” completely took me out of the movie,2024-03-01 16:10:07
"saw this yesterday 1010  
  
stunning on every level  visuals cinematography score acting timothée owned the latter half of the film chani was amazing austin butler was terrifying as feyd the irshot scenes on giedi prime were beautiful  
  
as someone who loves the book i was very happy with denis adaptation of the second half enough changes were made to make it more adaptable and general audience friendly while still maintaining the core themes and ideas  
  
i might love part two even more than the first film but i need couple of more watches as its a lot to process  
  
going again today tomorrow and next saturday finally in imax  
  
this must make all the money in the world so we get messiah and i will do my part",2024-03-02 09:10:44
"the entire geidi prime sequence was incredible but the scene that did it for me was when feyd walks down the corridor and the firework lights burst against the windows like gunfire

my jaw was unhinged the entire time the visionary talent at work is absolutely mindblowing",2024-03-02 17:47:18
"just came from the theater

this movie was so unreal

would like to give kisses to denis",2024-03-03 08:52:19
"im probably deaf now guess i know now why the other movies in my cinema are always this quiet

dune took all the sound budget holy fcking 

definitely in my top ten movies of all time im rarely speechless after exiting a movie but this maaaan that took me out",2024-03-03 19:28:30
"saw it last night and loved it there were a few differences from the book that kind of bummed me

 the second half of the book takes place over a couple of years and alia is actually born and we get to see some of her growth
 the book makes it explicitly clear that the marriage between paul and irulan is strictly political and paul and chani are still a couple
 the book has a lot more focus on paul training the fremen in the weirding way which is something lynchs version gives a lot of attention to

with that said those changes are not detrimental to the overall story and i think the two movies together make it to my top 3 scifi franchises",2024-03-03 20:20:53
"my biggest annoyance in the book to film adaptation wasnt changing the brutal manner in which feyd is killed altering the ending by omitting the exchange between chani and jessica or even the lack of a preborn toddler for the finale  it was the inconsistent punctuation in the subtitles what happened there part one had good grammar 

otherwise this was a 1010 film that had me on the edge of my seat throughout fantastic visuals bonerattling sound design otherworldly and intense score and fantastic performances abound cannot wait to watch this backtoback with the first film this is a masterpiece and easily my favorite film of the year   

bring on part three",2024-03-01 03:09:52
paul must be the chosen one arrakis would have some  up uv levels and yet he maintains the complexion of a victorian era ghost child,2024-03-01 03:56:58
"i loved this movie but i have one major gripe that i dont see anyone discussing 

bautistas and brolins fight was pretty anticlimatic which would have been passable if not for the worst like of dialogue in the movie this is for the duke and my friends 

a large portion of my theatre laughed it was so woefully out of place from the rest of the movie

i also wish lady jessica and gurney got a scene together thought that was strange",2024-03-01 11:32:07
"absolutely spectacular movie 1010 gonna see it 3 more times at least

one thing i didnt quite understand and thought was kinda important when lady jessica drinks the holy poison the passing reverend mother remarks in terror that shes pregnant and everyone around kinda gasps in fear what does that mean and if it means something ominous and dangerous why did they not do something about it

i understood it as it is dangerous but she is now the reverend mother so we must do as she says no matter what is that correct i was quite interested in that little plot point and moment in the movie would love to hear more about the lore behind it",2024-03-01 19:37:27
"i love so much how denis portrays the talking fetus

jessica talking to herself framed like shes insane was so creepy and well done",2024-03-02 21:28:49
chani is the only sane character in the whole movie,2024-03-03 00:37:42
"i’m trying to be measured in my response to this film but it was honestly one of the most moving artistic experiences i’ve ever witnessed story aside the audio  visual achievement of this project is for me unmatched several instances brought tears to my eyes out of shear awe as the final scene cut and the score hit i just sat and cried for a solid 5 minutes

also i was skeptical of tc as paul even for some of this movie but he completely took over this film by the end the scene of him announcing his arrival to the bene gesserit was fantastic",2024-03-05 14:04:32
"just came out of a very empty session perks of going to the movies midweek probably one of the best cinematic experiences ive ever had based on sound alone will be sad watching it at home without a surround system top notch visuals which is a given with villeneuve and got me very excited for part 3 

also a shout out to the movies comedy specially javiers guy got pitch perfect comedic timing that lisan algaib at the end of the last duel killed me dude sounded like that uncle who just saw his favourite soccer player score a goal haha",2024-03-13 23:31:12
"i guess i’m gonna be downvoted but these responses are confusing me

it was a good well made film but people saying it was one of the best films they’ve ever seen are a bit much people are also saying specifically that it was better than part 1 because part 1 was slow did we watch the same movie this was very slow the final antagonist paul faced took a ton of time even to be introduced i still think part 1 was the better movie

that said still a visually stunning and well acted movie would definitely recommend seeing in the highest quality format possible",2024-03-01 03:28:21
interesting that gurney wasn’t trying to  jessica in this or did i miss that i know in the book he believes that jessica was the one who betrayed leto but i don’t think he mentioned it in this,2024-03-01 03:29:17

was anyone taken a bit back from the comedy i havent read the book so i am not sure if its like that but coming from part 1 where there was like almost zero comedy maybe a few chuckles here and  there but cut to this where stilgar was cracking jokes every other line,2024-03-01 16:22:45
i absolutely loved the fact that they had the separate factions of the fremen its not really a thing in the first book and i found it the most interesting change,2024-03-01 16:31:29

any book readers can explain why the great houses refused to honor paul as the new emperor even after the old emperor surrendered i thought it was mentioned earlier in the movies that the houses would topple the old emperor if they ever found out he was responsible for the atreidus massacre,2024-03-04 05:44:06
i was kind of hoping wed see villeneuves take on the spacing guild navigators ah well maybe in dune messiah if that comes to pass the sandworms the nukes any scene with stilgar lots to enjoy in this one,2024-03-04 07:55:47
movie was fantastic loved it however can any hardcore dune fans eli5 this to me was the prophecy even true were the fremen lied to why did lady jessica need to convince all the fremen in the south that paul was the messiah,2024-03-04 14:16:20
paul is a character straight out of shakespeare play isnt he the tragic hero who audience is supposed to relate and whose actions will be his own tragic downfall,2024-03-04 15:16:59
"i really missed more of the mentats in these movies and the explanation that they are the replacement for computers and ai  


im not even sure they hinted at what the mentats were for nonbook readers or if there were any references to the ai uprising that caused them to be outlawed   


however i did like the array of chanting mentats in the harkonnen command center that were being used to track the traffic around arrakis  


we needed another hour of movie to dive more into world building",2024-03-04 17:02:49

one scene i havent seen mentioned yet that i really loved was that bit with rabba running and almost being killed by a fremen this is a feared guy who squared up with gurney who is acknowledged as one of the best fighters in the empire and some random fremen almost kills him hes just sitting there thinking that that a no name fremen almost took him out and that these fanatically loyal dangerous people are willing to fight and die in pauls name and there are millions of them i loved his look of realizing how  they are,2024-03-31 10:25:45
"didnt feel this movie as much as the people in this thread it is a far cry from lotr thats for sure lotr had a lot of heart i would even put got ahead of this since the characters were more intriguing and the politics was more complex and engaging dune is just too weird and part 2 gets even more so

still the weirdness felt unique and dune 2 did feel like a breath of fresh air however the cold tone very common in villenueves movies and quick pacing prevent dune 2 from being an all time film imho the film puts us at a distance from the 2 main characters of the previou film paul and his mother instead chani becomes the emotional core of the movie moreover the water of life thing wasnt well explained paul just becomes op within minutes and he is able to steamroll the emperor as well as the harkonnens within seconds no resistance whatsoever became all too simple

i must say visually this movie was a treat for sure definitely worth it to see in theatres but i dont think this is a cinema classic i still think br 2049 is deniss best scifi film and from what i have read dune 3 whenever it comes out will be even weirder man i was glad when the credits rolled because the bleak world of dune is tough to sit in for more than a cople of hours",2024-04-01 18:06:22
"my thoughts on the film

 timothy did a incredible job with this role given the amount of subtle transitions from being a servant  son of duke all the way to being the messiah a lot of emotions inbetween his transition was portrayed in a way that made the whole journey believable he did a similar character transition in the king which is on netflix amazing movie which i think was used as audition footage for this role in my opinion

 villeneuve has done something with this series that i dont think many people were expecting the world building and cinematography was outstanding but he also captured a story that i believe is more relevant today than when it was written in the 60s the families superpowers business interests all fighting for power in the form of spice there is obviously a lot of similar themes to the middle east shortly before this book was written to me this story was taken from when mosaddegh tried to nationalize the oil industry only for the usuk forces to interfere and create a coup overthrowing the government out of fear their oil resource would be at jeopardy and more underlying factors were built out and put into a science fiction setting what makes you really contemplate is how much things have stayed the same even with corporate entities fighting over technological resources russia fighting over ukrainian resources and obviously what is happening in gaza to overtake land its really a movie that makes you reflect on what is happening in the world today even though it was written decades ago the prophetic theme of the story makes it much more powerful when realizing how much history has repeated itself

 one thing i was thinking about regarding the story between paul and chani is that he told her he would always love her as long as he breathes in a prior scene we see paul having visions of chani seemingly dying when looking over the dune i think pauls newly found ability to see future outcomes has influenced his decision to take the emperors daughter as his bride to protect chani from a negative outcome i know the film frames the decision to take the emperors daughter irulan as beneficial for paul to be more acceptable to the houses but we see the houses reject his claim anyway we also see prior that the reverend mother mohiam also desired this outcome which she even seemingly discusses with irulan i believe this could be a red herring and that the decision to take irulan as his bride is more about protecting chani than about political motives paul says to chani that his allegiance is to her and i dont think that has changed we are often too reactionary to things and look back on them as fortunate and i think chani will realize that paul was protecting her",2024-04-07 01:12:39
i feel like christopher walken was just thinking the whole time “what the  am i doing in this movie” ,2024-04-08 16:38:06
good movie but it would’ve been even better even if it was 30 more minutes not the 5 out of 5 stars everybody is saying more like a 4 i feel like even though it has a long runtime it felt a bit rushed austin butler was under utilized and could have been more fleshed out and more impactful next to the romance between paul and chani which i felt came too quickly based on the scenes we had also the final assault on whatever compound it was felt too fast for me when they were suddenly in the room with the emperor and the baron would have loved to see more of the battle there and not this quick cut to it happening and feeling like we missed something still enjoyed it though,2024-03-01 14:34:13
has anyone noticed that the first shot of part 1 is a vision and we see it play out in part 2 when chani tells paul right before they kiss “arrakis is so beautiful when the sun is low” there’s a quick moment after that where you can see on paul’s face that he realizes another one of his visions has come to pass i just love how subtle that call back was,2024-03-02 12:07:23
paul the absolute chad picking to marry the princess in front of his girlfriend,2024-03-02 14:09:16
"a solid 910

we now have a definitive film adaptation of dune just like we got with lotr that will likely stand the test of time 

personal highlights 

chalamets paul after drinking from the water of life what a transformation totally bought that version of his character not thinking i would

the score a time of quiet between the storms and the recurring musical motif is just chefs kiss

feyd rautha butler absolutely nailed it and almost stole the show

i was glad denis wrote out alias character and kept her from being born yet wouldve been way too difficult to faithfully adapt this book without some weird  and thats probably 1 for me",2024-03-03 08:13:34
"loved the movie thoroughly entertained for the entire movie never once looked at my watch a couple of points that i haven’t seen raised that i thought were great subtle touches 

1 i loved the juxtaposition between the northsouth fremen it also seemed like a generational divide with the younger fremen chani shishakli etc being the skeptical ones and the older folks like stilgar buying in felt like a subtle nod to real life where younger generations are increasingly apatheticskeptical to organized religion me included 

2 i loved the scene where rabban is flying his troops into the stormambush to face off against mua’dib you see the shot of the harkkonen guy throwing up out of nervousness and the others looking scared stiff did such a great job of showing that despite rabban and vladimir’s designation of the fremen as “rats” they have struck fear into the hearts of the harkkonen foot soldier the fight was over before they even landed 

separately austin butler stole the  show feyd rautha was terrifying chalamet’s sietch scene was incredibly well acted and genuinely startling lastly the intro to feydrautha and the oil fireworks were amazing 

can’t wait to go again in two days this is the closest i have felt to coming out of the theaters after mad max fury road which is a big compliment imo",2024-03-03 12:10:53
"also christopher walken  massive miscast

not sure if it’s because i watch severance but i couldn’t really accept the character as this emperor who rules",2024-03-05 12:33:09
so if you drink the blue worm juice you become an ,2024-03-06 05:17:00
"as a cinematic experience this movie is a 1010

visually stunning beautiful score just an utter spectacle probably the first movie since fury road where i was thinking to myself “i have never seen anything like this” 

the action sequences are incredible i can’t fathom how this whole creative team put this together in the final battle scene i was just in awe of the vfx of the totally original sci fi vehicles and structures soaring in the background the choreography of the actual fighting the costume and weapon designs the perfect cinematography the sound design the music everything was incredible it takes hundreds if not thousands of people operating at the top of their game to pull all that off 

i do think there was clunky dialogue at times and the flow of the plot wasn’t perfect not bad but it’s just a lot stuffed into one movie even if it was nearly three hours 

overall a must see experience in theaters check it out in imax if you can",2024-03-01 03:53:58
austin butler went for seconds when he kissed his uncle ,2024-03-01 03:59:33

"as a huge book fan  seeing the final battle actually play out on a screen was phenomenal huge smile on my face the whole time 

giedi prime black and white because of the black sun also super well done this movie was 1010 for me 

small detail  didnt ultimately take away but anyone else disappointed with how long the fight was against feyd rautha at the end i feel like the point was to show how easy it was for paul idk correct me if im wrong",2024-03-01 06:03:28
so incredibly incredibly good i cannot wait to watch 1  2 back to back my only complaints were the  behind me that wouldnt  despite multiple people hushingasking them to stop and walken not feeling transformed from his usual self enough i thought all the other performances were very transformative and left the actor behind while i only ever saw walken not the emporer but  what an incredible film  one of the best edited movies ive ever seen,2024-03-01 06:38:33

i loved it except they almost completely forgot about the spacing guild the entire reason paul can take over the empire in the book is because his threat to destroy the spice will destroy the guild thats how he can force them to transport the fremen otherwise theyre not going very far,2024-03-02 02:30:24
this might be the most memorable movie experience ive had since the dark knight,2024-03-02 12:57:39

that was a franchise making movie we’re talking lord of the rings and harry potter and that’s it ,2024-03-04 05:09:02
they  nailed the casting for paul holy  that dude can be charismatic and soft spoken and then go to 100 like a warlord lol everytime he yelled or got into his speeches it either made me jump or gave me goosebump,2024-03-04 07:07:21
plot hole how is timothee chalamet still that freaking pale and  after months in the desert paul should be either tan or sunburnt as heck by now,2024-03-05 05:01:24
instant classic as a book reader it felt flawless and i love the changes chani feels so much more real in the movie than the novel,2024-03-09 21:35:37
the harkonnens fell like  when confronted by people actually willing to stand up to them bautistas character was completely emasculated,2024-03-24 01:46:35
"a sequel just as good as part one if not better

 rebecca ferguson and javier bardem carried the first act
 pacing was almost too fast even though its a long movie
 technically the movie is impressive in terms visual effects cinematography production design sound will sweep the oscars again
 timothée chalamet during the scene where he claims his chosen one title was absolutely perfect 
 action was lacklustre except for the final fight
 kinda wished the kept anya taylorjoys cameo as a secret


visually impressive and one of the best imax experiences",2024-03-01 03:22:19
this film is rewatchable just came from third viewing and the ending hit even harder,2024-03-02 14:18:35
"at 2 hour and 48 minutes it felt like it could and even should have been longer a bit more explaining through scenes some of the reasons why characters were at where they were at

i enjoyed it far more than the first film  part 2 is the best scifi film ive seen since ex machina at least

probably the best imax experience ive ever seen metreon imax in sf 70mm print  it didnt have the crispness of oppenheimer but this film better utilized what the imax format can do with scale and sound",2024-03-02 17:00:33
"i echo so many sentiments that have already been said beautiful visually stunning sound butler killed it chalamet having his “this dude is it” scene when fully embracing the messiah role etc etc…

but can we talk about how zendaya just rocked dude with an rpg straight to the chest from like 5 feet away",2024-03-03 15:41:03

don’t go to a late night screening you will stay up late thinking about this movie,2024-03-02 06:45:49

ps if you pretend the water of life is gatorade this movie is kinda hilarious",2024-03-01 03:48:31
no exaggeration that might be one of the best third acts i’ve ever seen the rest of the movie is great but everything from paul’s water of life sequence to the end is an alltime great 4550 minute sequence,2024-03-01 04:25:15
"i have mad respect for what villeneuve did here he adapted the book in a way you normally only see it in theater done with classic plays the source material is an amazing story on the one hand but full of anachronistic elements on the other hand while containing amazing ideas and concepts there is also a lot of problematic stuff in it its like super fascists vs normal fascists vs religious fanatics and terrorists vs eugenicwitches typically we would see an adaption either ignoring this fact altogether or kind of whitewashing the story to make it palatable in the 21 century villeneuve did neither but instead leaned into all those problematic aspects and deconstructed the story to a point where basically every individual or fraction is kind of bad in its own way and he does that by staying essentially very close to the source material the changes to the story are rather subtile and a lot of it is delivered by aesthetics i dont think i have ever seen a scififantasy blockbuster being that bold star wars and even lotr which i adore look like movies for babies compared to this

  
also the costumes and set designs ",2024-03-01 08:14:12
"i think this movie will solidify its four young stars as bonafide movie stars a lot of the discourse is already focused mainly on the performances of timothée chalamet zendaya austin butler and florence pugh rightfully so the film would not have worked as well without their stellar performances this will be seen as career defining films for all of four of them 

i was listening to the big picture podcast episode on this and i think they put it more aptly this is them jumping from famous upcoming stars to harrison ford level movie star 

not to take anyway from the older actors of course they also gave great performances rebecca ferguson in particular stands out in many ways i think she gave the most interesting and thought provoking performance overall 

i think this will also finally establish denis villeneuve as a big name director with the mainstream",2024-03-01 09:27:34
"ughhh absolutely incredible unfiltered thoughts and reactions

x200b

 part one is so well done that its impossible not to be entertained but it purely exists to set up the marvelous payoff of part two the set up is important but i think the contrasting scenes and echoes are where the magic is
 the execution of visuals cinematography casting pace costumes is just incredible imo villeneuve has followed a similar trajectory to christopher nolan as a visionary director being given bigger budgets to work with and theres something about his style that is absolutely captivating one of my favourite things about these films is how convincingly it portrays the sense of scale and importance and its easy to fall under the spell that these actors standing in a room talking are the most powerful people in the universe not an easy feat 
  chalamet is truly paul in part two the diminutive desert mouse is a very fitting motif for the boyish actor who commands this massive film in part one leto foreshadows that he found his own way to lead and that paul might do the same and to see it come to fruition was so satisfying
 the film took juuuust enough time in the first act to really sell paul and jessicas transformation into fremen and i really appreciated the little details to sell this
 i found javier bardem to be pretty stale in part one but now with the context of part two i really enjoyed his arc the juxtaposition of seeing stilgar be disrespectful and aloof with leto in part one to a fanatic of muaddib in part two was excellent and the scene of stilgar and the other boomerfremen finding meaning in absolutely everything paul did was hilarious 
 i also really appreciated the nuance of the northsouth tribes and how this played into the plot pauls true love of the fremen way of life through chani was a solid emotional thread to the film and grounded his character from the universeconquering emperor he becomes 
 some clear seeds for a part three laid throughout and i cant  wait
 paul taking command of the sandworm was so powerful and his conquering felt earned afterwards
 the scene of pauls true ascension to prophet in the fremen underground wow ready to take any warriors on and then a demonstration of his prophetic power to bring them to heel
 i can hear your footsteps old man i had a big grin on my face at this reunion
 i really appreciated feyd being given more nuance through his connection to the bene gesserit and enough time to stand on his own his extended introduction was excellent and the parallels to paul were given enough time to make an impact and feyd having the same speech pattern as the baron was an excellent flourish to the role
 poor bautista gets another thankless role his character deserved a bit more and im still waiting for his true breakout role
 i was a bit disappointed with the lack of time we got with walken as the emperor but im still glad with his casting nonetheless it was a great contrast to see him on the throne and allpowerful above the baron before seeing him brought to heel before paul
 and it was also a very nice touch to see the baron have so much trouble bowing to the emperor clearly a gesture he has rarely had to pull off and you could see how much it chafed him to do so
 i knew it was coming but seeing paul command the reverend mother mohaim to silence was everything i wanted it to be
 i cant even begin to pick out the visual details but i can recall a scene of chani fighting that echoes one of pauls visions in part one i cant wait to see more",2024-03-01 12:47:53

"love how striking all the war imagery is without ever overstaying its welcome we hardly even get full sequences—more like quick little living tableaus shreds of a masterpiece ripped from their museum to come ribboning past us 

also love the use of a humor part one lacked and especially as a way to underscore how ridiculous the beginning of a myth can be—before we get swept along with the fremen into cheering for paul until it’s too late masterful stuff",2024-03-02 06:44:59

between the dune and avatar movies im so happy to see that the scifi genre is still alive and well this balance of spectacle and engaging storytelling is what made star wars so generational in the first place thats why i think star wars is in desperate need of a wellplanned movie trilogy instead of an endless onslaught of poorly planned disney shows honestly though pains me to say but im ok at this point if star wars never comes back if i know the sci fifantasy genre torch is being carried by other incredible talent,2024-03-03 15:23:59

i found the whole reaction from the bene gesserit during the arena scene pretty funny too they were acting like feydrautha just did this amazing feat when all he did was take out 3 drugged guys and struggled against the final guy whose been in prison for  knows how long like come on we just saw paul ride a  worm and  tons of harkonnen were really supposed to think this guy is a threat",2024-03-05 01:09:41

really feel for chani at the start paul was like the new kid she was helping catch up and by the end it feels like shes the one being left behind,2024-03-01 09:36:39
awesome movie but the moment that stood out for me the most was that they brought back jamis as a mentor jamis is the last one paul asks for guidance before going south its whos opinion he trusts most perhaps because he never saw him as a lord or messiah or son just as another person jamis is basically the djinn stilgar mentioned,2024-03-01 09:59:32
my heart rate was fluctuating during that arena scene the entire atmosphere is so surreal the bw cinematography adds a layer to it i am dying to see this again in imax,2024-03-01 11:59:30
i didnt understand the spy of the freeman why she did it and then she dies lol,2024-03-01 12:24:02
"just got back from the theatre and man  the spectacle visuals cinematography and sound were stier i cannot wait to see it again hopefully in imax 

my reaction towards the characterisation compared to the novel was more mixed i liked how they gave chani way more agency and things to do as the only character who wasnt drinking the lisanalgaib koolaid and saw the bene gesserit propaganda for what it was i didnt like how they make paul buyin 110 in becoming the symbol of the lisanalgaib to the point of seeming to forget about the fremen dream and discarding chani

in the novel the relationship between paul and chani is meant to mirror the duke leto and lady jessica  concubines who are really the wives i was sad to see that disappear from the movie",2024-03-01 12:47:24
 the color grading in the harkonnen scenes was just  amazing,2024-03-01 13:20:51
"question is kissing a very big deal among the desert people like they have a thing about water and wasting water and sharing other people’s water 

given that you’d expect kissing to be the like the most intimate thing you can ever do in this culture",2024-03-01 13:40:39
i dont think they  gave enough weight to the water of life and othermemory they didnt sell how much paul was transformed and how crazy it was he survived,2024-03-01 13:54:37
why did souheila yacoubs character sacrifice herself,2024-03-01 14:39:36
"i think paul is so good

tells chani he loves her but then for the sake of being a leader takes the emperors daughters hand in marriage

always the bigger picture",2024-03-01 14:41:44
"the ending of the movie made me think that theyre just going to end it there let it be assumed that the holy war was going to succeed as a matter of course

that raises a few questions as well why did the bene jeserit breed feyd rautha then",2024-03-01 15:29:22
i enjoyed it but i think 35 would have been a better length it felt pretty fast and the shift to just wanting to work with them to taking full control felt too quick,2024-03-01 16:06:31
long live the fighters,2024-03-01 16:24:49
i must have missed something why did chani’s friend stay behind when everyone else went south,2024-03-01 16:37:48
elvis has left the building,2024-03-01 16:38:07
lisan al gaib amazing film,2024-03-01 17:54:50
analog technology design in this was so cool i loved the thumpers the princesss recording device the little scroll that the emperor receives the water pumps and sardaukar floating devices but no mentats ,2024-03-01 18:42:41
invigorating performances from entire cast and leads butler was immense sound design was incredible finally another great trilogy this is cinema ,2024-03-01 19:21:41
i feel like this movie fully encapsulates what movies are made for,2024-03-01 19:34:08
i really enjoyed how much they were talking in fremen language,2024-03-01 20:34:41
"these movies remind me heavily of the godfather part 1  2 

but like his upbringing and when he goes to other side with his mom like  im stilling thinking about this movie 24 hours later",2024-03-01 20:47:59
when we saw jessica travel south all i could think of is lady gaga arriving in alien egg that one time,2024-03-01 23:16:18
only one thing missing and thats heres my gom jabbar one of the most amazing parts of the story other than that a solid bloody movie ,2024-03-01 23:19:18
"pretty good movie i enjoyed part 1 slightly more 

however did anyone else find it way too loud maybe im getting old but i dont remember movies being this loud in theatres ten years ago at such a level the sound mixing doesnt immerse me more into the universe but makes me feel slightly uncomfortable which actually takes me out of the story for a moment",2024-03-01 23:46:20
what was josh brolins character doing with his own spice harvester i must have missed that exchange,2024-03-01 23:49:20
the 3rd act of this movie  flew by i wish the 3rd act alone was another 3045 minutes,2024-03-02 02:23:18
i feel like due to time constraints the final epic battle ended too quickly really missed a cool shot when the emperors guard went into the entry and could have shown the bluetored shields and bodies falling otherwise fantastic movie,2024-03-02 03:15:58
absolutely just speechless about this film  definitely one of the greatest scifi movies for me there were maybe a couple fight scenes that i wish were longer but wow other than that just an awesome film to go see in person,2024-03-02 03:34:33
got heavy tetsuo vibes in the back shot of paul looking at the big explosion his stance the loose cloak fluttering in the wind even his hair,2024-03-02 10:01:07
i’m a little annoyedbothered by the fact that they cast anya taylorjoy in this for one scene and a bunch of adr but couldn’t do the same for florence pugh in the first one,2024-03-02 13:25:51
"minor scenes i cant wait to see again

 the different looks on each of the emperor and cos faces as they are being guarded by the sardaukar and watch the ultimate boomerang of their despicable actions enter the room and  the baron
 the old reverend mother of the fremens use of the voice just once with drink and how powerful it sounded
 lady margot fenring watching the battle on giedi prime",2024-03-02 19:03:30
maybe ill enjoy it more on a second watch but i found this had some pacing issues i found the first suffered from similar problems too,2024-03-02 20:11:38
i was 10 minutes late to my imax theater and i felt like i really missed an epic opening about ten minutes later the projector failed the screen went back everyone left to complain and the people in charge of the theater said they were unable to fast forward and instead started the movie from the beginning and  what an opening  just insane cinematography awesome jetpack physics such a tense sequence  denis is incredible,2024-03-02 20:39:44
"i love how stilgar became paul heyman to paul’s roman reigns

…lisan al gaib",2024-03-02 21:48:12
everything has been said but i’d like to appreciate that you can see the budget in how  beautiful and expansive and bold this movie is every last cent feels line it was used towards making the movie the best it could be there are movies with double this reported budget that look far worse,2024-03-02 22:17:31
probably my favorite intro scene for a sci fi movie,2024-03-02 23:12:53
i just came back from seeing it in imax and i was blown away by the sound design score and visuals every scene and shot was perfect and you always knew what was happening every action sequence and dialogue said had impact and clarity what i always find so compelling with villeneuve’s films is how precise his storytelling is the dynamic and love story of paul and chani is so emotional the way he depicts each planet and how he didn’t shy away from the influence of islam in frank herbert’s novel and so many other aspects i can just rave on about makes this a rewatch many times for me,2024-03-03 01:59:36
"highlights

like everybody else i was pretty amused with stilgar  until paul drank the worm bile his fanaticism became terrifying

speaking of the water of life i wish pauls was as creepy as jessicas whole sequence but  chalamet just exuded power and command after all that water of life business i was glued to the screen when he marched in and defied the fremen

giedi prime need i say more giedi prime

also i couldnt have asked for better actresses portraying the bene gesserit rampling ferguson and even seydoux were phenomenal i didnt get psychic witches vibe from the bg in part 1  but in this one oh man",2024-03-03 02:08:43
"making dune pt 2 im sure the handling of alia was one of the first hurdles villeneuve and co came across and i think they handled it very well 

a bookaccurate alia running around would have been almost impossible to not be cheesy or a cgi mess 

they still kept the spirit of her gaining awareness early while adding to jessicas character",2024-03-03 02:10:00
"there is so much dna of denis’ old stuff in this thing  a ton of the shots of faces of the fremen in the first third reminded me of the shots of recruits in the opening to incendies

in fact just the way people moved through this whole movie and occupied the camera was really cool if that makes sense  it was just as impactful as the big set pieces",2024-03-03 02:33:46
that scene where paul was talking about their narrow path to survival i so wanted him to call it their golden path,2024-03-03 03:20:56
holy  i saw this in imax and it was worth all of my monies the sound design the costumes and the visuals were so cool,2024-03-03 03:55:37
all the talk about bloodlines in this movie and not one single person acknowledged the bloodline and their tribal chief roman reigns,2024-03-03 05:01:52
i liked austins take on a more composed feyd but i feel like it changed the dynamic of the final fight it was more about skill than deception and distraction no hip blade,2024-03-03 09:13:26

i bought tickets to see this in imax and based on what ive been reading this movie takes the cake in the ultimate imax experience cant wait,2024-03-03 18:04:37
maybe its common knowledge and done purposefully but was the black  white during the scenes of harkonnens on giedi prime alluding to 1940s  germany sure got those vibes,2024-03-03 19:06:28
how did paul wake up suddenly when chani placed a drop of the blue liquid on his lip was he pretending for the sake of the prophecy desert spring tears so that the people would believe him,2024-03-03 19:21:29
"saw it on friday in dolby cinema loved it as a nonbook reader will be seeing it in imax 70mm soon with the siblings

there were a few small quibbles but the overall experience that this movie was kind of renders those things inconsequential

its crazy how this movie is pg13 when you consider that pretty much all of the mcu movies of the past decade were also pg13 those movies are like cartoons compared to this film from a tone perspective denis villenueve and his editor did an incredible job making a dark gritty scifi movie meet the requirements to stay pg13 while delivering for the audience an rratedesque experience",2024-03-03 22:13:48

is there anyone that can find that scene with three worms attacking for a desktop background ngl that was really hard,2024-03-04 15:07:17
odd request but does anyone happen to have an english transcript of the scenes where they speak fremen im trying to see the movie here in italy but unfortunately the english language showings here dont have english subtitles during those scenes only the standard italian subtitles,2024-03-04 16:48:59

 not clever,2024-03-05 17:50:21
my favorite part of the movie is the technology the weaponry and the airspacecraft everything moved so quietly the emperors polished chrome spacecraft reflecting the surrounding sky and desert was a particular highlight even the harkonnen infantry were graceful when they climbed the rock formation by floating up it,2024-03-05 21:49:24

"two questions

why was feyd able to destroy the sietches i thought their safety came from their secrecy but it was actually just rabbans unwillingness to use artillery what 

if paul can see the future why didnt that final feyd fight look more like putting down an animal than an actual fight did he need to be seen taking a wound for some future fight was feyd so much better than him that this was the only way to win",2024-03-06 12:19:09
amazing saw it last night and wow the soundtrack was intense austin butler was great and the plot overall was full of surprises,2024-03-07 05:46:01
"i think one thing the movie does better than the books is portraying the transition from friends to fanatics  stilgar goes from a mentorfather figure to a frothingatthemouth zealot over the course of the film and its hard to portray that in text alone

love the harkonen rodeo clowns too",2024-03-07 07:51:01
glad i was able to see this in a movie theater because that sandworm ride is an incredible scene to experience in the big screen,2024-03-07 09:20:42
"i really enjoyed the movie and i’m about to watch it again but here is my question 

did anyone understand how harkonnen finally found sietch tabr 

it seemed so difficult before and they find it just by switching their leader ",2024-03-07 11:09:37
"watching dune part 2 a third time the thing that really started standing out to me are the performances of walken and zendaya i initially agreed about most reviews that walken just plays himself to the point it becomes jarring but coming out of my third viewing i felt more comfortable walken playing walken as the emperor than zendaya does a fremen

the emperor is the emperor it started to feel perfectly fine seeing his mannerisms as eccentric whereas zendaya just came across too i dunno clean in both her appearance and mannerisms im not sure if this was intentional on denis part to make chani stand out from all the other fremen for the viewers sake or whether zendaya was just miscast but she just felt like an americanfremen all the other americanisms felt fine since they reflected the landsraad culture

rather i started seeing yacoubs performance as shishakli as something more befitting how i imagined chani she just had that free and more importantly that coarsegruff quality that marked all the other fremen we see that zendaya for whatever reason didnt match",2024-03-07 17:22:37
"everything from the moment paul decided to go south to the end did feel a bit rushed but i think purposefully and not necessarily in a bad way on one hand it shows that once he made that decision nothing is holding him back not even bothering to properly explain to chani whats going on just following the narrow path to get over with it and on the other hand this just feels like the prelude for dune part three at some point ill have to watch all of them back to back for the best viewing experience d

ill also have to rewatch it in english because some powerful quotes that ive read on reddit may thy knife chip and shatter bring them paradise dont have such a nice ring to them in german sometimes literal translations just cant match the original im not blaming the translators for it",2024-03-09 23:19:50
"1010 film a generational movie imo 


questions for the book readers

anyone know if thufir hawat leto’s mentat is confirmed dead he was alive and taken by the harkonens in the book

anyone know why they made the emperor look so old was that just a directorial choice the book says that the emperor looked like he was in his 30s even though he was in his 70s 

i of course don’t expect the film to 100 match the book but these stood out to me as i started reading the book after watching the movie ",2024-03-09 23:36:03
aight this one slapped hard felt more expansive than the first one also geidi prime was amazing felt as if i was teleported there,2024-03-10 06:29:52
just saw this for the second time today this time in imax so worth it i can’t get over the full body high of the battle of arrakeen the sound in imax was absolutely crazy unfortunately i think the projector may have been miscalibrated a bit because the picture didn’t seem as sharp as i was expecting and i think when i saw it in standard format it seemed crisper maybe i’m just crazy though when the love theme for paul and chani kicks in as the fremen prepare to send the nonbelievers to paradise you just can’t help but feel the horror and the power definitely a 910 for me,2024-03-10 07:20:51
honestly a 2for1 deal if you watch this in imax a fantastic movie and an almost 3hour vibrating seat massage,2024-03-11 01:16:00
is this the most violent pg13 of all time im trying to think of one i know there are movies with higher implicit bodycounts disaster films godzilla v kong etc but i cant think of any movies with as much inyourface murderdeath as this the lack of blood and gore kept this from being rated r,2024-03-11 01:58:57
i really liked it,2024-03-11 06:59:22
watching this movie in the theater was really awesome i even closed my eyes at night before going to sleep and it seemed like i was in the middle of the desert,2024-03-12 02:43:32
the thing that impressed me wasnt the visuals or the cgi or the worms it was the the writing it  is so solid and strong also the music just elevates the whole thing to another level,2024-03-13 19:45:16
"saw it last night   
all in all a great continuation however i felt it needed another 45 mins to really flush out a few things like the end battle sequence and pauls sand pilgrimage ratha could have also used a bit more to build his presence dont get me wrong i loved the gladiator bit but felt like his limited screen time wasnt enough same with the emperor",2024-03-14 11:20:40
"cinematic candy that was fast paced and more colorful than part one a great adventure that doesnt waste a moment 

this part just feels like so much more is going on and the stakes getting higher rapidly the parallels to real world power plays and rebellion and being based on the book make this well detailed and defined

the idea of people creating myths to use them and become them as well as imperialistic power grabs is a story as old as time but always interesting directing effects editing cinematography acting writing all top notch",2024-03-16 04:09:16

gidi prime is the coolest place from the movies imo


hopefully the offshoot series will show more of it and other harkonen awesomeness


probably the best movie villans ever they really felt authentic and sold them in",2024-03-17 12:58:33
so one question i had from both movies which i loved btw that maybe i missed since i haven’t read the books…but like what’s the scale of the empire i know it seems like each house has a planet but i was just surprised that one planet could destroy the entire empires army in one battle even if they’re the much better fighters and maybe they haven’t and just won bc now they have the emperor is it like you know ten planets or an entire galaxy  maybe they’ll explain it more later,2024-03-18 03:09:01
paul character is a true defition of a tragic  a shakespearean play he would be a perfect protagonist according to aristotles six characteristics of to define a tragic hero he must have these things  hamartia peripeteia anagnorisis hubris nemesis and catharsis paul goes through this in part 1 and 2 and might even have the some more to offer in the next film,2024-03-20 14:23:44

i’ve not gone to the theater for a while in fact one of the last was wonka  but  this was a true work of art that must be experienced in imax i watched both the 191 and 1431 formats denis villeneuve does not miss like literally every film of his since prisoners is great still gotta watch his earlier canadian films,2024-03-24 20:10:07

the answer to that question is a resounding yes holy  that was a  incredible movie experience absolutely incredible",2024-04-01 15:40:54
this movie looked stunning the score was especially stunning actors and action sequences are good plot and dialogue were next to non existent this movie was a snooze fest and overall did unfortunately  like really how can you be entertained by 80 of what you saw you must be lying theres no way theres any deeper plot that im missing the story and script were dead help me out here anyone,2024-04-05 17:14:39

"can we talk about   
christopher walken as emperor shaddam iv    


will it go down in history as legendarily worse than marlon brando as jorel in superman 1978

every second walken is on the screen isnt your brain saying theres christopher walken theres christopher walken and walken and production design did nothing to make him look in any way different from walken doing guest appearance on talk show and he apparently did no preparation his voice is classic walken™ im not even asking him to do an accent which he cant just some take on the role that is not pure walken hes the 81st padishah emperor of the known universe and yet him requesting more cowbell as a concession for his surrender to paul atreides is not unexpected  there are no wheels let alone wheels within wheels within wheels to quote herbert

i loved the movie and walken but this was just such poor casting andor acting it cannot go unremarked

• the scene where jessica drinks the water of life and shows alia surrounded by that beautiful blue and becoming conscious opening her eyes… holy  

• timothee’s performance when paul reaches the fundamentalists in the south  

• the fremen riding in on the worms flying the atreides flag… chills

• that ending… “lead them to paradise” and the fremen boarding the ships… jessica explaining that the holy war has begun… wow just wow

this movie was a cinematic masterpiece on every front acting direction score cinematography special effects… this is one of those films that will be talked about until the end of time hasn’t left my mind since i walked out of the theater",2024-03-01 15:37:45

zendaya is incredible the ending of just a closeup of her emotion reminds me of the second hunger games movie where it just ends on jennifer lawrence closeup when she wakes up and i think they tell her her home was bombed or whatever i havent watched those movies in ages but the acting stuck with me same as chanis heartbreak will,2024-03-03 04:32:23
i read the book i watched the first movie… 5 times i am absolutely in awe of this film series probably more so than any film i’ve ever seen before it’s the story cinematography score character development i am in awe i’m honestly upset when i talk about the film and i ask people how they like it and they say oh it’s okay i liked it im just like how do you not love this movie,2024-03-03 10:02:40

fun fact the same infrared camera used for geidi prime was used in zone of interest",2024-03-01 03:44:57
"great  movie  feels appropriately epic  a lot of the on location shooting made this world feel a lot more real as opposed to avatar style of mostly everything on a green screen 

watching chalamet’s growth from meek quiet boy to “he who do you do not  with” leader was fun to watch 

some characters feels a little waste  brolin’s gurney comes to mind  streamlining the side stories and focusing on the main conflict though really helps the pacing of the story 

rebecca ferguson shines brightest i feel in the whole movie  her role really stands out and was pretty masterfully done

this was incredible in imax seeing everyone’s gorgeous faces closeup approx 30 foot high and then the any long shots looked incredible particularly when    paul reached the cliff edge to look down below at the fremens and the sound was amazing could hear the flutter of each wing on the dragonfly spaceships a must watch in imax really immersive experience as much as i loved oppenheimer in imax this film because of its grand scale truly utilises yeh format better,2024-03-02 01:24:09

i dont care who tells me to calm down these films have rocketed themselves right into the greatest films of all time conversation,2024-03-16 13:57:15
"im lucky enough to have seen this twice already once at the imax fan event last weekend and once today its pretty rare for me to see the same movie in theaters twice in a week and im not an especially big dune guy but i am just stunned at how much i loved it even more the second time part one is an achievement in scale and filmmaking but the character arcs and pacing were just not there it was a lot of setup of which i am grateful for but part two just  hums beautiful and epic in scope the entire time satisfying arcs a huge and more involved cast even some natural humor i think it was well assumed denis would come back with a homerun this time around but this thing shatters the bat 

denis has such an impressive visual language obviously he just made the headline rounds saying how much he hates dialogue and while thats obviously hyperbolic the things he can do with frame are incredible his sense of scale is seemingly unmatched in filmmaking right now theres so many incredible shots of endless desert plains slow moving ships or armies or even just a fetus or walkens face that shot where paul is running towards the middle of a sand dune caving in as hes about to jump on the sand worm is wildly impressive just think for a moment how hard it must be to shoot in an endless desert and keep it interesting for the eyes the visual storytelling is doing a lot to keep our eyes busy and its part of what keeps this from feeling three hours 

paul and chani feel so right in this giving it an amazing emotional core zendaya is an actress i like a lot but she stunned me here especially with that final shot shes selling how tough chani would have to be to live out there but shes not prickly shes vulnerable with paul its not something he has to force her to be you can see shes kind but pragmatic and hardened both times ive seen this movie now i get really emotional when they kiss just after having an honest conversation and the great line i would very much like to be equal with you and the incredible score that builds up that whole time its a moment that totally invests you in the rest of this insane movie plot 

timothee also really surprised me with how commanding he was of the screen in the final act im no dunehead outside of seeing the movie renditions but when he finally says dune it is somehow the most awesomely legit way anyone has ever dropped a movie title in the movie that scene starts a momentum that takes us all the way through the following battle and to the credits really impressive it cant be overstated how well cast these are how everyone gets their shine javier bardem in particular is simultaneously having so much fun playing this incredibly sincere religious fanatic delivering he is too humble to admit hes the one another reason he must be it is foreseen in a made up language like he did is honestly a masterclass line reading 

the moral complexity on display here has to be somewhat unmatched in this budget of filmmaking right really the only thing in this movie that could be widely agreed upon is the harkonnens are not very nice other than that its this massive jumbo of politics religion honor freedom destiny and scheming the second time i saw this i really zeroed in on how everyone was fighting the same war but for different reasons chani wants the fremen free and lead by their own people paul wants to avenge his father jessica believes in the destiny and wants to protect her son gurney wants to fight for the honor of house atreides javier fights for his religion and it leads them all to the same battle its them aligning until they dont paul tries to avoid causing any major harm while purposefully posing as a messiah but the circumstance forces him to follow his visions he has to make a choice at some point to hit the gas or not and thats when chani and him are forced apart worth noting the final shot in this movie is not all of the soldiers boarding their warships it ends with chani leaving absolutely hearbreaking 

the first real action scene where they attack the harvester was so so satisfying that shot of zendaya running between the legs as the helicopter crashes in the background was such an amazing feeling and that whole scene starting with the desert mouse them popping out of the sand when she shoots that guy with a rocket the fremen fighting style is awesome i love when they just drop to the ground and leg grab the shins and that jumping horizontal spin timmy does in the final fight was nuts the final battle was also incredible i honestly wanted more of it the main three warriors all have their leading the armada moment and chani goes insane on some fools while the brolin v bautista fight is kept purposely succinct but i just wanted a bit more of the battlefield fight and pauls ascension to the emperors chamber would have happily sat in that theater for 10 more minutes 

its a 910 for me and if you told me its a 10 i wouldnt disagree i dont mean to be dismissive of part 1 which is an achievement on its own but i dont really see a reason to watch it again unless im marathonning part 2 was everything i wanted and more a fully satisfying experience beginning to end a great love story action and scale on new levels a full and vibrant universe with oily fireworks and whole cultures some natural humor and pathos i just loved it and like everyone i really hope denis gets to finish this the way he wants to but if he doesnt its still a massive achievement and honestly just lucky in this box office landscape that we got this movie

rreviewsbyboner",2024-03-01 03:01:35
did anyone else think zendayas acting fell kind of flat i can’t believe all the praise i’m seeing for it i thought she was by far the weakest of the bunch her chemistry with timothée was lacking a problem that falls on both of them and the last half of the movie she just huffed and puffed like an angry kid i was definitively underwhelmed but i think i may be alone on that lol,2024-03-02 07:06:16

" this movie was everything i had hoped it would be and more i was blown away by the scale of it all there is something weirdly tangible about the worlds villeneuve shows us that feel miles away from the video game landscapes of recent comic book movies

910",2024-03-01 04:05:44
"some things i really liked

this is one of the most beautiful movies i’ve seen in recent memory some of the best vfx i’ve ever seen

i chuckled when baron harkonnen saw feydruatha attack the fremen stronghold with airships and said “that’s brilliant” yes because only a strategic genius could figure out that bombing the  out of a settlement owned by an enemy that has almost no antiair is a good idea

i like how utterly useless dave bautista’s character was he was too much of an angry meathead to be an effective leader and he couldn’t even fight his sole purpose was to get  on

the harkonnen took the “bad guys will  their underlings without a second thought”’trope to another level between the baron feydruatha and rabba at least half a dozen underlings were killed for no reason other than evil

it’a funny how the whole story of dune is about religious fanaticism holy war and psychedelic drug use which are all controversial subjects but people are cool with dune because it’s scifi and weird",2024-03-04 01:03:05
that final fight scene was absolutely great  it felt real in a way most movies dont do anymore and each guy seemed vulnerable  i hope other directors pay attention especially anyone doing a marvel movie,2024-03-04 03:55:06
i did not think it was particularly great choppy and rushes through the plot beats,2024-03-01 03:11:26
"probably get downvoted but the acting of the two main actors timothee and zendaya felt incredibly stale to me and honestly took me out of the movie a lot neither were convincing in their roles and it felt like the actual physical acting in scenes where they interact was just super bland 

it genuinely felt like the absolutely most intimate scene between them was when she was teaching him to sand walk 

the last scene where paul tells chani  always love her just felt so stale you couldnt see anything in his face and nothing in hers either 

feydrautha stole the show for me and mohiam was electric in every scene she was in

other than that movie was amazing as  must see in imax sound was absolutely immaculate and the set design was ridiculously good as well as costume design",2024-03-01 03:42:11
"am i the only one who overall really enjoyed the movie and thought it was great but was constantly caught off guard with the jarring transitions between scenes


one example is when paul is traversing the sand and chani meets up with him to show him the way the next scene is them along with many others ambushing a rig until the camera focused in on paul i was thinking this was taking place elsewhere while he was still out there on the trial


thats just one example but it felt like several other parts of the film had this rushed feeling compared to the first which seemed to allow scenes and moments to breathe


again overall it was incredible and i already recommended it to friends but i dont think it was as good as part 1",2024-03-01 05:44:29
"i will be completely honest i like this less than the last movie

everything about the presentation was fantastic geidi prime looks alien as  arrakis always looked intimidating and hellish for anyone not fremen the effects were excellent the sound and music continues to impress as always and hans zimmer brings it back in spades the acting is as good as ever and so much is conveyed with the camerawork and just the eyes and the way people look at each other and say so much while not talking at all i love how tonally so much is conveyed so smoothly like paul very obviously leading the fremen to their doom with chani desperately trying to bring her people to their senses

the problems are almost all pacing and a couple of the characters namely feydrautha and the emperor the emperor felt really toothless and barely fleshed out very brief explanations for why he even instigated this whole thing and it feels brushed off when they reveal that it was the bene gesserit which was already known from the last movie walken barely has any time to make this emperor an actually formidable foe and he turns into a meek pliant  which was very disappointing austin butler as faydrautha was flawless and conveyed the psychotic nature of a harkonnen heir perfectly the problem is theres almost zero tension with his character and he barely even feels like a threat the arena scene felt like it was meant to convey him as a shrewd but accomplished warrior but they should have done that with someone other than the grunts that were thrown at him i know hes another bene gesserit puppet but once again toothless and pliant so when he duels paul it barely feels like a challenge even if the duel scene was  fantastic

the pacing was honestly terrible because this is very obviously the second part to a trilogy the whole trilogy could be theoretically plotted out as an inverse bell curve of pacing with the last movie ending as the bell curve was halfway through the dip and this one ends halfway through the next climb the problem is unlike something like lord of the rings where we had a bunch of subplots and many characters who were doing their own thing with complete arcs in the two towers were primarily following paul through this whole movie and the first 23rds felt a bit too stretched out with the final third desperately playing catchup this meant so much of it felt so disjointed by the end things like the emperor coming to arrakis are kinda rushed and feel very sudden pauls arc after he becomes lisan algaib happens at lightning speed he just takes over the entire fremen army takes over the emperors base captures and subdues him duels feyd and then were left at another cliffhanger for when he executes his war in the next part which is probably another 34 years away all within maybe the last 3040 minutes

all in all this is absolutely not a bad movie and id score it something like 810 but the first movie was such a fantastic setup and to be delivered yet more setup was a huge let down i wish i liked this one more but i guess i might appreciate it more on a rewatch before the third movie which seems all but guaranteed

edit watched in imax and holy  it was an experience people should try getting imax tickets if possible",2024-03-01 10:40:53
"my respect for chalemet is through the roof right now he absolutely crushed this movie

that scene where hes preaching to the crowd and looking straight in the camera

or the scene where he walks in to the emperor with his mask on and acts only with his eyes

just an incredible performance",2024-03-02 04:01:43
"just got home from the cinema man i’m speechless the cinematic experience of a lifetime for me it’s denis and nolan at the top and then everyone else the cinematography in this one somehow surpassed the first one which was already immaculate i’ll have a letterboxd review later but for now all i can say is paul’s gradual descent into what we see at the end was so fun

the juxtaposition between feyd rautha and paul throughout was great culminating in that amazing fight at the end really thought paul might’ve been a goner there at the end

couldn’t help but burst out laughing when paul basically told the emperor “i’ll take your throne and your daughter” straight up  bro right to his face probably had never been talked to anywhere close to that rudely

the mom just straight up staring down the other bene gesserit and telling her she should’ve picked the winning side was great too we just gonna ignore the fact that she thought paul might lose that fight too  

felt awful for chiani in the last hour though seeing paul break his promises to her and do a complete 180 on all the equality stuff he was preaching at first had to be so heartbreaking for her felt every bit of her pain during that final shot as paul and the others take off preparing to fight the other houses

i still haven’t read the books so there was so much cool lore dropped in this that came as a surprise to me hopefully by the time messiah drops i’ll have read the series and can truly appreciate everything here looking forward to seeing paul sister too

stilgar hyping up literally everything paul did as a sign of him being the messiah was brilliant dude behind me in the cinema kept bursting out laughing the whole time ",2024-03-02 06:01:46
is it just me or are there large swathes of this movie missing i feel there were character development scenes for austin butlers character or at least scenes of him simply being a villain completely missing same thing with the emperor i feel as if i may have blacked out for parts of the movie perhaps like seriously they were just kinda in and out without doing much on screen or having much weight in the story ,2024-03-03 05:30:13
they created a universe that looks and feels truly alien and advanced beyond anything we could even imagine  then you have christopher walken being christopher walken right in the middle of it,2024-03-06 01:42:25
"what am i missing i understand the visual marvel that the film is but the narrative the pacing some of the acting and even the editing were all poorly executed at times 

nolan talking to denis before the release of the film and calling the film his empire strikes back plus the claims of it being one of the best sequels and scifi films ever made perhaps made me expect too much maybe this is the problem with social media recency bias and nolan stans transferring to denis in the meantime until nolan’s next film don’t get me wrong i love nolan’s work and i am a fan of many of denis’ films but this just doesn’t add up 

it’s shocking to see the comparisons to lotr and the dark knight does recency bias have that much of a stranglehold on perception or is it simply that the effects outweigh the pacing and storytelling issues for modern audiences 

we spend so much of the story on things we don’t need repeated over and over zendaya’s acting was such a weak spot i thought butler was surprisingly very good in this role walken felt a bit comical and certainly broke the verisimilitude bardem was good and executed those comedic moments well but beyond that there is a strange disconnect between characters and their ability to connect with the audience portraying timothée in a menacing manner is a tough feat to pull off and it really wasn’t done effectively which just shows it’s a casting issue 

it was difficult to find anything compelling or engaging until 23 of the way through the film the ending is rushed to the point where i don’t see how there is any sort of payoff the lack of emotional heft and connection really left me wondering what i missed from this film",2024-03-02 09:28:58
"1010 for me not a book reader 

the visuals the emotional weight of the things happening to paul the religious stuff is huge you can see how powerful and how dangerous religious fever can be paul understands this and yet is forced into a situation he has trouble confronting it was a beautiful story and the soundtrack and art direction and cinematography were all amazing",2024-03-03 13:08:42
this was something special part 3 when,2024-03-01 03:14:37

they did it they outdid the first one  incredible,2024-03-01 04:00:38
"my only complaint is that i felt like the third act was bit too rushed i know its already pretty long at two and a half hours but maybe another 1015 minutes to give the third act some more breathing room more of paul embracing the holy war more of that big battle with the worms more cowbell emperor and the landsraad more of the gurneyraban showdown

but overall this movie rules cant wait for part 3",2024-03-01 04:09:48
"austin butler was so good in this that i have some sort of weird  up crush on feyd rautha

edit also havent seen it mentioned but the sound of that knife sliding through pauls hand at the end is the absolute worst noise i have ever heard in my life",2024-03-01 05:04:34
"florence is already very attractive always but she was especially beautiful in this movie 

helps that it’s a gorgeous film just elevates everything",2024-03-01 07:58:09
"i loved that the final battle wasnt a grand battle sequence of over an hour

concise to the point and got things going in a quick fashion id have loved to see the harkonnens die a more brutal death but i guess knives to the throat are as good a way to go as any

a solid 910 for me denis nailed it with the visuals and storytelling",2024-03-01 09:12:58
the scene where paul and chani embrace and kiss for the first time on top of the sand dune was great the score behind the scene was incredible too from hans i’ve had the song stuck in my head since the film ,2024-03-01 13:50:19
im not sure why they chose to go with a few dead people on the ground and famine evidently still on arrakis as pauls prescience of the future tragedy why no green banner and billions dead the future visions could have been a tad more impactfulfrightening and at scale especially when you have the geidi prime scenes to contrast with,2024-03-01 18:09:06
you know for all the longer movies they are producing these days in hollywood this one deserved the most to be over 3 hrs long that sequence before the climax with paul and his ascends into being the supreme leader and his relationship with chani needed a bit more fleshed out otherwise a perfect 1010 movie imo,2024-03-02 00:19:37
"
i’m adjusting to the very interesting change with chani and the implications it has for messiah it’s entirely possible denis is closing the whole saga with the next movie and not even bothering with setting up children of dune unless the ending with her bailing is a fake out 

though i’m bummed out we lost “history will call us wives” it’s a great line from jessica 

that being said good  lord incredible movie absolutely a visual feast incredible sound captivating as  even funny with bardem’s stilgar being the ultimate zealothypeman seriously find a guy who hypes you up like stilgar paul breaths “lisan al gaib”",2024-03-02 04:25:00
"harkonnen minions have got to learn to stand a little further out of reach 

loved it visually spectacular and wonderfully performed i dont think there was a single actor who didnt rock their role or a single scene that wasnt a feast for the senses 

i do feel like the plot clipped along a little too quickly i could go for an extended cut i also wonder how viewers coming to it without any book knowledge are gonna feel about paul forcing the princess irulan to marry him seeming to set chani aside especially as the film plays up her hurt and alienation",2024-03-02 10:18:10
"this film hit me in so many of my favorite film places its of the highest quality 


huge oppressive score


scale mecha i loved the spice harvester sections


beautiful intricate costumes the princesss headpiece for example down to the harkonen trooper suits and pauls fremen garb and cloak


well shot fights and incredible cinematography 


dialed up on the humor a slight bit from part 1 really added to the film too


everything was just so magnificent  


seeing brolin and bardem together on screen is ",2024-03-02 12:51:55
"just  incredible wow like just wow i saw it last night on imax and i would 100 recommend anyone planning to see it to do the same

i have read the book so for this movie in particular i was the most curious about how villeneuve was going to present 1 the final battle with the fremen riding sandworms to war 2 the duel between paul and feydrautha and i think he knocked both out of the park

i think if anyone was bored by the first film they would hopefully like this one better but stylistically it is pretty similar and i dont know that that would win over a lot of new fans this movie has a lot of action but i would still describe it as more of a slow burn and a movie you have to appreciate more for its cinematic qualities than for relentless action and plotting a marvel movie it is not and thank  for that lol

i thought nearly everyone in this movie was fantastic particularly javier bardem he brought this levity to the role that the movie occasionally needed i think the only role i didnt love was christopher walken as the emperor mostly because i have a hard time taking christopher walken seriously in anything and seeing him play perhaps the most serious role in the movie didnt work super well imo everyone else really ruled though props to austin butler for managing to convince me hes a psychopath and not just the most ridiculously handsome man on the planet too bad he had to play a harkonnen since he and timothee chalamet could have had an epic hair competition of some kind",2024-03-02 14:01:04
"i really respect the fact that they leaned fully into the religious aspect of the book jessica is much more of a cynical and terrifying manipulator theres repeated references to fundamentalists and paradise and they somehow managed to make stilgars faith comic relief and horrifying at the same time

i can understand why they avoided using the word jihad the original book goes as far as one of the distant fremen ancestors referencing the hajj",2024-03-02 16:04:55

a minor thing but this movie showed death by dehydration in a way more impactful and horrifying than i knew was possible,2024-03-02 21:52:28
in imax the movie roars its an impressive piece of filmmamking as an adaptation i am missing some pieces that are very relevant in the next books and that change at the end is going to get tricky for the next movie all in all its an excellent movie and the reason movie theaters remain the only niptick is that after hearing denis villenueves thoughts on dialogue it becomes very apparent he really doesnt work too much on that excellent movie though and the art and costume departments were on spice it seems absolutely breathtaking,2024-03-02 22:22:58

 they learned from the internet there’s no end credit scene ",2024-03-03 02:34:56

i dont even know how you follow this up",2024-03-03 06:50:08
mind  blown  it requires seeing the first film more than aliens or terminator 2 do but i think it eclipses them as a sequel  i think from a visual storytelling perspective it beats empire strikes back but not from a story arc perspective esb is still my favorite standalone sequel ever but im biased dune 2 is soooooooo close but messiah will give paul alia jessica and chani the true arcs and will sweep the oscars in 20267 guaranteed  return of the king style it is so gratifying to see such potent and sacred genre literature staples done proper justice,2024-03-03 08:42:52

this was the loudest movie i’ve ever seen in imax scenes with the spice harvesters landing and the worms riding…i could feel my bones shaking coupled with the relentless haunting soundtrack was a visceral experience,2024-03-03 14:09:13
7 hours later still not over it i know that whatever i do i need to see that scene of paul walking up the cliff and hyping up the fremen talk about a near death experience i almost fell out of the chair,2024-03-04 03:47:48
it was pretty good but i liked the first one better maybe ill like this one more when i watch it again cause i didnt like the first one that much when it first came out but watched it last week to prepare for this one and really liked it,2024-03-05 23:34:37
i saw this for the third time last night the second time in imax worth it,2024-03-06 14:10:17
so i shed a tear towards the end not because of what was happening but because i knew i was watching something so monumental for the big screen not sure that’s ever happened before,2024-03-06 19:52:07
 i didn’t realize how much of a tragedy this movie would be a lot of similarities to the later seasons of attack on titan it feels like when both jessica and paul drink the blue goo they stop being themselves  seeing the past and future for paul affects them to not be themselves anymore it might be good intentions on keeping themselves alive but when does the cost become too high,2024-03-07 08:25:39
"who else thought dave bautista was poorly used in this movie they gave jarvier bardem a lot of screen time and rightly so as he was amazing in the movie but then they give bautista barely anything to do

they dont even give him a  good fight scene in the end he dies in two seconds",2024-03-08 08:04:18
"i saw it in imax a few days ago and wow what a film i wasn’t totally won over by part one if i’m honest but i guess they had to get a lot of the setup out of the way first

but it was worth it to make part two what it is the worldbuilding the plot the visuals the sound design and score the cast  all absolutely excellent

it felt like every other scene had something incredible going on even though it was so long it rarely dragged because they packed so much in the pacing and exposition were perfectly balanced which isn’t easy considering the source material

the standout performance for me was austin butler i’ve only really seen him in masters of the air where he’s a little onenote but he really killed it in this movie

if i had a criticism it’s that i didn’t find the romance between paul and chani very compelling 

i didn’t feel that timothée chalamet and zendaya had much onscreen chemistry and the scenes of just them together were the only ones where the movie ever so slightly dragged but i’m reaching a bit here because it’s absolutely not meant to be a love story

it’s a film that made me feel good about films the marvelisation of cinema has made me very cynical about it as a medium lately but this shows that when everything is done right cinema has still got it",2024-03-15 08:24:51
great movie lots of memorable moments almost everyone was in top form timothy c is here to stay he really is the lisanalgaib of this generation of actors zendaya was aggressively mid especially her dialogue delivery was atrocious may the  illuminati reign forever,2024-03-22 20:33:02
"just got back  very similar to the first in that its gorgeous but horrendous at telling the story  its like they  every fun and interesting parts from the story out  multiple people walked out and lots of booing during the final exchange with the emperor and to top it all timothy has zero leadership energy

edit lol at the responses below of people butt hurt at my experience",2024-03-01 04:07:05

movie absolutely rips saw it on sunday in imax and seeing it in dolby tomorrow i mean this as both a compliment and a detriment the movie somehow feels short with a 2hr 46min runtime  at time the movie breezes by and the viewer is unaware how much time has passed because of the engrossing visuals acting sound and action i wanted to see more and at times it felt rushed the last half hour picks up and doesn’t let up which only made me even more excited to see what is next for paul yet felt like another cliffhanger i started reading dune and messiah because i don’t think i can wait a few more years to find out,2024-03-01 03:37:10

there just has to be a third part now right but also apparently this is how the book first second ends with the incoming holy war,2024-03-01 07:44:35
"it took two days for me to fully process the film and i can say that i loved it it pays off the patience of you watching the first one which i loved too and builds on characters and themes beautifully i was kind of worried this would be some sort of revenge story but denis focusing on the prophecy angle was perfect i wouldve loved more scenes of tension between paul and lady jessica but i think chanis expanded role here works well too

just a few nitpicks from my side especially related to the book
 i dont remember the atomic arsenal being a thing in the books i didnt mind it until it was revealed that the leto had it stored without the fremens knowing about it and right under their noses this kinda takes away the fact that the fremens werent well versed with the land and whats going on around them at all times when in fact they didnt let anything slip under the radar and used the knowledge of arrakis to their advantage
 underutilizing skarsgard and saardukar i loved this version of the baron as opposed to the depraved and cartoonishlyevil villain one you find in the books wouldve loved to see more of him and also how powerful the saardukar actually were they looked cool af  though
 and finally this is a personal one that comes from both the movies removing thufir hawat from the plot hes my favourite character from the book and the side plot that he goes on is immensely interesting to me i love the theory that the reason why the emperor starts to distrust the barons rule is that he starts fearing the barons forces are getting stronger than the saardukar  this is basically hawats plan getting the emperors crosshairs pointed at the baron i knew this wouldve been tough to add in an already complex plotbut yeah i still stand by this nitpick thufir hawat is the goat

like i said these are nitpicks and nothing against the film i loved the movie and this one pretty much solidifies denis status as one of the alltime greats if it wasnt already the case before

"dune part 2 is a phenomenal film please see this movie every chance you get while its in theaters and if you can see the imax version i dont know how anyone could view this film otherwise 

with that being said im a tad bit conflicted about this film i read the book the book is awesome its the cough foundation cough of modern science fiction this film isnt the second half of the book i went into this film expecting to see baby leto a fremen get to together and one enlightened toddler none of those things appeared and now im wondering whether or not villenueve wrote this entire film on the premise of being unable to find a child actor skilled enough to play that aforementioned toddler 

let me be a bit clearer villenueves approach to the second half of dune is very similar to how stanley kubrick adapted the shining he kept many of the books themes but elaborated on them in a fashion the general movie going audience would understand the film criticizes religious fanaticism more overtly than the books it wasnt a problem but i wanted the film to explore other themes at a similar level 

the biggest change from the books besides the time frame is alia atreides anya taylorjoy she is way more powerful in this film as a fetus than she has been portrayed in the books its also my belief that she possesses both lady jessica and paul in this adaptation and there are scenes and dialogue that strongly allude to this the reverend mother refers to paul as an abomination which he shouldnt be because hes one tablespoon of salt away from the genetic concoction the bene gesserit was cooking for a millennia that phrase in the books is used to describe alia because shes preborn 

if that is the direction villenueve is taking the series then im locked in i want to see conflict between alia and chani who was likely pregnant at the end of the film in the sequel with princess irulan documenting their fights in spiteful delight 

all in all the film did not adapt the book to my liking however it told a magnificent story that covered the books themes",2024-03-01 08:45:25

the combination of paul  the fremen army using the warheads  the sandworms to  the sardaukar army has to be the most gangsta way ive seen a hero flip the script  take revenge on his enemies they were really taking no prisoners when gurney killed glossu real quick   some of the sardaukar forces in the throne room got quietly murked in the dust when paul stormed in

one thing i especially love about this film is that building up to the scene where paul takes absolute command over the fremen after drinking the water of life hes obviously still out of his element when interacting with them  in their early ambushes against the harkonnen but then he flips a switch in his swagger after his major trial with the giant sandworm",2024-03-01 20:08:19
i definitely feel like wb is holding back an extended edition of this a la lord of the rings a lot felt rushed but not a bad rushed like how one can see how two lines connect but we don’t see the line we didn’t see stilgar get injured but it makes sense that he got injured in feyds attack on the sietch we don’t see chani get notified that paul took the water of life but it makes sense that she did and that she showed up we don’t see rabban get information on the mua’dib but it makes sense he’d know about him of some time has passed,2024-03-01 21:47:06

"when stilgar went full monty python i about lost it i dont know if they were intentionally evoking the life of brian or just a happy coincidence but i was chuckling with bardems delivery 

pacing was a little too rushed which i get it they want to keep this massive story under 3 hours so theres a ton being left on the cutting room floor as well as standard bookmovie compression of timecharactersetc 

beast rabbans fight with gurney it was blinkandyoumissit like let the dude get more than literally 1 swing in before getting shanked not asking for some duel of the fates  but cmon it needed more than that

i loved how they shot the scenes under the black sun that was a genius move to film it with infrared and the transitions of characters from indoors to outdoors was seamless how it went from proper color to monochromatic 

the one aspect i wished there was more of was the whole of the dune universe the movie had no mentats no spacing guild no navigators etc again i get it its part of dvs need to compress the book into one cohesive story that can translate to the silver screen still just a little bummed

theres a lot more i could go on about but most all has probably been said in this thread already overall i really enjoyed the movie saw it at the early screening in imax and the scene with the nukes blasting the rocks then the sandworms enveloping the emperors men was breathtaking that alone was worth the price of admission",2024-03-03 02:30:10

on another note loved the religious symbolism here  a few of chani’s lines “you want control tell people there’s a messiah  they’ll wait for centuries” and “this prophecy is how they enslave us” cut very deep",2024-03-03 21:03:30
"pretty great all around only criticisms i have are those that come from the novel itself 

oh and no flaming giraffe but you cant win em all",2024-03-03 23:04:51
"gotta say pretty spicy overall 

on a technical level no doubt a monumental achievement from a true visionary villeneuve flexing hard here bringing together a story once thought untellable on the screen to life with such precision and imagination both a continuation of the first story and a set up for the third it feels grand epic but has a dark sinisterness to it to me this and the first part are mandatory viewings together and i actually think one cant stand alone without the other unlike star wars or the lord of the rings you just gotta be in awe of the sheer scale of it and the vision that villeneuve brought to life—i saw this in 70mm imax so that definitely helps 

ive read the book only once and its been a couple years but there are some significant changes and im mostly okay with them despite it being a movie about the future the changes made were to bring the whole thing into the modern era they also to bring some more conflict to make the back half of the story more digestable for film i think zendaya and florence pughs characters are more fleshed out feel like real people and arent just faceless woman in awe of pauls greatness there are layers to them i think diehard fans of the book will hate some of the choices but for me it didnt bother me toooo much though it was a little jarring 

theres a murderers row of a cast here just like the first one but it feels more apparent in this part i want to give a couple shoutouts to some people who i think absolutely stole the show rebecca ferguson is incredible and easily one of the best actresses working today i could just look at her onscreen for days she commands the camera and is just the best another actor who deserves a shout out is austin butler who plays an incredible villain i wasnt sure if this kid was worth the hype but this movie cements it he can do everything menacing terrifying evil he  rocked it on the other side with this and and wonka— chalamet is one of the biggest box office draws we have and im not sure he deserves it hes fine here but anytime he has to yell or act hard i didnt quite buy it hs one of the least interesting things about the movie for me 

theres some choices i found a little perplexing and i think the beginning takes awhile to get into things but its hard to really get bogged down in my problems with it when the movie takes such a huge swing and hits for the most part it succeeds in telling the themes from the book of how power can corrupt all and really how we are all pawns to those who lead us there are no deitys only the blood hungry who want to rule us all 

some scenes in this will stick with me for a long time what a beautiful looking film i cant wait rewatch that coliseum sequence again",2024-03-03 23:51:55

"i thought it was nearly  flawless and everything i wanted and more from a high budget scifi epic

  
but if i am to nitpick from a book readers perspective almost all of my small criticisms from the movie are decisions that i can understand from a directorial point of view

i cant believe im saying this for a movie that runs 2hrs 46mins but i thought the pacing was just a little bit too fast especially during the latter half of the movie every single scene felt so dense with plotrelevant information in the bigger scale of pauls arc after the first book that even the scenes without any action felt riveting again this isnt a fullblown criticism of sorts but when im on the edge of my seat foaming at the mouth for every single scene its borderline exhausting and i was scared to even reach for my popcorn for fear of missing key details



i think i can speak for most of us book fans when i say that i would not at all mind another hour of runtime and as i understand it there was ample footage that was cut out of the movie so i guess it was originally that length but with regards to box office numbers and what the average normies attention span for a movie is i kind of get why it had to be trimmed down to a short 2hr46min runtime i mean look at killers of the flower moon the movie flopped financially even though most critics and movie buffs liked it i have reason to believe part of that was due to its runtime were not getting dune messiah without part 2 becoming an overwhelming box office hit because like it or not this is the only metric that matters to the big studios so imo denis had more than enough justification to cut out what he did even though we all wanted more

i also wished it had an r rating to become weirder to include the spicy pun intended scenes in the book but im okay without it for the same reasons i listed above",2024-03-04 17:26:29

its a pretty complex plot with many characters and the way villeneuve weaved it all together while maintaining pacing was impressive javier bardem was hilarious i love the bene gesserit and the general spaceage feudalism i didnt realize before but its because of the butlerian jihad that they refuse to use computers resembling humans so its all biological

also the comparisons to oilopiates was pretty clear with the mujahideen angle and it was a little weird rooting for fremen coming from the perspective of the american harkonnens",2024-03-09 22:39:23

"i havent read the books so plsss dont answer with spoilers 

but im finding it hard to work out why the bene gesserit are so surprised by what has unfurled with paul turning fanatical and jessica kinda becoming the embodiment of fear

ive gathered that theyre the ones who created the prophecy bene gesserit and instilled it into the minds of the fremen over many many years and i know that they werent certain whether paul would be the lisan al gaib

but the prophecy has become true as they planned and originally orchestrated obviously paul has walked into the fire which they warned against but its not like they didnt see it coming

did things happen that werent supposed to go to plan like jessica becoming the reverand mother of the fremen was the old lady who gives jessica the water of life also a bene gesserit or is she moreso a true fremen reverand mother

im thinking mainly what didnt go to plan is that jessica was pregnant when she drank the water of life and also paul is a male when he was supposed to ideally be a female

as i write this i think its less so that the bene gesserit are surprised but moreso they know things have gotten out of hand and now theyre trying to bring back order but they didnt realise how powerful paul and jessica would be",2024-03-17 02:08:47

2 can i assume the water of life connects all minds of people who drinks it even future drinkers otherwise how could paul sees his sister in future form and also he says that he saw a plan to future i am guessing this is kinda like attack on titan iykyk",2024-03-17 10:36:25

"okay so i liked this a lot but i havent read the book so there was one thing i didnt get

they imply the other houses would be really  if they found out the emperor was the one who set up the harkonnens with arrakis presumably because its showing favoritism but at the same time the other houses dont accept pauls ascendancy so why doesnt paul just spill the dirt on the emperor and get everyone  at the emperor instead does he just think the other houses wouldnt believe him or is it somehow worth it to keep the emperor around even if the other houses declare war on paul",2024-03-18 03:16:43

the first half especially is so beautifully edited the whole development of paul and chani up against their howevermanyweekslong campaign against the spice harvesters was perfectly paced and the performances so good denis economy of storytelling with the visuals he chooses and arranges is on another level

its almost impossible to single out a best performance because everyone is so good every character is perfectly utilized in this story no one feels like they get shorted for time or purpose in the story timmy carried the whole movie and his gradual turn to darkness was wellrealized now that zendaya has a real opportunity to play chani she crushed it and the writing was so good with the whole internal politicking of the fremen i loved that whole aspect and how it played into her relationship with paul and just the whole thematic tapestry javier bardem also got more to do hes great often hilarious but perfectly sells that blind religious zealotry rebecca ferguson as jessica after the water of life  austin butlers feydrautha was awesome lets all agree to just let him keep doing whatever he wants with his voice hes clearly good at it

"wow what an incredible film definitely one of the best blockbusters of all time to me this is on par with the ot and the lotr trilogy we are witnessing cinematic excellence 

i do have a couple complaints i want to discuss first although i loved feydrautha i wish they differentiated him a bit more from rabban and didn’t have him also participate in the “so ruthless he kills his own henchman” trope also his accent was kind of distracting and sometimes i couldn’t help but laugh when he spoke which detracted from his intimidation a little 

additionally i really wished the ending stressed a bit more that paul’s actions have doomed the lives of trillions and that although it was not his desired outcome he still sees it as the optimal path it seemed like the final part of his journey was missing i expect the next film will grapple with the repercussions of his actions a lot more but i wish this one at least touched on it a bit more i would have taken inspiration from the incredible ending to oppenheimer where oppy and the audience are struck with dread regarding what’s to come and we see flash forwards of the upcoming chaos

however besides criticisms like these i loved the film it pretty much nails everything i expect from filmmaking writing acting dialogue character journeys action spectacle it does it all excellently this film almost perfectly portrays paul’s descent into darkness and i thought it did a great job conveying the important themes of the novel the dangers of following a chosen one how easily the masses can be swayed the nature of fundamentalism etc i really liked most of the changes to the book and thought they improved the story in the film medium 

overall absolutely incredible film",2024-03-03 05:44:40

timothee was the right choice for this role no  whatever flickers of greatness he showed in the king are fully fledged raging wildfires here i was absolutely blown away esp in the second half  him and zendaya are speaking the  out of that fake language

its good but not great a stunning film to look at but a couple of big moments didnt do much for me like the one where paul climbs up the hill and gets his followers riled up or the worms stomping the battle these are great shots entrances even but they do not have a proper lead up nor they lead to an equally great finish denis greatest strengths are in the much calmer moments and thats where some supporting characters shined like zendayas chani and bardems stilgar they give the films much needed emotional quotient which the first film was short of the last 30 min was solid where everything worked up well although a bit quickly,2024-03-01 13:16:17

"whew saw this last night and have almost nothing but good things to say about it

denis villenueve knocked it out of the park again as a longtime fan of the series this was an amazing tribute to the source material

highlights

the set designs and costumes were incredible if i had to describe the aesthetic it would be a mix of minimalist and alien these are human beings but as imagined 8000 years in our future where weve both progressed and devolved from where we currently are that tension was captured very well 

we saw the emperor dukes etc presumably some of the most wealthy people alive but we never saw what any of us would interpret as trappings of wealth no jewels precious metal etc once again everything was minimalist spice was the true wealth in the story which further highlights the struggle for control of dune in this movie

i like that chanis character had more autonomy and selfdetermination in this adaptation definitely suited an actor as strong on the screen as zendaya

also lime how pauls struggle was very well depicted he was a reluctant messiah every step of the way until he felt he had no choice but to step on that path

i do wish alias story wouldve been adapted more faithfully i think it was an interesting approach having a character born who was not only fully aware of the world but all their ancestors triumphs sins etc and the weight it all brings it looks like alia will be a character in the planned third film though hoping its greenlit so im thinking itll be given the attention it deserves

knockout performances from everyone in the cast the only somewhat weak ones were from walken and pugh from what i felt at least but ireland has more of a story part three anyway and shaddam was always more of a supporting character still have love for both of their performances",2024-03-01 19:25:45

"i can’t wait to be able to watch part 1 and part 2 back to back so many unforgettable and visually stunning moments finally getting to see a fully realized giedi prime in all of its glory was amazing brilliantly designed down to the last detail even the harkonnen fireworks were black

i loved that villeneuve leaned in hard to the references to the drawings that hr giger did for the jodorowsky story boards especially with the harkonnengiedi prime designs in part 2 those creepy dudes circlingprotecting feyd in the harkonnen colosseum looked like they were the  cousins of xenomorphs you could drop them straight into any of the movies in the alien franchise and they’d be right at home the profile  shots of the baron in his floaty  man throne reminded me of giger’s sketches for the harkonnen castle whether or not we should interpret that as a love letter or a middle fingermic drop from villeneuve to jodorowsky is a fun little question to ponder

i just wish he’d been able to work in a sly homage to the guild navigator vaginas in the lynch version i’m always going to have a soft spot in my heart for that magnificent trainwreck of a movie it was so confusing that when it opened in theatres they handled out glossary cheat sheets so that people who hadn’t read the books could keep up",2024-03-02 08:05:53

"christopher walken’s emperor apologist here 

 disclaimer i have not read the dune books on the other hand i am gearing up for the release of dd’s netflix adaptation of the 3 body problem which has already revealed several broadstroke changes to the source material it is with this mindset that i accept the fact that not everything has to be exactly like the books for the adaptation to be perfectly fine or even great

now for my opinion
walken’s emperor is neurotic and paranoid between duke leto and him it’s like a “you vs the guy she told you not to worry about” meme it’s plain to see how the bene gesserit could so easily twist him into plotting against house atreides despite the significant risk it would pose if the other great houses were to learn of the betrayal even with the plan kept secret the harkonnens correctly infer that the emperor is vulnerable laying the path for feyd rautha to seize the throne

against the context of dune 1 an old and frail emperor is totally consistent watch part 1 again and you might notice that we never see the sarduakar in a fair fight we get them and the harkonnens tag teaming a halfawake house atreides and then a squad of maybe a dozen sarduakar vs duncan idaho duncan the guy who admires the desert power of the fremen absolutely shreds the first 9 of them before a draw with the 10th this helps me believe that a sneaky fremen attack could easily wipe both the entire sarduakar and harkonnen armies

by the third act of dune 2 the bene gesserit confirm that the emperor is done no matter what for me this wouldn’t work as well if the emperor was any less pathetic instead i’d be thinking “what’s stopping the emperor and his sarduakar from having a narrow path forward”

in sum i liked the movie it’s very exciting to see a sci fi adaptation carried out to this degree of quality i’ll be happy if the netflix 3bp show is half as good as this",2024-03-05 19:47:50

"people are too media illiterate to understand paul is the villain doesnt make any sense to me and i think its only held by people whove read the books and cant see what theyre actually being told by the film alone 

theres nothing in the film to remotely demonstrate hes anything other than a hero heres a guy who does everything right fighting with an oppressed group with honour against the most blatant villains ever put to film he can see the future he can speak brand new languages just because and he comes back to life in a ritual no man has ever survived he rejects certain actions because he has a premonition that theyll end badly but then has a new premonition that we dont see and acts on it he kills the bad guys literally nothing here suggests villain",2024-03-21 09:38:25

on a side note did the uprising seem underwhelming to anyone else the harkonnen never had the upperhand and were just getting their  rocked no losses from the fremen and the counter attacks were dumb imo i dont know if they were trying to make a point out of paul leadingmotivating people but it seemed to me the fremen couldve rebelled much earlier

the movie did look good and the score was fantastic",2024-03-01 23:42:04
"i have to say this film suffers from poor editing and pacing there are times when the movie drags first 45 mins times when it feels disjointed and towards the end just plain rushed 

the entire sequence of them riding south on the worms till when chani discovers paul drank the worm juice is just bizzare 

so we see paul riding the worm the next scene he is suddenly inside the chamber looking at the baby worm hes then given the juice which he drinks we then see the juice lady inform lady jessica what paul has done and they are shown walking into the cave in the next scene we see chani arrive via an ornithopter  and jessica is waiting for her outside the cave  

at this point i was legit going  is going on here the whole sequence is just extremely disjointed 

and i know everyone says the books finale is also rushed but not having a single shot from pauls pov after the events of the climax felt very weird chani was not the right character for the film to end on in my opinion 

the final battle too is literally just 2 mins of action apart from the fight between paul and feyd in which once again we arent really shown how exactly did paul land the killing blow not a biggie but still

"so i watched this film with my parents and we had kind of different reactions to the end i thought it was interesting

to them they mostly felt like paul did what he had to do and it was a triumphant ending for them 

for me i felt deflated and depressed at the end i felt like ok he won but hes not the person he used to be and this isnt where he wanted to end up hes kinda ended up in this position where it feels like the aim isnt to have prosperity for the fremen anymore now its just the fremen blindly following him in this game of powers hes kinda leaning towards a dictator type character and i felt like chani had felt the same way betrayed by him not just because of him leaving her but because of him changing and becoming something worse and the fremen being taken advantage of as she had said at some point in the movie she didnt want the fremen to become slaves

but i guess someone could argue that practically the results are good the fremen are free now and nothing bad has really happened",2024-03-03 15:13:02
"i agree with most here that the film was overall very good the visuals cinematography score acting mostly themes and story were really well executed the one weak link for me was zendaya she just isn’t that great an actress and she and chalamet had zero chemistry it wouldn’t have been a big deal normally but for whatever reason villeneuve put a lot of focus on chani which drew attention this weakness 

i was also a little baffled by how rushed the ending was like this is nearly a 3 hour movie where they were willing to take 20 minutes just to set up the baron’s nephew but they totally glossed over the beginning of a galactic jihad also why end on a scene of chani once again giving her stank face there’s galaxy spanning decisions going on at the palace with a messianic figure but we are instead focused on the messiah’s jilted exlover weird 

other than that though i thought it was a pretty incredible film and about as good an adaptation of the novel as we could hope for",2024-03-20 14:43:39

"part one absolutely is better part two felt aside from a few scenes like it was by a different director it was fun but felt closer to a regular young adult dystopian film than the masterpiece ive had on in the background the past couple years part one some thoughts id like to expand on later


• stilgar rabban the baron gurney and feydrautha all felt off feyd not as much but introduced too late and underdeveloped

• harkonnens in general were way dumbed down rabban and feyd are like toddlers and the baron a fraction of how menacing and interesting he was in p1 

• zendaya chalamet and pugh were all inconsistent in terms of actingdelivery at moments zendaya just being a huge miscast in my opinion 

• part 2 felt oddly edited and really suffers from the same as dune 1984 incredibly rushed particularly the last hour 

• quicker jarring cuts and much less nuanced dialogue

rewatching for sure probably a 7510 for me right now i really find it hard to imagine a casual viewer rating this higher than a 610 or so",2024-03-02 03:22:14
boring and slow,2024-03-01 11:50:19
"just watched the premiere two hours ago

thoughts

 productionwise its exceptional
 visually stunning with incredible performances from everyone in the cast
 memorable and wellchoreographed battles
 simultaneously provides closure and sets up a sequel in a smart way
 the scenes on geidi prime are visually among the best ive seen in any film in a long time
 the sequence where paul takes control and declares himself lisan al gaib had me say hooooly 
 however i admit i found the movie a tad bit underwhelming compared to part one which i am a massive fan of it lacks the x factor that the first film masterfully accomplished through a combination of tone atmosphere editing careful use of music and sense of mystery
 in comparison part 2 feels like a blockbusterized version of the first film a generalized hollywood version designed for those who found part one to be boring when it was everything but or perhaps like it was made by different people with different ideas of how the world of dune should be portrayed i know that this was unavoidable simply because of the way the story unfolds but it was nonetheless my impression
 if you watch part 1 and part 2 backtoback i suspect this tonal inconsistency will be jarring not to mention the inconsistency in some characterization for instance stilgar
 the film is bombastic and does its best to impress you which it does but ultimately i felt a lack of substance emotional investment and in the first half some pacing issues  none of the problems part 1 suffered from
 the portrayal of part 2s themes  such as prophecy and dangers of faith  felt a bit on the nose and hamfisted like the film didnt expect its audience to be smart enough to handle some subtlety and connect the dots themselves  rather everything had to be explained in a blunt and direct way on multiple occassions the characters recap or explain what is happening as if the audience cant figure it out
 i can also imagine hans zimmer will be perplexed when he watches the final cut because there seems to be a bizzare lack of music in the film so many scenes and even battles play out with total absence of music or with minimal amounts as a result some scenes felt like they didnt deliver the impact dennis intended them to
 the film definitely picks up once austin butlers character is introduced although feyd himself is a rather onedimensional villain without much depth or complexity
 the main conflict is also partially resolved via a plot device spoilers hidden atomic weapons thats randomly introduced halfway through the movie and wasnt hinted or established neither in this nor in the previous film  unless i missed something
 overall its still a solid film particularly from a technical standpoint but i prefer part one",2024-03-01 03:56:55
anyone else really appreciate this movie but left the theater feeling it was kinda meh,2024-03-01 11:43:39

did anyone else feel like paul’s transition from “i’m not going south i’m not the one” to “i’m here and ready to drink the water of life” was a bit fast seemed like his mind just changed in an instant and that was that unless i missed something,2024-03-03 12:34:06
"look phenomenal movie best movie of 2024 easily so far however i have one complaint and i might get hate downvotes for it

did anyone think zendaya was miscast as chani i don’t know it wasn’t as obvious in the first movie because she was barely given anything to do and yeah i get that she’s supposed to be the one voice of reason but here i felt like she was outacted by almost everyone and seemed out of her depth i don’t know am i the only one who felt this way",2024-03-01 06:30:52

but the movie for me at least is missing the emotional gravitas of a masterpiece like arrival for example the moment when paul chooses florence in front zendaya should hit like a sledgehammer to the heart but instead it sorta feels like reading a line from the wikipedia plot summary i thought all the performances were great so i dont blame the actors at all my guess is that they had to have cut some footage of paul and zendaya in the desert near the beginning that could have forged their relationship more persuasively and strongly because even though they had chemistry i dont know if i ever felt their love and without that feeling i didnt feel the heartbreak at the end 

still this is incredible blockbuster filmmaking just trying to figure out why i felt like something was missing",2024-03-02 05:28:14
this movie is a true masterpiece it is a testament to the beauty of cinema and its power to immerse the viewer within itself and take them on a journey that is phenomenal javier bardem was brilliant in this and hans zimmer was having a field day with his score it was absolutely  listening to what he had created for this movie instant classic,2024-03-01 11:50:40
"the film was allright it had its moment i sat tense in my chair and thoroughly enjoyed the movie but there were times that i cought myself thinking the pacing is off here this wasnt good etc

i like a movie best when i dont notice myself noticing things in the movie so i cant say its a masterpiece it feels like they tried to put too much book into too short amount of time leading many important parts of the books to be cut

it felt a bit rushed this movie a good one but the pacing is fast a bit too fast ever so impressing visual and auditory effects cant change importance of the underlying dramatic curve that binds it all together",2024-03-01 11:58:33
get you a hype man like stilgar he was the comic relief without being the butt of the joke he commanded the respect of the fremen and his fanaticism was both amusing and terrifying,2024-03-01 13:50:27
jealous of fey i wanna touch margos box too,2024-03-01 20:36:25
"so first of all banger i 100 loved 80 of it and at least 80 loved the last 20 i think the changes to chani were a fantastic decision  the story doesnt work without a window into pauls conscience and chani gave us that while paul did his messiah  tasteful well conceived well executed i grok that and im here for it 

i dont know if i can say the same for jessica like ive read everything i know i get what shes supposed to be doing but i felt super in touch with her character in part one and in this one honestly feyd rautha is more sympathetic and he feeds people to people on screen i dont understand her character in this half with relation to her character in the previous half cant reconcile the jessica who was sobbing in a tent with paul to the jessica whos like woot jihad  its on

but maybe itll make more sense when i watch it a hundred more times",2024-03-02 01:55:23
saw it in imax and its nothing like anything ive seen before except dune i maybe,2024-03-02 11:54:53

if paul didnt  him the emperor probably would have",2024-03-02 20:37:58
hes not the lisan al gaib hes a very naughty boy,2024-03-02 21:03:57
"i feel very strongly that this trilogy is going to be insanely good on tier or even beyond lotr if you have read dune messiah you know what incredible potential the third movie will have

so many great shots the intro music and energy had me pumped up and aside from many other more conspicuous shots the scene where he first rides the shai hulud was absolutely phenomenal in terms of pacing and thrill of course even that pales as paul becomes who he needs to be

truly an exceptional movie and the best i have watched in a long time",2024-03-02 21:12:36
"i see 5000 comments here already just wanted to chip in and say that i regret not seeing this masterpiece in imax 

its been years since i saw something like this i read it was going to be very good so i set my expectations high the movie went higher than that and literally kept my interest without any problems for the entire 2 hour 45 minute playtime

a timeless masterpiece",2024-03-02 23:24:43

what a beautiful experience that was i love hans zimmer’s work so much,2024-03-03 01:22:10
"do you think the general audience understands that this isn’t really the triumphant ending that the cheering and music make it seem paul’s worst fears are coming true and that should be terrifying i wonder if villeneuve was leading us to also see paul as a savior

there must be a term for this unreliable conclusion",2024-03-03 02:10:31
just walked out of the theatre film of the year that is all,2024-03-03 03:29:11
that was legitimately one of the best cinematic experiences i’ve experienced holy  the sound design,2024-03-03 05:34:28
this movie is a monster a big giant monster just like the worm they ride on reading the books makes it better cause you fill in all the gaps simply incredible piece of work will see it again on the big screen for sure,2024-03-03 06:37:39
denis you have moved me,2024-03-03 06:42:37
okay but i lauged when chani slapped paul but the whole theatre was so silent rip,2024-03-03 07:40:33
why was the baron big and floaty and overwhelming in the first movie but just  and bathed and on life support in the second,2024-03-05 15:40:28
"loved it


feyd  was great


walken was great 

everyone was great

best sci fri adaptation ever",2024-03-06 03:55:21
  this movie was amazing holy  everyone and i mean everyone absolutely killed it in their performances the sound quality was also amazing when paul is reading peoples minds and calling out their secret thoughts and at one point he says the fremen name for arrakis  that dune made a chill run up my spine 1010 adaptation and movie i hope a lot of people watch this and we get a movie for dune messiah bring on anya taylorjoy as muaddibs sister,2024-03-06 05:15:46
i haven’t seen a comment that talks about this but did everyone already know that the baron was jessica’s father i didn’t read the books so i was shook lol very cool hearing paul calling him grandfather just before killing him,2024-03-21 20:42:45
"i like how they got more into what a psychopath feyd is here  rabban also got more to do as well

the film looks and sounds gorgeous

i’m conflicted on the jessica stuff

i actually really like what they did with chani here  i did not mind her in the book by any means  but here she is just a more engaging character with more to do imo  and it makes be intrigued to see her in messiah now  also zendaya was really good here

the ending definitely sets things up for messiah as well

timothee acts his  off in this film  paul is so  intimidating in the latter part of this film",2024-03-01 03:42:43
"910

good
 costumes especially harkonnen
 giedi prime
 fremen stuff
 overall book accuracy with smart changes

less good
 stilgar could have been less funny
 walken as the emperor fell very short",2024-03-01 03:45:09
i enjoyed it more than the first actually felt like a full movie why was zendayas character do  anyway shes the one that talked him into going south,2024-03-01 04:21:38
"good enough but part 1 was much much better this movie had great moments riding the sandworm knife fight but the pacing and editing were quite poor 

anytime a scene would begin to get interesting it would just jump paul is told to trek across the desert and they just kind of ignore it he is told he isnt fremen so he will never be allowed to ride a worm hard cut to him preparing to ride a worm  just felt super rushed at times while dragging at others",2024-03-01 05:15:24
paul atreides “i’m him” the movie,2024-03-01 06:17:19
"last line of part 1 “this is only the beginning…”

last line of part 2 “the holy war has begun…”

denis i love you man — you’re one of the best directors alive — but you gotta come up with better closing lines for these movies

anyone got a prediction for the final line of messiah",2024-03-01 06:44:44
mission impossible 7 last year dune 2 this year i’m liking this new annual tradition of having one blockbuster movie with 45 of the hottest women imaginable,2024-03-01 23:50:17
i think this is a modern classic i don’t think it’s reactionary on an artistic and technical level it was so profound,2024-03-02 04:30:26
that was insanely bad  incredible film  left the theatre shaking  everything about it was perfect i just knew i watched something historical as soon as it ended,2024-03-02 05:07:16
"really loved it and the little diversions from the book chani having real agency was a nice turn and i was gutted for her at the end  though a little frustrated this ended on a cliff hanger with her supposedly riding off

the time jump was handled very well and i was on hooks waiting to see how this was handled  especially after our glimpse of you know who earlier

loved jessicas behind the scenes play and talking to her counterpart nice little sickness there

absolutely loved that small little horror aspect of what have we done when they realise she is pregnant  and we also see in real time whats happening but lay viewers maybe not quite understanding whats happening to her baby uncomfortable watching

the black sun of geidi prime was a delight cant describe why when weve got sci fi films aplenty denis has to try so hard to bring something new to the table

im fully on board ill return to book three this year and see how i feel about the rest them but certainly feels like a great compliment to the books as i do find them a difficult read

"we must convert the weakest first

"part one was like reading an instruction manual filled with some very good lore artwork   
finished by an innovative tutorial mission

part two was the full game experience

cant wait for someone to do a showing of them together with a 10 minute hans zimmer intermission",2024-03-03 09:05:22
the most disturbing thing in this movie is feydrautha kissing the baron on his lips twice,2024-03-24 10:00:17
just walked out of a showing it was so boring  it looked great music was good very well directed and acted but so so boring nothing had any weight to it  i just didnt care about any of the characters it just ,2024-03-06 01:57:27
great film but anyone else think it felt like about 4 hours long first act dragged quite a bit still reckon part 1 is the better film if i’m honest,2024-03-01 03:24:36
"i dunno i really liked the movie stylistically for the most part but it was soooooo slowwwww 

we spent all of movie one world building and then this movie we spent way too long with sequences of paul and chani staring at each other the first half of the movie was super boring and dragged because of this for way too long people in the theatre even seemed to be actively bored during this part lots of ppl checking out and looking at their phones until we finally moved on from the ‘paul is a fremen now officially yay’ part of the movie

also felt like the director literally ripped off aliens and prometheus with how he did the harkonnen’s their entire look as well as the aesthetic of their homeworld looked directly ripped off from ridley scott and the white dudes in prometheus and covenant wasn’t a fan of that at all personally 

also feyd was just mehhhh and fell pretty flat for me in the ‘villain’ category he didn’t seem very menacing in the least and i think part of it was due to the aesthetic choices of how they made him look 

solid b movie for me but not deserving the 1010 that lots of people are giving it and i’m saying this as a massive book and dune fan 

the zimmer sound score was at least spectacular though",2024-03-03 04:37:03
"just saw the movie i really dont know how to feel its beautifully made well acted but the story is not good and pacing is too slow for what happened 

outside of destroying the north paul and fremen ends up curb stomping the harkonnens and becoming emperor it was fairly easy going for paul the only obstacle he had was drinking the blue gatorade some of the way they acted towards paul was a bit comical stilgar which kindve showed the aging of dune which you cant fault since it was written 60 yrs ago 

i think dune 1 and 2 are going to be one of the most overrated movie that will be talked about in the next 10 years not because the movie is bad but its not excellent its just good

also no bring in the  man line",2024-03-03 06:55:31
"great visuals decent acting terrible pacing 

solid 710 for me not understanding the 1010 hype rn",2024-03-03 07:17:39
feyd and paul shoulda  frfr the  tension was more intense in the 10 minutes they’re on screen together than anything between him and zendaya,2024-03-05 22:39:37
"1 a bit dense for a dune normie like me this truly felt like a part 2 where you actually need to watch 1 again and relearn stuff also that ending is made for part 3 sadly  
2 intensely slow the action would only peak for 10 mins towards the end and its barely a climax in fact  
3 a lot of the characters in this film are fodder ie butler and pugh and could have been edited out of it and it would still make sense butler is definitely overhyped for how littlebarebone his role is  
4 this film is overlong and such fluff zendaya and chalamet took the biggest chunk of the film but still felt underwritten  thats a testament given how long the film feels the religious cult storyline faired better but i felt that it could have been more subtle and organically ingrained into the storey rather than driven into dialogue  
5 its biggest strength is that it is a visual feast every moment is a painting vibes",2024-03-01 06:05:21
"visuals  stunning

music and sound  stunning

acting  very good mostly could so with less childish screaming to portray anger to be honest

characters  what the  did they do butchered chani made jessica out to be evil made stilgar look a fool deleted alia and so  up the barons death scene

at one point they made stilgar sound like something out of life of brian i half expected jessica to say hes just a naughty boy

i dont expect the film to be one to one with the book but there was no reason to make changes like this

ive seen people try to go but its to make the message clearerif thats the case its treating its audience as  and does not need to do so and in any case this film seems to have missed the point of the books and instead decided to make the first half into a teen romance for some reason whilst skipping some key scenes from the book which add weight and nuance to the story and characters

x200b

its not a bad film its just a bad dune adaptationwatch it for the visuals they are amazing but as a dune filmnope  it",2024-03-01 20:22:49
javier bardem is the best hype man you could ask for did not expect that type of direction for that character but i’ll take it,2024-03-01 03:27:27
ive seen it twice now there are so many amazing visuals in this film from the haunting float of the harkonnen fighters at the beginning of the film to the awe inspiring worm ride scene loved the rework of the baby into a fully sentient fetus that spoke through the mother real creepy stuff i really hope this does well this weekend and we get a third film real soon cause id love to see the rest of the paul story get adapted with messiah,2024-03-01 03:51:48
really loved the parallels between the colosseum fight scene and ancient rome  how civilization always seems to return back to its roots well i guess that was the theme of the whole movie,2024-03-01 04:07:24
take a shot every time they say lisa al gaheeb,2024-03-01 04:30:00
he really chose becky with the shiny hair,2024-03-01 05:17:02

off topic but whats with all the comments here saying everyone in their theater clapped cheered laughed gasped etc everyone was quiet af in my theater lol",2024-03-01 05:21:23
i’m so stoked after seeing this like i just want to shove it down someone’s throat it was so good,2024-03-01 05:47:39
been hyped for this film for so long so happy i was able to see it and enjoyed it thoroughly,2024-03-01 05:48:14
what does zendaya preparing to ride a worm at the end of the movie signify is she abandoning the cause,2024-03-01 06:16:58
“not very clever”,2024-03-01 06:31:59
florence pugh rocked that metallic space headscarf,2024-03-01 06:51:48
great movie i saw a lot of influences from all over the place the whole time i was wondering how they edited this thing because it must have been a beast to put together only thing i wanted more of was some sardaukar chanting,2024-03-01 07:00:01
there was a shot near the end of the third act when the fremen ships are flying in to rain gunfire down on the harkonnenssardaukar that almost looked like the xwings attacking the death star in a new hope felt very full circle since the novel dune partially inspired star wars,2024-03-01 07:00:37
dune  part two gave the missed comic to screen adaptation of thanos vs drax,2024-03-01 07:01:31
"as others said incredible movie really enjoyed it in a theater

one thing that lost me a little was how much did pass on arrakis during the movie  we see pauls mother pregnant throughout the film so less than 9 months  did she gave birth before the end  we didnt see any baby it confuses me quite a bit because going from total stranger to a full fremen fighter wormrider and chani lover in less than a year seems weird for paul

just a nitpick though",2024-03-01 07:07:56
so  amazing was fully gripped the entire runtime sets the bar absurdly high for the rest of 2024,2024-03-01 07:10:26
if someone could explain to me without spoiling the likely third movie… what is chani’s role up until this point paul’s dreams from the first made it seem like she was going to be as important or at least close to the reclamation of arakkis but then it kind of seems like she gets dismissed at the end,2024-03-01 07:11:33
"timothee chalalalamet really good in these

amazing movies so many great moments shame there wont be any extended cut cant get enough",2024-03-01 07:16:11
what a great visual experience cant wait to rewatch,2024-03-01 07:19:10
well that was  stellar,2024-03-01 07:22:28
the line between loyalty and worship is a thin one what a great job of showing the dangers of following a charismatic leader no one is the good guy what an amazing movie,2024-03-01 07:55:34
"so the ending was changed from what it is in the book so i have some questions about this new ending

 the main point of him taking irulan’s hand and becoming emperor in the book seemed to be that this move was the only way he could buy the support of the other houses as being emperor they would have to obey him but in the movie with the other houses challenging him what was really the point of wanting to take her hand if becoming emperor didn’t prevent the houses from turning against him

 i feel like the whole paul character aspect of him trying to avoid the jihad for pretty much the entire movie just to end up going along with it in the final scene was confusing did i miss anything in the movie that would explain his sudden change of heart and why he is now suddenly okay with going along with it and sending the fremen out to exterminate the other houses even when doing so will cost him chani",2024-03-01 12:55:24
overall a great movie but the lack of alia is unforgettable i missed the abomination of our heart,2024-03-01 13:10:21
did anybody else catch the weird knife thing in the last fight the knife switched positions where paul was stabbed,2024-03-01 13:25:01

i have an imax 70mm for dune 2 tomorrow evening but i live near a dolby cinema and i’m thinking about seeing it tonight i don’t have the funds to do back to back showings what should i pick ,2024-03-01 16:46:18
i didn’t expect austin butler to be doing a stellan skarsgard impression,2024-03-01 18:07:59

"i think i’ve seen princess irulan’s headdress somewhere before

",2024-03-01 19:54:55
only complaint was christopher walken like i get it hes a good person but the guy just plays himself definitely took away from the awesome acting by pretty much everyone else,2024-03-01 20:20:01
lets give a round of applause to hans zimmer he is the low key mvp in this movie the music is so good on its own yet fits with the movie perfectly the final theme still sounds in my head what a piece of work,2024-03-01 20:34:58
"incredible visuals sound good acting decent take on the story

i know denis seldom disappoints i know this is totally my kind of movie and that i was going to really like it no matter what but i think this was great",2024-03-01 21:13:14
so did chani just not ever get closure on austin butler barbecuing her friend,2024-03-01 21:42:36
"just saw it generally enjoyed it but i have a bunch questions

 when paul gets sent into the desert by stilgar he bumps into chani and then were immediately thrown into a full battle scene in the next scene is it just me or was something cut from the film it seemed like they were setting us up for a paul surviving in the desert by himself scene
 they establish that jessicas eyes turn blue after drinking the worm  how come pauls eyes turn blue before he drank the stuff
 where did chani learn how to fly one of those helicopter things
 when feydrautha gets sent to arakis did they establish that baron harkonnen would be joining him
 when the harkonnens attack the fremen following the explosion at the spice depot they make it seem like stilgar is very badly injured and he wants to paul to  him how is it that stilgar is back in ship shape for the final battle sequence
 why does everyone stand idly by when paul kills baron harkonnen especially feyd rautha
 is jessica supposed to be good or bad i was deeply confused about her role in all of this

thank you for coming to ted talk",2024-03-01 21:46:24
qq at the end when the fremen board the ships to “show them paradise” is that them going to have a battle with the other houses armada seems a bit out there if that’s the case as surely they have never had a space battle would they even have the man power,2024-03-01 22:17:02
"loved the visuals and felt the energy of the fremen stuff also it heavily borrowed from islamic and jewish and coptic christian themes 

seems like a third film is guaranteed",2024-03-01 22:18:22
"did anyone watch it in dolby 

i may go see it in there next but i have a question did it play in the full 185 or 19 tall aspect ratio or just in the standard 239

i ask bc when i saw gotg3 in dolby it expanded to fit the full screen during what i assume was the imax sequences during the action sequences",2024-03-01 22:24:39
was anya taylorjoy ever announced for the cast was shocked to see her during the vision,2024-03-01 22:28:26

the baron was striking the vape he just like me,2024-03-02 01:40:56
didn’t read the books nor watch the older movies just trying to figure out these new ones  have really enjoyed them  the only thing i know that i was disappointed in was how big of a  bautista’s character ended up being in the second movie  is he the same way in the books  his character seemed to only exist to give others a chance to beat up on which is the exact opposite direction i expected,2024-03-02 02:28:32
should i see this in imax or imax 70mm imax i can see soon 70mm there isnt any tix available till mid march or even late march,2024-03-02 02:40:38

edit upon another viewing i appreciate ferguson  chalamet’s acting even more paul seems more calculated earlier on jessica is plotting love to see it",2024-03-02 03:21:50
dumb question but why was there black and white scenes it was visually stunning i might have missed that explanation though,2024-03-02 03:53:22
this is timmy at his most powerful ,2024-03-02 08:23:37
can anyone clear something up for me after paul and chani go south paul drinks the water of life and then it cuts to chani arriving in the helicopter am i not remembering a scene where they got in it originally the edit and cut there just felt jarring to me,2024-03-02 18:43:14
hes not the mahdi hes a very naughty boy,2024-03-02 19:23:19
this movie was pretty but definitely takes a lot of liberties away from the book,2024-03-02 20:19:41

since ive heard that if there is a part three it will be an adaption of messiah so i guess i answered my own question and that its yes ",2024-03-02 20:31:56
somehow muadib is back,2024-03-02 21:45:06
if the reverend mother wanted house atredis to die out why did she tell the baron in part one to not  paul and his mother,2024-03-02 23:19:52
the fight scene was good,2024-03-03 00:16:25
how did guerny survive what deal did he make where is his base of operations to refine spice why cant the harkanons see his operations was he captured or injured in battle his scar his reintroduction felt a bit unexplainedconfusing to me tbh,2024-03-03 00:43:14
the technical instinct denis and his crew have is awe inspiring so many little things to enjoy like chani running and giggling in dead silence immediately interrupted by the ornithopter crashing,2024-03-03 00:59:55
i think this will be the best movie of the year my only complaint is that it ends…,2024-03-03 03:09:22
"seeing this in a dolby theater at amc was otherworldly the audio was both jarring and explosive most scenes had my seat shaking and rumbling near the end of the film when paul yells silence using the voice on the reverand mother was straight chills 1010 would see again in dolby the loss of hearing was worth it lol

also the entire middle section of the harkonnen planet was some of the best cinematography and general world building ive ever seen made the harkonnens feel even more alien the baron killing his servants and slowly dipping into his tub was another great scene",2024-03-03 03:13:17
i’m just here to comment and say this movie was amazing,2024-03-03 03:33:47
i would watch 3 hours of paul atreides walking slowly in the desert while his cloak billows,2024-03-03 05:09:35

definitely was a if i had a nickel moment",2024-03-03 06:20:14
not a book reader pls clarify because i was in awe of the fight but it ended suddenly how did paul exactly defeat feyd feyd was winning until he suddenly lost did paul get stabbed on purpose to trap feyds knives on his body why was feyd not going for killing stabs he stabs paul twice but he walks away generally okay,2024-03-03 15:07:11
"i was seriously terrified that theyd end the movie in the scene where paul refuses to fight javier bardem then declares himself leader of the fremen i really thought theyd do what they did in part 1 and end it just as the story was really going to get insane 

im so glad the film had that epic climax instead fantastic movie",2024-03-03 22:26:29
"first off i’d want to say me and my gf absolutely loved the film 
the sound atmosphere and acting were all top notch plus it was so beautifully shot and arty without feeling pretentious 
did have two questions though
how do they get off the sand worms
why did the emperor stick all his resources and army in one spot when they were fighting against guerrilla warfare 
also when zendaya slaps timothy chalamet and the music goes ahhh ahhh  eyyy had me in stitches",2024-03-03 22:36:21
that was so badassssss so cool seeing this world play out and it’s only going to get crazierrrr,2024-03-03 23:40:18
at the end are we supposed to like paul or hate paul,2024-03-04 00:02:00
amazing movie but the only thing i was curious about is how the  they got so many people onto the sandstorm to ride it to the south lol,2024-03-04 00:05:36
there was another reason chani zendaya was  off at paul paul said he would marry princess florence pugh,2024-03-04 01:14:42
"even without rewatching the first one i enjoyed rhe movie even when i felt the 2 hour mark i wanted more






with that said i dont remember anything about bautistas character and really all he did in this movie was kylo ren trying to  luke completely with the over the top yelling and failing",2024-03-04 05:38:15

kinda funny that thousands of years in to the future and a nuke is still the ultimate world destroying weapon,2024-03-04 13:25:31
i liked this movie,2024-03-04 19:14:32
"i really like how after drinking the water of life he just fully embraces the mahdi role chani also notices a change in him and that he no longer hesitates about being the new messiah

i kind of wish they let lady jessica and chani interact more and let lady jessica explain to her that she will have a similar role to her as pauls true love despite being the concubine i think chani is smart enough to understand political marriages

overall absolutely incredible and i loved every second of it",2024-03-04 21:33:46
i wonder if theres a dune part 1 and 2 mega cut that can combine both movies in some manner like for instance feydrauthas character mightve been better introduced earlier so his character could sit for the 2 year gap in movie release along with the others felt like they were setting him up for more than just to get killed at the end or maybe just some more time with him on arrakis besides the aftermath of the bombing scene,2024-03-04 22:38:20
"i have so much to say about this film because it was absolutely glorious sweeping majestic nail biting beautiful moving so much

but instead of counting all the ways just two random thoughts instead

geidi prime fireworks looking like plasmoid ameobas and somehow being creepy yet still beautiful a wonderul touch

poor chani good sis lost her man not to another woman but to glorious purpose loki voice  
its impossible to compete with that ",2024-03-04 23:04:31
"having just watched the first film yesterday for today’s viewing i have a lot of thoughts going through my head first off the visuals and sound design were amazing my jaw was dropped at several scenes with the sandworms the harkonnen’s home planet and the scene where the emperor’s ship was coming to the capital of arrakis

the action ranges from solid to excellent little to no complaints there

i’ve never read the books but i did find the story predictable galactic holy war is the endgame with that said the execution of it was well done it’s portrayed both as a moment of triumph for paul and fremen but also horror for the jihad to come

the character writing is a little wonky this is where i feel like 2 two and a half hour films isn’t quite enough to establish and flesh out all the characters in this massive ensemble cast a few felt superfluous or weren’t given much to do like momoa and bautista paul has it best overall in the narrative seeing him go through a transformation from a well meaning and kind young man to a conqueror who embraces the religious fervor is terrifying a part of me thinks it went a little quickly of how fast paul rises through the ranks and gains more followers in this case a longer adaptation might have been more effective in fleshing that out

i didn’t quite buy the relationship between him and chani but it did make for an effective if predictable crux he loses the love of his life to gain power and become emperor a part of me wants to see the aftermath and how horrifically wrong the jihad will turn out

it’s an excellent film and i see it sweeping 2025’s technical awards i love the sound design when they summon the sandworms to ride and attack it was one of my favorite reoccurring beats in the film

all together i really enjoyed the film 810 wish it was longer so characters can be more fleshed out",2024-03-04 23:20:45
the scene where lady jessica drinks the water of life was one of the more nightmareish scenes ive seen in a while,2024-03-04 23:24:44
im super biassed because i love the book but i can already say this is one of my favorite movies ever i honestly think denis made the story better while still staying  completely true to frank herberts themes and ideas,2024-03-05 02:20:37
ugh i was so excited to see it but there was a mix up and they showed the life of brian instead,2024-03-05 04:15:40
the fremen were definitely drinking their own  right they didnt even want jessica to puke and lose water ,2024-03-05 04:27:10
wonderful movie no notes i always like how books get adapted to movies such as this movie having an accelerated timeline i also love that jessica post reverend mother ascension comes off as more of a villainantagonist than in the books ,2024-03-05 07:21:56
"please let me know if im getting this wrong 

chani is like you killed him   i wont kiss him back to life i dont even believe your  prophecy and then rebecca ferguson uses the voice on chani dew it 

she stands there paused for a few seconds then she goes ahead and does it     was it the voice that made her do it  or did she just do it anyway like why not 

and when chani walks out of the room she says something to rebecca ferguson right before leaving and is her voice now stronger when she says that thing",2024-03-05 08:22:06

florence pugh channeling her inner rick james towards the end there,2024-03-06 12:11:24
question those inkblot fireworks were so  cool of an idea but i noticed it seemed like they were splattering against a clear surface when they went off after feyds fight suppose there was just an invisible shield over the theater and the fireworks splattered against it  or was it just the way they went off that i interpreted them as if splattered against a surface just curious cause im always trying to learn more about when exactly shields are and arent used,2024-03-06 18:44:31
"majestic writing

during the final duel you expect paul to win of course so they first have feyd threaten chani to raise the stakes like yes our hero will eventually win but what is he risking also he wins by outsmarting his opponent which also helps the final battle have an interesting dynamic even when you know how its gonna end",2024-03-07 07:18:47
ok that part at the end when zimmer uses a motif from the 1984 dunes theme a couple of times i was excited,2024-03-07 07:44:02
such an amazing film,2024-03-07 20:05:06
"this has nothing to do with the film itself but i noticed an unusual detail about the end credits and im curious if anyone knows why they did it

right at the very end of the credits theres a note that the film is rated pg13 i think thats the first time i remember ever seeing a films mpaa rating included within a films credits of course they always show the mpaa certificate number but i cant remember ever seeing the specific rating mentioned before",2024-03-07 20:12:59
"can someone explain what happened at the end with the knife fight i could have sworn that paul was stabbed in the chest but he later removes the knife from his shoulder

also how was he able to block the knife from stabbing him by grabbing the blade with his hands even with gloves wouldnt that have been very painful as surely the blade would have cut through his gloves how was he able to do thata nd then stab him with his knife

  
also at the end why is paul and his troops allowed to just board the ship and  the mian  villian without any of the guards doing anything to stop him",2024-03-08 01:13:47
can anyone settle a debate between my girlfriend and i i think feyd rautha repeated “may thy dagger chip and shatter” to paul because he was super excited and enthusiastic for the fight but my girlfriend thinks he was mocking him i could see it being 8020 respect mocking also,2024-03-08 17:56:24
really love the look of the helmetless sardaukar they look like space vikings lol,2024-03-09 15:04:42
why did zendaya’s friend stay back at the sietch when everyone was moving down south,2024-03-09 23:06:58
was it revealed in the first film that the fremens messianic prophecy was a bene gesserit invention or was it stated for the first time in this movie,2024-03-10 03:56:05
my only gripe with the movie was pauls perfect stubble when did he have time to shave,2024-03-10 22:08:11
loved every minute,2024-03-10 22:45:48
"loved the movie

images and scenes were perfectly shot also amazing fx and score love the silent scenes

1 thing i hope that there will be a longer directors cut  someday because i had the feeling they jump very fast through the story which normally is simple to solve with some dialogue which seems to be cut",2024-03-10 23:05:55
denis only makes perfect films that is all,2024-03-10 23:42:32
something i really need to know is how they manage to get lady jessica in the basket onto a sandworm,2024-03-11 23:53:38
can anyone explain what was going on when everyone arrives in the south  the group is walking towards the city walls and when an ornithopter lands and chani gets out  when did she leave the group and where did she get an ornithopter,2024-03-12 13:41:25
is it just me or did feyd cream his pants several times while watching paul,2024-03-12 16:10:30
"just got out and my  what a spectacular experience i genuinely cant recall the last time i was affected by scenes in a movie like i was with this paul riding the sandworm for the first time the hallway scene with fenring and rautha stilgar a co riding the sandworms out of the storm paul embracing being the lisan al ghaib just wow

dare i say i thought some choices improved on the book

everyone was on their a game in front and behind the camera 1010",2024-03-13 02:53:39
holy  the gun sounds on that ship that was shooting down on them was amazing,2024-03-13 20:45:54
"saw the movie a second time and while still very good tried 4dx but the theater we went to i think cheaped out on the seats i have even more questions than i did last time

 gurney says that he bartered to smuggle survivors off world after the massacre are those survivors not going to tell everyone that a massacre took place i still think the idea that it is some big secret that all the atreides are dead doesnt make sense within the confines of the movie dont tell me read the book

 the bene gesserit have the power to make people do what they want via talking to them and rarely ever use this ability why not if they truly are trying to control everything from the shadows how come they are not actively using this all the time pauls mom uses it on chani and fenring on the harkanen so why arent they just always telling people what to do they could have told the fremen to go away when they came for the emperor 

 if arrakis was originally a tropical paradise why was it called dune lol this one is kind of a joke question

 finally it is a big point that nobody can go to the south of the planet because of the stormwall between the north and the southwhat the harkenens have satellites and ships why arent they just landing on the other side of the storm we see people walking around down there frequently in the movie meaning landing is very possible its also strange that the worms can go through the storm or actually that the storm is so strong you cant get through it but if you sit on the back of the worm you are safe what",2024-03-15 02:33:49
what did feyd do differently from roban that chased the fremen down south they didnt show how he knew where the fremen were staying,2024-03-16 21:53:15
did anyone else think austin butler’s character would’ve lasted longer,2024-03-17 03:30:31
why does paul want power do most people think it’s as simple as he just wants to survive and do people consider his taking power a betrayal of what he promised chani,2024-03-17 18:39:54
who where the last atreides people that feyd killed in the coliseum i felt i was supposed to recognize them from part 1,2024-03-19 14:54:37
were the fermen taking the emperors ships to other planets to start the war at the end,2024-03-20 02:36:41
"i liked the film liked it more than part one as well though i dont feel as strongly about it as most of reddit seems to feel about  i just didnt connect with any of the characters that much 


edit after sleeping on it i liked the first one better still liked this one but probably a 355 ",2024-03-24 03:29:57
so what i liked about the first one was the slow build up and the thing i didnt like about part two is how rushed it was this just shows that some things cannot be rushed no matter how good the cast or directing is i still enjoyed it of course but a lot of things just didnt have that impact as they should have like pauls solo walk in the desert or how paul not once questions his mother on how she completely changed,2024-03-24 21:37:30
so i’m late to the party but can we talk about the tip of the cap moment to monty python life of brian “the messiah is too humble to admit he is the messiah” had me going “he’s the messiah” in my head and nearly literally lolling,2024-03-25 04:19:49
did it not bother paul how his mother kinda became insane after she drank the holy water,2024-03-27 13:33:08
"first time ive been to the movies in ages and i had an absolute blast

was worried about my mum who i was seeing it with would hate it as shes not a fan of longer films always falls asleep and doesnt remember anything from the first dune but she actually really enjoyed it fell asleep for a little bit during the final battle though

the only thing that i didnt get was how did paul know where and how to get the water of lifepoison just his visions i mustve missed that detail",2024-03-29 06:05:48
i cant handle that he doesnt say to chani from now on you will never leave my side it isnt the same love i read but i get it lots to pack into the story but the way they loved man i gotta go read the books again just to feel okay haha,2024-03-30 04:14:45
i feel like they kind of did away with the whole slow blade penetrates the shield thing,2024-04-02 00:08:33
rautha stabbing that woman multiple times to check his blade’s sharpness was so evil i loved it,2024-04-03 09:28:29
"can anyone explain pauls behavoiour to me he had to go south which he feared because of the attack on the fremen base
then suddenly cut he decides to drink the blue worm poison learns he is harkonnenwhy is that so important that it changes his character something about the bloodline but i feel like this wasnt really explained and then it feels like his character is doing a 180 and he does everything he didnt wanted to  that confused me i got lost there",2024-04-05 22:25:20
" this movie was a masterpiece i really felt like i wanted more in the end dennis villeneuve really gave this novel justice the epic scenes and great casting if only other hollywood studios can learn from this

hans zimmers took the score to a whole other level one of his best",2024-04-06 15:08:13
so nobody talking about that 05 seconds  scene i guess when you’re in a spice desert you need to conserve sweat lol,2024-04-09 02:45:15
i think i went in expecting to like it more than the first film based on review scores and i’m not so sure that was the case,2024-04-09 04:33:12
it was a fine movie lots and lots of eye candy and wonderful spectacle my biggest beef with it was how tonally flat it was for 25 hours by the end i was getting fatigued by the dreary flat emotion of the whole thing and onslaught of frowny faces the tone is trying to maintain a sense of intrigue and seriousness which it succeeds at but i think because its so relentless that it starts to feel tiring and lopsided after awhile it ends up feeling like a 25 hour dream sequence which is really interesting but unfortunately hurts the connection to the characters and immersion of arrakis the main disconnect for me was how the characters arent very relatable everyone is so entirely serious and lacking any color whatsoever with the exception of a few passing moments my impression of the fremen from the book was that they were culturally vibrant and full of life despite their circumstances yet there are only brief glimpses of that in the movie,2024-03-02 15:30:23
"massive disappointment i loved the first one world building political intrigue great characters massive battles etc dune 2 on the other hand was bad no real intrigue little more insight into the world behind it all the battle scenes were laughable the main battle was such a massive let down a  joke 

  
i get that they tried to go for the show paul struggle with not fulfilling the prophecy but the entire story was predictable boring and filled with shallow 2dcharacters 

410

edit loved javier bardem though awesome actor",2024-03-04 07:37:33
"i loved it more than the first one 

denis villeneuve continues to provide strong direction writing and atmospheres throughout this movie as villeneuve perfectly captures the characters essence and themes of dune the camerawork the visuals the colors and production designs are all fantastic as it helped create the world and settings within the characters and tone various scenes of action thrills and tension were all wellexecuted and done beautifully with many allstar cast members all performances were great with not a single performance feeling dull or out of place 

since i haven’t read the original book yet i may not be too familiar with the lore of dune but the narrative is pretty interesting as some of the concepts new characters and themes explored are pretty good including a great soundtrack uses of dialogue and structures throughout the only complaint i had was that there were a few pacing moments that could have improved 

overall dune part two is a great continuation of the first film and villeneuve has proven to be one of the best filmmakers we have right now 

910",2024-03-01 03:03:10
"i kind of love what they do with chani here  like she was fine in the book  but i just think this was a much more intriguing way to take her

and zendaya is really good as well",2024-03-01 06:41:43
"i feel like i’m living through another star wars lord of the rings phenomenon we are going to see a generation of people with this series as their de facto sci fi experience

absolutely incredible",2024-03-04 11:28:27
"loved the movie all the great things that everybody talks about i agree with 


i had 2 main problems with it 


stilgar being a comic relief i hated it so much i understand them trying to make it more approachable but flanderizing such a badass character was not it  


christopher walken was miscast i havent read the books but even if you want to portray the emperor as a pathetic wimp you still have to give him something he had no pulse going for him did not feel at all like the mighty and treacherous emperor i had imagined someone like varys or littlefinger would have fit much better ",2024-03-05 07:53:59
better than the first for sure i fell asleep during certain parts timothee and zendeya have zero chemistry,2024-03-01 03:03:13
reminded me a lot of the zack snyder movies  not exactly my favorite type of movie but i respect the art and talent requires for it  hope they get to make more,2024-03-01 05:15:19
i honestly had no idea what was happening 80 of the time,2024-03-03 03:41:21
"liked it a lot but there were some problems

feyd seemed to have no point other than being a 5minute foil for paul with a 20 minute buildup with a sterile miniversion of gladiator inserted weve also seen paul win one knife fight so we get to see him win one more after its been established that feyd fought for sport in arranged matches and probably couldnt have won over an average fremen fighter

i havent read the book so my moviemind would have merged rabban and feyd into one character that gurney could have ended satisfyingly cutting out feyd would have made the movie 2025 minutes shorter without affecting the plot and some other stuff could have gone in

rabbans end was anticlimactic i understand the characters are apparently fairly faithful to the book but both of them seemed to be used wrong

i didnt expect stilgar to be funny and that watered down his character a lot imho",2024-03-01 03:31:15
"man i knew the movie would be hyped to death but scrolling through the early thread and only finding 1 post even mentioning the horrible pacingjumps that clearly felt like big moments are missing people seem blinded by the spectacle

that said it was a wonderful cinematic experience with great acting and world building dont get me wrong awesome achievement

but storywise it really fell short of my expectations and clearly has problems lots of stuff i was eager to learn about their relationship with the worms how they use them in battle was not there at all other stuff just happened randomly  without any deeper explanation the grandfather reveal the spie getting burned why df there was a sandworm behind paul when entering the south caves the sudden tzrnarounds of ghanjis char supportive of paul even when he mentions the dangers of going south then instant  after one thing she doesnt like etc even the final battle felt kinds rushed like the third act has rotk style several endings and acts 

shouldve been three films for the first book imo and it woulde been a masterpiece pacing and weird time jumps was also my biggest gripe with the 1st one",2024-03-01 07:48:22
most overrated movie i seen this year but good enough,2024-03-02 09:26:56
"i loved the first movie one of the best in recent years this one…look i enjoyed it and visually it was incredible 

but it felt a bit hollow and many of the storyline beats seemed silly paul over and over again fulfilling prophecies to the sounds of epic hans zimmer music and chanting…they did that over and over again the final 20 minutes was ridiculous the emperor inexplicably landing with all his troops just chilling on the desert and being wiped out…just silly the music and visuals alone put it above most movies but the storyline really held it back",2024-03-02 09:37:18
literally no one talking about zendaya honestly her portrayal of chani didnt have an impact and she had a lot more screentime and more to work with than some of the other actors i didnt feel the strong emotional connection between chani and paul like the actors dont have enough chemistry,2024-03-06 01:43:52
"there were many things to like about the film but it contained way more fan service than the first without geeking out about it there are also things that the lynch version did much better even in terms of what to include i dont understand for instance why villenueve of whom im a huge fan in general chose to simply exclude any mention of weirding beyond the single phrase weirding woman paul instructing the fremen etc

its also a bit about unnecessary bloat in recent years corporate interests have affected franchise movies to such an extent that in a fairly short childrens tale like the hobbit entire subplots are made out of whole cloth to inflate runtime an elfdwarf love story a dumb rivalry between an orc and thorin oakenshield the barrel fight scene i could of course go on here as one of many examples we had one of those stuffedin moments when the clumsy foreshadowing of gurney hallecks mention of his familys  at the hands of rabban was followed predictably by his killing of rabban forgetting to even mention his family 

while the focus on feyd rautha was fun and interesting and visually the designers and director did a good job of consistently making the entire harkkonen culture creepy and revolting paul atreides by the final conflict should not have had such trouble killing him between bene gesserit speed and control plus foresight this is another thing lynch did betterone simply cannot compare the battle in the current movie with the moment when paul speaks the killing word breaking feyds body and the rock under him almost nonchalantly followed by the epic murmur from stilgar muaddib and going by the novels feyd would be expected to have fighting prowess beyond limits today without going deeply into it there were swordsmen in the preceding war with the robots called the butlerian jihad which could move faster than machines ie could move faster than modern humans do today and as the bene gesserit do and feyd as the scion of a major house would have every possible advantage coached and built into him

thus the final oneonone fight which so many seem to have found enthralling should have been more of feyd moving beyond current human limits of speed and finesse and paul younger slighter and less well trained countering with his halfformed bene gesserit movement skills plus his kwizatz haderach abilities the first movies death match was superior where pauls coached fighting skills and bene gesserit abilities were barely enough to keep him alive until his foresight pushed him over the edge thats the essence of a comingofagegoldenchild story in this context

where the first movie was pretty much artful in every way this movie in general was dumbeddown full of more careless errors and written to hammer away at personal moments like chanis discontent theres no reason for the change in approach and it weakened the story dune in book form was already one of the most compelling stories ever written i wish the director had used the same ethic throughout both movies but it feels like he must have compromised with corporate interests for the second the same high standards from the first movie could have been observed while delivering all the definitely gorgeous eye candy of the second

there were many things to like about the film especially as an exercise in worldbuilding i just was hoping itd be as excellent as the first its not bad just a bit strange as an effort from someone so consistently delicately thoughtful",2024-03-02 18:11:34
"i don‘t know what to think i absolutely loved the first part and watched it three times in cinemas… this one i didn‘t even want to watch again 

everything felt kind of unfinished for me 
the ending was the best part and the middle seemed rushed in the sense that soo much was happening and i felt like it was just stacked on top of each other 
especially the part where he finally has his resurrection moment and „oh yeah her tears will wake him up“ and it was just too much for me

great acting from every actor and actress but there wasn‘t any type of fascination i had with the first part present 

i watched the movie in dbox seats and every action part was very nice especially the worm riding",2024-03-01 07:26:40
"i liked it but have mixed feelings i felt that paul and lady jessica were not portrayed too well or at least their motivations were not as clear paul goes from being adamant about staying north to suddenly drinking the water and embracing his ascension in the book his thoughts and inner struggles make him feel like its what he must do and to me is a tragedy but the movie makes him seem to relish in his new power rather than seeing it as a curse when paul tells jessica thats not hope that was the paul i knew from the book


as for jessica her actions are portrayed as insidious like shes some kind of villain but she was just doing what she had to do to keep paul safe although chani asking how she could do this to her son was spot on


i guess the common thread is that i didnt feel the hesitance and strong desire to fight against what they had to do rather they succumb to it rather quickly but it is a long story and i understand that there must be a lot of thoughts and motivations on the cutting floor theres also the problem of how to portray the visions and timelines in film since its a bit confusing and flowing in the book seems their answer was to just not try and just have nightmares


i have to admit i thought the movie dragged a couple times but it went by surprisingly fast anyway


what i liked were the changes to the ending reading the book it was so unsatisfying for paul not to be the one that kills the baron so happy to see that change interesting that alia isnt born yet maybe i need to reread the book but i thought the houses accepted his ascension to the throne or am i misremembering am i also misremembering stilgar as not being such a fanatic


all in all a good movie but i hate the way the characters were portrayed in order to move the story along quicker its definitely given me more appreciation of the book and the time it spends on characters",2024-03-01 09:54:22
chalamets so good in the last act of this felt like a real messianic figure when he converts the southern fremen hes given some good performances in the past but this was the first time he felt like a true movie star,2024-03-01 19:32:15
"might get downvoted into worm territory considering the general reception but i’ll offer two things i didn’t like

1 the edit of paul traveling south and drinking the blue water felt really jarring i didn’t understand how he got from riding a sandworm with a group to arriving on foot alone also unclear why chani arrived so much later in an ornithopter my sense of travel times and travel companions were thrown off for a good couple of minutes

2 as much as the film was marketed as a war movie and delivered on some fronts i still wanted more i would have loved a 30 minute sequence showing waves of fremen and imperial forces clashing with each other gaining and losing the high ground seeing war tactics play out successfully and unsuccessfully maybe some of the enemies finding a way to take down a worm etc pretty much what return of the king did here it felt like paul’s team got the upper hand and rolled over everyone within 10 minutes i know the film’s making a point that desert power is overwhelming and severely underestimated by enemy forces but i just wanted a longer battle",2024-03-01 22:50:42

so i liked this movie but not nearly as much as the first one i think the mixture of hans zimmer’s score shaking the whole theater mixed with the gorgeous visuals entranced me like blade runner 2049 did it all seemed like it was leading up to something far more epic than this it seems like this movie is rushing and i didn’t feel that with the first one paul speedruns his way to becoming the fremen leader and prophet and before i knew it he was killing the baron casually and bringing the leader of the entire known universe to his knees this should feel more huge than it did i think a lot of it has to do with the fact that timothy chalamet doesn’t emote much and when he does i usually don’t know if he is sad upset excited etc he looks good for the part and was clearly chosen for his looks more than his skill like most of the actors in this movie  i also noticed when i rewatched blade runner 2049 that gosling doesn’t emote much even when he is supposed to be emotional i really think the aesthetic and the soundtrack carried the film i want to say the same thing happened with dune part 1 with dune part 2 there had to be a lot of stuff happening and it hindered villanues usual style maybe this is all a hot take as i just saw it but yeah kind of disappointed,2024-03-03 00:28:47

"
please reply and tell me your thoughts as i really want to discuss this

note i have not read the books i am a huge fan of denis villeneuve and scifi

negatives
 first 15 acts appeared quite slow
 third act very rushed and ended abruptly
 dialogue very quite
 hardly no memorable lines opposed to first film theyre brutal
 characters besides paul seemed wooden and pointless 
 for example i thought austin butler’s character would play more of a role in the films by the way they were talking about him but basically died semi off screen
 hans zimmer score more of the same nothing revolutionary and the score was absent in a lot of the film i wish jóhann jóhannsson was alive to produce the score instead but oh well
 christopher walken very out of place and overall underwhelming
 gravitas and scale of the universe and the empire appeared small
 character motives and decisions weren’t explained and seemed confusing   but i chalk that up to the book being told potentially in internal monologues that are hard to translate to film maybe
 zendaya’s character in the third act

positives 
 chalamet’s performance was absolutely phenomenal and carried the film
 the rise of paul and his speech in the south along with his new authority as he rises to emperor
 the huge wide cgi shots of the dessert were impressive
 the sound design of the machinery 
 the artistic design and creativity of the harkonnen planet 
 javier bardem 

overall 7

first movie 85

i feel as though this is a film where you may benefit from reading the books first i strongly believe that this isn’t always the case but i think it applies here",2024-03-02 04:09:36
"i may be going against the flow here but i didnt enjoy the movie 

i am a fan of the books part 1 stuck true to the book and as a fan i really appreciated that and i was so excited to see part 2

the first half was amazing but there are some changes they made that just seemed crazy to me and really took me out of the movie

these may be things i am missremembering but after talking about it with my wife who has never read the books she had some of the same conclusions 

pauls crossing of the desert to make him a man was not an achievement worthy of him becoming a fremem his riding of the worm was and why they didnt have that celebration scene after he rode the worm instead of crossing the desert with chani i do not know 

the harkonans having their meeting in a bason rather than the city seemed like a crazy choice just so they could have the scene where the army ride in on sand worms 

the meeting with the emporor in the books was so much more civil there was an explanation of how to avoid war paul requires being married into the family and being declared emporor how it was handled in the film was like watching someone slice a cake with a hammer 

creating the rift in the fremem between the north and south felt  changing chani from being pauls loving supporter to being his biggest critic was heartbreaking cutting down on the timespan ment we missed out on seeing how much of an abomination pauls sister actually is  

paul doesnt get his son with chani 


it made the second half of the movie feel disjointed and rushed and as someone who read the book and loved the first film i felt pained watching the second 

yes visually it was spectacular the acting was amazing but the story felt like it had been changed for the worse as one of my personal biggest greviences the changes seemed to be in favour of visuals over the story like how in game of thrones they inserted a zombie polar bear and used loads of their budget removing some better scenes 

i understand that so much is being changed to make this book more suitable as a movie that was the reason for some of the changes such as chani being the voice of reason over paul himself but i dont like how it was done and i feel like it could have been better 

all in all its worth a watch but it doesnt come close to how good the first film was in my eyes",2024-03-03 08:47:48
this is the kinda movie you have to watch on a big screen the scope was unbelievable the sound was like hitting me in the chest,2024-03-01 04:02:01
"oh it was fantastic everything i had hoped and more it built on the foundation that part one laid out and masterfully so it’s gonna be fun to watch both films back to back the pacing was quicker and not a dull moment i loved everything about it the soundtrack performances visuals the direction was just on another level 

best film of the year so far for me definitely different from the source material but in a unique way and i thought the ending was incredible yeah i do miss certain moments dialogue and whatnot but it’s a great adaptation i know denis has talked about making a third film and i certainly hope so there’s so much to explore in the dune universe and i’m all for it",2024-03-01 04:34:32
"“lead them to paradise”
holy 

absolutely mindmelting film i feel like i need to see it two more times to fully take it in every change from the book was inspired the action was inspired every frame is a work of art denis’ confidence in his vision is off the charts it’s like nothing i’ve ever seen the whole cast brought their agame and chalamet brought something way beyond that butler crushed it as feyd i don’t know how he made that character so repulsive and so captivating complimenting paul on his death blow was just chef’s kiss 

i love how the film was so overt about jessica being being a poison to the fremen the book only briefly touches on her influence the whole movie leans way more into the dark aspect of this story than the first book even does people who haven’t read the book are going to have their world rocked 

a genuinely legendary film bring on messiah",2024-03-01 04:59:17

"just saw it tonight with a friend and holy  was this an awesome movie i love the absolute world building in these two movies i want to know more and see the other houses  how this world interacts with each other geidi prime was incredible in infrared and so alienlike like a black sun   i feel like i would go to war for paul atredis he definitely has that power and charisma chalamet was great the incredible scale of things two you know things are massive and when you see them blow up it is jaw dropping i have one stickler the final battledoes it not seem a little shortlike we missed 1015 mins of it   
the battle plans were laid the initial worm assault and artillery barrage and freman jumping up was great on a giant open sand plain then we get into the inside the throne room with the emperor and his capture after that we jump right to arakeen and its demise and siege and its over it just seems like we should have more fighting with the saddurkar the emperor brought his whole army were are arakeens defences  
its not a downside to anything i still thoroughly enjoyed this and part 1 1010 for me  
also the voices at the start of the movies talking about power and spive who or what is speaking it i dont think we hear it anywhere else in the movies",2024-03-02 05:10:01
"so didn’t read the book and really enjoyed the first movie but i can’t be the only one who felt like paul got really op really fast right

my only criticism is that it seems dumb that the emporer would land on arrakis when it was obvious that he was walking into an ambush also theres no explanation as to how paul delivers a scroll with his duke seal to the emporer on another planet in what seems like a day and why the great houses would even consider making the trip out there at the request of a fallen house,2024-03-02 19:25:12
"i cant lie i preferred the first one

dont get me wrong it looks fantastic and chalamet bardem and butler are great in it

but i thought it kinda dragged in the middle portion florence pugh was given nothing to do except being in stunning fits and recording her video diary and i thought the ending was rather anticlimactic

also reading the changes they made from the book tbh ive never read it im not sure how i feel about the timeline being condensed by that much i also feel that the reason for paul going to the dark side seeming to be unable to resist the temptation was lesser than the original reason which was his and chanis kid dying 

overall id give it 355 i gave the first one 45",2024-03-02 19:52:05

"absolute masterpiece i actually liked how chani’s character was evolved to serve as a foil for paul’s growing cult of personality

the scene on geidi prime was enthralling and visceral and the desert ambushes by the fremen were top notch action scenes 

the only thing i enjoyed more than the visuals was the audio the music sounds and especially the recurring chant motif were sublime

might legitimately be a 1010 viewing experience in the theatre",2024-03-03 07:29:00

"really great movie i liked it a lot more than part 1 although it of course gives part 1 more meaning now


anyway i havent readthe book and have some questions


1 lisan al gaib is a creation of the bene gesserit through hundreds of years of planning correct so although some religious fanatics follow paul blindly he is indeed the chosen one right


and is kwaisatz haderach essentially the same thing as lisan al gaib


2 we see what i assume is pauls sister walking to the ocean on what i presume is arrakis in a vision what is this about do the fremen not know the ocean is there does she discover it


3 paul tells stilgar that arrakis will become paradise he is lying right


4 what makes paul go ahead south after drinking the blur stuff he still sees horror but sees himself leading as being a better future than him not leading


5 how does the final fight with feyd rautha compare with how is goes does in the book i was a little disappointed paul didnt dispose of him more easily also stilgar saying lisab al gaib immediately after winning the fight was a little too comical for the moment lol",2024-03-03 08:08:49
"i really liked how part 2 deepened rabbans character  
  
in the first one he was a fearless monster who didnt take  from no one but here he ran from the fremen could barely hold his own weight hanging from the ornithopter and was afraid and humiliated multiple times   
  
he was a good fighter but deep down he just seemed like a spoiled child throwing tantrums at the giedi prime personnel who couldnt really fight back",2024-03-03 09:34:16
this has probably already been mentioned but hans zimmer has made the most beautiful score i have ever heard in a very long time the love theme and its variations throughout the film is breathtakingly beautiful it gave me chills and enhanced the love story beautifully,2024-03-04 06:10:57

i really enjoyed my time both the visuals and the sound design were amazing that being said both this movie and the first one felt simultaneously too dragged out and too compressed at the same time some scenes went on for too long and it felt like 80 of the plot happened in the last 20 of the movie while watching it i was actually anxious that it would end too soon and we would get the wrap up in the third one also i think most changes from the source material served the story well,2024-03-08 22:03:30
can anyone tell me where zendaya got that ornithopter when she was rushing to see paul after he drank the waters like i felt like i missed a scene or something they traveled all the way south on worms and then all of a sudden bam theres an ornithopter,2024-03-09 07:17:44
truly a 1010 at least a 9510 everything was well edited not a single scene felt bloated this honestly might be my favorite sci fi movie ever after the thing  star wars dont get me wrong i like empire and new hope and aspects of the others dune has set a new threshold cinematicaly,2024-03-10 04:01:23
hot take af but i think feyd shouldve killed a freman now it makes no sense in the books or scaling but neither does feyds threat when he was dealing with the atreides when the sardukar easily massacred them in the movie before i think more of feyds efficient attacks on the freman shouldve been more apparent  maybe in that same scene he attacks the sietch maybe theres one freman the harkonans have cornered but cant  could have them be tired but still mobile and have feyd be the one to  him so that duel at the end couldve had a bit more stake other than that i loved the movie,2024-03-11 11:18:24

just finished watching it for the second time what an incredible film,2024-03-20 03:49:02
"i liked both dune parts but i think what puts me off  is that i feel they both suffer from a lack of character development i just dont care enough about everyone involved in the story im not sure why  maybe its because the characters arent likeable or there is not enough interpersonal dialogue relating to the thoughts of the characters themselves instead of whats going on in the world around then it leads me to feel like in the third act of this movie i am watching an incredible visual spectacle but while im seeing all these major events occur i feel like i am admiring the cinematography and visuals more than that i actually care about what i am seeing

also more of a side tangent  i imagine a lot of the technical details are explained in the books but i kept on wondering how certain things in the world actually worked

 how did they get so many people on and off the sandworms because it seems like its really hard to get on it in the first place

 how come the flechettelike turret in the copter during one of the crawler attacks is not used everywhere else because it seemed to be pretty  effective against large groups of fremen or shieldless enemies

 in a similar vein what weapon were the fremen using to  the harkonnen from range during the intro battle when they are on top of the rock formation and why dont they use that more often",2024-03-27 01:53:36
"saw it today in imax 70mm and it looked  amazing but then so did the creator 

visually stunning but for a nigh on 3hour film there were a few characters that didn’t really do much i loved the baron was expecting so much after the first film he was an evil mastermind but not when he was climbing the stairs to the throne i was expecting him to be “tricked you suckers” nope 

the emperor and his daughter are barely in it same with margot i guess they’re going to have bigger parts in the next one but i said that about several parts of the first one feyd was a onedimensional bad guy but he was great villeneuve clearly loved that character because he made him and that whole black and white sequence cool as  but yeah stole the show for 25 minutes then he’s gone

i watched the first one last night in preparation so 5hours of an emo timothee chalamet wasn’t really my cup of tea but i’ll admit he was captivating when he went heel but again for such a long film it felt like large chunks of were cut out 

80 looked amazing i’m glad there was a finale this time and i’m looking forward to the conclusion i’m glad it brought so many people joy and awe but some of the reviews are well over the top",2024-03-01 06:46:21

"this is the lotr of our generation

"so people probably won’t see this but anyway here are my thoughts on the movie

first of all it was a good movie and one i am deffiently gonna rewatch many times and i have been looking forward to watching since i saw part 1 

but i have few things i will mention i feel wasn’t executed properly

first is the pacing the majority of the film i guess 2 hours are nice pacing and it goes into a lot of details but at some point the movie just speeds up to be eleven and tries to move the plot insnaly fast i think it’s when they get to the part where they finally decide to go south we see them ride worms and then next seen paul is drinking worm juice and chani arrive in a flyer and where did she get this  and how does she know how to fly it into paul waking up and convincing all fremen to follow him and boom they are assaulting emperor and considering the build up in the movie the entire battle goes way too fast and midway through battle they are also assaulting haarkenen and it’s all over in 5 min 

the movie is 2hr and 45 min and with the pacing i feel like they made a 4 hour film and realised it was to long in editing and had to  their darlings and decided all the action at the end was less important than the storyline which is fair but walking out of theater my
first thought was almost i hope they make an extended edition

my 2nd biggest problem or concern is the setup and pay off there are a few times in the movie when they set up different things that doesn’t follow through further along 
 the saudakaar are descrbibed as the best fighting force there is in d1 and we seem they getting moved down without any problem like if we take the final battle into account 1 fremen easy equals 10 saudakaar even the emperors personal which we presume are his best just vanishes in a cloud and never seen again 
 the freaking laser cannon we see the fremen use these laser cannons tearing through haarkenen patrols and air ships like it’s nothing and then we don’t see them used ever again such a powerful weapon and only use it in the beginning and it makes little sense in the first patrol scene where they are fighting under a spice crawler and paul needs to reload chani bazooka that they use the laser right after and blow it all open why even risk going into close quarter combat could have fixed it all from afar in 10 seconds 
 in same scene as above they put a lot of time into describing the energy shields and likewise in d1 but here in d2 it feels like they aren’t relevant outside that one scene with chani and the bqzooka 
in the finale battle we see multiple flyers getting shot down by single shot and we also see gurney move down harkkenen soldiers one by one and shields don’t seem to matter and i am mentioning these example because we see the shield cgi effect but it’s just there no real protection 

i might seem like i have a lot of criticism but it is because i like the movie a lot that i noticed these few things and i feel those problems don’t live up to the rest of the movie the shots the actors the story everything else top notch entire experience 810 on a good day",2024-03-02 04:59:25

the emperor was a massive disappointment imo he was hyped up as some dangerous villain in the first part didnt do much besides looking confused and kissing chalamets hand,2024-03-01 11:19:24

"surprised this is getting so much love maybe i just needed to see the first one again but the plotting and pacing felt so off  i really had a hard time following the plot and the payoff in the third act just wasn’t there with how rushed it was   

they really set up such a a great villain in austin buttler although the harkenens just randomly killing their minions constantly was cartoonishly bad directing  it had 0 impact by like the 5th time it happened weirdly amateurish well for denis to keep visiting   with the homoeroticism and mommy issues but then really did nothing with him

this absolutely needed to be 2 movies  one with paul coming into his own as a disciple of the dessert and a second with paul’s turn to delusion out of desperation to save people

the emperor falling for the world’s dumbest trap was…insane why was your daughter and whole army or even you there  really sloppy writing where character motivations went out the door 

i think zendaya is one of the generations best talents but my  she is so miscast in this  why is she the only one in her tribe that has no accent she doesn’t have the gravitas here

best part of these movies remains rebecca ferg and the whole concept of nuns pulling all these strings",2024-03-09 09:08:54

waiting two years to see batista vs brolin and…………welp,2024-03-01 08:15:53
"i liked it but its a step down compared to the 1st one imo

pacing was weird with some scenes taking a lot of time like paul  chani flirting in the desert while others interesting ones were just skipped like paul arriving into the south and the fight scenes had the build to be satisfying but were mostly underwhelming like a badly directed paul vs feyd rautha just look at the numbers of people asking what happened in this thread or the harkonnen getting obliterated using 0 strategy going into a fight with no visibility under batista

the weapon physics also have to be explained because its weird how they can use lasers to destroy harvesters but not infantry  and infantry never shoot at fremen but i dont think they have any shield 

it was cool seeing the bene gesserit playing all sides and having a better understanding of the emperor strategy or how clueless he was",2024-03-01 21:00:34

iv recently read dune book and seeing it on screen is now one of my life’s pleasures 

genuine awe",2024-03-03 05:35:34
"i cant believe how much i loved it i cant put it into words when it finished i immediately went to the box office and bought a ticket to see it again immediately in imax

im not ready to declare it lotrlevel yet which i honestly never thought id live to see the day but this is as close as you can get i still cant stop thinking about it and have goosebumps holy ",2024-03-03 08:01:08

"this is what a 200m dollar movie should look like it is one of the most impressive films i have seen it is a director given freedom and a budget with a cast and crew bringing their a game and given the time to do it right see it on imax its just impressive 

i am not saying it is a perfect movie or that there is a formula for a hit movie but when you see things like blade runner 2049 oppenheimer barbie mad max fury road the last jedi i dont care if you hate it keep it to yourself and dune and you see what real movies look like compared to so much of the mcu dceu jurassic park and fast and furious type movies that seem more concerned with hitting a target date than doing it right   

movies are not an assembly line this movie makes most blockbusters look like  despite the same budget the cast was great the visuals were amazing if i am complaining it would be that i wish it didnt end as another to be continued really wish hollywood would stop doing that looking at you fast x mission impossible dead reckoning across the spiderverse",2024-03-01 03:17:48
ok…so this was an epic film but i left feeling disappointed  alia wasn’t even born by the end of the movie so that means everything happened in a matter of months and not years paul and chani didn’t have kids so his first born that was killed never even existed in the movie and finally i just didn’t like chani’s character turn of her always in her feelings and angry at paul for half of the movie she was his rock in the book…  but alas it was still entertaining from a “movie” perspective oh and they made stilgar a religious fanatic,2024-03-01 12:39:58
zendaya at the end really said im outta here,2024-03-01 14:41:59
the almost 3 hour runtime went by comfortably with good pacing unfortunately the experience will forever be tainted by a woman there was a couple behind who were talking throughout so when the credits rolled i told them they were talking too much during the movie the man apologised but the lady immediately went into a rant at me,2024-03-02 11:53:07
dope visuals and even doper sound but a little disappointing on the script side i didnt care about any of the characters so neither the grand space opera politics nor the fremens struggle for freedom nor anything going on with paul or his mom did much to move me and the villains  i mean feyd looked  awesome and the harkonnen homeworld was very cool but sheesh none of the bad guys even put up a fight like every time theres a faceoff the bad guys just get steamrolled so hard it hardly even feels good to watch them lose and back to feyd  the movie doesnt sell the idea the hes a good fighter all we see him do is  two drugged guys and one nondrugged guys and were told by the film that he usually only fights drugged guys so like is he actually any good all that is to say that it didnt feel like a satisfying payoff to see the bad guys defeated and even if thats supposed to be intentional it remains unsatisfying the narrow way to victory is evidently with nukes and giant sand worms,2024-03-04 00:57:15
thought it was slow at times   visually great  austin butler was the real deal and def florence pugh crush a lot  i preferred part 1 but it was ok,2024-03-01 03:18:36
i didnt like it as much well shot but the plot is weak i guess im not a fan of the source material,2024-03-01 17:09:49
"chani being  was strange jessica talking to a baby was weird like shes possessed i didnt like that she just changes personality completely paul changes as well with the wol but in the books the water doesnt necessarily make you evil but only opens the door to perception therefore the choices you make might seems evil he still has a soul but the movie kind of suggests the water takes your soul you heart as the emperor puts it as describing leto 
the fanaticism was overplayed as well i think possibly because they didnt want to dive into the depths of what it means to have a true jihad its described in the book as a race consciousness where humanity is collectively acting to destroy and rebuild itself paul in the source material always aims to eventually lead the fremen and overthrow the oppressors because he cares for them only hoping he can avoid the jihad here he seems to be reluctant to do it in the first place somewhat hoping for a stalement or somesuch i felt the motivation was simplistic linled to the previous wol sudden personality change 
the film kind of skimps on the intricacies of characters and their journeys instead being quite hamfisted using big skmetimes clumsy narrative levers to enact swift attitude transformation 


i liked a lot of it but much of it felt quite oddly paced and focused perhaps my mind is too full of the book to appreciate the story they present coupled with the fact that i already know whats going to happen i dont know  but i knew the lord of the rings story before i watched it and still enjoyed it immensely i think the narrative simplicity of this film which also emphasises style over substance leaves it quite scarce for the person who already knows the plot  ",2024-03-02 02:27:22
"i was disappointed i find it too jarring to have chalamet and zendaya as the stars way too much time was spent on his acceptance and the details of fremen society i found the climax to be really rewarding and enjoyed that the most but it did feel a bit rushed 

austin butlers voice was great sounded just like his uncle

there were some plot points and lines that were a bit much this is for my duke and my friends old fashioned artillery genius   


i felt like the concept of the chosen one was just echoed too much a large portion of the film was people cheering or kneeling   


visually stunning the scenes in the harkonnen homeland were amazing   


i think i would have enjoyed it more if we spent more time with the harkonnens or the emperor he didnt really have the commanding presence you would think ruler of the universe would have",2024-03-02 05:27:59
"its still good but i felt by and large that the changes from the novel weakened the story there are a couple that i understand given the medium and box office hopes not having toddler alia out there acting like an adult stripping out paul and chanis murdered child side plot but there were others that didnt work andor were downright unforgivable

1 by far the worst ommission was the complete absence of the spacing guild they are one of the three pillars of power in the universe and arguably the most influential in the climax of the book the lynchpin of pauls leverage is his ability to destroy the spice and the guild in particular are the most invested in its safety his threats pull the guild in line and that forces everyone else to acquiesce as well because otherwise the guild will leave everyone marooned on arrakis without them the political aspect of the climax feels very derivative and plain

2 in theory chanis resistance is a good idea but the execution was very forced shes literally the only fremen who doesnt get caught up in the messiah prophecy and we get zero insight into why she is the exception  not even a reference to her mother being an agent of the imperium to explain why she might have a different perspective i get why the filmmakers wanted her to have more agency but its not what the story demanded and they didnt add in enough backstory to effectively execute the change

3 the choreography of the final fight with feyd was excellent but plot wise it again felt forced paul is one of the best fighters in the known universe trained by the best of the best of three of the four elite fighting forces the atreides the bene gesserit and the fremen feydrautha is a strong fighter but not shown to be quite at pauls level even in the movie he struggles against a simple atreides captive him having the edge on paul doesnt make sense the fight in the book worked because even though paul is the superior fighter his reticence of feyds underhandedness levels the playing field feyd not doing anything underhanded in the fight eliminates this and its also completely out of character for him",2024-03-03 16:26:53
it deserves all the praise it is going to get but i was a bit disappointed that denis seems mostly uninterested in the interesting ecology and the relationship between the worms and the spice just going with atomics at the end to threaten the spice is boring and kinda betrays the idea of using desert power and knowledge of the land to win,2024-03-01 03:29:55
timottee has beaten the fraud allegations hes a talented actor,2024-03-02 15:05:27
still prefer dune 1984 at the end of the day  whos with me,2024-03-02 21:44:02
"i wish feydrautha was more development as a complete psycho that they showed just how deprived he was he kinda felt flat

i wish rabban had put up more of a fight shown him as an absolute tank looks like he was all bark and no bite

i wish the movie had a little more tempo it wasn’t boring far from it but it feels like there was to much absolutely beautiful filler

with that said

maybe the most beautiful movie i’ve ever seen every frame is a painting

awesome casting besides austin butler i can’t stand him

im sure the movie will grow on me with future viewings but it’s already very high on my most like’s movies list

many badass moments paul fully embracring being lisanalgaib and give that speech at the end was awesome

great movie",2024-03-01 08:10:46
"the first half felt pretty solid but i think the movie would have seriously benefitted from chani actually having leto ii and by proxy less screen time only because chani isnt all that interesting of a character and didnt need like 5 different shots showing her feeling skeptical about paul  the final shot of the film felt like she was planning to turn on him or something just a really bizarre choice  it felt like something you would show at the end of a season cliffhanger of a tv show and not the final shot at the end of a movie thats supposed to cap off a book

i thought most of the movie was pretty good but alia not being in it was the one real spot where they lost me and ruined the ending and my favorite parts from the book definitely could have used some of of the spacing guild and playing up the metaphysical side of the navigators  rabban and the barons deaths felt so underwhelming and rushed after all that buildup next to no payoff  introducing feyd that late was also a mistake i think he needed more time overall to cook instead of devoting a huge chunk of the movie just to him  

the visuals sound and acting for the most part where very good but im sorry christopher walken was a terrible choice and has zero range the dude feels like the same character in everything  he hardly had any lines though thankfully so it minimized some of it but just felt really weird it came off like his character was barely involved  overall its not a bad movie but it kind of misses the vibe i was hoping they would hit  if you havent read the books you will probably like the movie but it ends up losing the things that made the book stand out in the first place and ends up feeling like more of just a standard actionrevenge movie",2024-03-02 18:08:36
"obviously incredible cinematography wow 

not a perfect movie but definitely one of the most incredible cinema experiences i have ever had 

huge improvement for me over the first movie 

i do think it was a tad convenient  at times with some of the decisions of the characters and i’m not sold on zendaya and chalamets chemistry but i didn’t find the issues distracting",2024-03-01 04:15:13
"i am blown the  away this is my favorite book of alltime like many other people and i just feel so grateful to get such an incredible adaptation of this book i think this movie is perfect

so incredibly impressed with all of the performances especially chalamet ferguson and butler feydrautha is one of the most terrifying villains i’ve seen in a long time the sandworm ride was  amazing the scenes on geidi prime were mesmerizing the sound design and score was  incredible

denis villenueve is the director of this era what a  success i cannot wait for dune messiah to be adapted",2024-03-01 05:02:01
"it was funnier than i expected  in a good way 

also built up the themes of religious conflict and skepticism to a greater degree than i think even the book did  certainly it builds up the character of chani and makes her much more interesting zendayas performance helps 

i actually support most of the changes they made from the book they dropped things that didnt work there and other things that wouldnt have worked that well on screen i wont give those away  but good on villeneuve and spaihts for adapting the material and wisely

probably should see it again  i thought it dragged just a touch at times but i mightve been tired  but overall i was very much impressed bring on part three",2024-03-01 05:11:35
"i really liked it but my criticism from the first movie remains its impossible to tell how much time has passed but in this movie jessica never gives birth so we know its less than 9 months unless bene gesserit has longer pregnancies for some reason

but in the first movie the amount of time between atreides landing on arrakis and then get destroyed could be a year or two days no one knows",2024-03-01 07:30:32
"if this movie doesnt deserve a 1010 i dont know what perfect scores are reserved for

the cinematography the music the stunning moments the characters arrakis lives and breathes here the action is engaging and compelling and believable the fallout from pivotal decisions ripples through the narrative the transposition of an impossibly dense novel onto the big screen in a tangible thematically accurate and emotional forman impossible task but done nigh flawlessly

i honestly cant think of another science fiction film in recent memory that captures what villaneuve has done here im tempted to go see it in theaters a second time and i almost never watch movies in theaters at all",2024-03-01 07:47:53
"was it just me or did some scenes feel truncated or skipped

like paul was tasked to survive in the desert had a single scene with chani and then the very next scene he was under the sand ambushing with the rest of the fremen warriors

or when glossu started bombing the fremens cave system all of a sudden

or when paul went from riding a giant worm outside to walking up to the baron

dont get me wrong i still think this movie is easily a masterpiece but i was surprised how often i was losing track of where characters were in the edit when that wasnt a problem in the first one

maybe im just ",2024-03-01 08:05:59
looking back its actually kind of crazy that modern hollywood was able to create a truly worth adaptation of the cornerstone of modern scifi,2024-03-01 10:34:54
the feeling where part of you still wants to internally cheer when you see the atreides flag atop the worms when you fully know this is actually everything going very very bad and chani should have stabbed paul the first time they met,2024-03-01 10:39:15
"may thy knife chip and shatter

no may thy knife chip and  killed me 

also i love how paul has picked up and learned from his experiences he did the before the fight rituals of duncan idaho heart and head point while doing jamiss dialogue and the double heart thump",2024-03-01 11:25:49
knocked my fkn socks off,2024-03-01 14:48:17
this movie has some of the best costuming i have ever seen especially irulan,2024-03-01 15:22:51
not only are the visuals amazing but the sound design and mixing are genuinely jaw dropping,2024-03-01 15:26:29
a bit loud really i did feel it in my chest but i personally like when movies make you feel anxious because you care about what’s happening rather than loud music or the ridiculous thump of every hand slap good movie just too loud,2024-03-02 04:55:29
moneooo bring me another duncan,2024-03-02 06:17:59
 miraculous masterpiece of a film wow,2024-03-02 07:36:29
 loved it the sandworms attacking sardaukar scene looked so badass in the trailer but here i couldnt even feel that way knowing how  up it was that they got manipulated into doing this over hundreds of years timeless movie and i hope denis concludes it to make it an all time trilogy,2024-03-02 13:02:35
absolute masterpiece some great moments in the film ruined by the trailer lost some impact,2024-03-02 15:12:41

that knife fight had me at the edge of my seat in that darkened cold imax theatre beautiful movie ,2024-03-02 18:19:15
the highest priase i can give this movie is that i checked the time about 2 hours in and i was really hoping that id misjudged and there was another 2 hours to go incredible,2024-03-02 19:36:54
"i love how this movie really leaned into some of the core themes of religion and prophecy in the books i was worried they were going to shy away from some of the weirder stuff and make it a less serious action flick instead of letting the work speak for itself it did have a few flaws in timelinelogic but its easy to gloss over given how great the overall story was 

i really hope they do messiah next",2024-03-02 20:59:49
what a film glorious from start to finish,2024-03-02 23:38:51
"id say im generally familiar with dune because its been around for so long plus my wife has read the books  i really enjoyed the first movie but this one really didnt grip me at all maybe it was my lack of expectations maybe im just not that into dune maybe im just not smart enough for the movie  i found giedi prime to be the highlight for me which doesnt surprise me as salusa secundus from part 1 was one of my favorite parts of the movie  

cinematography overall was stunning as expected

timothy and rebecca shone as their characters evolved it was great to see more josh brolin and javier bardem was a great supporting character

we saw it in imax and the sound was entirely too loud at points or dead quiet our ears are still ringing to our surprise",2024-03-03 01:15:17
"ok just got back from my second viewing i saw an advance screening on monday in imax and i saw it in imax 70mm today this film is a solid 9 out of 10 that definitely rewards rewatching absolutely incredible stuff in this one theres depth to the story and what its trying to portray theres internal conflict playing out in paul really well the visuals were wonderful again the sound was astonishing and there were a few really beautiful moments elevated by the score major book spoilers ahead couple nitpicks  
 chanis arc in this has changed from the book in some ways better and in some ways worse her being kind of the embodiment of pauls doubts and the naysayer definitely worked on screen one of the bigger challenges with adapting dune is replacing the internal monologues and exposition with events on screen that reveal that information theres a lot to reveal so creating that conflict was very convenient and was quite good for the most part three things that could have contributed to making her story deeper and more tragic that were left out were  
 there was no connection between her and dr liet kynes in the movie if they had kept kynes as chanis parent like in the book it would have given her and paul another way to connect dead parent huh yeah me too sucks right it also would give her more to fight for and more agency besides just fighting for her people  
 chani and paul not having a child and further not having that child killed i understand that the time has been compressed in the movie from a few years down to a few months so i get that it had to be cut just something that was a little jarring to me the first time watching this one it didnt bother me quite as much the second time  
 jessica not providing the final line of the book to chani when paul arranges his marriage to irulan think on it chani the princess will have the name yet shell live as less than a concubine  never to know a moment of tenderness from the man to whom shes bound while we chani we who carry the name of concubine  history will call us wives the fact that jessica wasnt married to leto and that chani isnt married to paul is a huge point and one of the central conflicts of the following books i wish they would have driven that point home on rewatch i can see how much they were driving a wedge between jessica and chani throughout the film especially after the water of life scene with chani so it makes sense why jessica wouldnt give that little bit of comfort to chani in the moment 


altogether what they did made sense narratively as a film but as an adaptation it kind of felt like they gave a lot more agency to jessica in these movies and took some away from chani jessica has for sure been a major highlight of these films so not taking anything away from her i would have liked to see a bit more done with chani though 


 christopher walken as the emperor is a little bit bumbling and his motivations are a bit unknown it just felt like he wasnt given a lot to do and you didnt really see the kind of frustration out of him that would have led him to take his family and his entire army to arrakis maybe the point they were trying to make was that he was just a  of the bene jesserit with irulan and the reverend mother being in his ear all the time that wasnt made very obvious though 
 and so if the emperor isnt the big bad villain of part two is it the baron or the beast rabban or the beautiful nabaron feydrautha or even the massive sardaukar army they dont really elevate the baron to levels beyond the first movie hes more like hedonismbot in this movie and the only thing that rabban gets to do is rage fail and die they kind of went all in on feyd who was admittedly magnificent as a presence onscreen but one thing that they didnt put into the movie which they already gave precedent for in part one was that paul was seeing his fights in his visions ahead of time but that paul had never once seen feyd in his visions so he couldnt predict what he would do it was like the bene gesserit were blocking his prescience as it related to feyd but we didnt get that only a kind of curious glance from paul when he killed the baron could have been an interesting bit of tension added to the final fight 
 some of pauls bigboyvoice line deliveries were a little bit weak for me with the addition of the voice it was fine but there were a couple that didnt land at times same with chani sometimes 


  no thufir thats unfortunate also the fact that gurney doesnt have his suspicions about jessica as the spy in the atreides house which could have really amped up the tension between him and the fremen if he tried to attack the reverend mother 
 my only effectsrelated complaint i have is about the crowd shots on geidi prime everybody pumping their fists simultaneously looked like early 2000s cgi and distracted me a couple times 
  the tradition of not recognizing leadership except through battle was only really touched on at the war council but in the book the heads of the tribes that swear allegiance have to come to him and fight him to the death in order for the tribes to come under pauls control a fact that he hates 


major kudos on how they handled alias inclusion in the movie that could have really been fumbled and could have sank the movie with audiences im really happy with the direction they took anyway i still loved it and hope that denis can make something good out of dune messiah i really didnt like the book but i will see anything that that man makes and hes done enough to build trust in his ability to adapt the material i honestly could have accepted this movie to be another 4060 minutes long",2024-03-03 03:36:09
"the movie is amazing but i have a lot of questions about the world presented as someone who isnt familiar with the books

 why again is spice so important to map the stars sure but once you have mapped a way to a new planet do you have to remap it every time it looked like they had mechanical wormholes to get from planet to planet so unless the fuel for that is spice which i dont think is how it works then idk what the point is

 and to that end how is paul gonna make dune a paradise while not giving up spice and thus crippling everyone i guess thats a big plot point for the next movie

 if the other houses arent going to listen to him anyway why still marry the emperors daughter surely that would clear that problem from the table and he can go back to chani while also then killing all the emperors people for betraying his father and is he not also the harkkonen next in line with the 3 leaders gone and him the grandson maybe there are others in line i guess but he has claim to at least two houses

 and to that end did all of the atreides go to dune why surely people were left behind on their homeworld at which point did harkonnen attack that planet too seems unfeasible the same amount of unfeasible as bringing all of your nations armaments to a foreign planet instead of leaving some nukes in your homeworld how the heck were they even launching the nukes why didnt they just nuke the emperors ship besides having the cool worm scene i guess so they could talk

 i remember in the old movie something about his name being a killword or something which would cement the idea of people thinking he is a  but in this movie he doesnt really use the voice the fanaticism of following him doesnt make sense to me considering that he seems to immediately throw away the initial wants of the fremen why the heck would they follow him offworld why the heck were they so quick to just raise this randomass flag theyve never seen before to represent them where did they even get all the flags was gurney op has a typo it says hurney storing them

i understand the point is to show how crazy fanaticism is but surely irl someone would hear what zendaya was saying and connect the dots that it doesnt really benefit the fremen to fight offworld especially when paul hadnt really done anything super godlike in the movie shown there are some throwaway lines about him predicting the weather and his parlor trick of knowing peoples past but all the bene gesserit seem to read people like that overall the movie was a better experience than the last one which was a bit slow but yea you really have to suspend your beliefs about human nature common sense and the practicality of what amounts to sand as a fuel source how the  did they even get to arrakis before they had discovered spice",2024-03-03 05:21:31
"absolutely incredible movie 

the only thing i don’t understand is paul deciding to go through with everything the entire first half of the movie he’s adamant that he doesn’t want to go south he doesn’t want war doesn’t want people to suffer i understand how he turned after drinking the water of life but what lost me was why he decided to drink the water in the first place",2024-03-04 01:24:32
from a movie making perspective it was terrific as someone who loves the books i thought part i was a better adaptation part ii was always going to be harder to adapt but there were changes i thought were unnecessary and poorly executed people say this sets up a part iii but given plot points that have been cut thus far i don’t see how adapting messiahchildren without further moving away from the books will make sense still phenomenal movie experience,2024-03-04 12:51:34
florence pugh was fantastic and her costumes were perfect,2024-03-04 16:57:11
why didnt rabban simply attack the sietches like feyd did that seems like such a simple solution that literally would have freed thd harkonen from the fremen unless they had a  messiah at that exact time did i miss something or is that never explained,2024-03-05 03:45:01
i kind of figured it wouldnt happen but i really wanted to see toddler aliyah running around stabbing people,2024-03-05 20:33:06
just saw it as a nonbook reader coming into the theater completely blind i thought that second act was turned up to fast forward in how fast the plot went coming home and reading the plot summary has helped in my understanding a little bit and i bet ill enjoy the movie more on rewatch than i did on first watch,2024-03-05 23:43:30
"i liked the movie a lot the pacing was a bit off at times but the cinematography was gorgeous and the large scale of practically the whole film was impressive 


florence pugh remains my favorite actress at the moment no notes austin butler deserves the hype hes getting he nailed the role the dune 1 main cast was really good but this felt like a film where all the big stars playing supporting roles helped a lot 


i watched all of the best picture contenders for this year in theaters and i honestly wonder how dune 2 wouldve shook up the awards austin butler couldve gained supporting actor momentum maybe they take the production or sound design awards just wouldve been a crazy packed year in some categories ",2024-03-06 17:43:55
"review

i always viewed dune as a terrible dry highconcept book that was used as a template for people who interpreted a better version out of it i appreciate it for iconic imagery worldbuilding and its attempt at subert the fantasy tropes but it had a terrible storytelling full stop star wars nausicaa a song of ice and fire pitch black the incal the matrix and even avatar yes that avatar all feel like fixed versions of dune

in that sense denis dune part two joins that club it is basically dune if it were good

maybe i wasnt fond of part one because it tried to be faithful to the source material i appreciate the movie as a vibe piece and the epic spectacle and vivid sensation sort of trick people into believing what they are watching is better than it really is

if judged it as a story its faithfulness to the book was poison it is a heros journey i know the sequel book says it isnt but judging the first one in isolation in which the heroes are bores and dont make choices it is messy and meandering it focuses on such a nothing character like paul instead of duke leto who should have been the protagonist it would be as if game of thrones season 1s protagonist was not ned but bran relies too heavily on prophecy ala the writer inserting his story notes through the fourth wall to contrive the characters into behaving the way they want which is a storytelling sin lucas and the wachowskis ripped this aspect off for their films and thats also what ruins their film

the desert adventure in the latter half is a complete tone shiftall the plot momentum dies the movie reboots itself again here into a different film having this journey in an already overstuffed movie also means the film cannot spare time to make these two characters suffer through the most oppressive climate imaginable i never felt that the planets heat was any danger to the characters 

part two diverges quote a lot from the latter half of the book in a way it fixes to make it an actual story it fixes most of my complaints with part one the plot is a lot more cohesive there is a clear goal from the beginning to the end and despite the slow pace it keeps the momentum going it tries to visualize what the book told the viewers arakkis actually feels dangerous rather than just telling us it is dangerous there are way more tensions and twist and turns alias presence is way more terrifying as a fetus than a ridiculous ninja baby

paul is an actual character with his own agency he actually gets to make his choices in contrast to the book paul who basically rode where the plot went chani also gets to be her own character and she actually has a chemistry now whereas in the book she is his girlfriend just because jessica is also very proactive instead of being reactive as she was in the book and her manipulations are downright terrifying villneuve channels his inner lynch in the bene gesserit scenes

it gives the cast characterization they were missing from the book and part one while containing all the books weirdness thematic implications and religious exploration at times i felt like i was watching some sort of biblical epic hollywood used to produce in the 50s those massive budget three hour long religious epics that transported the audience into the sights they couldnt experience elsewhere 

the story is still a lesser version of laurence of arabia some of the dialogues are hokey the love confession before the marriage was a pure cringe and i didnt buy chani would kiss paul at the first act the princess and her bene gesserit subplot feel more like a distraction from the main narrative i like how the syfy version handled the princess character more the heavy reliance of dream and foresight is still the narratives weakness because it is such a fake way of driving a story it seems no one but david lynch knows how to make it work

the nuke comes across as deus ex machina  it makes the climax too easy almost like the victory was handed to the fremens in one swipe rather than a gradual strategical agglomeration in the course of war they are capturing the literal emperor of space harder the goal is harder everything should be but you dont get that difficulty at all the imperial and hakonnen forces are all gathered here to protect the emperor but they didnt even try after the worms attack the next scene is paul arriving at the throne room its sloppy it doesnt feel like the fremens are outsmarting the villains but they won only because the villains were dumb

with all that said this is basically as good of an adaptation as this book can get there is simply no big budget movie like this anymore it puts the viewer into a different culture in a different universe i wasnt really mesmerized by the world part one presented but i was with the fremen culture in part two 

even what could have been a throwaway scene like feyd walking in a corridor with firecrackers shinning through the windows that scene alone had more thoughts put into it than an entirety of a marvel movie it takes time and does its best to teleport the audience into some kind of religious experienceliterally  it has the sensitivity of an indie film with an auteurs specific vision executed in a blockbuster resources and setpieces

810",2024-03-07 07:57:45
"this movie is still running through my mind i dont know how i will be able to work today

that said i thought they hit the religious manipulation angle a little too hard i was glad it was there since most adaptations dont really touch on it at all syfy dune miniseries

and i was also disappointed that alia wasnt in it both because i always enjoyed her messing with the reverend mother and killing the baron but also because i find it hard to believe that the atreides were wiped out paul finds the freman he is able to learn how to live the desert life and be accepted into their society lead a guerrilla campaign that it eventually brings the emperor to personally deal with the crisis and win the throne all inside of 9 month period thats a bit of a stretch for me",2024-03-07 14:50:43
"just saw it loved it i havent read the books so i am so excited to see where the story goes 

i have one burning question though how do they get off of the sandworms and getting jessicas little chariot onto the sandworm must have been a logistical nightmare",2024-03-07 16:51:09

austin butler was a real standout for me and while i’m  usually “neutral” on zendaya she was absolutely spectacular i thought,2024-03-01 04:01:21
"went to my 2nd viewing today twice in imax now the film remains a delicious audiovisual feast from start to finish so many jaw dropping images and sounds top notch cinematography and some of the best soundscapesvfx shots ive ever heardseen one of my alltime favourite theatre experiences


but in terms of storytelling and charactersits not bad but its not great either im afraid i had most of my issues with


 pauls transition from reluctant hero to messiah figureemperor was just so jarring to me it didnt feel particularly convincing or well executed i also dont know what to make of it it felt like setup for the next part so i dont know how to judge it yet could pay off hugely or not at all im hoping for the first


 the antagonists feydrautha and the emperor ive seen a lot of praise for austin butler comparing him to some of the greates villains in movie history which i didnt see at all it was by no means a bad performance he did quite well with what he was given but his role felt too familiar and to inconsequential to me to be up there with the greats i havent read the books but i feel like his character had so much potential in terms of being chaotic and unpredictable but that wasnt really explored all that much a lot of his threat came from other characters reacting to him or talking about him in a fearful or impressed way or him just murdering random servants every once in a while which got very boring very quickly the makeup also did a lot of the heavy lifting to make him look weird and  up on the exterior but on the interior he just felt soempty or generic i dunno the film spent a good chunk of the runtime to establish him as the main antagonist but he never lived up to it it was a solid performance but a flat forgettable character the conclusion of the final knife fight between him and paul also felt lazy and anticlimactic 


 christopher walkens emperor was just a whole lot of nothing i have no idea who this man is what he wants what he stands for we know nothing about him its a wasted role especially for such an iconic and esteemed actor as walken 


all in all these criticisms of storytelling and characters dont hold that much weight for me because as i said its not terribly bad the visual and the excellent pacing make up a lot for it plus part 3 could retroactively absolve some of these criticisms for me but for now these points are what hold me back from calling dune part two a masterpiece and what hold me back from fully jumping on the hype train",2024-03-03 19:15:51
"wow just came out from the theatres and my only regret is that i didn’t wait one more week to watch it in imax 

i sincerely thought overtaking oppenheimer as my favorite film would take decades but dune part 2 is a masterpiece i’ve always been a big fan of soundtracks to the point that my friends laughed at my taste in music in high school and yet again hans zimmer shows us again that he’s the goat combining his brilliance with the incorporating of the most beautiful instrument in the world duduk along with the dune franchise it doesn’t get any better really

i watched the first part in a large group of people out of 10 i was a big fan my brother didn’t hate it and the other didn’t like it two or three persons left the cinema “it was too slow pace and boring and weird” but my wife watched the first part yesterday for the first time and liked it very much but i’ve reflected on that “slow paced” term that i’ve seen a lot of people expressing regarding the first movie how you can barely scratch your balls before something else happens and it’s even faster paced in part two whereas i think it should’ve been 20 to 30 minutes longer",2024-03-05 23:21:58
"ive seen the movie twice now i think both part one and part two are pretty equal in terms of individual quality the first one has a strong start but slightly weak finish and the second one has a slightly weak start but super strong finish i believe if you were to watch these both backtoback it would make for one incredible sci fi movie

x200b

but lets not kid ourselves its not a masterpiece imo it doesnt quite land an emotional punch or have the same level of heart that some of the best of all time have but it is still incredible from a technical perspective i feel like denis pulled off the impossible of adapting this book into a movie that is accessible for everyone and does tell a legit fascinating story but at the end of the day its hard to call either of these movies best of all time maybe some of the best science fiction films of all time but again thats mainly due to the script acting and production design still very much impressed with both films individually id give part 1 an 810 and part 2 an 8510 but i think together seen as one they would be a 910 for me",2024-03-06 16:00:00
i honestly think as a 25 year old that this is going to be my generations empire strikes back holy  the only bad thing i can say is that it wasn’t longer tickets booked for viewing two already ,2024-03-01 23:01:34
"unpopular opinion im sure but i was very disappointed in the movie without writing an essay the movie felt very rushed and in many ways shallow it did not hit the same marks as the first one imo so many things happened in part two in such a quick succession that the movie didnt have time to look at any of the story elements at a deep level

it feels like the movie got marvelized it cashed in on the success of the first movie and depended on cheap stuff like admittedly impressive visuals 

currently im hoping that i will learn to enjoy it on second viewing when it comes out on bluray i  really wanted to enjoy the movie but im not really expecting that to happen",2024-03-26 16:41:01

"you could definitely see why the early reviews were raving butler and chalamet butler acted like an animal and you wouldve never guessed he played the charismatic elvis just one year earlier

chalamets paul was wonderfully tender in the first half but he definitely was able to deliver on the authoritarian and messianic aura in the second half after he awoken as the lisan algaib

the movie was surprisingly funny and the audience in my theatre got a bunch of laughs from javier bardems delivery and the dialogie from the southern religious fundamentalists

every piece of this movie doubled down from part one even my man hans—that score,2024-03-02 15:08:12
"its not widely known so i wanted to point out that feydrautha ritually kissing his uncle fits into the general ancient roman coding that their culture has going on what with colosseum fights slavery general blood thirst

the romans had a tradition called osculum kiss or ius osculi meaning right to a kiss whereby a male relative up to a certain degree had the right to greet a female relative with a chaste kiss on the lips this could have had a number of different functions including an assertion of dominance over the women in the family

i feel like the kiss in the movie could be a nod to that tradition because even if the participants were two men it served to underline a certain familial power dynamic

edit i just remembered something in the early roman empire there was a rumor that agrippina would often call upon this custom to kiss her uncle emperor claudius whom she later scandalously married

edit edit agrippina then made claudius adopt her own son who would become emperor nero you may remember him as the psycho emperor who set fire to his own city not true he definitely inspired the characterization of feydrautha",2024-03-03 00:30:28

movie only watcher what an insane experience every shot is so massive the riding the worm scene was so powerful the tension was palpable really liked it but i was kinda lost at the sudden change in pauls personality was it the water i did not get that part first time watching i rate it an 810,2024-03-13 05:37:17
"can’t tell if i liked it yet the first one had much more heart and character connectedness the first felt like it had the perfect cast and i feel like oscar isaac and jason momoa were sorely missed here austin butler was underused maybe this is the sequel where everyone loses their way a bit but i found myself not really attached to or liking anyone except zendaya which may have been the intention judging by the final scene it did a good job of making me want part three but i’m just not sure i enjoyed this like i did part one then again i enjoyed part one far more on second watch so i’m going to catch this again in imax next time 

also did we ever see the army from part one with the throat singer and the thousands of human sacrifices",2024-03-03 08:06:20
i liked it but felt annoyed with how little screentime there was to the actual plot moving forward of pauls holy war felt like a slog and by the time we get to the big ending battle its over in 5 minutes and just feels so underwhelming do we really need 40 minutes of wide angle shots and people silently staring at eachother or slow motion walking,2024-03-06 11:11:23
"part ii felt a bit weird to me but i may come around on a 2nd viewing happened with part i

many parts felt kinda wrong its been a while since i read the book but i dont think this is how pauls arc quite went and chanis reactions didnt seem quite right stilgar wasnt that silly i was really looking forward to alita doing her thing vs the baron and that was a nope where was the spacing guild

and im just never gonna be sold on villeneuves harkonnens

love timothee tho",2024-03-01 16:46:41
is this movie actually this good i remember people saying the first one was good but it was boring,2024-03-02 16:55:04
"overall its a great movie probably more enjoyable than part i but it seems so rushed despite the long runtime  like they just completely gloss over so much and the majority of the movie really is just people sitting in desert caves explaining the plot  somehow it works though  

it would have probably made a great tv series but then you probably wouldnt have the same budget cast and crew",2024-03-04 03:56:41
"started strong nice visuals eventually i got tired of so many locations just being absolutely massive structures with almost no decoration whether its on arrakis giedi primus or wherever 

i am really disappointed with all the deviations and omissions from the books tho wheres thufir hawat why have the emperor spout dumb  like leto ruled with his heart that means he was weak etc and if so how does appointing him duke of arrakis and then killing him help with that why change pauls plan for destroying the spice to setting off nukes above the deposits 

the second half of dune part 2 was really disappointing as if they just couldnt be bothered anymore and just halfarsed it its pretty sad that this is the dune part 2 we have to live with now

not a bad movie but i had expectations so its a disappointing movie",2024-03-04 16:59:30
"i give it a 87

liked the first one bit more although this one definitely expands on more things feyd was great but wish we saw more think the guy had maybe a total of 5 minutes of screen time and many are saying best villain since heath ledgers joker no chance

one of the most stacked casts ive seen in some time and everyone was perfect some of javier bardems comedic lines felt slightly out of place but it somewhat worked

visuals were amazing but cgi was slightly underwhelming at times honestly not quite as much action as i expected couple worm riding scenes ornithopterspice harvester scene feyd gladiator scene feyd final fight and the end giant battle but all those take up maybe 2030 minutes of screen time out of 165 minutes 

dont get me wrong it was an amazing film and ill rewatch it but i dont think it warrants a 10 and theres a handful of other sci fi movies i prefer including the first part",2024-03-01 04:55:16
"i think it was a really good movie 

that said i think my expectations were a little too high and i left slightly underwhelmed",2024-03-02 03:29:54
"i can’t believe this movie has an 88 on imdb and people are unironically comparing this to lotr and star wars  a 610 movie at best visuals were great but that’s about it this movie will be forgotten once the initial hype dies down 

zendaya cannot act chalamet was just okay the supporting characters were better the final battle was also an absolute letdown   the third act as a whole felt like a mess maybe i bought into the hype too much but i cannot for the life of me understand how people are ranking this movie so high different strokes i guess",2024-03-23 23:47:25
in my theater people were laughing at basically every other scene marvel ruined these peoples brains this isnt a slapstick movie,2024-03-03 12:03:24
"i’m mixed on the first one i do not love the first one as everyone seems to i think it takes too long to get anywhere it has massive part 1 syndrome and probably controversial i think timothee chalamet ruins that movie he makes paul come across as flat and boring and makes it hard for me to be compelled by his journey so i went into this is fairly lower expectations than everyone else 

this movie was like a religious experience every single issue i had with the first one was non existent this was one of the most satisfying theater experiences of my entire life 

this must’ve been how it felt watching the original star wars trilogy or the lord of the rings in theaters for the first time 

holy ",2024-03-01 05:41:55
just came out of the theatre i can honestly say that was the closest ive come to having a religious experience my  what a film it was truly an honour to have been able to watch and experience this film on the big screen i really cant say that about any other film ive watched in theaters dune part two will cement itself as a modern classic dennis has done it again please if you can watch it on the biggest screen possible you will not regret it,2024-03-01 22:01:07

dune part 2 

movie review

just like the first part its absolutely gorgeous theres so many unique looking things in it like the bits on giedi prime and some of the bits in the third act just like the first part the music and sound design is amazing just like in the first part the acting is great

but thats sort of exactly what the movie is the second part to the first part which is fine because thats exatly what it is but at the same time it feels like it could have been more having read the book they hit the marks they need to hit and end the movie as the book ends but it sort of feels like the entire thing needed a bit more space to breathe 

obviously were headed for dune messiah if the powers that be agree on it and im looking forward to it but this almost feels like the movies should be watched back to back and if and when a third one get made that should be added to the marathon

tldr its good but sort of leaves you craving for more 810",2024-03-01 22:24:06
maybe this is easier to see in the book so i’m hoping somebody can explain to me obviously paul is now drinking his own kool aid and is on a dangerous selfrighteous path however i don’t know what he could have done differently that still would have led to fremen liberation was there a middle ground option between “stay in the north and cede arrakis to the harkonnens” and “embrace messiah status and gun for the emperor’s seat”,2024-03-01 23:23:50
"awesome thread just have a few questions about the movie

1 where did paul’s goggles come from when he jumped on the worm he didn’t have them on before jumping and i doubt he was able to put them on while holding on for his life but he’s the messiah after all

2 i would remember if i reread the books but i can’t do that right now on the scene where alia speaks to paul she lets a tear out is she crying for the dead paul i believe paul’s journey ends in dune messiah

alright so as someone who has never read the dune books i have to ask does the original novel end as abruptly as this movie does because i was enjoying the movie up until that point but the ending or really the lack thereof it seems felt like a bit of a damp squib i get that villeneuve wants to make a sequel but i assumed that this film would still provide a resolution to the story that began in part one am i missing something big here,2024-03-02 00:43:20
why was the ending so different oo,2024-03-02 01:13:38

edit 2 also that they didn’t do the time jump and have little alia running around being creepy i understand it would’ve been weird in terms of pacing but i do wish there was a way they could have included that",2024-03-03 03:07:23

i’m so glad we didn’t have to wait until part 3 to see the final fight,2024-03-03 05:15:11
"edit thank you for the answers i understand much better now even more excited for dune messiah now 

incredible movie so many amazing moments had two questions though if someone wouldn’t mind answering 

1 paul seems really againstreluctant being portrayed as the savior for half the movie but then he does decide to go south drink the blue liquid and become the messiah figure they were promised why did he change his mind he saw all the deaths the holy war etc what makes him really lean into it like he does is it just to get the fremen’s help so he can get revenge for his house 

2 and what does his mother get out of all this she’s now the reverend mother and clearly spreads the rumors that paul is the one they were promised then the end she tells his sister he’s starting the war against the houses what does she have to gain why has she put this in motion 

i’ve never read the books and am new to the dune world only seen the films so forgive me lol",2024-03-03 05:20:05

am i going to regret not seeing this movie in imax i don’t want to spend a lot on tickets rpx for 13 is the most i’d go for  it’s 13 on tuesdays imax is 2349 matinee price",2024-03-03 06:58:55
"i feel like this will probably get lost in the comments but im still going to ask

1 why was chanis friend left back in the fremans caves intentionally or she was captured
2 why simplistically movie only does paul have his heel turn  the wol basically just turns jessica evil does it just turn him evil too  or does it give him such a surge of power and vision hes like i must be the messiah because i have so much power  like what is his reasoning

gorgeous movie saw it at century city which is tiny imax but already bought my ticket to see it again at citywalks big real imax",2024-03-03 19:21:57

amazing film there haven’t been many films in the past decade where i came out the cinema feeling like that just beautiful,2024-03-04 21:59:39
just left my 2nd viewing wish we had more space scenes the ones from part one were gorgeous even though it wasnt my first watch i was holding my breath the entire final duel whew the whole giedi prime sequence was  immaculate those “fireworks” and the scenes showing their military might was an excellent experience to see on imax the scene where paul does his first worm ride was also sublime the views from where paul was standing were breathtaking i found myself at the edge of my seat the entire ride absolutely thrilling i also loved the emperor’s ship flying through arakeeen it’s tough i felt the same way about part one as i do part two like some parts felt rushed while some felt drawn out pacing effectively in a dense story such as dune is near impossible though i’d give anything for a couple of 35 hour movies stellar movie chalamet was phenomenal especially in the second half like a mad man loved it can’t wait to see it again but like villeneuve says i was definitely wanting for more christopher walken voice “long live … the foo fightas”,2024-03-04 22:32:43
who were the chanting harkonnen in the control room with the hologramvisual thing of arrakis i havent read the books but ive read a lot of the lore  still cant understand what is going on in that room they dont appear to be mentats,2024-03-05 01:30:09
"when paul is fighting freyd last scene he keeps looking at zendaya i thought he foresaw that he was gonna win was he worried or making a point to her


was also thinking the vision of the ocean could be another planet",2024-03-07 08:06:27
how come it looked like they were portraying lady jessica to be bad sorry if this is a dumb question,2024-03-08 03:18:02
so i watched it a second time felt like i understood more one little thing that confuses me is wasnt rabban in the throne room during the final battle i know he was there when the baron was knocked over and he was still on the ground when paul stormed the room so not much time had to have passed how did he get from the throne room to all the way outside to he killed by gurney,2024-03-08 04:53:27
"all i wanted was for paul to shout at feyd’s body and crack it and the stone in half

i am disappointed in not having that awesome movie otherwise",2024-03-08 05:26:10

visually fantastic pacing and story was a smidge off but everyone executed so well it didn’t matter i thought it was a little slow to start and then was convinced the movie was cliffhanger us with the final siege i didn’t read the book move felt long as  to me so that’s why i felt that then we absolutely fly through the last act but then are rewarded with a sweet fight so… pretty good,2024-03-09 06:08:56
"why does paul change his mind and fulfill the prophecy if he thinks its going to lead to billions of deaths 

also i quite like the idea of chani leading a rebellion as she seemed like the only character you could reason with or relate to

fantastic movie by the way",2024-03-09 14:30:44
anyone know if there’s a full version or just a snippet anywhere online of the song gurney was playing on his baliset in his first scene of dune 2,2024-03-10 06:57:21
only thing i missed was no weirding way training my fave scene from the original my name is a killing word,2024-03-10 23:57:07
just seen it and wow such an incredible film dennis is masterful at sci fi this and blade runner 2049 are my favorites ones by him both at easily a 9510 imo,2024-03-11 00:40:37
"tldr did anyone think the oil bath discussion in dune part 2 between rabban and baron harkonnen was an identical shot to dune part 1

in dune part 1 there is a scene where baron harkonnen is in his oil bath talking to rabban when rabban asks what to do about the fremen he responds  them all before going underwater we do not see him say  them all but instead hear the words as the scene is shot from the back of barons head 

in dune part 2 there is a similar scene where baron talks to rabban in the oil bath baron again ends the conversation by going underwater with the camera facing the front of barons face instead i couldve sworn i saw baron mouth  them all in the shot even though his dialogue in the scene had already ended it seemed like a reused shot from dune 1 just from another angle 

im wondering if i hallucinated this since i havent seen anyone mention it the craziest thing was that when i mentioned this duplicate scene to my partner after the movie they had noticed the same thing wed been rewatching dune part 1 the day before so we were welltrained to catch this if it was actually what happened",2024-03-11 01:06:10
i really loved how well they portrayed the scale of things and moments that one shot of the emperors discoball of the ship landing and the scenery being reflected in it was stunning another is when the boulders started to come down on the soldiers this one is more about the scale in the opposite direction it was that scene where paul talks about the different futures he sees and theres one very narrow one where they win its essentially the moment he accepts to play the role hes been avoiding this prophet this messiah who will take them to paradise but all we see is his hand as he speaks that was beautiful to me hes still just a man doing what needs to be done playing the game,2024-03-12 16:54:37
how did they get the reverend mother and all that luggage’s on to the worm,2024-03-13 17:30:35
its gonna take a  ton of flowers or whatever the arrakis equivalent is to get children of dune,2024-03-13 20:23:08
awesome movie,2024-03-14 04:33:33
can someone explain how chani woke paul up from the water of life coma it seemed like she dipped her finger in the poison and put it in his mouth and he just woke up everything ok did i miss something,2024-03-15 04:33:56
ive seen it twice now and i can confirm it gets better on rewatch,2024-03-15 13:52:11
they can bring thousands of huge war machines to arrakis but cant bring a few tankers of water to trade with the fremen the harkonnens are too dumb to be taken seriously they must really miss piter devries,2024-03-17 00:28:46
feyd was beast,2024-03-19 12:07:53
"i loved what denis did with dune

i read the first book and to paraphrase shutsitdowngames “you only have the read the first half”

and i felt that when reading the book the first half was the most intriguing interesting and genuinely fascinating part of the book then the second half just happened like really fast making the ending feeling abrupt

but thats not the case with movies if felt like dennis reshuffle events cut parts and the best he did was add in segments to flush the culture the freeman the battle strategy of the ending and most of all channi

in the book it felt like she was just a love interest and thats it but in the movie she is her own person with her own beliefs ideas and views about the freeman and the liberation of arrakis

denis’ dun reversed how i felt about the book where part 1 felt slow and meticulous part 2 was action packed alive and really felt like you were seeing a major change in history unfold

i loved his take and it makes really desperate to see his take on messiah and the rest of the series like an addict craving another hit",2024-03-23 20:47:58
"just watched the movie and wanted to ask

does paul’s mother actually care for him towards the end of the movie we see them interact once after he drinks the poison to me it seems like she has her own individual goal that nobody knows about except for her and maybe her daughter",2024-03-27 03:08:56
"amazing movie i’m glad i caught it in theatres 

thinking about how stilgar and the fundamentalists were so able to quickly justify paul’s actions as being part of the prophecy it only dawned on me after the movie was done how easily i’d believed the idea that there was only one narrow path for paul after he drank the water of life regardless of whether or not it was true—how susceptible i’d been to take what was being told to me at face value",2024-03-30 19:20:17
"why did i think bill skårsgard played feydrautha
now i have to watch it again to focus more on austin butler",2024-03-30 22:34:22
excellent movie i liked it far better than the first dune throughout the movie i kept thinking about achilles in troy to paul atreides,2024-04-06 18:06:12
amazing film and a worthy adaptation disappointed there was no iteration of the weirding way was really looking forward to deniss take on it but oh well,2024-04-07 01:21:07
the music in this movie made it real badass,2024-04-08 01:26:18
small little detail that i noticed on third rewatch today when paul and jessica are telepathically communicating after he awakes from the water of life we see a quick flash of paul stabbing feyd for the  happens around the time he talks about the narrow way through didnt notice it before,2024-04-08 07:07:12
"i wish skarsgaard had more screentime and material to work with as i feel he could have been a wonderful baron and a great blend of the previous two barons weve had onscreen probably less prosthetics or a better hover rig would have helped the part too his few great scenes are really good but most are just him sitting around or being a monster

as it is mcneice is still by far my favourite portrayal felt like a guy who could actually run an empire and not just lurch around like a monster and mcmillan the most memorable so  over the top and fun",2024-04-08 21:43:11

"i can’t quite put my finger on it but for me it didn’t achieve the cohesive brilliance of the first movie don’t get me wrong many sublime moments score was great but it was almost a homage to the first didn’t bring anything new 

some moments 55 majority 35 christopher walken 55 for being christopher walken but 05 for actually acting mind you maybe i was just in a crappy mood that day as a lover of epic sci fi cinema i want this to do well ",2024-03-03 18:55:25
i think i liked part 1 more just for how amazing it was at establishing these visuals and characters and world i felt like i hadn’t seen anything like it ever before this was good but didn’t “wow” me in that sense but that’s just the nature of it being a sequel i suppose,2024-03-03 01:28:09
"well they somehow managed to make it feel rushed the point starting from when paul was told to cross the desert to prove himself was when the pacing got away from dennis we go from chani seemingly teaching paul in the middle of the walk to it already being done stilgars warning about desert djinns turned into a non sequitor and paul had a rocky montage that made him somehow a de facto leader of siech tabr

not a fan of that entire section

geidi prime got us back on track feydrautha missing from the first film shows up spectacularly and we finally get the bloodline mixing storyline i do have to say the knifefighting scenes absolutely slayed there were cuts but not the rapid fire cuts that seem to be popular nowadays we got to see some actual choreography and  did it look good

then were back to being semirushed with pauls war in the north which i do not think was done well at all were now at the point where chani suddenly doesnt love paul anymore and paul simply decides to go through with the grand plan oh well

it was kind of strange to me how the battle of arakeen felt like it was almost skipped we had a battle plan that never really happened we got our atomic strike on the shield wall and the wurm rush but then the battle was just kinda done oh well at least what we got looked cool

overall visually stunning as expected dennis missed the mark on the plot and pacing by a fair margin and i still cant believe we havent gotten any spacing guild scenes the spice isnt really shown as being important  were told it is so it must be i think a demonstration of exactly why the navigators are required with spice would have been a fantastic way to really sell the importance of the spice and the planet and how the  has nobody said the spice must flow yet thats the actual blasphemy

overall i think metacritics score is about right the flaws are overshadowed by how cool it was to look at definitely a worthy theatre experience",2024-03-07 08:28:38
"glad i held off on watching part one all this time and got to see it on the big screen for a double feature 

incredible looking movies and absolute peak scifi instant modern classics 

i felt the editing in part two was much better than first which i felt jumped around quite a lot understandable as there was a lot of ground to cover but i felt like the pacing suffered a bit part two was much better in that regard

and whilst this whole thread is full of just praise theres a couple of things im somewhat irked by so much emphasis is put on how harsh arrakis is during the day yet everyones always just standing there direct in the sun chilling i always have an issue with people just being in direct sunlight in moviestv because im aussie but still im supposing their suits just regulate temperature fine but there will still be a line like sun will be up soon we should move 

the other thing were also warned about is how intense the dust storms are and how they can tear apart metal we see that happen when paul and jessica are flying through one yet the fremen are somehow just fine riding on the back of worms covered by just cloth and little huts going through the storms on the way south

anyway small irks these movies are fantastic and i hope there will be a third

also for a horror fan like myself i was really pleasantly surprised with the amount of horror and creepy there is in these movies wasnt expecting that",2024-03-01 06:16:49

my only complaint while austin butler absolutely grew on me is that i wish they did a better job of hyping him up the gladiator fight where he beats 3 drugged prisoners and a worn out sober one definitely wasn’t enough,2024-03-02 22:48:48
unpopular opinion the movie is such a better product than the novel in general i like the idea of the writer a planet that is actually a desert the magical aspects combined with galaxy war and all but reading the book is a pain in the  the writing style is dull conversations are sometime  and pretending to be deep and dangerous and characters are too many and hence most of them not really well built,2024-03-03 02:33:24
"good to great movie not fantastic i think i prefer the first one even with its veeery slow pace at times simply because the world and universe felt grander this one felt hamstrung by the fact it was part 2 of something
comparing it to lotr is waay too far",2024-03-03 17:33:38
i feel like i may be the only person in the world that this series doesnt work for it looks incredible with an epic sense of scale but i feel like all of the characters are dangerously underwritten to a point where their motivations become almost impossible to track and thats the most important part of a story for me genuinely happy for everyone whos having such a transcendent time with this though,2024-03-07 03:22:43
the ending was a bit rushed and the bad guys kinda die too easily but other than that it was a good movie also i feel like the visual experience was couldve been better in a bigger cinema because i feel like it just wasnt it,2024-03-01 09:00:25

"so… the movie was beautiful and i liked the added conflict within the fremen and the fundamentalists but the movie itself wasn’t told in a very organic way it just seemed like the director was like “okay this is the lady jessica water of life scene” “now here is the paul learning to ride a sand worm scene” etc etc and the harkonnen killing people randomly was supposed to show them as being scary but other than the screaming girls that the baron killed all the other senseless death scenes seemed silly 

maybe i’ve read the books too many times and seen the lynch movie too many times but the way this story was told was just blah to me i am glad they didn’t try and get a kid actor to be his sister because that wouldn’t have worked",2024-03-04 07:05:03

"movie got a ton right and made some good changes dont think they would have pulled off alia as a talking two year old and the creepy possessive fetus worked well imo the action scenes were mindblowing feydrautha and geidi prime were masterfully done

people seemed to enjoy the comedic relief of stilgar but i didnt love it this fanaticism is supposed to be so great it swallows the universe the generational divide felt forced to me to give zendayas chani something to do i think it would have been stronger if theyd cast a smaller name and toned the role down",2024-03-02 14:54:02

thought the film was great amazing set pieces fantastic acting the works my only thing and i dont know if it was a script issue or their offscreen baggage but i just didnt feel any chemistry or connection between paul and chani which feels very integral to the plot,2024-03-09 15:09:57
i feel like the changes they made to chani paul and their relationships with each other and the fremen in order to counter the white savior narrative only ended up highlighting it and made it seem even more like a white savior movie reluctant as paul may have been its been a while since i read the books but it seemed like paul was driven more by vengeance for his father and son than in the movies and he himself was led towards the jihad by the fremen who used him as their messiah,2024-03-10 15:00:43

"incredible movie cant wait to watch it again because to be honest i couldnt understand half the dialogue so much whispering and mumbling i may even watch an open subtitles screening

my biggest criticism of this movie is that it didnt really show pauls emboldening impact on the group enough what couldnt they have done without paul really paul told gurney they were running low on firearms but we just saw scene after scene of them doing just fine on that part not too huge a deal but it made the movie a 9 but as i said i couldnt understand half the dialogue so it couldve been explained 

the dune title drop was so good

anyone else feel like part ii removed a lot of the nuance the books had paul’s descent to fulfilling the prophecy was much more interesting in the books because paul was constantly conflicted between honing and controlling his powers and realising what having these powers meant in the grand scale of things the golden path jessica also was way more interesting in the book because of the guilt she felt poisoning alia and also forcing the prophecy onto paul the movie also dumbed down the fremen culture and barely showed how paul and jessica used their intellect to gain their trust,2024-03-04 20:19:23

i saw it in screen x worked well with this movie since the sides just surround you with more desert dunes and when its an inside shot the feeling of being surrounded by people is immersive it wasnt constant either so you dont get use to  the impact in big scenes,2024-03-01 04:05:31

"just got back from the theaters and it truly did live up to the hype and praise

my one complaint is that i wanted another 1520 minutes i havent read the book so i dont know if it just ends at the same place this film did but i really wanted more guess ill have to visit a library soon

also minor nitpick princess irulan and feyd probably could have been introduced in the first film they were ultimately minor bit players in this and i feel like their impact would have been greater though i understand that the first film was already a gamble and why they wouldnt want to introduce characters that wouldnt have gotten much play until part 2",2024-03-01 04:34:29
as everyone has been saying the film is phenomenal on every level and an incredible visual spectacle but i just want to say i loved the moments of humor injected throughout  bardem’s character especially was quite funny  my whole theater burst out laughing when he was like “he says he’s not the messiah which is what the messiah would say”,2024-03-01 04:35:41
oppenheimer was a great movie won’t knock it at all but it was an underwhelming “imax experience” meanwhile dune part two just gave me the best imax experience of my life i found myself with my mouth open just in awe of the majesty of this film i can’t even discuss the movie with my friends yet i’m speechless i just have to see it again,2024-03-01 04:49:26
"incredible  movie i loved part 1 but this is definitely the stronger film i think it has wayyyy more memorable moments and is way more satisfying overall 

i hope to  we get part 3 and it ends in a solid conclusion because this has the chance to be an alltimer trilogy 

also poor chani… her character gets shafted for the sake of the universe",2024-03-01 04:50:38
ive never watched the first one im planning on it but i never have and i dont know anything about dune ive seen articles recently comparing austin butlers performance to heath ledger as the joker and javier bardem and no country for old men is it anywhere near on that level,2024-03-01 05:00:28
"166 mins run time felt short and act 3 there seems to be some disjointed editing which makes me wonder if there will be a director cut the first movie didnt feel like we need a director cut btw

i walked out of the movie with a big grin on my face",2024-03-01 05:05:36
"perhaps this is just me but i do think that this movie is weaker than the first one dont get me wrong the visuals are amazing the characters are great and there are no shortage of great moments but the plot progression felt a bit rushed a bit stunted

perhaps im comparing it to the original too much there are certainly a lot of things cut or changed i will rewatch this in the weekend with friends and ill see if my opinion changes or not",2024-03-01 05:10:49

absolute greatness everything was perfect from the soundtrack to the world to the deeply detailed character arcs kudos to villeneuve now we wait for messiah ,2024-03-01 17:21:22
the most impressive part was how nothing was unintentionally funny there could have been things that could have come off silly but it was done just right an ex of this is how they smartly revealed a lot of the lore through subtitles thru speaking the fermen language versus in english which could have come off nonsensical,2024-03-02 04:05:32

im still a little confused on whats the fake religion implanted by the bene gesserit and whats real like were made to believe that all the signs pointing to paul being lisan al gaib were made up to allow him and his mom to manipulate people which i get but he actually does see visions and jessica actually does think hes the one so was it not a fake religion and if the fremen were just being manipulated how did the water of life play into it cuz that seemed very real and gave both of them real insightpowers,2024-03-02 16:14:09

"a visual treat for sure it looked fantastic but for me that’s all i really liked about it i feel like i would have appreciated it a lot more if i had read the books because to be honest i didn’t have a clue  was going on for large parts of this film sequences were weirdly edited and ended so abruptly and it was really hard to grasp how much time was supposed to be passing between each scene

in terms of cinematography and score it was beautiful though",2024-03-03 22:56:48

"paul  i will not under any circumstance go south as it will lead to the death of billions including chani the one person i hold dearest not even stilgar or my own mother can sway me  

but what if i consult jamis through this rock  

jamis go south  

paul  ok  

that was one of the sillier parts to me the experience itself was amazing tho i think it is in dire need of a director’s cut to flesh out some scenes like paul drinking the water of life or his decision to marry irulan ",2024-03-04 06:40:40
"oh finally i can open twitter my feed was filled with dune references even though i had muted every word associated with it  you letterbox review images

coming to the film i don’t understand why people are surprised to see paul marrying the princess that was very predictable 

some people have said they liked the soundtrack better in dune 1 which i sorta agree with but it was still good there were few moments when it felt like our seats were shaking that’s definitely good


while watching the movie i was confused why everyone had come to dune but someone has cleared that in comments here so thank you
austin butler was great in this one probably the highlight performance 

highlight scenes for me were

the worm riding

giedi prime 

paul after drinking the poisonthat meeting 

the reveal although it wasn’t dramatised which i liked

the final duel the entire scene there tbh specifically from the crawling of baron

one question i couldn’t really tell who was the woman leading paul in his dreams was it the princess or was it jessica",2024-03-04 15:24:01
not gonna lie that preview of ‘challengers’ before the movie kinda ruined chani for me lol i thought of that ridiculous trailer whenever zendaya was onscreen,2024-03-04 21:52:46
"i see a lot of people comparing this to lotr or empire strikes back and most people even if they like dune they say things like almost comparing to empire strikes back

now i enjoy star wars but did we watch the same films i do like star wars but for me dune is way beyond that it evokes conversation on a totally different level and hits so much deeper

i think lotr is in some ways complete as an adaptation what i mean is i could see someone down the line making a dune adaptation that is worth making  villeneuve chose a clear thing to focus on religionmessiah aspect and left the rest out which i thought worked brilliantly but it leaves room for other adaptations however i dont see that were gonna see a lotr remake that would be considered worth making even 10 maybe 20 years from now  which would be 40 years after lotr was made its the definitive version which is crazy but villeneuves dunes did something different than lotr i dont think its a good comparison to think lotr is simply above dune as cinema for me it isnt",2024-03-04 22:47:55
this movie felt like i was watching star wars,2024-03-04 22:53:38

"i just watched the movie and i must say i thoroughly enjoyed it being almost three hours long i thought it would be very boring in long parts but to my surprise it was very well paced you really dont even notuce that its an almost three hour long movie

the acting from everyone eas really good for me the best performance was from jarvier bordem he was so enjoyable to watch another really good performace was from the young villian he reall felt like a formiddable villian 

i just have a few questions thiygh that im hoping someone will be able to answer

1 what is the importance of spice in the dune universe and not something like water why is it so valuable that they want to mine and risjk thier people bing eaten by the giant worms 

2 why do the mian characters have the tube things in thier noses and not everyone else what is the purpose of the tubes why do they need them and the others dont",2024-03-07 10:01:00
"just like part 1 villeneuve did a fantastic job condensing the thick abundant and nuanced concepts from the books onto screen much more effectively than lynch  especially when considering that this whole film is basically contained in the last 13rd of lynchs film lol  villeneuve put a lot of time in the process of paul winning over the fremen which iirc was sort of glossed over in the novel anyways and was like a ten second voice over in lynchs film too  and rightfully so that is an extremely import thing to make this fantasy film more realistic right  an outsider just coming in and sweeping up the fremen into a holy war  and lots of attention was given to that which i think was a criticism of the original novel the white savior complex  so i like how that was addressed without really changing anything it was just another added dimension  



also the changes he made to the source material were like part 1 really handled carefully and always meant to invoke the spirit and nuances of the novel and in many cases were basically to setting up plot and development for his eventual part 3 dune messiah clearly  specifically creating this rivalry between chani and irulian  which i gotta say zendaya and florence pugh make a great nemesis from even the one scene theyre in together  cant wait  



speaking of i love villeneuves tip of the hat to the novel with florence pughs dictation in some of the scenes  felt like an easter egg for superfans  and zendaya is great in this  obviously they really tried hard to put her in the first film because she doesnt really appear until this half of novel 1 lol but shes great here  in part 1 shes basically a goal for paul to achieve here shes a fullfledged character with her own motivations convictions and dilemma  that in itself i love her moral dilemma with the prophesies which iirc was not in the original novels right  i think that becomes something relatable to the audience a critique of the bene gesserit



i wasnt super convinced of christopher walken as the emperor but hey its christopher walken so ill take him  
javier bardem is great as stilgar and is like the only brevity in the movie lol  i love this guy  



the rumors were true and ana taylor joy as alia atreides is  perfect but dont get your hopes up for seeing her for more than ten seconds lol which if youve read dune or at least seen lynchs youd know  st alia of the knife is probably my favorite dune character so ill just be hyped for part 3 and they actually started to develop her character in a newdifferent way here which i rather liked  villeneuve was good at giving these characters more to do than in the books  so yeah wish there was more st alia but i guess good things come to those who wait  if there is ever a fourth film covering children of dune she will be insanely awesome  
the only two things i was let down with was the lack of thufir but i i read all his scenes were indeed filmed but were cut from the movie because of time constraints which is reasonable its still a long movie  also i really wanted to see some guild navigators but alas it wasnt meant to be  but i guess villeneuve cant put too much in one movie  it seems hes been pacing it out a bit each film sort of lets you see more of the outer galaxy kinda like the novels really and maybe hes just saving the spacing guild for the third film   



another thing i love that villeneuve has done was make this movie so inexplicably strange  like these details that are so very foreign really help make this vision of the future so bizarre also something lynch did but villeneuve does it in a more grounded way  for instance the sound of the harkonnen gunfire is this weird guttural thump that ive never heard before why cant it sound like that  he made familiar things intentionally unfamiliar to make them in effect more distant exotic and frankly dystopian because the world of dune is just that  these characters dont live in a paradise and i think that was what frank herberts point was its sort an archaic future right  humanity itself was redefined and the characters are constantly searching for it",2024-03-07 19:40:17
if you cant be the best be the worst,2024-03-07 23:09:28
the fremen use human shields so there will inevitably be civilian casualties and governor feyd cant let them get away with shooting at civilian spice transports so the special military operation to destroy their terror tunnels and underground bases is justified under international law plus all the fremen have become radicalized and would never accept peace and an equitable solution to the on the ground situation on arrakis,2024-03-08 12:43:34
"ok guys have twothree questions

1 why did that one girl stay behind to get torched what was the point of her staying

2 how did the bad guys know where the fremen peoples home was which they bombed they had never located it before

3 can paul read people’s mind and how did he know exactly where that temple was in the south

felt like the movie did some movie magic and just made stuff happen in parts without showing how",2024-03-08 22:17:29
question why did paul have to drink the water of life,2024-03-09 16:54:34
feyd killing subordinates randomly and his servants being cannibals totally wasn’t in the book right seemed like an overly dark addition ,2024-03-09 17:52:59
the talking  baby was horrifying,2024-03-09 18:28:23
"just saw it again this time i caught the sound of waves when paul was telling the emperor to kiss the ring wouldnt be surprised if the sound bite was from when him and his dad were talking on the cliff in the first part




also where the  did chani get a helicopter",2024-03-10 01:19:34
are they setting up chani to lead a rebellion against paul  thats a huge deviation from the books,2024-03-10 03:36:33
this was ridiculously good the perfect ramadan movie,2024-03-12 21:43:32
"pacing was just too fast imo i get you cant cover all the years that take place over the book and the build up but i didnt get a chance to breathe

the war scene to paul becoming emperor felt so sudden for all the buildup throughout the entire movie 

overall an 810 but cant believe anyone is comparing this to lotr",2024-03-14 17:32:50
"fantastic movie high quality movie

i cant stand timothy because his face makes me jealous but the entire cast did an incredible job 

the visuals were stunning the score was perfect the pacing was slow but necessary its a high quality movie with plenty of care behind it which isnt too common nowadays especially with other remakes",2024-03-16 02:27:06

"just saw it on imax 70mm two things

1 wow timmy is the  man when he gave that speech in the circle i was ready to go i just have to watch it in theaters again

2 im disappointed with imax while the sound was great and the big screen was nice i was disappointed in the actual picture quality maybe i expected more in terms of design i think the picture would be better in dolby 70mm screen is nice but the seats are too close and im not a fan of theaters where you have to look up to watch the movie even when youre sitting in the upper rows movie screens should be eye level too close and it ruins the picture its like sitting close to the tv at home when youre watching an epic scifi movie

overall im pumped and i hope they make part 3",2024-03-17 06:03:33
but but but the baby sandworm death was not nice ,2024-03-17 22:46:15
my favorite part of the movie was when paul said the original name of the planet was dune and the camera zoomed in to his face it was like that upright citizen’s brigade sketch,2024-03-18 16:08:38
im wondering what léa seydoux story plot will be for the next movie books,2024-03-23 03:21:09
just seen it for the first time and loved it it was visually  incredible but i couldn’t help but feel like the pacing was a bit strange  feels like i just watched 300 tiktoks about the film rather than the film itself,2024-03-24 00:09:53
"i have to be honest while i think the visuals of this movie were 1010 i hated what they did to stilgar chani and jessicas characters stilgar is reduced to a fundamentalist lackey which is totally not what he was like in the books i am rereading children of dune and there is a paragraph in there about how much he abhors how pauls legacy has become a religion he never believed in it truly 

chanis character gosh i understand what they were trying to do but damni could not understand why she loved paul and why he loved her in this film she was angry for 99 of the film and paul never communicated  with her unlike their book counterparts where she was aware of and on board with all of the decisions that he made she knew he would have to have a political marriage and understood why likewise paul always made it known to her that she was the love of his life and he would never even look irulans way despite her having his name they just ruined their love story to me it also would have been nice for the two of them to have a music motif for their romance buti know that is asking too much

lastly jessica lord almighty what they did to her she went crazy after the water of life she wasnt even around paul much in this film which is not what happened in the book ug i just hated what they did to her because she wasnt a mother anymore blech",2024-03-25 00:15:16
so ive got a couple questions about the ending why was the war over so quickly it seemed so sudden the emperor arrives lands with his army and gets beaten in a day seemed too easy also what did paul mean by lead them to paradise if the fremen want a green world how does attacking the other great houses play into that,2024-03-31 10:08:41
"just watched the film and absolutely loved it

things i liked 

some of my favourite aspects were the performances chalamet absolutely kills it the scene where he declares himself the duke of arrakis was legendary he was absolutely perfect for the role javier braden was amazing as stilgar with a surprising amount of comedy relief at times austin butler really surprised me as well he really leaned into it

the score and music were some of the best i’ve ever scene the music when paul arrives in the south or when he rides the work were perfect

the visuals on guedi prime were stunning the black sun contrasted with the white was a sight to behold the visuals were unmatched 

thing that could have been better

bautista gets really sidelined for rautha to take his place 

the biggest gripe for me might be unpopular but the editing could have been a bit better i’m confident there’s an extended version with jessica spreading the religion more with florence pugh and the empires and just more with rautha and the harkonens no doubt it’s hard to include everything but i thought some characters were underused i felt that zendaya and her character were given a lot of screen time that could have gone to others

overall fantastic film 9510",2024-03-01 03:46:35
just go back from the theater watched whole movie anddd the  is it really about the plot seems to  jump all over the place it lacks the thread that connects all scenes together ,2024-03-17 04:59:24
now thats pod racing,2024-03-01 04:51:58
saw it yesterday i enjoyed the spectacle of it and in general loved the cinematography the pacing felt off and it definitely felt like some of the characters were shoved in also anyone else just not buying the two main leads acting they seem mediocre to me especially the parts when they shout and try to show emotion still love anything villeneuve puts tho,2024-03-04 02:50:10
"610

just saw it this afternoon ive watched part 1 six times but i was really disappointment and underwhelmed by part 2 i dont really even feel inspired to watch it again lots of things were well done but the screenplay the choice of what to show and the scope of attention on details seemed misplaced and unconvincing compared to even part 1 i just didnt feel any of what it felt like they were trying to make me feel thru the art direction it felt like a miniseries crammed into a movie format",2024-03-20 20:35:54
boring movie with great visuals and wooden actors that belong as still images as models not actors,2024-03-05 04:28:57
loved the effects sound design and cinematography any scene with austin butler was a standout and the infrared scene was the highlight of the movie for me but did anyone else find the story to be a little weak its based on such a well regarded book so im wondering did they cut things out or do i just have bad taste timothee chalmets acting wasnt great in my opinion and zendayas acting was pretty bad liked it overall though,2024-03-01 19:07:46
i gotta say as someone who hasnt read the books and is experiencing this whole story for the first time through these films paul really  me off in the latter half of this movie stop trying to being so  powerhungry paul youre pushing zendaya away,2024-03-02 05:27:42
ami the only one who really thinks they went to far from the book,2024-03-02 16:14:14
i really liked it but there were certain changes from the book that did leave a sour taste in my mouth i do not expect 1 to 1s and it’s still a fantastic movie but alia not being born and creeping everyone out was a real let down her killing baron is one of my fave scenes in the book i also really don’t like not having leto 1 being born and paul’s total disregard for chani really was upsetting outside of that a solid 910 movie,2024-03-02 21:59:25
just saw dune part 2 came here to see reaction its been years since i read the books the books i vaguely remember thinking the last two written by franks son based on his notes were a little overthetop plotwise with like eight clones of everyone constantly popping up this movie i kind of have the opposite reaction im a big character dialogue fan and also a big political intrigue fan so game of throneshouse of the dragon is very much the gold standard for my tastes in recent fantasy tvmovies this dune movie just didnt feel like it had much of that we didnt get a feel of scheming and plotting it was all very paintbynumbers pure action with dramatic landscape shots so i need to go back and read the original book and see if thats a problem with the novel or just the movie,2024-03-03 08:03:44
"absolutely incredible experience in theaters this is one of those movies that i just couldnt imagine watching at home it just wouldnt be anywhere close to the same impact loved the visuals loved the sound design just great production all around there was also a lot of interesting setup hopefully the third movie ends up bringing it all together

my only complaint would be just how some scenes were handled i havent read the novel but i couldnt shake off this feeling that some characters or scenes felt kind of inconsistent with how they were being developed stuff like stilgar becoming almost cartoonish comic relief the deaths of the harkonnens being pretty underwhelming and pauls decision to just immediately go to war",2024-03-03 08:23:24
did anyone else have a problem with the editing at all paul walks out into the desert about to do is 40 days40 nights chani seemingly can’t stand him walks out with him we are told about ghosts and whatnot and boom suddenly a battle what,2024-03-03 23:54:56
"i know im going against the current here but here it goes i read dune back in the late 70s read most of herberts original follow ups  but not those released posthumously by his son 

i actually thought the first movie was better and was tighter the second movie was a lot of scenery and style but short on substance and actual dialogue

x200b

my 2 biggest gripes with dune part 2

1 the hollywood cliche about adding conflict between core characters  ie paul vs  jessica was overblown and paul vs chani at the end was unnecessary  every director who brings a very popular book to screen always succumbs to the desire to spice it up lotr is another example
2  time the events of dune the novel span over 4 years while the movie events take about 8 months a few subtitles  already plenty  could have portrayed some passage of time

overall i enjoyed it quite a bit  just annoyed at the needless conflict added",2024-03-05 01:21:42
"did the beautiful visuals make everyone brain dead 8810

the writing and editing were absolute dog  there was no chemistry between the two main characters   

am i going  crazy with everyone giving this thing a 1010 did we really forget what good movies look like",2024-04-08 06:58:08
"a 7 or 810 the cinematography was incredible as was the score truly elevated the film the dialogue was weak throughout autin butler was brilliant among a couple others the first 2030 minutes were slow and then the end picked up things massively maybe a bit rushed like rogue ones ending 

i found all the hes the messiah stuff incredibly cringe and not worthy of the few laughs it got in my packed imax theatre",2024-03-03 00:05:41
"wow so much to process it was certainly brilliant engrossing heavy and all around epic beautifully shot scored and acted but im also left with questions and thoughts as a nonbook reader

what is the balance between how much prophecy was true vs bene gesserit propaganda so much of the prophecy seemed to be playedalongto lies but then suddenly magical worm juice showed up out of nowhere that at times seemed to have real effect on the outcome of things then theres the fact it was suddenly revealed that chanis fremen name had been part of the prophecy all long but youd think that wouldve been noted sooner when she and paul first showed interest in each other  and what are the odds of her having that name in the first place if its all just bene gesserit planning

more on the worm juicepoison  it seemed to totally overtake jessica and her child into being devout to the prophecy but jessica also seemed to still be aware of the bene gesserits manipulation over the centuries meanwhile paul drank the poison and became much more dictatorlike at times but then other times seemed more like his old self like nothing changed at all so what did the worm poison do exactly it seemed like an outofnowhere plot device that had an unclear effect on two key characters i’d also heard whispers of paul’s descent into dictatorship and had hoped that would’ve had more motivation than “i drank dead worm juice and got more angry”

did paul ever tell chani that he dreamed of her before they ever met just curious when they first crossed paths in part one i was hoping hed make a bigger deal out of meeting the girl from his visions but of course there were more pressing matters at hand

more a critique than a question but the first half of the film was so focussed on pauls training on arrakis that i found myself missing the bigger picture of the galaxy and its housespolitics but then when we finally reentered the bigger picture in the second half it felt like things escalated really fast basically all paul had to do after becoming a leader was drink the worm juice be immediately convinced he was a messiah and pretty much send a message to the emperor saying dude fight me which resulted in the emperor falling into a pretty obvious trap thus the films final battle i found myself wanting more of a slow escalation into the emperors hand being directly forced into combat and better development for paul than drinking worm poison and changing

also more critique than question but i sorely missed the power of the voice sure it was used a few times but after being so established in part one i thought it would be more of a plot device and cool overarching supernatural ability instead its only real shining moments were the power transfer between the reverend mothers jessica forcing chani to fulfill the continuously developing prophecy as i noted in question 1 and paul telling the former reverend mother to be silent cool moments but i wanted more and it could have been a much more interesting plot device to further pauls ascent to power 

dont take any of these the wrong way i did really enjoy the movie and over time as i come to understand its world more especially the poison im sure ill come to love it like i have with part one over the last couple years i guess after enjoying the worldbuilding of part one so much the more settled and focused approach to part two took me by surprise along with the points above that i was a bit confused by still it was a  of a beautiful and enthralling ride im looking forward to seeing many more times and understand further",2024-03-01 03:40:28
i liked it i liked part 1 more as someone who has read the book im disappointed that thufir wasnt in part 2 and that alia wasnt born and didnt  the baron it also felt overpacked although the pacing was still nice jessica was amazing and contrary to many opinions i thought paul and chani had great chemistry id give the film a 710,2024-03-01 08:32:01
i’m on the same bandwagon as the people saying this trilogy will be up there with lotr and star wars let’s go,2024-03-01 13:43:31
this will probably be an unpopular opinion but i didnt particularly like the changes to chanis character from the novel to the film i think in the overall feelscope of what denis did with dune it works and zendaya acted well i just like book chani better,2024-03-01 15:08:00
revenge of the sith should have been more like this,2024-03-01 16:19:24
geez i hope there is an extended version it did seem like they skipped over some little details at times i really liked this one it might even be better than the first one,2024-03-02 09:47:26
i would ride timothees grandfather worm any  day,2024-03-02 11:24:36
"extremely good movie holy   easy 910 and frankly i give it a solid 95  not quite perfect but  close

changes from the book really bug me though  alia not yet born  paul killing the baron  no thufir  of course the movie cant follow the book perfectly but those changes were jarring to me

worst though and im honestly surprised with how much it bothered me paul didnt drive his knife through feyds jaw into his brain  i dont know i was just really expecting to see that  its is such a satisfying moment in the book and it would have fit perfectly in the film denis made  maybe im being nitpicky but that exact moment is such a huge part of dune to me and it sucks that they skipped over it

still  1010 soundtrack  1110 cinematography  butlers feyd is one of the best characterizations i have ever seen  films based on books hardly get more ambitious and challenging than this and it was an absolute toptobottom crush job",2024-03-02 21:57:23
"as somebody expected to be amazed coming out of this film i thought it was alright it felt like a decent sci fi movie but i dont really have this desire to rewatch it its setting up a good story but i feel like it will be one of those movies where you have to see the payoff in 3 which is how i felt about 1 guess i wasnt that enthralled by it

but on an execution level this movie is done so well the directing music and action are well done the few comedic bits also work

edit im coming back to this because im warmed on the movie as days have past i already liked the execution but pauls story and the whole lisan al gaib thing really intrigued me definitely thought provoking",2024-03-03 23:37:44
was there a scene or two missing from the movie or am i tripping stilgar asked paul to cross the desert by himself and then he started desert walking  chani comes to help teach him to desert walk better and then in the next scene he is blowing up a spice harvester that was my only complaint i also wouldve liked to see more of the grandfather worm,2024-03-04 17:35:50
anya taylor joy took me out of the movie in her scene shes like the rock now ,2024-03-04 21:59:19
"serious question to those who have read the book and seen part 2

in the book a large amount of the 3rd act takes places entirely offscreen in an exceedingly frustrating way bad enough to drop the book in my eyes from a 1010 to almost a 510 in literally the last 3 chapters

is this rectified in the movie those who read the book will know what i mean",2024-03-06 16:31:37
"solid 7510 

incredible visuals sound as everyone has said movie has great pacing for the first 2 hours and then ends everything in 10 minutes like a f1 race like everything is tied nicely with a bow and cherry on top i was shocked paul just absolutely takes a dump on everyones outstretched hands and walks away i mean i get thats what happens in the books but at least a bit more clever dialogue in the throne room maybe 

dialogue was super corny if i hear another character say war is comingwhatre you gonna do when it gets here just so it can be used in trailers i will jump into a sandworms mouth its like denis put 100 points into visuals and sound and 50 points into dialogue bad guys were comically bad like theres no nuance just the cliche bad guy kills own henchmen 234982942834 times to show how evil they are we get it dark evil pale  faces evil yes thats evil alright

i cant fault it too much though it clears most other movies ive seen in the past few years based on sound and visuals alone",2024-03-08 07:57:57
paul is what they meant when they said we need new modern masculinity thats not old school toxic or just  effeminate and metrosexual  just become an insane terrorist cult leader and have everyone worship you because of charisma leadership and intelligence that way youre still a high status dominant leader without being a toxic male stereotype,2024-03-08 13:23:24
"i liked it but didnt love it  the problem i think the film has is that the more they tried to stick to the books the more they lose the casual viewers who havent read them  while i understood the basics of what was going on i feel like i was missing a lot concerning the motivations of certain characters  

also what was up with the scene where paul is going on some sort of vision quest in the dunes  he gets sent on his way meets up with chani and then we abruptly cut to a battle scene  the whole solo trip into the harsh wasteland was supposed to be some big test and they skipped right over it",2024-03-11 22:15:25
"i truly truly loved the film honestly i watched it in a  cinema and really wanna go again on imax or dolby atmos for a second viewing watching the first film for the first time was meshmarizing

i haven’t felt that emotionally invested affected and immersed by a film in a long long time and in a good positive way it was just executed very well the sound the emotions the fight scenes how perfect paul was as a fragile skinny child struggling to a fierce fighter desert mouse smart and cunning not weirdly strong and acrobatic for no reason at all the cinematography the fight scenes the intrigue world building it was all incredible i felt the cinema in awe thinking this was a 910

my gripes

1 i felt rabban was a completely different character he was so menacing strong terryfing and then he becomes this weakling who could not reason at all the follow them with helicopters while screaming the guys name on desert and then immediately running away felt so lame the helicopter scene kinda made up for it as that was super cool this scene almost completely took me out of the movie but the movie was so masterful it  me back in i also really didn’t like the rabban and gurley scene just felt too rushed too perfect too simple
2 chani just the seemed like a 21st century teenager dropper in that setting her demeanor beliefs  actions she felt like a modern rebellious petulant adolescent teenager rather than a product of a violent brutal tribe commune culture not a book reader but from what i’ve read she’s a lot more supportive and understanding in the book and can think in complex layers based on her motivations rather than religion bad the whole culture is built around tradition and respect and the way she just seemed to disrespect the gathering rules her elders etc she just felt so out of place to me
3 more chani i felt the romance was forced i felt the characters didn’t have lots of chemistry i read a comment saying these were teens in a deserted planet which made this awkwardness easier but chani or paul was never shown as awkward honestly the scene between feyd and the lady gesseritt woman had so much more on screen chemistry
4 more chani she was like pharaoh from the moses story seeing so many miracles and not believing them i read a comment here that said they liked her character until the water of life scene where you are literally witnessing a hundreds if not thousands of year old prophecy that should not be possible at all being fulfilled in front of your eyes and your response is like an atheist subreddit user honestly wished she would struggle more with the prophecy and paul would try to convince her it’s not real she not believing it made her look so  and unreasonable there is literally so much proof that the prophecy is real
5 the emperor didn’t really feel menacing or powerful at all could be the cinema i was at but they said wow he brought his whole army and the scale of his army didn’t feel any bigger than harkonnen or attreides gatherings the first movies imperial army planet scene made it a lot more epic if we didn’t see baron kneeling and soldier behind him unsheating i would not feel he yielded any power at all felt the leto was weak line was a cop out wanted that to be more fleshed out
6 important people being on the front lines all the time were lame whether gurley or paul also gurley literally leading a suicide charge and surviving was lame i know it’s the same in the book but it felt cheap sardaukar being weak was lame but i read many comments it’s the same in the book the fremen and desert power is underestimated i didn’t get that sense from the movie i wish there was a dialogues from paul like that i don’t know the throne scene was really cool but then felt a little out of place and lacking scale they just got there too quickly and the imperial guard just stood there

i just wished chani at least struggled with the prophecy a little and maybe the lisan al gaib is men made but the hazerach thing is very real and very mystical that required a thousand year planning and luck of a perfect being that will lead to a better world i felt that wasn’t handled with proper respect",2024-03-13 09:37:27
"dune is a monumental film a fullfledged auteur blockbuster  without a doubt it will be a topic of conversation for years to come  there are shots and scenes that will remain etched in my memory for a long time
 however dune has the least lovable and endearing characters in the history of cinema lets add a little drama to the criticism  and for this type of story where the objective is to create a film saga the characters should be the initial and most important point to develop for their creators  since they are the ones we are going to follow for so long and it is for them that we get excited suffer laugh cry etc  because at the end of the day this is their story  its your way  it is their lives that are at stake

 but unfortunately its creators dont seem to care too much that their characters are the least memorable thing in their story  and yes as i said before duna is spectacular in all its other sections the sound and the soundtrack are the best i have ever heard in my life we continue with the drama the vfx are incredibly realistic every pixel is be careful the production design with that imposing desert really makes you immerse yourself in arrakis and its universe the photography is chameleonlike and loaded with information and meaning and the performances are truly impressive rebeca ferguson austin buttler and javier bardem wow

 but what about the emotion  dune fails miserably to deliver a story you really care about  and for me the big problem is that the only purpose of the characters their only function is to be the means or the tool to tell you the story  they are empty shells  without soul  and the thing is we dont know them  in both films because the same thing happens in the first at no point do they stop not even a little bit in showing us the humanity of these people  paul went from being the spoiled son of one of the most important houses in the universe to being the messiah of an entire planet and to leading a revolution against the galactic government is that what they say  the kid literally became a  who can see all possible futures  and he accepts it with coldness and exasperating depression  and this happens with all the characters except for jessica and stilgar  none of them generate a drop of empathy in me  and this is because i dont know who they are i dont know them at all i dont know their fears their personal ambitions their tastes their desires  i know they do what they do because they have a duty to do it but is it really what they want to do as people  these and many other questions are ones that dune is never going to bother answering us or showing us

 and its not that nothing happens to the characters quite the opposite everything happens to them but the problem is that it doesnt generate anything for me
 so i wonder if i dont care about any of the characters in the slightest why should i care what happens to them or what they do  spoiler alert why would i care that paul is the barons grandson  why would i care if gurney is alive and kills rabban  why should i care that paul takes revenge on his family by killing the baron  why should i care about the extermination of house atreides  i dont know them i dont know who they are i dont care about them  they are actors not characters

 i think that is the big problem in both films and hopefully not it is the problem that will drag down the entire saga",2024-03-14 16:45:43
"my biggest question is why was chani so upset at the end

 i get it on an emotional level but if you look at it logically what was paul supposed to do if you want the liberation of the fremen then paul chose the only correct path  it had to lead to conquering arrakis then an alliance with the emperor and then galactic war if the houses would not fall in line

so what should have paul done according to chani what different path should he have taken that would still lead to freedom for her people",2024-03-19 14:51:04

recommend seeing it in imax i skipped seeing this one in imax after feeling disappointed by many 70mm imax movies tenet oppenheimer once upon a time in hollywood all good movies but was not sure the imax was worth it   

was still epic and great in standard though ",2024-03-06 00:26:38
"denis villeneuve’s name really has got to be in the running for one of the best directors after dune 2 i was surprised that my film friend didn’t actually know his name until yesterday after our imax screening i’ve consistently liked if not loved all of his movies and dune part 1’s easily one of those movies that’ll stick into my head idk if i love part 2 as much it has more spectacle and the visuals and on sound are great but part 1 has a certain vibe to it on first watch it definitely feels like the first hour or so of this movie felt like a series of events that he had to condense but idk if that’ll go away or be more noticeable on a second viewing 

that said i loved geidi prime holy  the black and white sequence the sandworm riding the everything this dude does not have one single boring shot in an almost 3 hour movie and that’s a feat in on itself when it comes to ‘modern’ hollywood blockbusters",2024-03-01 05:03:58
"im surprised no one has commented on chanis adaption compared to the book while i loved most of the book i disliked how the women were written they fawned over paul lacked agency and seemed emptyminded

i love that chani had a much stronger defiant character in the movie providing some contrast to pauls rise and serving as an ominous prelude to whats coming some might disagree but i think its an improvement on the books",2024-03-01 07:38:08
havent seen the movie but as someone who didnt like part 1 and found it to be incredibly boring and slow would i like part 2 and is it any different,2024-03-06 01:09:59
"i thought part 1 was mid paul was emotionless and flat the “fremenness” of the fremen was a bit too played up and i didn’t feel like a lot of substance actually happened i walked out of the theater feeling like i just watched 25 hrs of setup 

but it was worth it by the end of part 2 paul is a badass but with depth as he realizes the personal sacrifices he has to make to achieve the future he wants so many epic moments once the emperor lands on arrakis i give it a 75 there were a lot of silly walks which were kinda goofy and it’s kinda boring to me how without exception every harkon is just a straight evil dude who loves being bad for badness sake the trope of “ill even  my subordinate” is so played out and happened like 6 times only with the harkons also had some gripes with fight choreography 

maybe i’m just a history nerd who’s watched too many youtube videos but the amount of  combat spins and somersaults was way too high in a fight they’re totally pointless unless you’re wielding an actual great sword which requires you to use momentum broke my immersion at times and it’s not the movies fault but it being chalemet and zendaya broke my immersion at times to",2024-03-06 14:35:51

imax was full week after premiere

why didnt they use guns instead of knives

with from reading the novelto sitting in a theater and watching the 80s version all daylike every showing to the syfy networks miniseries and follow upsi just feel zendayas performance made chani too angryweak and spoiledkinda ruined the movie especially that endingi know i am in a minority but dot care

chani is freman and strong enough and smart enough to see the union of paul and house corino was a necessary evil and she was pauls wife not irulanhowever the temper tantrum running off really  on a great characterwhat a disservice to  frank herberts masterpiece",2024-03-03 01:44:22
"hot take but paul is not the villain as a journalist i think audiences always want to assign something as blackorwhite and the point of this series to me so far is to prioritize the coexistence of people with honorable intentions doing evil things

to quote “his rule is more about exploring the gray areas of morality and leadership than casting him as a straightforward villain”",2024-03-03 10:38:18
my only gripe with this movie is they didn’t explain why arrakis was so important do they even call the spice melange if i recall correctly they never touched on what melange does and why it’s such an important commodity in the universe,2024-03-02 08:09:33

ost was insane for part 2",2024-03-17 00:12:22
i’m going to get down voted but  everybody smacking on their popcorn in the quiet parts of the movie can’t wait to watch this in an empty theater,2024-03-04 17:21:34
anyone else not a fan of the ost after wonder woman 2 i cant not laugh and think of ancient lamentation music but even beside that i found the music to be pretty uninteresting,2024-03-06 02:17:00
pacingwise it was pretty bad perhaps alia should have been cut entirely,2024-03-09 03:53:37
reading through these comments i can confidently say that i must have missed the point of the movie,2024-03-10 01:48:38
im really surprise by the intensity of the praise it was good but i dont think these movies have very strong characters,2024-03-17 04:17:36
hans  zimmer everyone just holy  the sound design in the movie is incredible there are multiple sequences where you can feel the score in your bones even in the quiet moments there is almost a steady thrum of bass driving the movie forward truly elevating an incredibly beautifully shot film it envelopes you throughout the runtime until the scene with the duel and even its  absence is felt bought another ticket for a showing on sunday im gonna pop an edible this time and ride the worm with paul,2024-03-01 11:55:10
amazing film   i was glued to my seat the whole time      visuals are amazing   story  everything    just so good,2024-03-01 04:27:41
i havent read the book but im a bit disappointed it left on another cliffhanger,2024-03-01 03:38:06
my biggest surprise here was zendaya never a fan probably from lack of seeing her in things but here i really felt for her character in the book she kinda just went with the flow due to her heritage they removed that aspect here for time most likely but with that she  has purpose and since it is at odds with paul to a degree it adds some nice tension nice little surprise,2024-03-01 03:39:44

"thought it was great every performance was stellar visuals were incredible

i loved how its clearly the second of three movies but unlike the usual trope of the bad guys winning in part 2 in this one the hero literally becomes the emperor and yet it feels like a downer ending because of the way they teased how paul attaining power will lead to misery

i also think the zendaya and timothee fans will be angry that they didnt end the movie together and instead he chose someone else wouldnt be surprised if the cinemascore is lower than the movie deserves because of that and the ending in general

overall i loved it on its own but especially as a companion to part 1  which i rewatched just before leaving for the cinema tonight",2024-03-01 05:08:17

finally the immense epic scale of dune brought to life the serious science fiction it is the titan of the genre yeah it had some chuckles but this is our godfather a no  film no marvel quips or star wars kid gloves

must see",2024-03-01 07:54:07
"i’ve seen it more than once now and have read the books so my thoughts are going to cover the whole series potentially 

if you only get one thing from me take that it should be seen in imax period dolby cinema is inferior for this 

 questions 

 did the great houses nuke arrakis at the end what was that flash orbital bombardment
 how do the fremen vessels gain passage to the great houses’ homeworlds i guess they just demand it from the guild who says okay fine since the spice would be destroyed if they don’t comply
 was the final atreides soldier in the gladiator pit the captain of the guard “shields” guy when they disembark in pt one
 if paul knowing the old fremen name is such a big deal why does the baron also call it dune in part one he thinks the fremen are subhuman he wouldn’t be using their folk names 


 reactions not specifically related to changes from book
 utter joy during the raids paul’s first sandride the war council and the climactic attack 
 paul entering the war council with a sandworm exploding up behind him and heavy drums that’ll go down as an alltimer badass shot
 paul’s ambivalence and waffling with taking advantage of the prophesy and then doing it anyway and not knowing what he really believed felt messy but i guess it makes sense it feels to me like paul sometimes tries to be a simple fedaykin but he’s lying to chani and himself that’s just not the person he is
 the first time watching i did not like javier bardem’s portrayal of stilgar but it grew on me in repeat viewings it felt like comic relief but less overdone than i initially thought 
 why exactly the emperor would ever come to arrakis in the first place upon receiving the challenge never felt clear tbf i think this applies to the book too
 and why did the saudakar mass faced toward the mountain
 a bit confused by the layout of arrakeen and the shield wall i could’ve sworn that mountain formation wasn’t there in part one 
 walken i don’t get the casting not what i pictured
 on the other hand florence pugh is incredible as irulan and austin butler is great as feydrautha 
 sad no more sardaukar language except for the first moment i still don’t get why the sardaukar specifically having prophetic sayings in the cold open because like now they’re all going to be dead except for the corrino house guard it won’t make sense to have those sayings continue instead if they would’ve known that they had multiple films locked they could’ve used it as the navigation guild’s language which they’ll need in books 2 and on and which would have been a little confusing to not hear in the first movie but a wild exciting tease for the super fans who see the explanation in captions  
 anya taylor joy is an inspired choice for an adult alia and tells me he’s setting someone up to adapt children or at least leaving it open even if he says he isn’t i’m not sure how they’re going to deal with ages since she’s supposed to be like 21 in that book 
 i’m guessing the vision chani has where paul sees her blistered is of the stone burner in messiah
 really strange coincidence that “usul” means the same thing as “al qaeda” fundamentalism indeed
 i wish some guild representatives had been in this one 
 simply incredible visuals that this movie can look this good and others so bad is amazing 
 strong strong soundtrack 
 zendaya is going to break me in messiah

 reactions specifically to changes
 did not like chani being the only fremen not to believe in the prophesy by the end none of that is in the book i really didn’t like ending it on her if every other fedaykin leaves idk where chani is going jacurutu
 even though i said i don’t like chani being alone to reject paul… on the other hand i loved the visual of chani being the only one not to bow for paul besides irulan it makes clear that paul considers chani his true wife and equal that removes the need for jessica to have the only “history knows us as true wives” speech which would feel a little on the nose and feel like a weird place to end in a movie
 slightly disappointed thufir hawat wasn’t in it and that feyd rautha’s daggers poison wasn’t switched in the gladiator ring hoping an extended edition exists
 did not enjoy bardem’s portrayal as nothing but a zealot i didn’t think it went that far stilgar and paul are supposed to be best friends did not come across at all 
 a little disappointed in the jessica stoking the flames plot but necessary for a sped up timeline and nice to see her take a more active role i guess 
 also slightly disappointed the jamis was my friend scene did not come to pass but explaining the water instead was nice
 it’s too bad chani isn’t related to lietkynes in this but the ages wouldn’t have made sense and i’m happy with the portrayal in the last film
 as a book reader i’m disappointed they didn’t threaten to  all the sandworms with water and instead threaten to nuke the spicefields at least one or two worms would probably survive of course that then requires you to explain the link between spice and the worms more which is too much background since it’s supposed to be this big secret so fine with the change i guess but it’ll always bother me 
 fine with no count fenring 
 i had a strong reaction to the end the first time the down note for chani hurts but it fits the story is a tragedy especially for her
 good choice to remove feydrautha having to cheat in his gladiator match against the undrugged atreides since it makes him seem like more of a threat in the climactic duel 
 big fan of how they portrayed collecting water way better than bloodletting 
 probably for the best that the polygamyagainstawidow’swill plotline was removed 
 loved the explanation of the water of life and loved the scene discovering the nuclear arsenal",2024-03-01 08:06:42
"this is strictly a book detail but in the novel the fremen have actually developed the ability to heal cuts quickly to preserve their bodies water content  a mix of evolution and one of the health benefits of the spice melange this is why book readers were not surprised to see paul survive several cuts at the end 


melaaaannnggggggggggge",2024-03-01 08:44:09
i made the right call watching this on psilocybin mushrooms a titanic biblical psychedelic movie,2024-03-01 08:54:00
that silence by paul at the end there shook the enire theatre amazing scene,2024-03-01 09:41:30
saw it yesterday and it was fkn great best movie ive seen in a long time,2024-03-01 09:56:38
"this is a theater experience ill never forget 

im not as critical to the changes from the book as most people seem to be i love how different this chani is instead of someone just following along i felt that she was a great way to usher in some themes from messiah",2024-03-01 10:21:28
great movie 910 but there were so many scenes where i was wondering why they are not using guns since they arent using shields,2024-03-01 10:29:57
the movie is just so good great overarching story complex characters and the pacing was perfect when they were showing the alien planet abd the battles and everything i was thinking this is what people felt when watching the original star wars excellent job immersing into this world and it felt like you were right there probably helped that i just saw it in 70mm imax lol,2024-03-01 10:38:23
"the feydrautha introduction was perfect from the “there’s another…” moment all the way through the arena scene 

loved the character in the book and felt he was portrayed perfectly an absolute menace",2024-03-01 10:51:37
felt like i was holding my breath jaw dropped the entire 3 hours,2024-03-01 11:05:54
this movie was absolute lava have not been so enthralled by a movie since lotr  it was overwhelming,2024-03-01 11:39:19
"i wasnt impressed with the part i but this one takes the cake we get to see how divided fremen characters themselves  relationships between them are far more complex wasnt fan of the book either this movie provides much needed depth to the story to make it far more engaging

this is clearly labor of love from villeneuve  cast did a great job just missed guild navigators  other weird creatures like spider in the first one",2024-03-01 11:40:48
"saw it at fan preview last sunday 

incredible 1010",2024-03-01 12:26:30
so the water of life is actually the water of corruption right,2024-03-01 14:08:53
i did like the movie 45 on letterboxd i just think unlike the first film where apart from omitting some dialogue and changing liet kynes to a woman it was a pretty straight adaptation this one changed or removed a lot more i love the scene in the arakis ducal palace at the end in the book but so much was removed or changed from that i was left feeling dissatisfied overall,2024-03-01 21:19:54
just got  home from it i was honestly a little surprised that there were only a dozen or two people in the imax screening i went to i know this movie is gonna do extremely well and its probably the greatest scifi movie of all time now but i guess i expected my theatre to be a bit more crowded for opening day,2024-03-02 01:48:20
say jihad you cowards,2024-03-02 04:09:49
that anthropology line about the films and professors was definitely directed towards redditors,2024-03-02 07:47:15
can anyone tell me how many books this movie covered it felt like it was going by at a neck breaking pace,2024-03-02 08:06:01
christopher walken more like christpher kneelin,2024-03-02 08:52:33
i am not the messiah he is the messiah,2024-03-02 09:06:03
what a stunning achievement got serious goosebumps from the sand worm riding sequence  the changes made from the novel were subtle and elevated the material,2024-03-02 13:54:52
feyd holy  the goat the goat the goat,2024-03-02 15:14:39
awesome movie i’m curious how do they get off the sand worms do the worms just come to a stop and let them unload do they just bail off the moving worm into the sand,2024-03-02 16:26:19
two questions why was chani upset with paul and why didn’t anyone have guns in the last battle,2024-03-02 22:57:01
it’s a masterpiece best picture 100 book it all the glaze,2024-03-03 02:49:23
so how do they exactly get off the worms,2024-03-03 04:38:02
i have never read the book but i’m getting the vibe that once he drank the water he saw the possible futures and chose this path bc it’s the path that will lead to chani killing him i could be way off,2024-03-03 05:24:05
lisanalgaib,2024-03-03 06:33:22
amazing movie ,2024-03-03 07:51:58
so how is paul the grandson of the  harkonnen i missed that part audio was a bit muffled it sounded like they were saying rebecca ferguson’s character had a daughter with the  harkonnen,2024-03-03 20:32:01
"so the first movie was very much a faithful retelling of the book


this quickly began diverging from the source material to the point that large plot points are different by the end chani specifically


it almost feels like the evangelion reboot movies by the time were done with part 4 will it be unrecognizable 


and given that i liked most of the changesis it wrong to hope for this",2024-03-03 22:37:07
can someone explain to my why the emperor would come to arrakis himself seems like it was too easy for paul and the fremen to take control and capture him as prisoner,2024-03-04 08:39:43
"i think austin butler was my favorite part about this havent been unimpressed with his acting since yoga hosers lol

glad they didnt backtoback film these because chalamet felt older and more mature because he was paul was much less emotionally restrained in this which was good

surprised they basically cut alia out but i can feel why they did for the sake of pacing and that little nod at the end about her was kind of important because it would be real hard to adapt the later stories without her shes quite an important character

ive always loved the lynch film for its art direction and vision but this is a marked improvement the extended scenes with charlotte rampling were also very welcome to see i can only imagine how much her experience making zardoz must have played into her being a veteran on the set here i feel like villeneuve was actively having her tap into that role

my only wish wouldve been more extended scenes around the galaxy much more geidi prime some more salusa secundus because  that was fascinating and just a bit more of a tour in general of the planeterary societies maybe even a small introduction to some of the other house members

i also feel like the spacing guild was essentially cut from the story as a faction the lynch movie in fact did a better job with them even if the puppets were weird lol he did a great job of illustrating the evolution aspect of spice but you only really see them for a brief moment in the first film and the fact that the galactic space travel economy hinges on this planet is kind of just thrown to the wayside for the messiah story pov

mentat stuff also thrown to the wayside you get thufir in the first film but much like the first movie you dont get much notion that paul is basically the combination of a mentat and bene gesserit

on the much more positive side the tech in both films was superb the ships the weapons the armor its perfect in almost every respect there

good movie i couldve handled another hour on each film that went deeper on the things that this version omitted even a little exposition on how humanity got to where we are now wouldve been great like the narration tv edit of the lynch movie is jank as  but its all pertinent information that immerses you in the world",2024-03-04 18:08:41
how do they get off the worm,2024-03-04 19:44:39
i went into the movie theatres pretty unbiased and found this movie pretty entertaining  especially the sound i just really felt like they filmed 4h worth of content and were forced to cut random scenes to fit the 3h mark,2024-03-04 23:22:43
so all of the movie happened in a few months how does space jesus rise to prominence in that short of time or is this different in books,2024-03-05 10:08:56
"saw the movie and really liked but have a couple questions 

1 there was a lot of mumbling in the movie and i kinda missed the significance of the underground river it’s the moisture of their dead correct and they don’t drink it because it’s sacred i heard stilgar say something abut arrakis turning into a green paradise what does that have to do with the river

2 how did paul even send word to the emperor do the fremen have ships with space traveling capabilities

3 how does paul subjugate the entire universe with just his fremen army the fremen are fierce but how can they win against all the other houses armies",2024-03-05 21:00:48
why didnt the other house blow the ships out of the sky as they left the planet ,2024-03-06 00:06:51
okay i have a question did they change barrons sexuality it seems like they might have the bathtub scene was so quick i can tell if those were women or boys he abused,2024-03-06 04:21:10
so im wondering if this is the first movie appearance that walken doesnt get to inject a little dance maybe his  boy slim video is honorary for this movie instead walken had to be one of those actors that just doesnt blend in in movies anymore he just plays himself  but i thought he was rather good in this he really had the presence of like a roman emperor,2024-03-09 06:53:37
this  was like burning man the movie a bunch of hollywood people in the desert dressed weird as  tripping off drugs,2024-03-10 14:42:24
beautiful movie and great fight scenes for sure plot and characters wise though very mediocre in my opinion still worth seeing for the cinematography alone but im very happy that i chose to read the book first,2024-03-11 04:14:11
sorry for the  question but why are they fighting with swords in this futuristic world,2024-03-11 22:48:56
in the scene after paul first rides the worm my wife was like  i guess zendaya wanted to ride a worm too and i almost choked on my soda because thats usually the kinda joke i would say,2024-03-21 04:34:09
villenueve manages to just  you into the world i have a scientific background and i see things in this film that are contradicted by basic physics yet i feel like im witnessing technology far beyond my comprehension even the psychic visions and hyperbiology just makes me think oh these people just figured something out in 8k years of selection its rare that a film goes beyond inviting me to suspend my disbelief but actually compels me to like some form of hypnosis the only thing that made me aware of the fiction was the fact everyone was mostly speaking english now i know how star wars watchers might have felt,2024-03-24 08:23:25
"while i like the way the character was written i didn’t really love zendaya’s acting for most of the movie she comes off as a little amateurish against the more experienced cast members and sadly it shows she sounds like she’s on a sitcom and not a film

the exception to that notably is near the end when paul announces his marriage to the emperor’s daughter the look of hurt coupled with anger and sadness all swelling to the surface at the same time was heartbreaking and done perfectly",2024-04-10 06:14:17
"my  i just left the theatres utterly speechless i dont want to get too carried away with the praise i give but its definitely up there with the best scifi films i have ever seen in my life and potentially lining up to be as good a trilogy as the lord of the rings i feel like shedding tears it was so beautiful 

i wasnt much of a fan of the first film but once you watch this one youll understand completely they tie in together so fking well the actors nailed it 

masterpiece",2024-03-01 03:36:48
i loved the book when i first read it and loved both movies what really struck me in this movie over the book though was the degradation of the relationship between paul and chani dennis setting up their relationship early on then crashing it down around them struck a cord with me zendaya and chamlet killed it as well excellent film,2024-03-01 13:24:30
this is the best movie ive seen in theaters since rotk holy ,2024-03-02 19:02:21
only criticisms the should have not had feydrautha always cheating in the giedi prime fights it would have made him almost beating paul believable like the guy only had one half fair fight in his life and he almost beats a battle seasoned paul also paul getting stabbed twicei’m pretty vitals places and just being ok other than those things it’s nearly perfect,2024-03-02 19:06:43
loved it a truly epic scifi movie visually stunning i got to see it in 70mm imax at one of only 12 venues in the world to offer it in that format i liked the inversion of the white savior trope i have no real critiques just loved it,2024-03-02 22:39:52
"was not a fan of my theater’s sound anytime a blade would hit another blade or someone’s armor it would make the worst sound visually incredibly impressive great hans zimmer score and i liked some of the plot

however under a lot of stress for my student teaching so never could get fully into the film fell asleep a few times until the blade sound would happen and it would instantly wake me up",2024-03-02 23:28:42
"here is my review of the movie which i thought was a near masterpiece

did anyone feel like princess irulan’s narration scenes were unnecessary",2024-03-03 01:57:55
good visually good sound was completely unengaged with the characters which made the movie not particularly engaging for me,2024-03-03 06:24:16
did we ever see anyone dismount a worm i need those deleted scenes,2024-03-03 06:34:59
this movie was so freaking good like i’m at a loss for words and just in awe i’m so excited but impatient for the next one i know dune is a book series so the ending is out there if i go looking for it and i’m just so hungry for more idk if i’ll be able to wait that long,2024-03-03 08:01:13
"alright seen it twice i liked the first part better strangely i did like the visual and audio design like the turrets on the ornithopters those sounded cool as 

i didnt hate it or dislike it i just feels so indifferent",2024-03-03 15:34:43
"it gets a lot crazier lol

a bene gesserit splinter group eventually appears from deep space with the ability to turn men into slaves with how good their  feels",2024-03-03 16:22:58
why does feyd rautha say “any attention for the pet” about chani at the end idk if i’m reading into it too much but i just don’t understand what he means,2024-03-05 21:00:29
"there is a straight up life of brian scene in this movie

also im not looking to denigrate austin butler by any means but does denis just not know that stellan has a son named bill because thats the only reason i can think of that hes not playing feyd

i knew the pepsi i drank was gonna need to come out at some point and i knew i didnt want to miss the last hour but then the whole harkonnen planet happened and i obviously couldnt leave during any of that so apologies gurney catching up with paul youre the weak link here",2024-03-06 05:55:57
hey wait a minute how the  did gurneys hair grow so fast from part 1,2024-03-07 04:15:33
does the movie offer any explanation as for why jessica and paul are suddenly full in on the prophecy after taking the worm poison if it just the future they see requires them to act a certain way or is it poisoning their mind as well maybe a bit of both pauls switch from i can never fufill the prophecy cause billions will die to i must go all in and even further in taking over the galaxy and becoming emperor over the course of 5 minutes was pretty jarring,2024-03-07 20:16:20
how did rabban character become a  part two but in part one he was a scaryass mf,2024-03-12 00:15:55
ill probably be in the minority  but i didnt think part 2 was nearly as good as the first very disappointing,2024-03-18 04:46:33
zendaya ending was sad why they do her like that,2024-03-01 04:52:41
zimmer is the goat,2024-03-01 06:13:20
im surprised how many people here are saying they love feyds character dude is a pure psychopath,2024-03-03 06:02:04
so is the third movie everyone just dying from radiation poisoning,2024-03-05 18:48:34
paul walked so eren yaeger could run,2024-03-05 21:22:25
"i loved it felt by the end it was incredible and delivered on so many high demand levels but am i the only one who did not find austin butler convincing the affected voice and scene chewing was one of the only things that took me out of it

and i have to admit walken was a distraction
that said greatest cinematic experience since dune part one chalamet is the real deal",2024-03-10 04:17:24
"i am currently tminus 22 minutes away from watching what i presume is going to be the greatest sequel if not one of the most incredible works of art i will ever have seen in my life i will be a different person once this experience is said and done 

i’ll either come out of this with the shortest review my transformed brain can muster or the longest essay i’ve ever written about anything",2024-03-03 16:39:53
"absolutely loved it chalamet’s performance was outstanding bardem and ferguson were aces zendaya just has magnetic chemistry she makes everyone else around her excellent 

i didn’t quite understand why chani is so upset with paul by the end though… what did i miss",2024-03-04 00:10:04
i think i preferred kyle mclachlan over timothee,2024-03-18 02:00:49
such a fantastic movie saw it in a packed imax theater at the sneak preview last weekend can’t wait to go back,2024-03-01 11:56:50
does it stay faithful to the books themes,2024-03-01 12:50:27
in the final assault on arrakis capital are the troops fighting alongside gurny atreides soldier or are they fremen id expect at least a remnant of atreides forces still remains in arrakis not just gurny alone,2024-03-01 20:28:43
what happened to the whole knife prophecy thing from the first movie,2024-03-02 02:23:04
"can anyone familiar with the source material tell me

 other than swords being cool why didnt the harkonnen soldiers use guns except a couple of scenes why would they be charging into melee when they clearly have a lot of guns i mean the air ships are still flying around shooting things

 whats up with personal shields no longer being used the only time you saw it on screen was when he disabled it in the fighting arena the only other relevant shield was when they blew up the one airship then they were casually shooting multiple down later on

 giant laser that can  the spice harvesters why only used against spice harvesters

 how did they suddenly know where the fremen base was did the harkonnen know the whole time if so why had they not already blown it up did they just forget about artillery because theyre  to going into melee to smack things",2024-03-02 21:45:51
love this movie solid 8 maybe 910 for me only things that i wished were a little different wish rabban’s character didn’t crumple so quickly immediately ran away from fremen immediately got punked by feyd rautha and lost to gurney in what i was hoping would be an epic fight i couldn’t unsee christopher walken as christopher walken,2024-03-04 17:35:20
pretty interesting how similar this was to killers of a flower moon you have a native people with a super valuable resource white guy comes in with an older relative looking to exploit the natives and the white guy ends up falling for one of the natives,2024-03-04 23:09:03
"so  paul is a harkonnen 

i kinda missed that part",2024-03-04 23:16:19
nice little detail they used carlo scarpa’s building as a set,2024-03-04 23:36:03
gurney’s revenge on rabban gave me chills,2024-03-05 04:53:08
good lord that was big kylo ren energy in that knife fight at the end,2024-03-07 16:28:54
saw it a second time last night and now i’m wondering did the bene gesserit test paul in the first movie and also feyd to see if he was willing to accomplish a task follow the golden path even if it meant great pain and suffering to him,2024-03-07 20:10:07
i loved the movie the cg was very good overall dune and dune 2 had great setpieces but still also had some of this where its just copypasted infinite hall some shots  scenes were pure sci fi art and could be hung up alongside syd mead or john harris prints some of the character focused ones it was obvious the interior design was clearly blueroom or soundstage or whatever for me specifically the scene where the bene gesserit is rizzing feyd rautha takes place in a hallway that looked like it could be in the phantom menace,2024-03-07 22:22:00
i dont understand what happened to the guys in the very beginning  looked like they were killing each other,2024-03-07 23:07:45
"why did feyd punish the spy shouldnt she be rewarded

what was with the birds the frenmen had",2024-03-08 01:25:58
"so whats the point of the pain test it tests self control i get that in part 1 i assumed it was a test the bene gesserit had to go through like a graduation or something paul is a unique case hes the son of a bene gesserit and has been taught their ways jessica was supposed to have a daughter like all bene genesserit but she thought she could give birth to the one and since they were being moved to planet where a prophecy had been laid down for just such an occasion paul had be tested like the reverend mother said he inherits their power he carries two birthrights

why was feyd tested that woman just slept with him and that seemed to be the entirety of his usefulness",2024-03-08 15:39:30
how do they steer the worms and how do they keep the worms from diving back underground,2024-03-10 03:31:06
why are their eyes only blue sometimes i thought if they were around spice they have blue eyes but i noticed zendayas eyes would sometimes return to brown,2024-03-10 05:40:50
i wonder if well actually get to see some of the holy war in the dune messiah movie or if it will skip over that like in the books,2024-03-10 21:15:18
so are the harkonnens cannibals,2024-03-12 13:27:40
the only thing i disliked was how bautista’s character didn’t get to showcase his abilities bro lost like every single time lol,2024-03-13 01:48:10
  the chani focused endinglast shot kinda threw me off i know its setup messiah but i don’t remember her abandoning paul like that,2024-03-14 21:29:15
this would have worked better as a tv series i don’t want to wait another 34 years for only 3 more hours of the dune story i needed more and was disappointed when it ended also they killed off the young nephew villain too quick would have loved to see more of him,2024-03-15 01:44:56
"isnt bene gesserits plan still working


they get paul to marry the emperors daughter and the holy war is still happening",2024-03-15 21:31:08
i am genuinely blown away by how beautiful the sandworms were and how majestic the scene of riding the sandworm was it was truly incredible especially in imax and i highly recommend watching it in imax its easy to feel that feeling with a dragon or something cool but they did it with a worm that i would otherwise normally be disgusted by,2024-03-15 23:09:39
saw it on dolby and with the rumbling seats i really wonder how much better imax would have been especially with not optimal seat choices,2024-03-17 23:26:19
after watching all of masters of the air i was able to recognize austin butler just from his upper lip ,2024-03-24 00:40:51
i just saw this in an imax theater and the sound was just amazing really everything about this movie was amazing the casting and performances were just solid all around im a fan of the books and it really satisfied me as an adaptation the movie is just so visually amazing that i definitely want to see it in the theater again before it leaves,2024-03-24 07:25:12
"here’s my review as someone who didn’t read the book this movie is loud that imax theater was seriously thumping beautiful movie too 

i like it a lot but the ending seemed a bit rushed to me while i don’t want this ridiculously long movie to be even longer here’s what i thought was left out 1 zendaya rebel attitude towards paul taking power  i wish they fully fleshed that out more they were together and in love and she’s upset he drank the water of life and is blaming his mother but by the end of the movie she feels like a side character getting upset about paul’s decision making didn’t feel like a love story falling apart due to paul’s fate and his ability to see into the future 

2 this ties into number one but paul’s complete abandonment of denying he is the messiah and wishing power didn’t land at his feet yeah i’m understanding the plot that there is a narrow path and he sees every possible outcome but the only time we saw him mentally toil over this is the scene where he’s sitting there saying there is a narrow path all other scenes for the remainder of the movie he is full steam ahead “i am lisan alguiab now” i wish they fleshed out his unwillingness to pursue this but he must so people do not starve to death 

or maybe those don’t happen in the book i didn’t read which would also be bad imo 

anyway awesome movie to see in imax i’m certainly glad i did",2024-03-28 14:41:52
why didnt paul just use the voice on feyd rautha,2024-04-04 02:07:54
people underesatimate gurney but he is the best fighter and would best the fk out of all of em duncan mightve come close,2024-04-06 16:38:18
dune 1 was terrible this was amazing,2024-04-08 04:42:41
nolan cameron spielberg del toro  already four of 21st centurys mostrenowned filmmakers openly given their praises i reckon this puts quite of a pressure on dv for dune messiah,2024-04-08 05:01:35
"we should all aspire to have a hype man like stilgar

i reckon paul could take a  and stilgar would be in the back shouting lisan al gaib",2024-04-08 22:21:34
as soon as 0paul saidi will always love you…i just knew he was going to pull a trifling move,2024-04-10 00:55:14
i loved the part where paul was riding the worm and he said now this is podracing,2024-04-10 02:33:24
did i miss something in dune 1 is there anywhere mentioned that lady jessica was born in the house of harkonen,2024-04-10 03:58:26
well that was pretty boring,2024-04-12 01:15:32
"i have just came out of the double bill in imax this thing is  crazy every shot is stunning

"paul muaddib atreides duke of atreides is a hero

after resenting and fearing power and leadership for most of the film an unwilling paul soon accepts his role in the prophecy after life and fate direct him forcefully 

after accepting this role and drinking the water of life paul is able to “see” into the future he states that enemies are all around and that the path to success is “narrow” we see paul take that narrow path towards the end of the film leading the fremen to successfully overtake the haarkenens and the emperor 

paul was faced with the choice of either freeing the fremen of generational oppression and imminent genocide and exacting revengeregaining honor on those that conspired against the atreides or allowing the fremen to become extinct and thus withering away with them 

further the bene gesserit were weaving another inheritor of the prophecy by setting up feydrautha as a potential candidate instead of paul we’re shown that feydrautha is ruthless powerhungry with 0 resentments towards leadership and just completely evil 

if paul were not to fulfill the prophecy and instead chose to be a pacifist even after lifefate maneuvered the decision towards him the alternative result in feydrautha becoming the mahdi and eventually residing as the emperor would be far more catastrophic for the universe",2024-03-06 21:49:58

visually it was so unique and so much better than the first one

"i caught this in the lincoln square imax and it was an incredible experience i thoroughly enjoyed the movie

however i cant help but think the ending makes no sense and undoes the events of the film

the instant the emperor shows up paul should have just nuked him and the harkonnens the only reason not to do so is because he needed the emperor to legitimize his claim to the throne also why would the emperor even travel to arrakis just to shame the baron seem awfully convenient for pauls sake

however the great houses not recognizing his claim makes no sense by what right would they even refuse it the emperor himself has clearly abdicated

most importantly if the great houses refuse him as emperor then there is no reason for paul to marry florence pugh

also why would the family atomics be on arrakis rather than caladan and why wouldnt paul know this since his father seemingly brought him into war councils where he learned they planned to ally the fremen

and as great as austin butler was i do wonder why not just cast bill skarsgaard",2024-03-07 16:25:06
"did anyone else think it was super corny that chani saved pauls life by putting a tear in the blue water and then putting it on his mouth that was super cringe the only way they could have made it more cringe is if she kissed him back to life im surprised a character off screen didnt say after he came back to life love is the answer  

either have paul drink the blue liquid and be able to survive it on his own or dont have him drink it at all are we supposed to assume that if she hadnt of been there that he would have died right there and then",2024-03-08 08:08:42

this was probably one of my favourite movie going experiences iv ever had i definitely recommend watching part 1 before you go see part 2 even if you’ve seen it recently i feel it’s better enjoyed as a whole rather than two parts the only issue i had was that everything felt a little too easy compared to part 1 the bad guys felt less threatening and things always seemed to go the good guys way bar a few incidents i also feel it could have gone for a little longer as some of the scenes felt cut short or rushed apart from that though it honestly is my favourite movie and iv now started reading the book due to how much i enjoyed it,2024-03-01 04:51:11

one thing i didnt fully understand why was chani so upset with paul she seemed to become extremely angry with him after he drank the water of life and almost died with everything they had already done together fighting against the harkonnens i couldnt really follow the reasoning for her to seemingly flip against paul at that point was it because he was aligning himself with the fundamentalists who she had problems with",2024-03-02 04:57:32

just got back from seeing it it was so good as masterful as part 1 was this was better in almost every conceivable way i think the biggest difference between part 2 and basically every other movie that villeneuve has directed is that all the other movies seemed very distant sure really emotional moments occurred in br2049 arrival prisoners and part 1 but i always felt like i was a distant observer that is absolutely not the case here and it helps make those final scenes absolutely hit hard,2024-03-02 19:59:07

"dune part 2  
a deconstruction of the esthetics of religion and its portrayal

the idea of a messiah the one who  
will come to save us all is a religious idea a romantic one as it encourages  
one to deposit all their doubts and anxieties into a single image that would be  
responsible for consulting all of them this very image is the one that paul  
atreides exhibits being the will of the bene gesserit what matters most  
in the eyes of the fremen although they are unconscious of it is that paul  
looks the part looking the part however is not an entirely visual aesthetic  
problem it is also an aesthetic of character all the details of his  
prophesied arrival played to paul’s character and his ability to adapt to the  
situation he found himself in regardless of the motivations and driving  
factors that may have laid within paul if he looked like the lisan algaib he  
was to be the lisan algaib

the display of perceived aesthetics  
extends itself far into the film and how it chose to portray the world of dune  
the obvious arabian middle eastern influences are worn on its sleeve with  
certain phrases and words being ripped straight out of the arabic language its  
choice to adopt the aesthetic flavor of middle eastern culture aided in  
drawing out its more religious themes without it being shoved down one’s  
throat making it a tad bit more believable that in this entirely fictitious  
world you would find a similar essence that can be found in our reality as  
well

from a simplistic point of view  
the movie could be summed up too “if it looks like the prophecy is coming true  
it might as well be” emphasizing the importance of selfrealization and  
agency the hijacking of personal motivation and beliefs can come before an  
individual as paintings and representations those that just so happen to align  
with narratives that have been laid before them

"as a fan both of frank herberts seminal scifi novel and of denis villeneuves towering first attempt at translating herberts text to the big screen i was eagerly awaiting this film and after having seen it im now fully convinced that i have seen the face of  ironic hyperbole i know especially given the films piercing religious commentary but this is destined to be remembered as one of the greatest cinematic achievements not just of this decade but also of the 21st century we may only be three months into the year thus far but when it comes to 2024 in cinema as far as im concerned this is the one to beat

villeneuve once again not only proves why and how hes one of our finest living filmmakers but also — alongside the extraordinary cast and crew — does considerable justice to the source material hes adapting bringing herberts characters environments and symbolism to life in the most unexpected yet also perfect ways you could possibly imagine this truly is an epic in every meaning of the word from its jawdroppingly grand scale to the explosive performances from such a superbly chosen murderers row of talent costume designer jacqueline west production designer patrice vermette and especially cinematographer greig fraser all do a magnificent job once more of creating a world that stays true to the spirit of herbert while also managing to stand out from other contemporary science fantasy films

while excelling as a sweeping war film packed with exciting action sequences and firstrate visual effects this excels even more as a hauntingly brutal tale of political manipulation religious fanaticism faith corrupted and the battles — both outside and within — between destiny and free will appropriately horrifying in its imagery and implications and rightfully scathing in its bite i have admittedly yet to read dune messiah but if it lives up to the quality of herberts original novel and the hollywood powers that be greenlight a film adaptation of that with villeneuve and company returning then we may very well be in for the best bigbudget blockbuster trilogy since peter jacksons the lord of the rings",2024-03-01 21:44:01
first of all we finally got to see it yayand it was beautiful everything fit so perfectly although i wouldve loved to experience it on imax but i dont have one in my hometown loved the additions to the cast loved the music correct me if im wrong theyve used a lot from the first film right i was surprised to see anya taylor in it more so because we were shown the trailer for mad max before the film and she was being such a badass in it shes having quite the year i must say i dont want to nitpick and acceptlove the film as it is but i just cant with austin butler  why didnt they go for someone with more grit i guess baron and rabban were sooo perfectly cast i can never take this dude seriously ever he took me out of the film sooo many timesi kept thinking about his elvis accent fiasco another thing that bugged me was baron dying that easily i felt like that moment deserved more friction somebody opposing something happening everyone just kinda stood there lastly i thought the emperor looked very plain considering how everyone looked so futuristic and unreal i kind of imagined the emperor wouldve not looked so ordinary thats it im done haha,2024-03-02 04:31:08
"these two movies are cinematic masterpieces literal  for the ears and eyes

the audience in my theatre was laughing at every time stilgar got a  for paul it become a joke the dialogue is awful 

there is zero suspense or drama there was not one single moment where i was worried that the hero on screen would not succeed

dollars to donuts based on that large of a budget that was probably the worst film this year 190 million bones and you get that dialogue the sand people  everyone like they are made of paper and they also have nukes what is even the struggle 

310 all the dune simps will downvote this i dont care 

i havent read the books but a character that scrawny and kicking everyones  is not believable id kick pauls  with a potato masher that last fight scene was so silly his cousin killing two drugged guys and another with assistant was it supposed to be funny because i thought it was hilarious",2024-03-02 06:45:07
usually when me and my dad are coming back from the movies we love to talk about stuff that could have been removed from them to reduce the watching time during the entire 20 min drive we couldnt come up with one scene that can be removed without taking some meaning from this movie you just gotta watch the entire 25 hours thats how you know its truly a perfect movie ,2024-03-02 19:59:29

"can someone tell me about the second worm scene please i missed most of it

this is the one with multiple worms after pauls first worm ride going south i believe

was there a big buildup where we saw lots of people mounting worms with the level of detail in pauls first ride i loved that part very much and im wondering if i missed an epic worm capture

why didnt rabban simply shoot missiles at the seitches is he actually that dumb that he didnt think of it one of the few times in the movie that i was like huh thats a convenient solution,2024-03-07 04:59:38
so i saw the old dune movie from the 80’s… how come they didn’t have the sound guns like they could fire them using the sound of their voice…was that not in the book,2024-03-23 21:33:29
"you are totally right that arwen makes aragorns standard for him  i was not saying she does not do crafting the person i answered however tried to make a rhetoric point that this is the kind of thing arwen likes and there is really no information on that arwen loves aragorn and this is why she makes him  a standard

also as you note too crafting is highly regarded in tolkiens books and there is certainly many highly competent male craftsmen who are also warriors",2024-03-23 22:27:02
 i loved it ,2024-04-08 04:37:58
"just saw it here is my full review i loved some parts and hated a lot of the others


ill start with what i didnt like

even though i liked it this movie was so off compared to the first movie the pacing was all wrong

some elements were really overdone  chani glaring and storming out repeatedly and the overwhelming random violence from the harkonnen neck snapping throat slitting and headbashing it was all a bit cheap and cliche

zendayas pouty face drove me insane

feyd rautha was a bit too moustache twirling his evil so overexaggerated that i didnt feel the portrayal at all  the stare and weird mouth movements made him look like a marilyn manson wannabe and having 3 cannibal brides to boot was just way too much

christopher walken was completely wasted here  you have one of the most talented actors ever and he just walks around looking bored overshadowed by his daughters plotting and screen time when i heard walken was the emperor i was over the moon i thought now theres an actor who can go from menacingly calm to terrifyingly unhinged in an instant but no he just walked around looking vacant with virtually no screen presence

chani and pauls love story didnt convince me at all they went from chani doesnt like this outsider to wow they are so in love to chani is mad because paul is a fanatic who is now marrying this random woman and it all happened with such speed and so little development that i had whiplash watching it

way too many embryo shots we get it shes pregnant

way too much action not enough focus on the chilling suspense and dive into faith and fanaticism that made part 1 a masterpiece the action scenes were also repetitive  how many spice harvesters getting lasered in half do we need to see

sardukar still dont feel menacing like part 1 this supposedly terrifying warrior elite keep getting mown down faster than red shirts in star trek 

speaking of the sardukar no throat singing scene come on villnueve i wanted my  fan service people lost their  over how cool it was in part 1 i at least expected a head nod to it in part 2

the monochrome on geidi prime didnt do it for me i know its meant to be artistic but it didnt look like that in the first film it was too much too exaggerated

how abruptly and pathetically major players died  raban and especially the baron going from full on constant perverted terror to just lying there helpless and getting stabbed didnt like that one bit 

the worms but i hated them in the first movie the worms in dune should have looked like the krayt dragon in the mandalorian

speaking of the worms pauls solo ride was great but how the  did they get a load of people plus the reverend mothers travel box on the back of one im not surprised they didnt even attempt to show it on screen

the whole no one lives in the south and its impenetrable thing they are living in a super advanced future im sure they could at least scan it and see

we didnt get an explanation for the leather spider creature

overall this film felt far less alien than the first

lady jessica looking terrified when paul got stabbed cant she see the future now it would have made more sense if chani looked terrified but jessica looked calm



what i did love

rebecca ferguson everything about her performance blew my mind it helps that she has an intense and fascinating face  but she is a fantastic actress i believed every part of her role and watching her turn from calculating bene gesserit mother into fanatical cult matriarch was just a spectacle she more than anyone else kept me glued to my seat for the entire movie just captivating

paul after he drank the water of life until that point i couldnt tell if timothy chalamet was a cardboard onedimensional actor or if he was just trying way too hard to brood to sell his  appeal but when he went full chaos messiah at the end i felt it and i realised i was way off about his acting ability it made it all the more impactful that he only came to life at that point

paul walking in to stab the baron without anyone even twitching to stop him it really felt like i was watching a prophecy unfold and it was breathtaking to see

the old reverend mother  as i felt myself getting swept up in the prophecy the sudden cuts to her composed logic brought me back down to earth and reminded me that yes these are stories and its fanaticism powerful stuff

all of the scenes involving fremen fading in and out of the sandstorm  visually stunning

speaking of visual stunning that first scene with sardukar all floating up the cliff side against a red sun was probably my favourite visual in the movie after that the movie wasnt as stunning as i had hoped

the scene where chani drained a living sardukar of his water  that was the only scene that made me intensely feel empathy for another human

everything about the fremen and their culture  what an experience it was so fleshed out and there were so many scenes where i just found myself wanting to be there and wishing it was all real

the whole powerful psychic fetus thing thought that was very cool

christopher walken accepting the role and therefore leaning into the meme from his  boy slim music video dance about dune walk without rhythm and it wont attract the worm

the eargasm musical score although it didnt blow my mind like in the first one it was still great


overall not as great as the first movie but a  good watch could have been much better",2024-03-03 20:48:57
i really enjoyed the film denis villeneuve is the mvp but for the life of me i can’t take chalamet seriously it might be his acting or his presence but i can’t unfortunately can’t buy into his paul,2024-03-01 06:30:22
"this movie was 80 great and 20 trash which i think is the appropriate ratio

i was laughing at the movie throughout like i did while seeing the star wars prequels unlike the prequels i took the rest of the movie seriously it’s a healthy balance between cinema and entertainment

did find that it was paced quite quickly which is probably best for a 165 minute movie they pack in a lot but i feel like there was some character development or plot development that could have been added to the middle doesn’t  the movie but sometimes slowing down helps the climax feel even greater",2024-03-07 03:41:34
"i i honestly thought this wasnt very good very boring and serious step down from the first one

i just do not understand the praise its getting especially in regards to characters all 5 minutes of screen time characters like fayd got were fine to alright i guess 

the pacing was frankly atrocious and the whole going native the spent the first 40 something minutes on were mind numbingly boring and i have seen done much much better in many other movies",2024-03-07 19:30:53
"its been mentioned that this could become the greatest trilogy of all time up there or even surpassing the good star wars films and lotr 

obviously theres no third film yet but do you think thats a fair assumption

"movie of the year contender  
scifi of the decade contender",2024-03-01 05:19:09
slightly better than part one but still boring don’t really think it’s all that visually impressive although the sequences that were in black and white stood out a bit more the biggest problem i have with it honestly is i just don’t care about the characters or the outcome of the story a good chunk of the movie was just groups of people walking through a desert and it got tedious and dull some of the music and performances were fine but the way this ends means they’ll probably be a third one 510,2024-03-02 18:10:36
"i truly hope the ending twist to part two is zendaya being eaten by the worm her acting was awful

ps make sure you watch it in a dolby theater the shaking is amazing",2024-03-03 02:33:30
"really disliked it

first off everyone is saying how beautiful it is even the people that dislike it but i just find the colour grading so  and dull the first one was even worse so they made it a little less  at least i enjoy the cinematography framing etc but idk why you would choose to make your colour scheme so lifeless

everyone is liking the soundtrack i really dislike it not memorable and just irritating 

i didnt enjoy acting from most people chalamet is wooden and lifeless zendaya seems like shes acting they have absolutely no chemistry with eachother

i enjoyed butler and skarsgard a lot but their characters werent given much to do very anticlimactic characters


the characters are so one dimensional and have no charm theres no character moments theres no chemistry
i dont enjoy watching any of the characters apart from the villains how have i watched 6 hours of this series and not give a single  about a single character


the story is uninteresting mainly because i dont give a  about the characters

the editing was terrible felt like i was watching a music video at times

why was there no blood at all made it feel so childish people getting their neck slit and theres no blood just looked so 

that ending felt so rushed the final fight was so meh and underwhelming like they havent even shown butler to be an amazing fighter he killed one guy fairly while the rest were drugged and injured but he had great screen presence and they have this anticlimactic end to the character both cool villains killed off in uninteresting ways


i think both villanueve and nolan have made me realise that i value character more than anything so i never enjoy their movies because they care more about making set pieces i need character moments people to care about enjoyable dialogue this had none of that


idk villanueve just seems to make such heartless soulless movies that have good cinematography


310 for my enjoyment of that",2024-03-10 18:36:47
really disappointed the series is ruined by the male lead,2024-03-01 04:42:57
it was as overrated as the first meh,2024-03-02 07:20:25
"the story is as rich as the visuals are stunning 

the weighty religious and political themes as a backdrop to the heroes journey makes it so much more interesting than most of the material that dune has inspired over the decades seeing pauls risedescent as he builds more influence throughout the runtime is fascinating as you see his actions take him one step closer towards the holy war that he so desperately wanted to avoid in the first couple acts",2024-03-01 04:01:08

"for my part if its the only film i see in 2024 whether on a big screen or not im a satisfied man
amazing",2024-03-01 04:39:36
"can someone please explain how it is possible for the desert people to have something as hightech as the black device that they stick into the ground what exactly does it to and where are they getting them from is the reason why they always stick them in the ground to create some sort of noise vibration that the worms dont like and therefore keep them away 

are they taking them from the soldiers they  it seems that the soldiers such as the ones from the start of the movie would have the devices on them as they seem to be far more advanced then the desert people plus they dont have any production facilities for guns etc

not once did i see the black device they stick into the ground help them out in any way its not like they needed them to see a giant worm in he distance to hitch a ride on if anything they just punch the sand to sense if any worms are nearby thus making the black devices that they stick into the sand completly pointless",2024-03-08 15:59:49
"a few cool dark harkonnen moments and some good costumes but otherwise  that was a terrible movie

the dialogue and acting were cringe and legitimately poor this was the worst part of the movie

the continuity of the story was so bad “here’s a scene now here’s another scene relationship between them ah well some people have read the book so they’ll piece it together but hey looks cool right you’ll figure it out one of these days”",2024-03-01 13:52:41
"ok so how do they get off the worms


how did they take the emperor so easily


why do they fight with swords when theyre 8000 years in the future


whats the point of wearing armour if one slice from a knife kills you


enjoyed the movie overall but some of the logic made me scratch my head",2024-03-02 14:19:43
there were some beautiful shots but the story and characters just werent interesting for some reason big fan of villenueve but feel like he is getting worse,2024-03-10 14:01:45
"part two was a miss for me i liked part one much better it was a more patient contemplative film that gave its viewers more time to digest its feast for the senses and complex plot lines part one was brooding and suspenseful with interludes of psychedelic seance that combined with the brilliant sound editing created a mystical aura that was absolutely captivating for a major motion picture of its production quality i never felt nearly the same sense of immersion in part two it felt rushed disjointed and lacking in buildup twice the  and half the foreplay it didnt get me sufficiently aroused and as a result i felt unfulfilled with the climax

i believe the director wished he could have made this a trilogy with the same exposition and pacing as the first film but the execs demanded a faster paced dumbeddown movie to appease the masses who generally prefer a purely visceral experience to get off and go home without being challenged mentally or spiritually very sad because as a trilogy in step with the first film this would be a landmark in cinema that would only grow in popularity over time 

part two is an unfortunate product of hollywood forsaking art for the almighty dollar they sold out to the mainstream complaints about part one pandering to dolts with the attention span of a toddler to sell more tickets this is why we cant have anything good anymore",2024-03-17 21:58:00
found it boring tbh there was no intrigue javier bardem character said they same thing over and over christopher walken went real christopher walken why did bautista give up so easy  fight scenes were not enough to make up for almost 3 hrs of nothing ,2024-03-04 23:16:43
tear me apart normies but as a huge fan of part 1 i found this to be the total marvelfication of what was so great about the first bloated no patience practically threw any of part 1’s transcendental style pace and atmosphere out the window in favor of what basically are super hero antics i love most of the moments people are raving about but i think if you enjoyed the merging of art film aesthetics with blockbuster budgets of part 1 that was more akin to blade runner 2024 then part 2 feels like the same old fluff would have liked it more as miniseries,2024-03-06 10:03:04
yeah this movie was ridiculous unlike anything ive experienced in a theatre before i really like how grand this feels compared to the first one there are some minor cheesy blockbuster things that make me wary of rating this 1010 but it might still make it in time,2024-03-01 04:46:26
"no no no no no no no no no  this movie was almost perfect right up to the end when chani gets mad that paul is going to marry irulan  chani in the book knew something like that was going to happen  jessicas relationship with leto was the foreshadowing for this  and the  it up

1010 outside of that one thing it was brilliant",2024-03-01 05:55:09

910 until the end then 410",2024-03-03 19:18:45
"the best part of this movies is the cinematography it looks very good and believable making the world and fight scenes genuinely exciting

everything else is meh it still feels like exposition to something bigger and most of the characters and relationships feel flat the older actors were good but the younger ones felt weird

after 2 years and almost 6 hours i feel like i didnt really get something

half of the movie is paul not wanting to be the messiah and in the middle after 5 minutes he quickly changes his mind and starts blasting

also i still cant get over the fact the emperor came to the planet himself and not summoned the barons to himmeet at the moon or somthing and that somehow some sand warriors with swords damaged the strongest army in the universe feels like plot decided to let him fall hostage to paul

overall 610 will still probaly watch the next one",2024-03-03 23:24:31

"i wonder if the people in the comments are being paid bots or are 12 the movie is like a b movie with a big budget thats it there are so many plot holes and transitions that justt dont make sense 
here are some points  


 no character development or back story on who the freeman characters are we still dont know zendaya character who is she how did she end up fighthing where are her parents something 


 why did zendayas friend died what was the reason and again who us this girl 


 how to they put a whole tribe on top of a sandworm how do they jump out of it how nosense 


 why did paul went from wanting to free the freeman to become the emperor and start a war because the blue water showed him it was the only way dumb af he could do so many different things no logic 


the script was either written by ai or by someone writing for greys anatomy because they all seem to not be in character for the most part of the movie and when they do its weird 


terrible what a  happened ",2024-03-08 05:41:28

i realized here that austin butler using something similar to his elvis voice shouldve played paul then his charisma might be a tad believable and anvilfaced timothee could have been perfect for the creepy unnatural feydrautha but i guess direction is a far more serious issue than the casting several fine actors here but nobody is allowed to give an interesting or heartfelt performance its all as dry as the desert which is similarly boring to look at fraser and villenueve love jerking off over scale and thats about it theres hardly anything remarkable to admire or think about only the harkonnen planet tickled me slightly but for the most part this was a waste of 160 minutes similar to the first dunc,2024-03-01 17:31:19
"this movie is everything that is wrong with how hollywood big films go right now

lets see i am not a long time fan of the books i just read the first one a couple years ago because its a classic i liked it it was a small book easy to  read really humble in its style but with a lot of interesting themes touched in a really good way 

thus said this movie makes me sad of thinking the absurd escale of production expenses they should have done to shot it the movie looks beautiful the photography is pretty standard but really well talen care off no shots will blow your mind or you will remember then but they are good screensavers

but all of that is to cover an empty shell the movie not only again decides to not adapt important parts of the book they decide to dumb down all the themes they touch that appear in the book that are not every theme they totally make the religious people dumb fanatics instead of victims of the bene gesserith and the bene gesserith instead of kinda sect of nazis are just powerful woman controlling everything this kinda desvirtuates imo the themes of the book and also it ignores all the ecology themes

the movie in itself it doesnt do anything above average villeneuve can do way better things and the slow moving camera pans the landscape shots are really boring when there is no meaning behind and you abuse them the movie does nothing special not memorable the worst part is the transitions that seem rushed sometimes and most are extremely abrupt they didnt even tried to make the movie flow

most people i watched both movies with they barely understand the minimum of the plot even though wveryone said it was cool or ok they dont see a reason as to why spend 6 hours watching it again and are totally uninterested in a third movie

this is because this movie is victim of hollywood new vices movies have to be an spectacular event so they just created a crazy budget and they tried to make everything grand and apotheosic on screen to look expensive and also a cast full of tons of well known celebrities offcourse the movie has to be long so its worth your money huh and two parts because that means twice as money offcourse the specialized magazines will need to make audience react about this big event to get better seo and more audience so they will say that the movie is crazy good even saying is the new lotrlmao 

then you get there and is just an expensive souless movie what it really baffles me is that both movies like they are you can fit them in one 3 hours movieeasily and it will be better

one of the best things of the book is how it is concise not too long it has a couple scenarios and it always has a reasonable scale idk why the movie had to be long grand tons of scenarios 

enjoyed it yes i enjoyed to see millions on screen was it a superb movie or something i will remember not at all",2024-03-03 03:41:33
too long……………,2024-03-03 03:43:49
it was very very good and obviously they had to cut stuff out to squeeze it into a three hour run time but it was a war crime to not include thufir and i cant help but feel that they had to entirely rewrite chanis character to conform with zendayas grumpy  persona without leto iis death or even existence pauls shift to instantly being pro genocide seems really random,2024-03-04 02:26:52
"

dune like most scifi combat gets ruined as soon as you apply any kind of combat logic to it  
  
dune isnt even selfconsistent  sometimes the blade from duncan idaho travels really fast and kills people through shields sometimes feydrauthas opponent had his blade slowed down a lot by the shield  
  
dune 2 was especially problematic as people on the sand cant have shields and they were getting sniped by laser rifles and large masses of troops were getting blasted with autocanons from the air  if thats the case all thats needed to defeat the fremen meat wave zerg rushes is more autocannon turrets or even a ww1 maxim machine gun  
  
lets ignore the lack of shields on the sand and assume everyone has energy shields and the equivalent of medieval shields  and the energy shields permit human max sword speeds  if thats the case youd just resort to large vehicles with mechanical grinders in the front like a farm tractor and youd just tear through the meat waves  you can also use slow mechanical pincers that crush and slice people",2024-03-06 00:23:05

out of almost 3 hours 1 full hour is a scene of this girl who looks like she is ai generated  while looking at camera or somewhere randomly 

also story went really  main guy was strugling whole movie and at the end all changed he became most loved and defeted enemies who were presented as a rough very dangerous strong etc in 2 minutes of action like super easy of course he also killed that guy in 1 on 1 was there any doubt and how he did it in a most  way  by putting whole sword in his chest so he gets closer hahahahah
of course what is a sword in chest for our hero for him that is like a mosquito bite

"im finding it difficult to believe how wellreviewed this film is

the changes to the storyline arent just ones necessary because of the nature of adaptations or because of practical limits on the filmmaker

they leave in developments while completely removing the context that made them notable and meaningful destroyed entirely the political manipulation had characters explicitly announcing their motivations you cant just have character say how they feel  that makes me feel angry  the robot devil futurama and turned major plot points into meaningless incoherent nonsense

consider the nature of the leverage paul brought the fremen  in the novel he realized that the transformed water of life would be a catalytic poison to the sandworm ecology and would annihilate all the sandworms if introduced in the right place  which requires reverend mothers with the ability to transform the water in full knowledge that theyd be destroying the spice which given the consequences was something only the fremen would possibly be willing to do  this keeps the other houses from invading arrakis

in this movie the fremen threaten to nuke the spicefields which any one of the great houses could do and most of the leaders of those houses wouldnt be addicted to the spice and likely wouldnt realize the consequences on the galaxy if theyd done it  whats more the film has the orbiting forces not recognize pauls leadership when the entire point of threatening the spice was to force the spacing guild and bene gesserit to force the galaxy to accept the fremen since they are absolutely dependent on the substance

even little details like the baron summoning all the great houses by claiming the saudarkar had invaded and the emperor coming alone instead of at the head of an invasion force made an utter mockery of the politics of the novel

thats saying nothing of the excessive chiaroscuro which was seemingly designed to conceal the sets as much as possible

up to now denis villeneuve was one of my favorite directors  im going to be thinking long and hard before seeing another of his films  thats how objectionable i find what he did in the second segment of this story",2024-03-06 18:09:53
"the television miniseries of frank herberts dune and frank herberts children of dune are despite their very real flaws much better reflections of frank herberts work than this second film is

i had high hopes after seeing the first film and they have not only not been fulfilled but betrayed  villeneuve went far beyond adapting the novels to the silver screen but merely kept some of the events of the books without reflecting why they occurred or what they meant  i am reminded of the lotr movies in which the first was a good adaptation of the book it corresponded with and the latter ones increasingly failed to understand the themes and motifs of the works they were supposedly adapted from",2024-03-06 19:41:31

010  no static lightning storms w multiple huge sandworms moving together i always thought it would not just be visually striking esp in dv film but add a bit of cool science fiction nerdiness to anytime they were on screen very disappointed it wasn’t a visual signature of the sandworms in this sequel where they’re heavily featured compared to part 1,2024-03-01 19:02:50
i thought the americanised additions to the script were irritating and chalet increasingly looked like a vacant model boy the rushed ending and naff knife fight topped it off such a shame   i loved the book and enjoyed the first film,2024-03-01 19:36:42
i know a lot of inspiration was drawn from the middle east but i wish they didn’t mimic how muslims pray so closely it felt disrespectful,2024-03-02 13:19:11
i did not enjoy the movie i am so disappointed the visuals were unmatched looked perfect with a few exceptions but what they did to the story was so disappointing chani is not chani lady jessica is not lady jessica it is visually stunning but it is not dune how did he absolutely crush the first one and then totally fumble the bag,2024-03-01 16:38:48

20 minutes of weirdness and good scenes doesn’t make up for 2hr 20mins of incompetent editing  cinematography and seemingly nonexistent blocking and framing let’s not kid ourselves just because it is better than other big budget movies c’mon now this and poor things being so beloved genuinely makes me think modern audiences should be required to watch at least 25 movies pre1980 so they can understand what good filmmaking is because if this is what is considered great cinema is dead,2024-03-04 03:32:40
"love this movie i can go on and on about the cinematic wonder it was as a book fan i dont care that much they didnt adapt all the elements i think it could have been 10 mins longer with a bit more on the political dramagreat houses and the spacing guild but i get it how many things can you focus on

the only gripe i really have with this movie and the world building  the sword fighting makes no sense i get the shields they can be a danger around worms i can even fill in the gaps from the books regarding the laser gunsshield issue but why the  arent all sardukar and even the harkonens using bullet guns on arrakis we even see how effective regular guns are when they use them to  the fremen in the first half but they are still using swords like in the final battle charge why didnt both sides come with guns why did the harkonen soldiers even walk with  sword when they obviously have regular weapons 

i love this movie and its honestly a sci fi masterpiece but man you cant have these powerful military forces that rule the entire universe but they cant even think about basic tactics",2024-03-01 08:02:17

chani getting the closing shot instead of paul is laughable denis doesn’t understand what a heroes journey is paul is the star it’s his story it’s his movie chani is barely in the books she doesn’t deserve to be on the posters opposite paul i just don’t get it,2024-03-04 04:17:45
"im not a fan of dune so im prepared for all the downvotes i dont care i gave it a chance again

this is what i wrote about dune part one this movie is so boring nothing happens its all a set up for part two it ends just when its getting good its a 3hour incomplete movie theres nothing satisfying about it

fast forward three years later and we finally get part two what a  snooze fest there are way too many characters introduced and so much extraneous information going on i had to go on wikipedia afterwards just for clarification the most thrilling part of the movie was the sandworm riding and a whole lot of nothing happens then all of a sudden stellan skarsgård dave bautista and austin butler i cant remember their character names all die in a row suddenly paul has become kind of an  now basically taking control into his own hands when he told the princess he was going to marry her i heard a woman behind me audibly gasp and then it ends on a similarly disappointing note with chani  at him and yet another unsatisfying cliffhanger ending

i really cant do it anymore doesnt seem like dune messiah is in any hurry to be made either i should have learned my lesson with the 1984 film way back when i love scifi but for whatever reason this series is not for me",2024-03-05 15:00:24
what a  movie,2024-03-06 23:02:14
"lets start off with the positives truly amazing cinematography and the highest production values on the big screen so far this year honestly the visuals were incredible no complaints in that aspect  
  
now for the negatives i heavily disliked the blatant white saviour trope with all of the side characters being middle easternblack and so easily misled into following a couple of whites it felt soooooooooo condescending and patronizing  
  
i think one can also draw political parallels to what is going on in the real world since much of this films plotline mirrors the israelihamas conflict with the gazans being freman and the israelis being the emperorharkonnens not neccessarily a good or bad thing just an interesting observation  
  
overall dune part two 2024 rating 710 i saw this for free with my accumulated admission points at my local cinema definitely worth a watch in theaters just for the spectacle alone but dont expect the usual white saviour trope to be subverted in this film",2024-03-10 21:00:17
man these are the best boring movies ever  im still  theres going to be a part iii  i just want something to end already,2024-03-04 03:54:08
"there’s a lot i liked about this film and some stuff i didn’t many people can summarize those much more eloquently than i can 

i saw the first film again in imax quite recently and thought this one’s extensive use of the format helped with the scale but i still feel like the grasp they have on using it is less than stellar some scenes that should’ve been in 143 the missiles the knife fight weren’t the scenes of the two of them in the tent felt awkwardly framed and shot and lacked energy it felt like the filmmakers are not super comfortable with leveraging the large scale format or are still learning i’m sure if we get messiah it’ll be even better

it’s an unfair comparison but i also saw tenet again in imax and nolan’s handling of it as a storytelling medium is second to none there’s a brief shot of debecki whose performance i didn’t particularly care for on the boat and the expressiveness and emotion was really striking i didn’t find anything like that in this film ",2024-03-04 00:04:53
"i just saw it my third time and it needs to be discussed

when jessica drinks the water of life and tells paul he will eventually have to too thats 100 not timothee chalamet shes talking to

thats very clearly his stunt double and i gotta know how that ended up in the film",2024-03-09 07:24:59
the music was beautiful the scene introducing austin butler’s character was so intense and freaky but his character didn’t really go anywhere plus his accent was all over the place the costumes were also really off for me it was so hard to take paul seriously in his baggy pants with the cup lol,2024-03-10 13:06:59
movie was garbage when it came out still gonna be garbage with different actors,2024-03-01 16:11:32
can we get a new thing and not the love of someone brings back someone and then they are the one sand neo movie was good but this tired trope took me out of it and if the book had it and wasnt tired at the time narrative things from the book were changed so thats a bad excuse and just feels like lazy writing in an other wise well written movie,2024-03-04 20:40:10
"i feel like i must watched a different movie to everyone else

i didnt get much chemistry from paul and chani and didnt really buy  the romance also where were the stakes here paul won every battle and even when  the harkonnen blew up their base it didnt effect the frenen or paul at all not even a life changing injury to a main character

plus i was hoping for the big show down between rabban and hurney but it lasted like 10 seconds 

it wasnt a bad movie but i think if this was 2 12030 min movies it could have been paced a bit slower and allowed more character development maybe this whole thing would have been better as an 12 episode epic mini serie

maybe after i rewatch it i will appreciate it more idk",2024-03-07 02:54:09

this movie does a better job of mitigating the atrocious whisper brooding of chalamet during dune 1 but the guys is severely lacking in juice until he becomes space jesus,2024-03-03 20:39:35
as much as i liked this movie and the first one its too self indulgent and too long when put together and i dont think they need to be as long as they are especially as i dont think character development is that good past paul david lynchs dune has better character developments and individuality in the characters for nearly 6 hours of movies i dont think it delivers nearly as well as it should,2024-03-07 20:20:07

holy  part one was bad so maybe i thought this would be better and it wasn’t wasted 6 hours of my time on a terrible  knock off star wars,2024-03-08 03:47:35
"ugh i got dragged to this movie last night blind i haven’t seen the first dune but my friend invited me to the movies last night i like scifi and fantasy so i figured how hard could it be to follow he always drags me to marvel movies as well and i actually ended up liking the avengers and thor 

so i sit down expecting this to be a standard 1 hour 40 minute movie 

first thing i see is the poster children of gen z kylie jenners boyfriend aka  wonka and rue from euphoria spoiler i don’t like either of them 

how distracting they had those airpods in their nose airpods go in your ears genz not your nose 

anyway i hate worms in any form and  i was heavily confused by that scene because i thought he was riding a sand storm when i found out it was a giant worm i was disgusted 

so i decided to check the runtime because i didn’t really understand why it was cool that everyone was just getting blue eyes or talking in monotone voices 

also them dancing in the sand like a musicaless musical pretty much lost me 

clearly everyone was very important and dark and interesting but i’ve never been to a movie i couldn’t just figure out starting in the middle of the series tropes are all the same they rarely change as long as you pay attention you can normally figure out the plot

when i found out this movie was going to be as long as lord of the freaking rings i was done the only movies that need to be that long are literally lord of the rings 

which i watch 2 or 3 times a year 

so anyway i decided to sleep for a bit to get through the movie because of course we went to the cheap theater this time with the uncomfortable chairs for a 3 hour movie i had great dreams though",2024-03-31 14:04:18

"has anyone brought up the way women in power are betrayed as evil manipulative witches and that men are the pure rightwrong devine fighter for freedom

i can unsee the fact that the benij jesturt are in the shadows mixing bloodlines and in the end holding onto power at all costs and seeding the next generation with the same dna as past generations and are always present when a change of power so they can tweak it to their preferred outcome

i presume the books are like that because it was a time and a genre that devalued and misogynist view women in power but i fear that women will gloss over this part of the movie to fawn over the marketing hype and cinematography

i was not impressed with the portrayal of women in the movie in the end the only women not in power had to leave on a worm to escape the killing of pauls followers",2024-03-04 00:07:12

"one on hand this movie is a visual triumph and it’s hard to fault it on anything visual except for a few shots that were probably had a little too much digital noise for sure some nonnative iso going on at a couple moments 

overall it just felt like an episode of really high budget tv show nothing really gets resolved one conflict is exchanged for another the story continues forever and never ends i hate how movies have become tv and vice versa

i honestly think i might be done with this franchise i really felt like this movie should have been 2 hours flat run time was egregious for how little happened checked my watch so many times i lost count",2024-03-02 02:53:45
worm riding is just too silly and doesnt fit tonally with the movie i dont know how these huge perma aggressive  worms all of a sudden just stay at the surface at a constant speed also how does a pregnant woman mount and dismount such a thing it makes less sense the more you try to think about it,2024-03-03 15:04:40

it was an great experience for part one   we went and saw jurassic world dominion in 4dx and it was a  miserable experience movie and the features

so going into part two we all decided to take a chance and go with 4dx again and it was another amazing experience

the ride features are subtle enough to not overpower what you are experiencing until it was 

one great experience was the very beginning when the dudes got sniped in the head by the freyman  air was blasted into the back of your ears and head where ever the dudes got hit with bullets  

another was when paul was finally riding the grandfather worm it was just a rollercoaster of air smells and movement

but there was a few moments it was like ok wow this is ridculous   haha   when the freyman attacked the spice production area at the end and all those boulders came down  it was like 2 minutes of bouncing  it was a great but also bad experience  lol

i highly recommend watching this movie in 4dx if you can

followed up by that awesome shot of him walking through the crowd of fremen ,2024-03-02 00:12:30
hans zimmer just know how to   it with the score dude was perfect for this kinda movie,2024-03-03 01:09:35
hans was on one absolutely cooked,2024-03-03 05:27:28

know the name of that score,2024-03-03 00:22:19
they probably cut a big a lot of material which we will never see as there are no other cuts besides the movie villeneuve presents,2024-03-03 00:47:15
the additional black really made him look so much cooler,2024-03-03 22:21:00
"i saw it twice already and had briefly forgotten that scene which made it even more amazing when i got surprised a 2nd time

ayo imma go left,2024-03-06 07:33:42
i keep thinking about this shot how beautiful it is how it looks like literal concept art in motion the dark cool tones the slower motion of the worm indicating its distance away and scale just gorgeous,2024-03-16 00:56:56
i read this as “ it get me hard” and i was like me too dude me too,2024-03-10 12:21:02
been trying to find that clip online cause its stuck my head but no luck yet,2024-03-11 16:43:47
"holy crp i just came to redit to try to understand this exact scene because of the worm behind paul and the this is the first comment i step upon wow talking about coincidence

anyway does anyone understood what did represent the sandworm behind paul was he walking normally in the sand without the wormdance with the worm just chillin behind him as his kin or something",2024-04-06 20:32:15

imma start telling my homies if they don’t say lisan al gaib after everything i do i’m going to be stay home and be lonely,2024-03-11 03:18:58
it was long live the warriors for me wouldnt be surprised if that makes its way into all the helldivers memes,2024-03-02 23:05:41
as it was written,2024-03-20 03:15:14
lisan al gaib,2024-03-21 03:00:34
lisan al gaib is now my all time favourite quote,2024-03-23 22:25:55
i should reqtch it and do this,2024-03-04 09:33:54
be careful if you live in western europe you might attract a lot of racist hate by doing this,2024-03-02 06:12:01
when she said we must convert the weak and vulnerable i was like oh this mf is sinister,2024-03-01 08:45:33
those piercing spice eyes from her  markings tattooed face was scary as ,2024-03-01 05:27:48
"i love her lady macbeth esk scheming to rile up the fanatics with  fetus alia lol

her final line was so chilling too",2024-03-01 08:21:59
man she became terrifying the way shes constantly mumbling and talking to her daughter too,2024-03-01 20:25:14
"id be bonkers if my baby started talking to me too 
book accurate",2024-03-01 06:13:25
honestly she was probably the scariest character in the movie you saw radicalization of the locals every step of the way so seeing her bedecked in jewels and tattoos in her next scene just felt right and also wrong,2024-03-04 17:55:45
i can fix her,2024-03-03 16:01:50
thats what happens when you drink the blueberry cool aid,2024-03-03 05:28:48
i liked that turn for her character so so so much more than in the book,2024-03-03 04:12:21
she spends 90 of the first movie looking like shes about to break down crying at a moments notice and its not until she gets one over on stilgar that she shows her strength and it seems that just escalated,2024-03-05 02:41:30
what’s funny is she was following paul’s original strategy we must win the unbelievers but paul changed his tune after actually becoming one of the fremen,2024-03-05 16:51:01
rebecca ferguson is the real deal,2024-03-06 03:56:40
she was the best part of the film i thought  loved how they just totally went for it with the craziness and pulled it off,2024-03-04 13:47:41
crazy just wait till you see messiah she is a reverend mother now not crazy,2024-03-06 16:01:41
she was always a bit twitchy i thought it was to highlight the contrast when she became the serene allknowing reverend mother but it went the other direction,2024-03-10 15:51:53
so did javier bardem me and my wife were laughing at some of the scenes where he was basically like i told you he was the one reminded me of morpheus in the matrix not that i didnt like any of those moments because he was ultimately right,2024-03-21 04:30:44
the way she slowly turns into the reverend mother in both title and personality was very well done  one of several examples of parallel storytelling between both parts what cemented it for me was her casually using the voice to order someone around when she arrives in the south these people would obey her regardless she didnt need to literally command them but she does it anyway,2024-03-24 17:50:06
now it makes sense why she was freaking out in every other scene in part 1 she knew this would happen,2024-03-06 05:16:19
that final shot of her explaining the beginning of the war will live in my head rentfree forever i didnt expect this to be as haunting as it was im a bit  up over here,2024-03-20 01:16:51
i thought she was going jack torrance,2024-03-21 04:49:46

when paul was killing the baron he looked like he was about to  butler crushed that role ,2024-03-01 18:15:46
one of my favourite things about the movie is that feyd is frankly a way cooler character than he is in the book i dont often see a movie tone up rather than town down a character,2024-03-10 07:08:38
feyd  look cousin how about we put aside our differences and talk about this galactic jihad idea  i really like killing people and have zero morals otherwise and i think id be a great fit in your organization,2024-03-07 07:47:57
reminded me of aemond targaryen doing the same thing at daemon in house of the dragon,2024-03-03 05:03:01
i really need everyone saying butler has no range or that hes wooden or whatever to just  because the man can very clearly run through three or four very distinct emotions in one shot with no spoken dialogueunder blinding lights and baking in makeup that obscures most of his  musculature,2024-03-12 03:52:38
he was even impressed when he was killed by paul like  way to stay in character,2024-03-14 06:12:12
they really missed out not playing up the homoeroticism more,2024-03-09 08:05:17
it’s incredibly weird but i kind of got aroused by his arousal as in the fact that he seemed  about paul’s power made me feel a bit aroused too i left the cinema contemplating quite a few new things about myself tbh,2024-03-23 23:03:04
legit made me jump,2024-03-03 12:56:15
“will you hurry up i’m still bleeding over here”,2024-03-05 17:20:04
so was the slap from chaney when paul woke up from the worm ,2024-03-06 16:18:44
 i really wanted him to use the voice and make him kneel but leave the ring kissing be his own decision,2024-03-07 09:14:55
legit even louder in imax,2024-03-03 17:19:18
come here worm,2024-03-06 02:56:45
mirroring stomping the sand to call and control a sandworm,2024-03-06 13:51:29
 boss move,2024-03-06 21:41:01
reminded me of a hoof stomp like a bull harkonnen,2024-03-14 02:43:14
loved that,2024-03-07 11:49:27
the sound techs should win a grammy and an ocscar for their work the sound engineering that went into that scene felt like what we were to really understand what the voice felt like,2024-04-01 00:54:15
666999,2024-03-17 20:44:31
i laughed ,2024-04-11 14:28:40
i actually didnt like this idea came off as petulant paul would have seemed more commanding and impressive if he was just obeyed immediately without a fuss,2024-03-04 00:39:03
how do they get off the worms once their ride is done,2024-03-03 01:25:03
for me its lea seydoux one of most seductive actresses ive ever seen,2024-03-01 13:02:49
avenge father’s death or marry the emperor’s daughter marriage it is,2024-03-01 04:00:21
for a very short role i was surprised how much she brought to the table she’s going to be one of the all time great actresses for sure,2024-03-01 07:25:25
watched it in an immersive imax i havent had a film experience like that in 10 years lol my whole body felt every worm scene it was the most beautiful film ive seen on a huge screen in forever i hope everyone gets to see it in theaters while its there,2024-03-02 13:38:06
cant believe how much the entire theater was shaking when paul was riding that worm i had goosebumps,2024-03-02 20:08:41
i mean this with all sincerity but ive never been so attracted to someones eyebrows,2024-03-01 17:37:39
 villenueve could have done that scene a thousand ways and he went with pov youre riding the sandworm and pulled it off ,2024-03-04 01:01:31
between this and oppenheimer she has about 10 total minutes of screen time out of 6 hours but she just takes over no matter who is across from her her presence is crazy,2024-03-04 04:33:04
florence was brilliant here,2024-03-02 09:44:15
i thought it was pretty cool to see them capture and ride the worms but how did they ever get off they never show them being done riding the worm and im guessing for good reason,2024-03-03 08:38:25
yes mommy pugh ill do as you say shes so pretty,2024-03-04 04:10:40
loved their schemaghs whipping behind them as they rode,2024-03-02 20:45:51
ok but how do they get off the worms,2024-03-04 03:37:28
i want florence pugh to order me around,2024-03-04 07:29:02
for me it’s souhelia yacoub ,2024-03-03 05:37:53
weirdly the second movie this year in which florence pugh will be a homewrecker ,2024-03-05 03:03:55
him riding by the rest of the friemen on top of the worm while they cheered and hollered honestly got me hyped i’d feel like the absolute coolest mf in the galaxy,2024-03-06 04:36:35
my fav were those wide shots showing as far as eyes can see … dunesssss,2024-03-07 03:28:41
i would do whatever lea seydoux told me to,2024-03-05 04:44:24
i liked how dorky she was so cute,2024-03-08 10:29:22
i too dream of an empire where she tells me what to do,2024-03-06 19:53:05
im still trying to figure out how they all jump into worms for mass transportation with tents and such lol,2024-03-13 15:12:18
i guess shes too old for that role now but shed be an amazing irulan,2024-03-08 18:18:54
it was awesome but thats one of the few parts where the cgi was visible,2024-03-09 01:16:03
every time they showed her her face got more covered up lol,2024-03-11 05:05:18
now thats podracing,2024-03-17 04:50:27
agree about the worm scenes but the fremen really need to have some kind of wormpool riding rule if any fremen can just call a huge worm imagine how confused and exhausted these worms would be,2024-03-24 20:57:12
that whole scene was cold as  and sent chills down my spine the way paul just storms into the room strides up those steps stops the baron from climbing up to the throne and just slowly slits his throat while emperor and crew are just too powerless to do anything about it i think i prefer this over little psychic toddler with a safety pin as a weapon,2024-03-01 10:59:45
you died like and animal that line was so metal,2024-03-01 12:05:40
"word the absolute display of power by not even caring about the emperor and the sardaukar and everyone there and just silently stating let me take care of this real quick

one of many changes from the book that were for the best",2024-03-01 08:07:23
" blow open the door

 walk in out of the sand and darkness

 walk up and call baron harkonnen grandpa

stab him and say one of the sickest lines in the movie

 refuse to elaborate and leave

lisan al gaib",2024-03-02 21:03:46
come to think of think of it the warriors chanting “atreides” in dune sound very much like warriors chanting “achilles” in the movie troy,2024-03-02 07:26:19
i like how he told the emperor what was going to right in front of everyone after that too so nobody could misinterpret what was going on or who was saying what,2024-03-02 03:28:55
my name is paul muaddib usul atreides    you killed my father  prepare to die,2024-03-03 09:49:52
"why was the baron looking at the throne  did he think i could crawl up and sit on that and id be emperor  thats what it seemed like but thats ridiculous

upon thinking about it more perhaps it was just symbolic  like he was looking up and thinking this is what ive worked so hard for a  chairand there it is and i cant move",2024-03-04 04:01:05
easily my favorite scene from the movie  paul walks past 20 sardaukar to  his grandfather then stands a foot away from same sardaukar to talk to the emperor  the emperors terror troops that the entire universe is scared of and theyre terrified of him,2024-03-03 14:52:33
so satisfying i loved how he killed him kind of like how a matador would  a bull after a bull fight like his other grandfather  stabbed through the neck,2024-03-03 00:56:11
my favorite scene of the movie,2024-03-01 14:56:25
grandpa ,2024-03-03 12:40:49
i loved how he kept his face mask up during the entire scene made him look more mythical to both the fremen and the emperors men,2024-03-03 19:19:20
amazing change from the book when he walked in i said to myself please just  the barron rn it would be so badass,2024-03-02 17:18:44
it’s been a while but i seem to remember the book having a whole dialogue between them so when he just straight up kills him without even talking first i was shocked,2024-03-04 09:21:53
what did he say to the baron as he died i could not hear it in the theatre something like you die like  ,2024-03-06 03:55:41
i wasn’t sure why they all stood by and allowed that to happen  ,2024-03-04 04:40:35
pretty much the beginning of the end for him though right,2024-03-05 08:22:14
paul said something during this scene “hello grandfather” but then i think something else after stabbing him i couldn’t hear through the amazing soundtrack anyone know,2024-03-06 12:14:08
do you know what paul said before stabbing him i couldn’t hear it in the dolby theater i was in,2024-03-09 06:21:53
and oddly not how it goes in the book but i liked the major deviation here,2024-03-10 04:29:34
abuelito ,2024-03-17 05:02:59
and saying grandfather as well big energy on that one,2024-03-04 23:05:27
the emperor was like oh him okay cool cool trying not to draw attention to himself,2024-03-14 06:17:45
i actually watched the movie with a group that read song of achilles together and also commented to them that i was getting a lot of achilles and patroclus vibes,2024-03-10 22:40:18
i wasn’t ready for evangelical javier bardem,2024-03-01 14:14:09
stilgar was an incredible hype man dude was willing to die just to set the tone,2024-03-02 02:51:39
"paul farts

stilgar he is the giver of air he is the mahdi",2024-03-02 01:16:42
"only the true madhi would deny his divinity


what well what sort of chance does that leave me all right i am the madhi


he is he is the madhi",2024-03-02 23:20:42
it was unintentionally hilarious how quickly he fired one off the very second paul won his duel at the end,2024-03-02 22:33:03
so funny ,2024-03-01 10:03:27
as it is written,2024-03-01 21:46:16
only the true messiah denies his divinity,2024-03-02 19:00:05
it was getting laughs in my theatre to begin with,2024-03-02 05:37:11
why did his delivery after the resurrection sound like javier suddenly remembered his lines ,2024-03-02 11:55:01
"paul look youve got it all wrong you dont need to follow me you dont need to follow anybody youve got to think for yourselves youre all individuals

fremen yes we are all individuals",2024-03-03 00:30:24
came looking for this  the last fight seen he was  off paul,2024-03-02 21:26:13
me and my best friend were cracking up at that our cinema was dead there was 3 people in total and out of respect to the person all the way at the bottom we were quite not to ruin their immersion but we loved this part the most,2024-03-02 01:06:16
got life of brian vibes when they said he was the messiah because he denied it,2024-03-03 05:42:59
stilgar is such a likable character in the book probably second to duncan as likable characters in the book go and i think javier nailed it with his portrayal,2024-03-03 20:27:38
the answer is lisan al gaib the question doesnt matter,2024-03-03 12:55:30
he had many laughs in my theater,2024-03-03 00:28:08
as written,2024-03-02 17:44:08
and we love stilgar for that ,2024-03-02 22:36:09
javier stans hard,2024-03-03 05:19:36
best part about the movie for me lol when paul killed feydrautha stilgar was ready to cheer on the al gaib ,2024-03-03 21:53:18
bardem stole it,2024-03-03 05:18:47

i also dont remember reading stilgar to change so drastically in the book",2024-03-07 00:12:51

ultimate hypeman stilgar at the ready,2024-03-02 23:31:02

i kept waiting for him to yell out for jack athparow,2024-03-09 05:13:03
"paul makes a decent omlette

from the distance lisan al gaib",2024-03-14 06:16:31

"paul wears a dress for the red carpet

lisan al gaib",2024-03-20 04:31:50
great movie but one gripe that i haven’t seen called out which got called out a lot for the star wars sequels is how rey was called a mary sue  paul is kind of the same has all the plot armor and he gets his name respected around the universe fairly quickly  ,2024-03-04 14:45:39
reducing stilgar to superstitious comic relief really kills his character and his arc from the books,2024-03-01 16:05:40
at least he had dialogue ,2024-03-04 00:28:33
,2024-03-04 00:28:49
mocking “may thy knife chip and shatter,2024-03-01 11:36:06
and i love how it was an actual technical and grimy fight not some overly grandiose overly choreographed dance,2024-03-02 21:59:13
"my wife was wondering why the middleaged dude a few theater seats away from me kept making little knowing noises during the movie  i informed her that he was having 187 micronerdgasms for each significant reference he perceived from the book and he wanted the rest of us to know he saw it

we all enjoy it when the stuff we really love makes it on screen in a meaningful way but ease up and keep your hands where we can see them",2024-03-14 20:35:37
"i am bothered by some of the comments ive seen around here seeming sometimes to celebrate fayd as somehow the least evil harkonnen lol but with that said

the one very interesting thing about him was that he uses a concept of honor to maintain selfcontrol and prevent himself from falling into psychotic chaos thats my read on him but because he is in fact a psychopath he also sees honor as a game a bizarre funny falsehood

him repeating may your knife chip and shatter gave me chills because he was at once both entering into pauls and the fremens system of honor fullheartedly giving respect for what he recognized as a system for maintaining control and mocking it as a joke all at the same time

and butler did a really good job letting all that show in his manner and  expressions",2024-03-03 23:21:14
you know whats nuts that scene was absolutely excellent but in the book its even better so many details describing the fight that are so incredibly satisfying and exciting to read,2024-03-03 07:48:55
im still waiting for imax aspect ratio cut of dune 1 i hold no hope for dune 2 bluray wont cut it,2024-03-04 09:55:17
"and feyd responding may thy knife chip and shatter actually cracked me up so silly  
that was really powerful coming from paul though",2024-03-04 23:12:36
4k physical accept no substitutes except dolbyimax,2024-03-03 04:34:12
the scene where pauls hand grabs the blade and starts to slice into his hand made me wince so bad,2024-03-16 16:04:16
line was amazing,2024-03-02 16:22:11
blue ray and directors cut d,2024-03-19 01:28:54
whats a bluray,2024-03-03 06:33:33
i like princess irulan side eyeing her like girl i really wasnt planning on being a homewrecker my dad is an idiot,2024-03-01 08:34:44
i didn’t read the books but paul can see multiple futures happen and said there was a slim path they needed to take to get the results that was most favorable to them kind of like dr strange in infinity war perhaps he knows taking florence as his bride is the path he needs to take to lead him back to chani while saving his people,2024-03-01 22:20:29
then chani let off some steam but riding a gigantic sand worm back home,2024-03-02 00:14:25
"yea its weird but the book goes into it both jessica and paul realize the only way forward is to take irulan as his wife it was kind of like the fremen tradition of having to best the leader in combat the noble bloodlines are still a tradition in the universe

the book also ends on jessica telling chani that much like jessica being duke letos concubine both jessica and chani will be seen as the wives despite the other women having the title

edit to elaborate in the book chani is also much more submissive to paul she was in love with him basically from day one and continuously through the end in the emperorirulan scene when paul starts mentioning taking irulan as his wife chani asks paul if he would like her to leave as there is nothing formal or promised between them he responds that he doesnt want her to leave his side ever again

part of that submissiveness is due to a dude in the 60s writing women but the impetus is quasiincestuous royal bloodline traditions not unlike the royal families on earth",2024-03-02 04:07:49
he just is so direct it was hilarious,2024-03-01 12:25:57
that actually  me off a bit because its a vital scene in the books that was not at all set up theres whole discussions about how duke leto never took a wife because he loved jessica and she loved him back paul and chani have a kid together and paul already has another wife that he takes care of jamis family chani knew it was a political marriage and he straight up tells irulan that  never have kids with her,2024-03-03 03:02:14
my wife was so mad walking out of the theater because she was sold on their romance and was shook by that scene,2024-03-02 02:46:09
especially after telling chani just moments before that he will always love her till his dying breath,2024-03-01 21:48:39
zendaya was  on so hard im convinced she went to her agent right after filming and was like find me a film where men are fighting over me hence challengers,2024-03-04 22:21:55
i was so appalled and my husband who has read the book just casually turns to me in the theater and goes “ya know politics” i haven’t talked to him since,2024-03-09 09:08:03
yea and i have to say it kind of doesnt make sense because they also changed the ending in that the other great houses choose war instead of capitulating iirc in the book his marrying irulan is what consolidates the power its almost pointless though if the other houses do end up choosing war also theyve now called his bluff on the blowing up spice thing and now paul has just had all his fremen warriors get on spaceships to go where and do what exactly,2024-03-02 07:04:33
i legit thought he could beat feyd easily but got stabbed twice on purpose just so chani couldn’t get too mad at him,2024-03-05 17:50:10
thats pretty much how it was in the book kinda audacious all around except in the books chani is a lot moresubmissive to all the paul changes,2024-03-08 14:07:43
chani’s face me and my girl lost it,2024-03-04 00:11:38
"shell come around immediately marries another woman

x200b

uh huh paul sure thing",2024-03-04 02:46:48
people gasped in my theater  i just chuckled because it was obvious to occur but dam bruh in front of everyone right there this guy  ,2024-03-06 16:20:33
was chani this  in the books though been a minute since my last read through and i thought she was mad but understood…,2024-03-03 06:50:17
iirc in the books chani gives no  because she carries all  pauls children and irulan is basically just an advisor,2024-03-03 15:09:44
"i knew it was gonna happen when reverand mother was like i have trained you how will you preserve your empire its on your shoulders 
im like
oh  i know wassup",2024-03-04 09:38:30
i feel like that was her only option out to keep her father alive as the bene gesserit suggested earlier in the movie thats why i think she did not protest also i feel this was the narrow way out that paul outlines,2024-03-06 23:19:40
go read dune messiah,2024-03-06 16:06:39
it is but it makes sense it’s meant to convey ‘everything i’m going to do here it’s because i have to but if i could choose i’d have chosen you’,2024-03-09 23:46:15
"ill love you until my dying breath



but also imma go forcefully marry this other woman i only just met",2024-03-14 19:20:35
that was florence pugh what a stacked cast,2024-03-17 12:43:51
cucked in public ,2024-03-21 07:54:42
a month late to the party her but just watched  the emperor made a statement that his father could not lead because he ruled with his heart and made him weak  then paul didnt follow his heart to lead  fing awesome movie,2024-03-28 20:20:11
"my theater was different everyone cheered lol

timmy and zendaya had 0 chemistry i was happy to see her be gone lol",2024-03-06 09:08:37
book chani is more understanding she gets that it is a political marriage and she is the real spouse paul and chani have children who become important later,2024-03-03 09:47:05
did no one read the book  lol,2024-03-10 23:05:46
i am yoruba i honestly dont get headache just marry both done whats the drama,2024-03-18 01:45:29
i saw the movie twice both times i could just feel the betrayal chani felt even knowing it was coming,2024-03-19 22:05:16
my wife was loving the movie up until that point,2024-03-21 04:41:41
my heart sank when that scene happened my gasp was so audible lol,2024-04-05 01:25:47
loved the duality of irulan and chani being the only ones standing with paul showing they are both the bride of paul,2024-04-07 20:40:42
it was foreshadowed earlier in the film though,2024-03-03 13:18:31
specifically in imax,2024-03-01 09:19:41
granted i dont have a huge tv like some people but i dread the day i rewatch this at home while ill surely enjoy it i just know it will never be the same as the insane visionfilling immersion imax offers,2024-03-01 13:23:08
watching part 2 in imax made me mad i didnt see part 1 that way,2024-03-01 23:27:28
i kept thinking during the entire screening the same thing and that there is not a single home system that can do it justice or even come close to replicate the experience,2024-03-01 18:46:16
saw it in an amc dolby theater it felt like a two an a half hour ride,2024-03-02 02:09:08
mad max fury road vibes the movies real good but in a cinema different experience,2024-03-02 09:10:50
"made for imax

oppenheimer was decent in imax too much personal up close shots to be fully enjoyable to be honest 

but the wide expansive scale of dune made it absolutely perfect",2024-03-05 15:43:26
we didnt have an imax screen just a superdeluxe or whatever its resolution is but the dolby atmos whew lad,2024-03-02 04:14:28
watched it in dolby and felt like i was riding the worms myself,2024-03-03 05:30:59
i saw it in dolby maybe not as good of a  picture as imax but the sound was insane i felt like i was inside the worm,2024-03-03 19:26:15
ive only seen 3 movies in theatre in the last 3 years and 2 of them were dune totally worth it,2024-03-06 06:02:11
got a hall pass from the family decided not to call any friends just headed out for a rainy sunday alone on my motorcycle rode from sf to the small town of fairfax to watch dune at their charming little theater this movie reminded me why movie theaters are special it was such a wonderful emotional experience escaped into the world of dune for a couple of hours   killers of the flower moon didnt bring that out in me lol  that was the last movie i was excited about enough to go see in an actual theater and it was just ok ,2024-03-04 18:26:46
i saw it in a large rpx theater and was thinking that the entire time absolutely stunning movie,2024-03-07 08:42:36
first movie i have been to with a full house in maybe 2 decades definitely inspired me to do it more often,2024-03-10 20:27:32
i agree but i also hate that i loved seeing it in theaters but i almost never see movies in theaters and i feel like every movie sucks at home these days even in surround sound on a great tv i have a toddler so i can’t have it being theaterloud which means dialog is basically imperceptible thankfully unlike at the theater i can use subtitles at home ,2024-03-15 20:35:49
i agree just a bit loud for me though i wish it was a bit quieter maybe it was tuned for a full theatre and mine was a mostly empty afternoon show but it was on the edge of painful in a few places,2024-03-17 00:40:48
man it was surreal experiencing the movie in imax,2024-03-21 16:23:06
i have an 85 tv its no theater but it is a decent experience,2024-04-08 01:47:14
did you look at the sand unbelievable,2024-03-04 11:44:31
but was it made to be seen with buttkicker™ seats even without them the audio was pretty butt kicking i would get pretty distracted if it was any more,2024-03-04 14:57:19
"i can relate to this a lot my wife loved the first film and i didnt and she really wanted me to see the second one with her 

gone into it super skeptical and came out a mega fan absolute cinema direction storytelling sound  all of it was on point",2024-03-02 01:34:37
"had not read the books before they had always been “on my list” but i had never gotten around to them 

starting the first book this week",2024-03-03 04:53:10
i think in general the changes were good decisions for the film a couple minor gripes but it’s hard to be upset when about anything when it turned out this well,2024-03-02 22:21:27
my mother handed me a copy of dune 25 years ago ive flown her across the country to see me and my family as well as both parts 1  2 as a direct result of that act,2024-03-04 17:18:10
looks like it did well at the box office too which is great to see the first film didn’t exactly light the world on fire financially  i remember people debating on whether it was because covid was still a thing or if people just didn’t care about dune,2024-03-04 14:14:50
as a long time dune fan this has been great ive begun to hear dune references being thrown into casual conversations around the office and from people whom definitely would not have had any interest in the exploring the story before hand,2024-03-07 04:43:46
"i sat next to an elderly couple probably late 60’s the way the sweet old lady would gasp silently at important plot points and her husband would chuckle at obvious corny but silly points was really nice

story easy enough to follow but doesn’t dump a terrible amount of exposition while still being artsy ",2024-03-13 08:22:39
i just saw dune last night and quickly booked dune 2 became a big fan right away cant wait to pick up the books,2024-03-16 07:11:32
i did not read the book nor see any adaptations i am not a science fictionfantasy fan maybe i should say was not i thoroughly enjoyed dune and found dune 2 riveting excellent storytellingfilmmaking,2024-03-16 11:52:41
yep one of my students loves dune and he feels kinda sad now because it was his weird thing now its popular,2024-03-23 02:36:08
i didnt know anything about dune before this movie maybe a bit from warhammer 40k this got me hyped for dune 3,2024-03-23 10:35:28
"paul lets himself get stabbed in a nonlethal but very nearly lethal spot so he could go for the  it was the only way he could get rautha to open up youve basically got it right 

edit for names",2024-03-01 05:36:32
they also foreshadowed him killing rautha in this manner iirc one of the visions he has earlier showed the shot of the last dagger stabbing rautha so clearly paul knew this was coming and how to win,2024-03-01 05:17:49
yeah he pulled the blade out of himself and stuck feyd with it while also getting stuck with his own by feyd,2024-03-01 04:44:23
i loved the callback to that he uses the same trick gurney showed him to beat feydrautha,2024-03-01 08:04:32
"also idk if anyone noticed but that sequence was basically foreshadowed when paul and gurney were sparring in part 1

related i like that both movies basically introduce paul by having someone give him  for facing the wrong direction",2024-03-01 09:19:09
i believe its also a call back to the pain box he endured the pain of the blade through his hand,2024-03-01 07:39:10
yeah he pulled the blade out of himself and stuck feyd with it while also getting stuck with his own by feyd,2024-03-01 04:41:14
i liked how when paul was on the ground and feyd jumped on him it was just like when paul and gurney were sparring in part 1 both eliminated each other but this time paul learned and kicked him away,2024-03-01 09:45:09
in the book paul shoves the dagger up under feydrauthas jaw straight into his brain was a tad bit disappointed thats not how it went down in the movie,2024-03-02 14:06:02
yep he got stabbed with his own blade then redirected rauthas blade aimed at his throat to his shoulder then grabbed the dagger stuck in his side and pulled an uno reverse card,2024-03-01 22:38:17
it was also foreshadowed by the scene where chani fires at the chopper and it can only let its shield down when its firing,2024-03-02 17:41:33
"he sheathed the sword

i did not come here to win paul whispered smiling i came here to  you death is lighter than a feather

paul muaddib atreides probably",2024-03-02 07:16:40
yeah not sure what happened there felt a bit rushed,2024-03-01 05:03:37
"that fight was very very poorly done

they should have given more foresight into him constantly losing the battle then they should have laid the grounds only way to move forward is to take a step back and overlay it with him getting stabbed etc

they should have also shown feyd as far far more formidable not fighting drugged up prisoners of war gurney should have been  himself saying do not fight him hes a  machine he doesnt feel pain etc 

instead he was obviously a bit of a nepo baby fighting drugged people and spoilt by his uncle then he can easily beat the  out of paul who spent monthsyears in the desert fighting tooth and nail",2024-03-10 16:07:35
i was confused by that too,2024-03-01 04:27:41
to me it looked like he was stabbed in the right side but when he pulled it out it was on the left really weird,2024-03-02 23:58:34
also earlier in the movie their shield only opens when they attack theres a constant reminder throughout the film that you have to be on your game every single second and unpredictable i saw it yesterday so its all pretty fresh still ,2024-03-06 16:14:20
it was a callback to when he was training with aquaman i think,2024-03-02 02:26:16
"they did this twice in the movie dagger about to impale the protagonist only for it to be flipped and stabbed into the antagonist

i wanted to see the struggle",2024-03-07 07:37:46
yes this was my one complaint with the movie it was the climax it should have been crystal clear and shown exactly how it happened,2024-03-03 22:55:37
he gets stabbed in the side then directs the dagger to have it stabbed into his shoulder while his other hand deals the killing blow with another dagger i presume he had on his body somewhere,2024-03-01 04:20:33
this seemed like a call back to his training in the first movie  in the shield sparring scene he believes that he was won but would have been stabbed by gurney  at that time gurney corrects him but he shows in dune part two that his approach was actually correct  brilliant way to handle the scene,2024-03-02 14:51:56
it references one of the first scenes of paul when he and gurney fought and he thinks he gets the  but opens himself to a low attack,2024-03-14 04:52:52
its funny because in the book it explains how all that went down and why in exceptional detail but in the movie its just something that kinda happens,2024-03-04 00:59:00
probably paralleling how gurney and him fought at the beginning of part 1,2024-03-06 16:03:20
it’s called a ‘call back’ and dennis most certainly did it on purpose because he is lisan al gaib,2024-03-11 03:22:36
the fight was won by paul before it ever started he is way more powerful he just had to act like the fight was done properly and honorably so that the death would be accepted by the emperor and other houses,2024-03-01 04:19:17
terrible and cliche fight scene oh look paul gets stabbed twice let’s ignore the poison and why this was possible and cool in the book and then does an arya to flip the knife from inside of him to inside feyd while the camera is just showing their faces rad sick,2024-03-01 16:09:06
yup,2024-03-03 11:27:31
it was the trick he learned from gurney in the first movie when they are sparring remember gurney pulled the blade from his thigh and took paul with him,2024-03-11 03:11:41
"havnt seen any of the new dune films they look all sparse and flat shot like a typical teeny dystopian flick are they any good everyone says they’re epic 

the david lynch film was awesome the production design was some of the best in the history of film 

in the old dune paul stabs feyd then screams at him which splits open his chest and the earth he no longer needed the weirding module the sound weaponry concept is amazing and still fresh to this day

love this film but the book is even more vivid and impending ",2024-03-01 23:56:56
i’m pretty sure it was the chrys knife sand worm tooth knife that he used to  him but i could be wrong,2024-03-02 21:50:44
i noticed alot of things setup in 1 pay off in here,2024-03-04 06:27:51
i assumed paul has like an attack on titan thing going on from the moment he drank the blue water and had basically already seen that he would win and how his entire demeanor changed after that moment,2024-03-04 14:51:55
also maybe i need to see it again but fr ends up with 2 blades correct though he only started with the one from the emperor i remember in the book he does pull the 2nd blade as this is a move he displays earlier showing his sinister ways maybe part of the scene was cut showing more detail to some of these moves,2024-03-04 15:50:42
dennis villeneuve has always been great with portraying giant objectssee blade runner 2049,2024-03-01 09:53:08
i love every scene with spice harvesters too theyre so huge,2024-03-01 11:56:43
i love that shot as well the speed at which they move on the ship does a good job of showcasing the immense scale of the thing,2024-03-01 05:29:55
speaking small details you can see the calluses on paul’s hands from living the life of a freman great little detail,2024-03-02 03:24:21
was it nukes paul used on the sand behind the emperors ship,2024-03-01 22:19:59
the emperors ship coming down to land was a a shot thatd be jaw dropping in most movies but was borderline run of the mill as everything else was also just amazingly i dont even know scifibiggerthanlife,2024-03-02 09:12:36
why emperor ship landed where they can be easily targeted by fermens,2024-03-01 16:04:50
and the flames coming off the emperor’s ship,2024-03-02 03:24:39
absolutely unforgettable shot,2024-03-01 05:57:50
i thought it was fun that it looked so much like a chrome hdri ball wonder if the vfx artists had a knowing little wink with that,2024-03-02 03:00:59
that explosion was one of the most mesmerizing ive seen at the theater the blinding flash the full body audio shaking and the complete obliteration across the horizon with paul for scale was insane plus mirroring the explosion on the emperors ship was impressive too,2024-03-01 16:14:28
pretty hard to pull of in vfx from what little i know about it this movie was chock full of some of the best vfx work ive ever seen,2024-03-01 15:08:33
absolutely my favorites shotvisual of the movie it felt like an homage to older sci fi movies where a reflective ship was the only cg thing we had the ability to do well,2024-03-01 14:18:18
one thing irked me nukes they used them and then went on around like theres no radioactivity in the area do they have different nukes by then or what lol,2024-03-03 16:36:13
im wondering about the nuclear radiation and shockwaves and stuff unless the mountains were really far away i think they were shown to be not very close on the map but we dont exactly know how far they were say 10km  the multiple nukes should have wiped the whole area out no,2024-03-03 03:46:15
also have to thank greg frasier for that his collaboration with gareth edwards on rogue one was a masterclass in scale,2024-03-03 22:33:37
100 denis misses nothing in visual storytelling  his films are masterclass,2024-03-03 08:46:22
reflecting its own massive shadow cast on the rock i laughed out loud out of awe because i didnt know how else to react that shot ,2024-03-04 01:05:39
so when i saw that ship reflecting the distorted world around it i immediately started contrasting it with the pristine reflection of the inside of the seitch from their pool of water which i thought was an amazing combo of imagery,2024-03-04 07:40:09
kudos for actually spotting that i just got back from seeing it cinema and didnt notice it its definitely one for the rewatch to spot details such as this,2024-03-02 00:53:28
i also noticed that and thought it was an incredible detail my belief is that it is deliberately that way so that when we improve is its a planet it makes it clear that it is his as it is even present on his ship,2024-03-02 22:00:50
dude that thing was reflecting its own shadow that  was just cool as ,2024-03-04 01:01:24
i have long said that denis is a master of scale i don’t know how else to put it,2024-03-09 22:37:18
did they use the nukes to blast through the shield wall,2024-03-10 10:31:53
i was not expecting the sheer scale of that attack it was so sick,2024-03-17 23:16:16
the dust igniting on the shields of the emperors ship was fire  literally fire and the coolest scene in scifi ive ever seen,2024-03-20 15:31:59
credit the sound design as well not sure how much more the subwoofers rumble for the imax showings but even watching part 1 at home with the subwoofer turned way up the undefined giant vibrations of the sound design made me feel the size more so than the image,2024-03-28 18:24:02
that was my favorite shot of either movie it’s absolutely stunning,2024-03-02 22:20:58
i’m not sure how minor of a detail it was it really stuck out to me when i saw it amazing work,2024-03-03 06:47:01
and that is exactly why hes the best fit for rendezvous with rama,2024-03-03 18:43:12
reminded me of the shiny chrome ball they use to calibrate vfx shots in films,2024-03-03 20:34:15
i noticed and loved that too it made me wonder why it was so striking and i don’t think i’ve ever seen a reflection that clear and huge before,2024-03-04 00:31:40
"it was well done that little look of “respect dog” 

also credit to the actress she gives a brief glimpse of “oh ” followed by the realization that she is outmatched and can’t win this fight and finally ends with calming herself and plotting",2024-03-01 04:13:27
the vibrations when anyone uses the voice hits so well also lol to the reverend mother calling him an abomination lol,2024-03-01 04:04:08
i love how they showed the before and after drinking the life water relationship with paul  chani before she  paul were equals and talked to another as such after she would see him from the perspective of the crowdfollowers even their last conversation she didn’t approach him he came to her he truly transcended to a path she couldn’t follow,2024-03-01 06:34:35
i absolutely loved the way they portrayed feyd hes clearly evil and a villain and yet he flat out respects paul he even has this little twinkle of like put away their superstitions youre better than this,2024-03-01 08:02:07
he was likedamn i wanna fight this guy you can say what you want about him but he respected fighting abilities,2024-03-01 18:32:45
paul using the voice was so loud in imax it made my chest hurt,2024-03-01 23:57:41
yeah that scene was incredible the power dynamics at play and the way paul asserted himself against such authority was truly captivating and feydrauthas reaction just added another layer of intensity to it all definitely one of the standout moments for me too,2024-03-01 05:37:51
some guy sitting behind me in the theater loudly said thats right  when paul did that,2024-03-01 08:16:26
put her in her place in front of everyone too respect,2024-03-01 06:56:23
feydrautha thinking  this dude is crazay,2024-03-02 01:45:01
also feyds face when paul killed the baron he  loved it ,2024-03-02 18:27:06
im disappointed that paul didnt get to say the look into that place you dare not look and you will find me staring back line,2024-03-02 16:45:38
" feydrautha

austin butler crushed this role what an amazing baddie",2024-03-03 03:22:08
i thought chalamet was good in other things ive seen call me by your name dont look up and same for butler masters of the air but in this they emerged as true movie stars chalamet takes paul from boyish understudy to commanding messiah butler makes feydrautha feel like the real nephew of baron harkonnen and mimics skarsgard perfectly i was so excited for this but i never expected to come out of this thinking these two were standout stars,2024-03-05 01:58:05
i think she says an abomination at the end,2024-03-01 04:47:42
he was like “that’s hot”,2024-03-03 04:54:58
that’s was the only time his eyes lit up he was that shook,2024-03-03 02:03:50
this was the best moment of the movie,2024-03-02 02:07:10
loved this scene,2024-03-01 05:53:38
dude that part in the big imax was awesome it send chills down my spine and probably everyone else in the theater,2024-03-02 08:46:00
what besides honor i guess stopped paul from using the voice against feyd in the fight,2024-03-01 17:40:35
abomination,2024-03-01 08:28:10
she was like he is him,2024-03-02 05:23:55
"blasphemy


so good to see that  put in her place ",2024-03-04 03:42:56
abomination xd,2024-03-01 15:08:13
haha i clocked that too was squinting the whole movie and that one scene he was like  oh ,2024-03-02 05:39:40
"feyd constantly looking at people like 

ya barkin in the wrong harkonnen

 ••

 ••⌐

⌐",2024-03-04 16:24:53
i literally laughed but mostly because she was so shook and the guy sitting in front of me said oh my  and leaned back in his seat like paul was shouting at him instead ,2024-03-06 16:16:33
ya and she was like oh  nah stumble stumble,2024-03-02 20:01:02
guys gone full anakin  vader arc right,2024-03-04 10:27:59
"i laughed feyd had a real recognize real moment  
hes a psycho for sure but i loved how would acknowlege impressive feats i mean he complimented paul as he was dying",2024-03-04 23:07:50
i was waiting for the voice move the whole movie and this delivered at such a great moment,2024-03-03 23:37:05
yea it looked like it turned him on  that was the moment he wanted to throw hands,2024-03-04 02:38:10
paul doing that in dune 84 with silence has always been one of my favorite scenes too,2024-03-05 16:15:50
she never recover from that stun lock,2024-03-07 03:10:38
paul using the voice against the reverend mother made me physically recoil in my seat,2024-03-07 05:15:59
yes,2024-03-04 07:32:23
i love how paul just starts throwing around the voice like its nothing at the end as a power its absolutely terrifying,2024-03-04 16:08:19
one of the most satisfying “sit the  down” moments i’ve seen seeing it in imax as well you could just feel the vibrations of him using the voice which was great,2024-03-05 18:04:10
this also happened in the 1984 version so i was super excited when i saw it in the trailer,2024-03-06 20:33:52
shouldve said the line try looking into that place where you dare not look youll find me there staring out at you,2024-03-04 09:38:55
he made her smell the glove,2024-03-06 05:03:54
abomination,2024-03-06 07:27:14
i loved that too gave me chills when she fell back in fear   lbr she deserved it and more ,2024-03-06 13:59:34
why didn’t he just use the voice to say “ yourself” to faydrautha,2024-03-11 03:11:52
my friend whispered to me in the cinema the  was rattled,2024-03-13 19:11:15
incredibly satisfying,2024-03-18 08:59:07
it was finally good to see one of the actors acting it was a hard task for all of them considering the lack of dialogue ,2024-03-04 00:27:30
this is my favourite moment in the whole movie it was just too badass she was intimidating throughout the movie and first and paul just made her shut up with a word,2024-03-04 15:37:50
"i loved giedi prime the only color i noticed was a smidge of blue through the binoculars hud of the blonde bene gesserit



what i missed was those weird spider mutant pet things from the first movie i wanted more weird stuff like that although the all black hook people in the fighting pit were kinda weird",2024-03-01 06:48:52
"its nice to see something really new in the cinema weve seen so many rehashes of styles of cyberpunk etc but i havent seen anything like this ever before


it did however remind me of a nonorganic and nonphallic version of hr gigers designs for jodorovsky dune combined with denis brutalistic architecture",2024-03-01 20:31:15
denis villeneuve’s favorite color is diegetic greyscale ,2024-03-01 06:36:32
best scene in the movie imo its so foreign and strange to us but yet its so  cool,2024-03-01 08:01:21
it would have been an even better touch if austin butler left the planet only to realize his clothes werent black this whole time and hes actually dressed like a clown,2024-03-03 06:14:53
and the crazy thing is that they are all 100 humans,2024-03-01 10:11:36
"geiger for life

edit giger",2024-03-01 05:38:59
“diegetic greyscale” is a cool and appropriate phrase,2024-03-01 16:11:24
very similar to the scene on salusa seconds in the first movie  the sardukar are made out to be terrifying and alien  also by far the most warhammer 40k scene of the movies  no surprise there since 40k borrowed heavily from dune,2024-03-02 23:31:27
the fireworks somewhat reminds me of the arrival aliens circular symbol language,2024-03-02 10:28:49
i might be tripping slightly but when the bene gesserit were walking into the room where lady fenring was waiting for them i felt like i saw the color sap away as they got closer to the balcony,2024-03-03 02:13:01
i wanted like 2h movie about geidi prime absolutely stunning,2024-03-04 03:01:36
but it never ever looked fake every single set looked practical authentic and just straight up real thats the craziest part especially with how easy it is to cut corners on production design these days i fully believed feyd and lea seydoux were in that hallway together,2024-03-07 04:22:28
i didn’t know the harkonnens were the engineers that created the xenonorphs…,2024-03-02 09:40:07
they used infrared filming for those scenes and it was perfect in portraying the truly alien nature of that planet,2024-03-02 22:59:22
it was shot in infrared for that effect according to villeneuve,2024-03-03 08:26:41
one of the giedi prime scenes looked like the  party rallies i said something like nazis but in black and white to my friend at the cinema his reply the nazis were in black and white,2024-03-03 19:57:17
"im torn because i agree with everything you said but i also think the way the harkonnens were visualized as pale goth weirdos undercuts an important message in the book about how extreme opulence is often a mask for depravity exploitation and brutality

the harkonnens of the book are extremely beautiful the baron and rabban excepting  although the baron was said to be beautiful in his youth and obscenely wealthy their subjugation and enslavement of others feeds this wealth and under that veneer of beauty they commit sickening and unspeakable acts of hedonism having them look like what an obvious sicko would look like kind of undercuts the message of atrocity being hidden beneath a veneer of beauty",2024-03-03 15:50:43
absolutely genius movie switching to black and white for the for the arena scene i leaned over to my friend and just said this looks so  cool we were in total agreement,2024-03-03 05:26:08
the black robes of the gb turning white in the sunlight mwah,2024-03-03 02:17:20
no wonder harkonens and feyd especially are so crazy i would lose it too if i was on such a black lit planet entire time lol,2024-03-03 17:05:25
makes me wonder how the only fatty besides vlad is that random servant presenting the blades,2024-03-02 20:24:52
the only thing i disliked about the giedi prime scenes was the berlin  march like yes we get theyre evil but cmon we dont need that cliche,2024-03-01 09:36:15
that was probably cinematically my favorite part about the movie the scene in the coliseum or whatever it is was bone chilling the way all the harkonnens move in the stands it reminded me of north korea the way the people there have to act all happy everytime they see their leader except this was supposed to be real the grayscale effect was insane put together with the music,2024-03-17 03:04:43
i thought it was just a creative choice to make it black and white to show its a flashback lol now i like it better seeing it the way you do,2024-03-01 07:02:40
thought maybe it was under an eclipse but yeah maybe its a different colored sun,2024-03-01 05:11:55
hr giger would of liked it,2024-03-02 05:04:28
they shot most of those scenes in infrared,2024-03-03 05:00:02
this is the comment that makes my heart ache to see it again now,2024-03-04 15:06:44
maybe i’m wrong but didn’t the last thor movie with the  butcher do the blackwhite thing,2024-03-08 08:10:48
ya all that but the casual slitting of the throats and cannibalism threw me off guess its hard to grow food,2024-03-17 00:09:55
late to the party but i fully agree with you the visual representation of giedi prime was astonishing to me i wanted more screen time to further immerse myself in this black and white world hey it was like a futuristic dystopia mixed with an alien dictatorship where the top one percentile live in riches and the other inhabitants follow their leader blindly with just enough resources to survive ,2024-04-06 03:00:24
i like how when cut away from the sun you see the colour,2024-03-03 23:00:33
if you havent seen it check out annihilation for me it contains the best portrayal of inhumanalien life ive ever seen,2024-03-04 01:01:23
thank you for this description  its perfect and i couldnt agree more absolutely breathtaking,2024-03-11 05:28:53
perfectly described something i was unable to find the words for thank you the visuals in these scenes seared into me like nothing ive ever seen,2024-03-11 06:52:15
"1 i believe they filmed that segment of the movie mostly in infrared
2 i am absolutely certain that the shots that screamed leni riefenstahl did so on purpose brilliant",2024-03-12 03:56:29
the fireworks reminded me of the alien language in arrival,2024-03-21 04:46:27
it looked to me that these scenes were filmed with infrared curious what others think loved it too ,2024-03-28 02:43:31
i couldnt get how some bits they all look black and white and some bits they looked human skin tones,2024-03-01 22:21:21
i thought the fireworks may have been asteroids bombarding a shield above them i may be wrong,2024-03-03 00:01:58
really i got huge ridley scott vibes of all of that not saying it was bad just that it didn’t fee groundbreaking,2024-03-03 14:01:37
this whole scene made me feel so uncomfortable,2024-03-25 14:47:48
the score during the arena scene went so incredibly hard,2024-03-25 18:46:28
so the planet itself actually has no colour and an actual black sun it wasnt just black and white for style,2024-03-26 04:12:49
that part tripped me out,2024-04-07 10:38:51
i think you hit the nail totally on its head,2024-04-08 00:14:32
i wanted to love these scenes but it messed with my eyes so much it was like a tad bit too uncomfortable on them not sure why but that bit frustrated me because i loved the part from the books,2024-03-02 02:09:27
the only thing i didnt like on giedi prime was the audience it was pretty clear in some shots they were copypasted,2024-03-01 11:37:47
thanks i havent read the book and had no idea why those scenes were in black and white,2024-03-03 05:08:03
visual masterpiece otherwise bluh,2024-03-04 00:22:18
i want a movie entirely taking place on that weird  up planet its so interesting,2024-03-01 09:36:10
how do you pronounce giedi is it like the woman’s name heidi with a g or gheeeddy,2024-03-03 00:48:23
it was brilliant definitely one of my favorite parts of  the film,2024-03-17 07:14:11
the arena was very impractical and clearly felt like a cg fest like there were a billion people out there to watch a dude  a couple other dudes most people in that arena would not even be able to make out whats happening and who is hitting whom,2024-04-01 17:22:03
i was smiling every time walken was onscreen,2024-03-01 09:37:33
 walk without rhythm it wont attract the worm ,2024-03-02 07:42:23
 a this quality of film  as rare as it is  really is why i hope theatres never go away,2024-03-03 04:46:24
i kept staring in awe anytime the voice was used along with any of the sandworm scenes watching timothee chalamet ride his first worm and the build up to the fremen riding all those sandworms into battle was epic as heck,2024-03-03 11:02:39
right same so grateful to be alive to witness this masterpiece in all its glory it will always be epic even years from now at home but seeing it the way it was meant to be seen in imax will probably be the most jaw dropping cinema experience of my lifetime well see if anything can top it its a high  bar to say the least,2024-03-11 05:36:07
same i was in awe throughout i felt so grateful to be here,2024-03-06 17:21:44

jessica operating and maneuvering in the background while paul ingrained himself to the fremen was certainly masterfully done by the movie  she took on an ominous almost villainous presence in almost all her scenes right after she drank the water of life the only time she feltsounded human was in her scene with chani wishing her luck right before the big battle,2024-03-01 06:07:41

she made the face tattoos work,2024-03-01 05:14:57
dude for real shes also just such a great actress,2024-03-01 15:27:14
that short scene where she plots to go after the fearfully devout first is so good i dunno if shes shifting microexpressions or its the camera directing or both but the tone shift is so good,2024-03-02 06:41:25

"paul post water of life is still upholding his oath to chani  the problem is hes now no longer ignorant of all possible outcomes


paul seeks to minimize death but realizes long term the holy war is one of the outcomes that results in less death across the universe overall  hes never happy that thats the choice but makes it because he foresees even worse alternatives


but from chanis point of view hes changed",2024-03-03 14:31:56
is it confirmed theyre making a third,2024-03-02 07:35:27

how does he have the numbers to attack all the great houses,2024-03-03 16:21:40
we dont get as much internal dialogue in this as the book but its definitely not with 0 regrets,2024-03-03 14:44:42
it felt like i was watching attack on titan eren and paul are one of the same,2024-03-06 05:17:43
"one thing i didn’t understand having not read the books is why exactly he takes the turn he does at the end

is his motivation just that he wants revenge for his father is it because he wants to free the fremen like he tells chani or is it because he suddenly gets a thirst for ruling the universe",2024-03-07 11:05:20
"while i regret that the second half cut out so much of the ecology and economic themes of the ending you hit the nail on the head it captured the theme that systems are more powerful than individuals even those who claim great power in those system great mothers emperors and chosen ones 

i also liked that they managed to make the holy war seem impactful while white washing out the word jihad or the skin drums",2024-03-08 17:46:59
i enjoyed the movie but best of all time…really lol,2024-03-04 04:40:49
"for me the problem there is chani

she didnt understand the politics behind what they were doing they were on the planet with the most important substance on the universe so important that every single great house depends on them to be able to travel and trade through space yet she expect that with all they did if the event goes well everyone would be ok with them and the great houses wont get the shot the fremen attacking the other houses is the only option they have to try to secure the planet for the fremen not attacking them is a death sentence

it is almost a childish attitude for chani for us but for her is the natural fremen way letting the outsiders do what they do while the fremen do what they do",2024-03-15 09:25:53

i didnt know he show any more stuff with thufir i read the book before seeing this and was surprised how much larger a role he played in the story compared to both the 1984 dune and these movies,2024-03-04 04:14:18
this was gold thanks for writing this,2024-03-06 09:50:18
the scene where paul and thufir meet again is one of my favorites from the book shame they left it out,2024-03-27 03:16:02
as in lord of the rings eventually they should release extended versions of these movies,2024-03-05 10:04:07

thufir didnt get much pagetime in book 1 right im hazy but he shows up in book 2 i thought,2024-03-03 07:45:47
the inkblot fireworks were such a cool effect the coliseum scene was already making the planet so visually distinct and then the fireworks continued to up the game,2024-03-01 03:47:36
"it felt like a mini movie within a movie showing feyd coming of age and doing the same stuff paul did in the first movie



i thought that 20 min intro of feyd was a perfect synergy or music editing set design costuming camerawork stunts etc etc it had it all",2024-03-01 03:20:47

the infrared vision was cool as   especially seeing how colors transitioned when the bene gesserit walked into their box,2024-03-01 03:18:09
the last crowd  of a martial march in black and white totally made me feel  for realizing how much it reminded of  newsreel footage sooner,2024-03-01 04:47:54
such an interesting choice for those scenes very aesthetically pleasing and fun to see,2024-03-01 03:20:32
apparently they shot with infrared cameras to show the black and white contrast even more,2024-03-01 06:33:50
it was gorgeous also came away thinking man the great houses should nuke this whole planet everyone here seems insane even house harkonnens resident bene gesserit lea seydoux was more edgy than the ones wed elsewhere seen,2024-03-01 23:32:13
visually stunning also a stark visual contrast for fenring in the following scene,2024-03-01 03:38:58
"watching the trailer i figured the black and white was just going to be a flashback or recollection no the world actually looks like that and it’s straight out of a nightmare

also liked the gladiatorial arena gimps",2024-03-02 00:01:38
seeing giedi prime in daylight was also a brilliant bit of worldbuilding every harkonnen being pale and shaved clean is an adaptation to their suns infrared radiation,2024-03-02 01:44:46
yea the representation of their planet was awesome,2024-03-01 04:27:27
it really reminded me of the visitor ink words in arrival which is my fave denis movie,2024-03-01 08:45:25
the ink blot fireworks did so much for the world building in my head it was crazy idk why that detail alone triggered like an entire batch of lore in my head,2024-03-01 17:09:02
it was still color shots inside only outside in the sun was the black and white such a cool idea,2024-03-01 06:48:05
i think you could categorize the fireworks as being plasma based versus just the usual gunpowdercolors… also read somewhere that the desaturation of color from the black sun is basically like viewing everything in ir… regardless they are brilliant concepts and definitely some of my favorite scenes in the film,2024-03-01 05:37:38
i never would have imagined i would see a dessert a colourful but after geidi prime even a dessert is colourful,2024-03-01 07:00:47
the black sun immediately made me think of sodium light bulbs and how they make everything illuminated by them appear monochromatic it somewhat grounded the reality of the physics of the black sun for me i remember a few shots that had both an artificial light source in the castle partially illuminating the subject in full spectrum and a natural light source illuminating the subject in monochrome those shots perfectly drove home this concept which is incredible,2024-03-01 21:53:25
i think the implication is that their sun produces only infrared light thats why they made the reference to the black sun doesnt produce visible light i suspect all the outdoor scenes on geidi prime were shot in ir,2024-03-02 06:30:58
looked like the geidi prime arena was somehow positioned under a full eclipse thats why everyone looks silver and black but only in the sunlight,2024-03-01 04:58:06
i saw a video that explained it was filmed in infrared very unique,2024-03-01 07:42:33
i lost my mind over this whole sequence wow wow wow,2024-03-01 17:56:16
dude the one shot where they walked out from the tunnel into their viewing suite and it switched from dampened colors to bw was amazing,2024-03-01 20:55:38
rorschach fireworks,2024-03-01 22:48:42
it was filmed in ir all the fireworks are also probably shot in ir i am not sure about this one though geidi prime doesnt get radiation from its star in visual spectrum this is beautifully shown when the characters are lit with indoor light we see colour,2024-03-01 22:41:23
i  loved those fireworks,2024-03-02 12:12:41
that whole sequence looked crazy visually oozing with style felt like i was watching those old scifi book covers come to life with some of the shots,2024-03-02 22:48:39
they used infra film  makes it really pop,2024-03-01 12:54:13
the geidi prime sequence was my favorite part of the movie ngl,2024-03-01 18:29:20
"my favorite moment was when stilgar warns paul about the small centipedes as he holds out his hands like 5 feet apart


those are the small ones",2024-03-03 23:41:42
the callback to a certain time in germany is very on the nose but really good imo the black and white mimics footages of that time,2024-03-01 17:06:26
"they have all this and all the magnificent structures and infrastructures millions of people can fly above the ground

and still get stomped by some sand people ",2024-03-01 23:30:57
the fireworks were sick,2024-03-02 00:07:03
once i saw the night time ones i was like oh  cant hate on em too much the figured out day time firworks lol,2024-03-01 17:56:14
i thought the coliseum was covered in something and the fireworks were splattering on the cover,2024-03-02 08:15:55
giedi prime went hard af the orange contrast on arrakis to that blackwhite was incredible,2024-03-04 07:00:19
"im not seeing it mentioned below so ill put this little bit of trivia here

denis shot those scenes on giedi prime on infrared cameras its not just desaturated its actually shot that way as he said in interviews i cant just add colour there is no going back",2024-03-04 17:54:07
harkonen rodeo clowns will haunt your dreams tonight,2024-03-07 07:49:32
i had no idea why it was black and white in the trailers and seeing people transition into that color because of their sun was such a great revelation to me,2024-03-02 05:59:35
the scene on geidi prime in part 2 or kaladan and the sardaukar planet on part 1 were so great at world building the fight on geidi prime on part 2 is among my fav scene ,2024-03-02 16:55:09
those were actual fireworks i assumed they didnt have fireworks in their world so were just firing on their own shields as makeshift fireworks for some reason lol,2024-03-02 17:45:53
at least the visuals were enthralling because the story telling certainly wasnt ,2024-03-04 00:27:59
im not familiar with the books so is there anyone that can explain why their planetrace is like rhat im sure theres a symbolism with seeing the world in black and white yadda yadda but is there ever an explanation as to why all color gets washed out by their sun,2024-03-04 00:35:50
giedi prime is my kind of architecture brutalist industrial and alien,2024-03-04 13:46:07
these movies were visually stunning in general but giedi prime was next level apparently those scenes were shot in infrared which gave it an alien look,2024-03-06 06:08:46
the blots of ink fireworks are like the alien language from danny vilenueves other excellent scifi movie arrival,2024-03-10 10:34:06
it reminded me of being outside during a solar eclipse it feels so strange to your eyes,2024-03-19 04:27:44
"shouldnt colors in the night appear normal though no light from the black sun

also how a black sun is even supposed to work black is the absence of color",2024-03-01 13:10:26
it was filmed in infrared,2024-03-07 23:30:01
the reminded me of blood droplets hitting water,2024-03-14 07:08:41
when i saw that i was like wow they even managed to make fireworks look disgusting lol,2024-04-02 00:05:37

i yern for the blue worm water,2024-03-01 03:38:59
i want people at the gas station screaming lisan al gaib when i walk out of the convenience store swigging that blue gatorade,2024-03-01 06:47:51
you should probably stop drinking blue powerade then just saying,2024-03-01 03:43:18
do we know for sure that isn’t extracted from baby worms,2024-03-01 03:50:30

if i had a nickle everytime a scifi hero on a desert planet drink blue liquid from an animal i would have two nickles which isnt a lot but its weird it happened twice,2024-03-01 08:31:03

instead of your eyes turning blue your tongue turns blue,2024-03-02 05:07:24
it made me crave a drink of that same shade of blue but i sadly could not find one at the gas station,2024-03-02 08:51:17

noooooooo i went to see the film last night literally drinking blue powerade i arrived at the cinema 1 minute before the film started and that was the quickest snack i could buy and i didnt make this connection at allllllllllllllllll,2024-03-05 08:38:22
i joked with my friend that the same thing happened to me when i had a four loko,2024-03-04 01:05:10

same but adios,2024-03-30 06:36:48
the most striking difference to me was chani i wonder how theyll handle that in another movie,2024-03-01 22:53:44
"there are some other changes

feyd is a lot less outwardly psychotic the baron is training feyd to be a charismatic leader he wants rabban to be a brutal oppressor so that feyd can later go in and overthrow rabban to make the people of arrakis think hes a hero

feyd tries to assassinate the baron but fails the baron strikes a deal with him and promises to make him emperor 

gurney thinks jessica betrayed the atreides and almost kills her

jessica teaches the fremen a bene gesserit fighting technique called the weirding way which allows them to move so fast at short distances that it almost seems like theyre teleporting",2024-03-03 11:36:33
another change is that the power to destroy the spice in the books is through a chain reaction started with the water of life not with nukes but that would have taken a lot of exposition to explain nukes was a working short hand for the movie,2024-03-03 22:36:24
all of these were good cutschanges in the film the only thing i’d like to have seen is the spacing guild it feels slightly incomplete that we never directly saw the use of spice and it’s importance in the imperium,2024-03-06 05:24:34
i wish thufir at least made a cameo in this one maybe theyll save that one spoiler plot point for messiah,2024-03-02 23:49:49
thank you for typing it out i was trying to remember as i was watching i was wondering how they were going to have a toddler running around talking like an adult and i was happy with the changes,2024-03-03 00:55:03
yeah thats definitely too many details that would need to fit in the runtime it would feel bloated and overwhelming theres always going to be the novel for those who want that level of detail which more people are going to read due to how great the movies are part of a masterful adaptation is knowing what to cut that still allows the story to be just as impactful,2024-03-06 03:43:52
 i would have loved to see caladan again space scotland was beautiful,2024-03-05 23:10:56
theres also the part where paul puts the emperor under house arrest on the planet selusa secundus and promised to terraform it into a pleasant world which is a nicety wrapped around a shrewd move to dismantle the sardaukar since the inhospitable nature of that planet is what allowed the emperor to create his sardaukar legions similar to how the harsh nature of arrakis created the fremen warriors,2024-03-10 14:42:48
the only changed i really disliked was chanis character i think its hard to bring the story as told to the screen i doubt fremen women as chattel would have gone down well in any scenario but bookchanis character is far more nuanced and interesting to me than always angry moviechani,2024-03-11 23:44:06
" gob jabbar poison needle 

in the movie paul says you die like an animal which is a parallel to the gom jabbar

it also contrasts how he dealt with his vendetta against the emperor which was settled by custom and honor",2024-03-14 07:00:57
"perhaps overly dense plot

understatement of all time lol",2024-03-15 02:13:02
dont forget paul also acquired a whole  wife and kids upon arrival at sietch tabr he basically ends dune with having accumulated 3 wives,2024-03-20 04:47:16
i really didn’t like how the changed the noble houses from surrendering to paul after he threatens to destroy the spice mines to everyone calling it a bluff and refusing to accept his legitimacy paul threatening to do that meant that he has really gone mad with power and was prepared to destroy the entire empire as we know it if it meant getting his revenge also i hate that they made the holy war about fighting with landsraad now at the end of the novel paul already had the control of the entire world there was absolutely no strategic advantage to starting the fremen jihad it was not a reaction to the landsraad’s declaration of war the only reason it happened was that when paul set on his quest to revenge his father and gain absolute power he has set off on the path of being the cause of the greatest genocide the galaxy has ever seen the jihad was started solely by fanatical fremen,2024-04-01 23:20:17
" overall i think its a great adaptation faithful to the spirit of the book and streamlines the perhaps overly dense plot to make it more accessible 

interesting because that was something that left me going huh at points i definitely did not find the plot as pleasing as you my thoughts

 the pacing was weird at times the transitions with all the implied developments–eg the mighty force of the muaddib and his fremen fighters–were a bit abrupt

 pauls transition into the messiah the catharsis of him deciding to make the move it lacked something

 so many of the points you mentioned definitely brought back memories and i wished they were included partially not as a whole saga themselves especially the bits about the spacing guild the bene gesserits conspiracy chani  leto and then the spice trade

 chanis disappointmentanger at the end that was a letdown to me it just screamed we should put in some romantic drama and connect it to politics in a way",2024-03-29 10:19:28
i liked part twoloved part one but all of these changes from the book frustrated me,2024-03-27 20:50:23
wait so paul was the son of leto’s official concubine does leto have a wife doesn’t that make paul illegitimate in a way,2024-04-08 05:34:51
i think not including the navigators slightly weakened in the movie as friends who i watched it with who had not read the books were asking questions about how the freman would be able to go into outer space and defeat all of the great houses at the end of the movie,2024-04-10 02:37:51
that scene where she was talking to alia then sees a bunch of fremen and says “we must convert them starting with the most vulnerable” was so terrifying and creepy imagine you’re just a little fremen child and this weird foreigner starts talking to herself while staring you down,2024-03-01 06:57:39
seriously she was sooo sinister and creepy,2024-03-01 06:57:07
very smart way to do it though i love how the underdog aka protagonist faction in this movie went full on machiavellian route immediately to increase their chance of success which also realistically paid off very well,2024-03-02 02:29:56
am i missing something or did she just say we must convert them starting with the weak and vulnerable and then one time tell some people to spread the word i thought we were going to be in for some scenes where she does some harsh stuff to convince people,2024-03-10 04:40:48
i was worried he would come off as austin butler in large head makeup but he was completely captivating ,2024-03-01 03:35:24
i  loved it i was very curious what kind of voice he was gonna use stellan was basically just doing blubbery stellan and dave bautista didn’t change his voice really either i was not expecting him to just go full “vaguely swedish skarsgard” he nailed it too,2024-03-01 03:55:16
austin butler blew me away  i genuinely thought his elvis was just meh but now this this was impressive,2024-03-01 03:14:44
i had read he studied animals in prep for the role and i totally saw it in the gladiator ring and his little animalistic  movements really creepy and disconcerting,2024-03-01 03:43:04
his face and big  head was soo perfect for the role that he didnt even need to say anything and wouldve been great and you can tell he trained his  off for the fight they barely showed chalamet since he might have used his stunt doubles more the camera was all over butler,2024-03-01 03:37:05
honestly he was my favorite character and all the scenes on the black sun planet were my favorite i want a show about his character,2024-03-01 04:52:46
i know this is heresy but austin butler was a better feyd rautha than sting in speedos,2024-03-01 03:56:56
i basically spent this entire movie waiting for the next harkonnen scene ngl skarsgard butler bautista were all incredibly captivating in this,2024-03-02 01:02:43
"final sequence was great 

“i’ll need a blade”",2024-03-02 03:50:00
awards time come around the cast should get some love but butler is on a different level,2024-03-01 22:30:24
i honestly thought he was skarsgards son the whole time because of how much he sounded like stellan was surprised when i checked the credits afterward,2024-03-02 03:38:39
surely they could have found an actual skarsgård for the role though there’s so many of them lol,2024-03-01 09:23:18
i immediately was like “oh my mom the biggest elvis fan i know won’t like this”,2024-03-01 05:35:36
yea i thought he looked ridiculous in the trailer but he was a great character in the end,2024-03-01 09:52:27
he’s almost too good at sounding like stellan i found myself confused about which one of them was talking a few times,2024-03-02 22:07:23
i genuinely thought it was bill skasgard,2024-03-02 23:25:59
honestly feyds first line sounded just like his elvis voice to me which was lol but then he became a bad  villain that i wish we got more of,2024-03-01 07:16:34
i wanted barry keoghan as feyd from the moment villeneuve confirmed the character would be in part 2 but butler won me over with his performance i still think keoghan would have been great but dont know if he would have had butlers intimidating physicality,2024-03-01 04:24:58
flits tongue,2024-03-01 03:41:09
he is who jared leto thinks he is,2024-03-04 14:44:49
that was such a cool flourish made total sense in the plot and it was a convincing take,2024-03-01 22:43:48
it was very much a bill skarsgard impression and it was weird to me that they didnt just cast another skarsgard but i was also very much here for it,2024-03-04 07:58:50
kiss my feet,2024-03-01 06:46:05
 i fully thought that was a skarsgard until i read this comment i did honestly hate how much they had shot to be like look at his prominent brow bone while he stared into the camera like pennywise,2024-03-02 12:18:17
i thought it was alexander skasgard at first lol,2024-03-03 03:18:20
im mildly embarrassed for thinking it was his son bill the whole movie,2024-03-01 18:58:58
i was so confused because i thought why is stellan skarsgard talking here  then i started thinking is this some clone of the baron  are they using stellans voice to convey that but a younger actor,2024-03-04 04:08:45
when you got the butt head and the zim zam man doing the score in a movie baby you got a hit going,2024-03-01 12:43:56
i don’t know how he perfectly did the voice but it was badass,2024-03-03 21:13:28
see i got bill skarsgards pennywise mixed with heath ledgers joker,2024-03-05 03:03:19
i legit thought it was bill skarsgaard,2024-03-07 07:07:04
he sounded a lot like nux from fury road to me lol,2024-03-06 21:26:44
yes i loved that he was like ok my dads swedish so i have to talk like that,2024-03-07 07:54:01
jesse einsenberg really out did himself,2024-03-08 00:07:42
history would tell us that  continue doing a stellan skarsgard impression for his next few roles,2024-03-08 13:32:56
he did amazing in this role,2024-03-11 00:42:51
"i honestly thought they dubbed stellans voice over his it was so convincing

felt bad for the actor that he got overdubbed little did i know",2024-03-13 14:23:43
he nailed the impression sometimes and sometimes he just sounded like a generic pirate,2024-03-01 11:22:27
no he didnt he faded in and out of it it was irritatingly inconsistent,2024-03-01 04:20:15
he was fantastic i was seriously so bummed we didn’t see his character survive the gom jabbar ,2024-03-03 06:54:07
yeah i was very pleasantly surprised and i felt like he stole every scene he was in and i couldnt help but want to see more of him,2024-03-03 09:51:40
he stole the movie were supposed to hate and disgust the harkonnens but you had to love him for how pure he was a la kal drogo ,2024-03-04 00:23:38
my only complaint is that he shines so briefly it wouldve been better if theyd shown more of him unleashing terror upon arrakis prior to the final confrontation,2024-03-03 09:07:11
he was great in elvis but i agree it kind of seemed that maybe thats just because hes like that in real life,2024-03-02 20:00:44
he reminded me of bill skarsgards pennywise and ledgers joker in the best ways,2024-03-05 03:08:08
i’m having trouble processing that that was him i truly didn’t know it until i came into this thread he’s so uninteresting in masters of the air completely completely dominated this movie,2024-03-02 05:39:14
bro he killed it  i didn’t see it coming,2024-03-04 01:30:34
yeah hes really impressed me every time i see him  seems like a genuinely humble and decent guy as well really excited to see where he goes with his career,2024-03-04 13:54:12
he’s good in masters of the air too,2024-03-06 04:19:32
why did you ever have any doubts,2024-03-05 19:46:06
i knew he was the real deal at the end of elvis when it switches from austin to real footage of elvis and i was like oh thats what elvis looked like,2024-03-16 04:36:27
seriously going into the movie i was wondering who they had cast to be pauls foil had to be someone who felt legitimate standing across from chalamet butler was some inspired casting and he  killed it,2024-03-08 17:02:30
it’s as if people didn’t see once upon a time in hollywood  if quentin deems you good enough you’re good enough,2024-03-12 06:31:47
"i remember back when he just had recurring or guest roles on shows like arrow and switched at birth but i definitely remember liking him a lot when he was the lead for the shannara chronicles  i know people like to give that show  but i enjoyed it enough and could already tell he had some serious talent

now to see his success with this and elvis just feels wild  good on him dude’s killing it",2024-03-18 00:09:28
have you seen elvis dude did an incredible job he’s a gifted actor who should get more roles,2024-04-05 18:19:07
love when they bring up pain and fenring is like hes actually into that,2024-03-01 05:24:46

if that’s your idea of a cruel ploy sign me up for another,2024-03-02 04:54:41
didnt read the books so hes probably a muchworse character compared to the movie version but hes kinda doing something for me lol probably partly due to austin butlers effect but stiiiiill,2024-03-02 14:51:28
and letting the chosen one  him for the big finisher por que no,2024-03-02 09:35:27

totally badass issues a challenge to the entire fremen and riles them up before bringing them to heel with his prophetic power,2024-03-01 22:45:20
the part where he says  take florence pughs hand in marriage after killing the baron in front of everyone was such a chad move,2024-03-03 06:43:42
this is my new favorite your mom joke,2024-03-12 01:10:04
hide your mothers im coming  also paul,2024-03-31 15:23:49
i was kinda chuckling because that scene made him seem like one of those  televangelists that can ‘speak’ with the dead,2024-03-01 07:01:54
thinking about it now perhaps chalamet deliberately leaned into the boyish humble portrayal extra hard until about halfway into this movie to illustrate the contrast,2024-03-01 05:21:17
his character is supposed to be between 1518 across the two moviesi think he was the perfect choice to go from that scrawny rich kid to a powerful messianic figure and be believable as both,2024-03-01 09:45:41
him walking into the hall where all the fremen were gathered absolutely floored me he really sold it,2024-03-01 14:00:00
never thought that id ever find tangerine cremebrulee to be the most intimidating person standing inside of a room that has stellan skarsgaard and christopher walken in it but he did it right here in this film im impressed,2024-03-01 10:35:03
he’s really good in the king too  he has a talent for portraying power ,2024-03-01 17:15:52
i think the boyishness actually fits with the “desert mouse” motif surrounding paul and was executed well plus chalamet absolutely nailed the commanding presence his character needed in this film,2024-03-01 22:57:34
yeah dune part one was my first exposure to chalamet and i was very really on him initially but now i think hes perfect,2024-03-01 16:53:50
is it safe to say he might be on the cusp in a few years of becoming one of the biggest actors ever,2024-03-02 22:45:17
"too boyish

he is perfect for twink space  jesus",2024-03-08 17:40:27
"his boyishness was a welcome choice because his was a previlaged boy from a nobel house who was mostly sheltered but also trained that came out in his mannerisms and his capabilities also it is a great visualauditory whiplash when the switch happens and he becomes this ruthless commanding presence

my problem with timmy in one and most of two is his tendency to mumble act just a personal grip of mine makes him seem like a monotonic sad boy works a bit in two but he shouldve been a bit more expressive his emotions were pretty plateau throughout but from the southern sietch speech onwards in combination with his acting and denis directing paul embodied the presence of an unreachable figure",2024-03-01 07:44:33
i didnt think he would pull it off so well i mean he was ok in the king in a quieter way but he was pretty  intimidating at that fremen leaders meeting can definitely feel his change post forbidden worm juice,2024-03-02 10:26:57
me to my so i guess chalamet is a good actor he actually had me convinced that hes intimidating,2024-03-09 22:50:34
he will go down as one of the greatest actors of our time mark my words 10 20 30 years from now whenever that may be look back at his work and his performances,2024-03-10 09:40:59
his slide to absolute bloodthirst was handled way better here than anakin skywalker in that other franchise,2024-03-11 03:21:13
i agree mainly because the actors in previous incarnations all seemed older  yet once he drank the water of life he was so authoritative it shocked me in a good way  ,2024-03-06 14:06:26
that made his transformation all the more relevant i was totally on board with him as the leader of the freman they had us the the first half ngl,2024-03-20 15:59:12
i agree i didnt super dig him in the first one but now im completely sold  excellent work,2024-03-01 14:41:07
he was phenomenal i was worried about him taking on the role but wow he knocked it out the park,2024-03-03 19:35:34
all true but i cant get over the skinny legs his still suit always looked baggy like a boy wearing his dads clothes,2024-03-03 21:42:54
he has an amazing performance in the king really shows even at a younger age he had that authoritative side in him,2024-03-06 18:56:30
having watched part one right before he does definitely look older here even though it wasn’t much time passing,2024-03-07 10:37:18
i think the first movie had a lot of pacing issues and shouldve been longer it was a fantastic foundation for this film which is one of the best cinematic experiences of the decade,2024-03-01 15:23:48
they somehow made that boy look wide enough to be oscar isaac’s son amazing ,2024-03-09 07:55:09
agree actually i didn’t buy him in the first movie at all but i was impressed this time around the acting was acting,2024-03-18 00:39:15
i mean paul is supposed to be that way ,2024-03-05 00:51:44
im assuming you havent seen the king then,2024-03-14 20:46:43
"i asked my friend i saw this movie with if i’m just old now or stars actually look younger nowadays or this movie intentionally cast stars that are skinny and waifish and look like they’d be elves in a high fantasy movie

like brad pitt and george clooney never looked like kids even when they were young the way chalamet and zendaya do but also i am old now so maybe that shifted my perception",2024-03-18 16:12:55
in the book pauls character is 15 years old,2024-03-24 18:42:04
if you havent watched the king on netflix you really should to me it was most likely his audition to this role even still be an excellent movie with an amazing score,2024-04-07 00:46:01
honestly off of how his was in part one i wasn’t expecting him to be like that once we got to know him more and it was such a pleasant surprise to me fantastic film in general but that character’s execution was something i didn’t expect as someone who’s never read dune,2024-03-01 05:41:14
"this was this generations lord of the rings

was starting to get that vibe about halfway through i thought man this is all coming together so well this is  awesome",2024-03-02 04:22:36
yes and no the same millennials that showed up for lotr showed up for dune also and a lot of zoomers are not into dune its still niche for them as lotr took over everything for three years,2024-03-02 21:12:32
if this gets a 3rd movie this will definitely be this generation’s lotr that was the best scifi movie that i think i’ve ever seen,2024-03-03 05:19:25
i wasnt sure how i felt about a funny stilgar at first but it was a great decision,2024-03-02 20:11:00
not in the same ballpark as lotr but definitely awesome,2024-03-09 07:04:25
dont disrespect lotr like that,2024-03-10 04:14:39
as is written,2024-03-03 20:11:47
why did the eagles paul not just drop the ring in mordor use the voice on feydrautha,2024-03-05 09:21:11
i don’t know about the movies but for me in terms of status dune is to scifi what lotr is to fantasy,2024-03-05 20:13:48
its good but not lord of the rings good,2024-03-21 20:07:31
in theatre someone quoted life of brian after this line it was honestly a great unintentionally funny scene,2024-03-04 07:21:08
" this was this generations lord of the rings

lets not get crazy lol

it was a good film but it could not be more opposite to lor in message and vibe it is well produced and scored if thats what you mean but there are no good people in this story",2024-03-24 22:16:41
not even close,2024-03-09 03:49:18
people didn’t like stilgar but he was one of my favs for sure,2024-03-01 04:22:02
that’s the exact feeling i left the theatre with,2024-03-07 14:24:33
i think its more this generations epic scifi trilogy hopefully what the star wars sequel trilogy utterly failed to achieve this is the star wars of the 2020s and this film is its empire strikes back yes i know star wars was essentially a rip off of the book originally,2024-03-20 23:31:31
ik there should’ve been a mark in his face right after my one and only complaint of the movie,2024-03-01 20:45:28
"people in my theater laughed at this like it was the “girlfriend mad at boyfriend” trope but that slap right after saving him was “how dare you pull me into this and how dare you become what you swore not to be” 

there was pain and fear in her slap it was perfect",2024-03-03 13:32:34
i laughed so hard at that part way more than anyone else in the theater did the whole room was living a religious experience including his mom and she slaps the  out of him  off she had to play her part in some prophecy foisted upon her people by offworlder witches,2024-03-02 03:43:29
"that must’ve hurt… for zendaya

and the music kicking in immediately after the slap my theater was dying,2024-03-06 00:43:08
i clapped,2024-03-02 08:16:49
that slap sounded like a gunshot in the theatre,2024-03-15 03:45:43
thats one way to describe anya taylor joy,2024-03-01 03:18:46
the way she was having full conversations with it in public and she wasnt even trying to hide was pretty funny,2024-03-01 03:29:38
abomination,2024-03-01 03:41:40
rebecca ferguson going sicko mode is my favorite film subgenre,2024-03-01 05:15:04
"thats the one thing i missed from the book all the fremen being freaked the  out by the creepy 2 year old that moves and talks like a wise adult lol

paul was just like oh my sisterfetus is chatting with you thats cool whats it saying 

i appreciate their scheming though and getting ready for the holy war in the book she acts mostly the same i felt like even after the ritual just mostly wants to help paul as she had been before  her excitedly declaring the holy war begins at the end was horrifying",2024-03-01 07:48:42
"it was either that or the fremen equivalent of getting whacked 

honestly id take birthing the space anitchrist over getting whacked too",2024-03-01 04:03:56
"i was ecstatic with that change instead of alia killing the baron it was paul im fully onboard with that

they managed to have alia be part of it without her sorta being there which means this all went down in less than 9 months in the book it took what 2 years to overthrow the harkonnens 

i was wondering howd theyd do a babywoman for alia but this direction is much better",2024-03-02 07:21:21
can someone help explain was this because she drank the blue juice or would she be able to talk to the baby without the juice,2024-03-01 05:21:14
without spoilers why is it an eldritch horror just cause pregnant women shouldnt drink the life water and it made this weird little telepathy baby,2024-03-01 08:39:58
"i absolutely loved the directors decision here it was the best way to handle it without having a time jump

plus it was unsettling as ",2024-03-01 11:48:49
"therapist and is alia in the room with us right now


jessica as a matter of fact…",2024-03-05 19:17:06
the exreverend mother be like oh i can finally retir oh  what have we done,2024-03-21 20:24:13
"i did not get that not having read the books  


first scene oh cute theyre joking about his sister  


then theres blue worm juice and glittery spice in the  and shes always passing on the words of the sister fetus    


um is that thing really talking no inmovie explanation",2024-03-03 05:18:41
this was the one thing i was so worried about i had visions of twilight and that baby doll abomination and i was so worried the way denis handled her was nothing short of stunning,2024-03-06 14:14:37
its even more scary in the book haha,2024-03-07 18:55:39
that and the ants scene reminded me of 00s marilyn manson music videos,2024-03-09 15:06:58
what’s the eldritch horror what’s so scary about it,2024-03-03 05:34:26
the mahdi is humble as is written killed with my crowd bardem did a fantastic job portraying blind fanatical idealisation which is so important to the source material,2024-03-01 03:45:48
it felt like villeneuve was very intentionally riffing on life of brian in that scene but i think he got away with it especially when stilgar doesnt stay the comic relief his same devotion becomes way more terrifying later in the movie,2024-03-01 03:51:19
that was a great cut too great editing all around in this film,2024-03-01 03:14:27
i loved how it started kind of humorously but those lines got less and less funny as the actual decisions and important moments came at the end,2024-03-01 06:39:23
all the comedic setup paid off loads in the scene when paul embraces being the lisan alghaib during the fremen council ,2024-03-01 03:58:20
yeah wasnt expecting so much humorous delivery but my whole theater was laughing at those parts as well,2024-03-01 04:11:02
to be fair he wasnt the mahdi until after he drank the water in which he went 100000 not humble about it,2024-03-01 06:35:49
only the true mahdi denies his divinity,2024-03-01 04:52:53
yeah i loved that there were a couple points when the theater laughed like that one and the one where paul mansplains sandwalking to chani,2024-03-01 07:54:01
"“well what kind of a chance does that give me alright i am the lisanalgaib”

“he is he is the lisaalgaib”

“now…”",2024-03-01 04:15:06
my theater also got hearty laughs at that part,2024-03-01 03:57:48
“as is written” ,2024-03-01 05:40:37
yeah they really made stilgar more comedic here but it never felt inappropriate,2024-03-01 07:19:46
i loved how my audience stopped laughing at stilgar’s zealotry in the third act paul’s conversion into a messianic figure felt weighty and earned,2024-03-02 14:33:53
loved stilgar would love to see more of him,2024-03-01 05:55:21
got massive life of brian vibes from that scene,2024-03-01 06:47:27
"what well sort of chance does that give me 

alright i am the mahdi

now ",2024-03-01 07:03:46
"i just couldnt take that seriously since it is the exact same thing in monty pythons life of brian

i am not a messiah that means he is the messiah",2024-03-01 10:25:26
"stilgars blind faith reminded me of life of brian 

 brian im not the messiah

 arthur i say you are lord and i should know ive followed a few

 crowd hail messiah

 brian im not the messiah will you please listen im not the messiah do you understand honestly

 woman pauses only the true messiah denies his divinity

 brian what well what sort of chance does that give me all right i am the messiah

 crowd he is he is the messiah bow",2024-03-02 04:03:38
am i alone in thinking this is bardem best performance yet,2024-03-01 06:03:09
bardem also got the laughs in my theater,2024-03-01 04:17:37
yeah making him a cheerleader immediately instead of over time was a smart move gave the movie some levity seems the audiences are enjoying,2024-03-01 07:32:06
"im not the messiah





he is the messiah",2024-03-01 11:34:50
i love the way villinilli managed to sprinkle humor in like that the setting is so severe strict and strangling and then he hits you out of the blind zone like you say javier nailed the delivery i just appreciate how it was made room for it to begin with,2024-03-01 13:13:33
stilgar was the greatest hype man in this movie and i loved it,2024-03-01 13:30:24
stilgar is on a  wild ride imagine having a literal  of your religion walking beside you twice in fact with the second one even more immortal and alien,2024-03-02 02:11:40
"paul breathes  
stilgar lisanalgaib",2024-03-01 13:33:00
"same i was bursting out laughing every time he talked about paul throughout the movie which made his final scene in the movie the saddermore tragic as he shouts paradise with a smile and his eyes full of faith

edit watched it a second time i enjoyed the movie even more stilgar doesnt say paradise nor does he wear a smile instead he shouts lisan algaib lisan algaib with fanatical eyes as they ready for battle however he does get overly enthusiastic when paul says show them paradise just a little prior the effect is the same

edit 2 javier bardem delivers a fantastic performance as stilgar",2024-03-01 08:37:31
at first i thought it was full on funny but the real magic i think is how i came around to it by the end when everyone is chanting it and holding their blades up i half wanted to join them lol,2024-03-02 21:28:32
"look alright i am the mahdi ok
he is the mahdi he is the mahdi
good and now 
how shall we  lord",2024-03-01 08:48:01
"i never understood the term atedevoured the role before now i get it bardem just feasted every time he was on the screen he was glowing the entire time

id love to see interviews with him talking about this movie",2024-03-03 05:42:44
same the theatre i was at we all laughed so much i loved javier,2024-03-01 14:44:58
watching movies must be different in america in the uk everyone remains silent,2024-03-01 22:04:56
"paul farts

stilgar he gives us air he is the mahdi",2024-03-02 01:14:08
i was the only one one laughing at this stuff  in my theatre,2024-03-02 02:22:42
he’s not the kwisatz haderach he’s a very naughty boy,2024-03-02 02:32:36
my theatre got a lot of laughs out of stilgar as well,2024-03-02 03:41:58
he’s not the madhi he’s a very naughty boy,2024-03-02 19:49:42
hes not the mahdi hes a very naughty boy,2024-03-02 22:57:52
same esepcially at the beginning and like someone said further down it got less funny and more serious as time went on i loved that dynamic,2024-03-03 05:40:07
myself and partner were cracking up the entire time thinking of the life of brian,2024-03-04 08:26:55
reminded me of that scene in life of brian,2024-03-08 06:33:28
same thing happened in my theater,2024-03-10 01:57:28
watched it in religious texas the humble line was met with very uncomfortable silence,2024-03-25 05:14:04
this scene is my biggest complaint about this movie it made stilgar and his men seem childishly naive in the book hes a hard perceptive person the way he should have been portrayed is as someone who believes in the bene gesserit mythology so completely that he cant perceive evidence that it might be wrong ,2024-03-02 02:19:23
it was so funny,2024-03-01 08:36:44
yeah my audience laughed at a lot lol,2024-03-02 02:42:22
i loved how his devotion was mostly played for laughs but in that pivotal moment when paul was casting a huge shadow of doubt he doubled down and we get a good look at his shear desperation and need for paul to live up to the legend  i dont care what you believe i believe it great moment,2024-03-04 21:23:14
stilgar was acting like he was a character in life of brian,2024-03-04 23:26:48
stilgar makes a great hype man ,2024-03-06 10:34:49
so funny,2024-03-11 03:11:09
there were time i thought i was watching lawrence of arabias anthony quinn instead of javier bardem same character different movie resemblance is uncanny,2024-03-12 12:57:25
my mind immediately went to the life of brian only the true messiah would deny his divinity,2024-04-06 15:02:33
"the funniest one was right after he kills feyd rautha it cuts to stilgar and he looks like javier bardem just woke up from a daydream lol 

  whats my line aga lisan al gaib",2024-04-12 04:28:02
i hated that people laughed when mohiam said abomination such an underwhelming second half of a pretty good adaptation,2024-03-01 15:58:43
i cant imagine anything worse than paying laughing during this film,2024-03-02 18:21:50
thats exactly what the messiah would say,2024-03-01 09:30:33
i immediately tought of the scene in life of  brian it is so similar,2024-03-01 12:54:21
this was one of my favorite hilarious moment of the movie,2024-03-01 15:34:41
its almost life of brian except played for horror,2024-03-01 16:27:31
"i know the theater i thought 

timmee  “im not the messiah but we need to win this war and i know how” 

everyone else “that such a messiah”",2024-03-01 17:52:14
sweet user name,2024-03-01 17:54:59
i cant be the only one thinking about the life of brian during that scene,2024-03-01 18:36:19
it was straight out of life of brian that scene,2024-03-01 20:24:53
yup my theatre loved it too the first time i had a split second thought of “i hope im not the only one thats gonna laugh at this”,2024-03-01 21:35:41
my theatre howled at all his preachings lol,2024-03-01 23:44:28
i loved it towards the end after the battle with feydrautha harkonnen everyone was quiet and he bursts out saying lisan alghaib,2024-03-02 01:01:26
bardem was awesome in part 2 it was also cool to see an no country for old men reunion with him and brolin,2024-03-02 01:58:58
reminded me of the life of brian,2024-03-02 02:27:15
he not the mahdi hes a very naughty boy,2024-03-02 04:32:14
"it was just like most of the scenes from monty pythons life of brian

im not the messiah

only the real messiah would deny his divinity

alright fine i am the messiah

he is the messiah


im paraphrasing from memory but that was essentially the exchange

edit formatting",2024-03-02 07:21:59
the fact that paul even picked a similar sounding name for himself muadilb which is just phonetically similar to mahdi with extra letters lol,2024-03-02 17:43:05
"the mahdi is too humble to say that he’s the mahdi which means he’s the mahdi

lol same in my theater everyone burst out laughing in this scene",2024-03-02 18:39:16
same here he played it perfectly zealotry that’s almost comical until the moment that he’s leading a holy war in paul’s name,2024-03-02 23:15:08
javier bardem and his fanaticism was the best part,2024-03-02 23:40:26
seemed very life of brian honestly,2024-03-03 03:34:37
our theater was loving the humble scene ,2024-03-03 04:44:15
yeah the “he’s too humble” line got a big laugh in my theater as well,2024-03-03 04:55:10
gurney repeatedly pulling chani down was amusing,2024-03-01 04:50:58
huge credit to tc he pulled off a level of intimidating presence i didnt think he was capable of,2024-03-01 04:58:52
"i also loved the part where he absolutely publicly addressed and shut down that ludicrousfortheoccasion protocol where only leaders should be allowed to speak and since hes not he should  stilgar then  there so he can take his place just to speak

 were about to go to war and you want me to  one of my best generals just to adhere to traditionprotocol",2024-03-01 06:18:52
"whole time he’s basically saying 

“don’t bring me down here don’t bring me down here bad things will happen if i go down there”

“we’re bringing you down anyway”

“alright… in that case  bow down before me”",2024-03-01 04:09:59
he looked like a sith lord that hoodie was badass ,2024-03-01 04:03:44
title dropping “dune” in front of that fremen dude had the theater gasping,2024-03-01 03:30:55
 i got chills with that scene  it was amazing especially the scale of how many people were there that room felt filled to the brim all to see paul,2024-03-01 03:16:29
when he starts telling people about their past i got chills man ,2024-03-01 03:51:17
probably the best acting in timothee’s career so far i was engrossed he gave such a phenomenal performance the whole film but that scene alone was 1010,2024-03-01 06:53:58

nothing less from the man who played  wonka,2024-03-01 05:46:52
this was definitely my favorite part because he went from a boy to a prophet he really full sent it even his mother doubted if it could work,2024-03-01 05:58:27
timothee chalamet screaming in another fakelanguage with that much passion was so  powerful and such incredibly good acting that whole sequence stole the entire movie for me just incredibly cool,2024-03-02 20:47:25
i was expectedly captivated by the whole spectable of the film until that part but that was the moment i knew that the next time i would read the book again i would picture chalamet as paul,2024-03-01 08:26:45
any timothy haters after that scene were prob converted as he killed that scene and it was prob my favorite of him,2024-03-01 10:50:14
he went iso mode  then literally  mode,2024-03-01 04:45:42
they forgot that im him,2024-03-01 12:33:55
i like how literally every single one of the freman stood up ready to catch fade though,2024-03-02 19:55:25
"it felt like a risky gamble but he had the powers to
back it up",2024-03-01 07:52:19
yea he got me with that scene i was ready to follow the lisan al gaib anywhere lol,2024-03-02 07:34:27
mans got the dracula flow energy i am himothee chalamet,2024-03-03 08:39:47
one of my favourite scenes dude is the embodiment of  around harkonens and find out,2024-03-01 05:56:40
it made me grip my girlfriends thigh  incredible acting sound design and direction,2024-03-03 07:44:04
came in like “i’m himothee chalamet” i’m just waiting for the future youtube edit of that scene playing over ‘superhero’ by metro boomin spoiler alert in the link for anybody who hasn’t watched ‘better call saul’,2024-03-02 04:58:14
bout to lay down the hardest bars in the game,2024-03-02 13:37:42
timmy can bring it,2024-03-03 06:41:32
emmm you realised the point of the movie here is that he has fully embrace his role as warmongering cult leader right…,2024-03-11 10:16:31
pretty sure it was meant to be harrowing and concerning he is very clearly framed as a villain after the slap,2024-03-24 21:56:55
no it was terrible missed the entire emotional note of why he did it to save stilgars life ,2024-03-04 00:20:23
himothy chalamet,2024-03-03 14:46:04
same show me more of the arakeen siege  it i know you shot more denis,2024-03-01 04:18:22
"i was partway through and thought im really glad this movie is so long because when will a movie of this scale and this level of emotional potency happen again 


 ive seen a lot of movies in theaters but the last time an experience felt so large satisfying and complete was lotr if the third movie is anywhere near as good as the second itll be one of the best trilogies period


also i havent seen a single other person mention it but the first scene with that deep orange tone with the sardukar getting picked off one by one and the bodies raining down was when i was ride or die for that movie i wouldve sat for 6 hours just waiting for another scene nearly as good and we got so many",2024-03-01 08:38:06
i wanna rewatch the movie already i could’ve just pressed replay after that ,2024-03-01 05:08:59
im normally annoyed by super long movies i was fine with oppenheimer but others i groan a bit but this one when i thought it was wrapping up what i guess would be the like 2 hour mark maybe i was like  i really wish i knew i had another at least 2 hours of this,2024-03-01 19:47:01
yeah it needed more time some stuff still felt rushed,2024-03-01 15:53:45
someone at my theater groaned and went thats it ,2024-03-01 08:25:44
honestly i felt like the 3rd act could have used another hour i was a bit disappointed that if you watched trailer 3 than you basically watched the entire battle at the same time i throughly enjoyed acts 1  2 and our time with the freman so i wouldnt change anything,2024-03-02 09:53:40
my bladder was struggling and i didnt want to miss a second,2024-03-01 18:14:57
"bring back intermission and let the runtimes soar

but yeah no they start hitting 4 hours and people are gonna get caught wearing diapers to the theater",2024-03-02 04:38:31
this movie needs that lord of the rings extended cut treatment,2024-03-01 11:19:11
"how i felt with once upon a time just another hour of brad pitt driving around 1969 la

an hour of drunken lizard walking",2024-03-01 08:04:07
i kept getting worried it was gonna end in the middle because there were so many intense slow mo shots of people walking intensely and staring at each other considering i still have ptsd of how part 1 ended i was constantly worried it was just about to cut to black,2024-03-02 01:52:45
"tbh this is why i liked part 1 more pt 2 was great but much of it felt rushed incomplete in terms of fighting and development of paul’s ingratiation in fremen society

pt 1 was better paced and varied in character arcing in general",2024-03-03 15:57:31
"the pure watchability is enough to know that this is the new marathon movie series when messiah drops like lotor where you watch them all in one sitting because they’re still entertaining 

also denis give us the extended cut",2024-03-02 21:06:04
i couldnt believe it was just 25 hours felt like i watched a 4 hour movie so much happened,2024-03-01 19:27:10
im gonna need that directors cut extended edition denis stat,2024-03-01 10:17:46
i fully agree my first nitpick for this movie is that the last hour just went too fast the whole i cant go south i will go south i become what i feared was almost rushed and with respect to the siege the movie made it look like the sardaukar were a bunch of unprepared bums and the fremen went like a warm knife through butter,2024-03-06 12:26:10
 no amc’s imax seats are extremely uncomfortable and i’m short the 6 foot tall dude next to me had to be in pain,2024-03-03 06:11:34
right as long as it was it still felt a little rushed,2024-03-05 01:48:09
i dont know it felt too long for me but maybe its due to so many slow motion shots in the desert if they cut those down we could have saved half an hour or so,2024-03-02 05:21:31
 i was thinking if youve gone this far give me some dune spaceship battles,2024-03-02 22:46:51
i was so upset when it cut to the credits as  into the film as i was i was fully aware that i was witnessing greatness and i didn’t want it to end,2024-03-04 04:02:24
good news is dune messiah is basically assured with the way this one ended  probably already greenest  cant wait ,2024-03-04 13:54:58
i have such a hard time watching long movies but i was just glued to the screen i totally couldve sat through part 3,2024-03-06 06:17:05
same i need another hour in this world,2024-03-01 20:30:52
"one thing part 2 does well is the way the ending doesn’t feel as abrupt as part 1 while still leaving you wanting to see the next chapter 

that’s one of the few downsides to part 1 because just as we’re getting into the thick it of it the movies over with part 2 we get great conclusions and multiple setups so you leave feeling both satisfied as well as excited for what’s to come",2024-03-02 23:23:33
i wouldnt i felt the beginning was really stretching it and i was getting really sick of arrakis,2024-03-01 13:15:18
i was so sad when the credits hit i was literally on the edge of my seat for probably 80 of the movie i have never been like that in a theater before entirely engrossed what a feast for the eyes and brain,2024-03-09 03:05:36
same it ended and i was like wait i can do more,2024-03-09 20:34:42
"i really wanted to see thufir hawat and whoever tim blake nelson was supposed to play


heres hoping denis changes his heart about deleted scenes on discs",2024-03-10 00:10:20
me too but i wont be able to hold my  that long been holding it for an hour and the thought of should i dash for the toilet was beaten by i wouldnt miss a  second of any of this,2024-03-12 16:48:43
id be so down for 35 hour directors cut of this,2024-03-20 23:38:10
i kept wanting to look at my watch because i wanted to know theres more time left but i was too scared it was going to be over soon,2024-03-23 03:34:21
ngl for a movie this long it felt rushed ,2024-03-27 22:29:46
i watched the trailers 1 time and checked the cast list but even i knew they were just zooming through stuff  but they did not have much option  loved it,2024-03-01 14:03:02
the chairs in my theatre  but i still would,2024-03-01 22:01:11
couldve had more hour of the sietch life,2024-03-02 12:30:28
"i want to see guild navigators 

its the only big missing thing",2024-03-02 22:28:21
such a stark contrast from that  argylle movie i saw last month that felt like it never ended i wanted to walk out dune 2 couldve definitely been longer,2024-03-03 02:54:54
my boy thufir was cut wanted to see him as his portrayal in this version is so good,2024-03-04 13:49:59
"chalamet absolutely killed it

in the book paul uses voice very very subtly at times no big booms or shouting just quiet whispered coercion only noticed and appreciated by jessica iirc",2024-03-01 13:44:25
costuming and art design in here was absolutely oscar worthy,2024-03-03 08:16:23
i totally see that however i also saw it as irulan preparing for war at the beginning she’s dictating the fall of house atreides so she’s not preparing for war only recording a massacre on another planet that doesn’t affect her as she begins to realize her family is being threatened by this rebellion she begins to wear helmetlike headpieces culminating with her metal veil,2024-03-05 04:59:57
costumes are not something i usually have a huge reaction too but she looked absolutely incredible every time she was on screen,2024-03-04 18:36:15
 genius costuming,2024-03-03 07:15:09
great catch the costume in the final scene was basically her behind bars,2024-03-07 19:57:58
they dont try to small talk so its a five star for me,2024-03-01 03:28:13
" sandworms the uber of arrakis

you know i just realized i have no idea how they get off them let alone slow them down once they get to where they want to go",2024-03-01 03:26:41
much less expensive too,2024-03-01 03:22:46
fremen started freaking out when they find out paul’s first uber is an uber xl,2024-03-01 07:19:13

"i love how they force them to stay surface by prying open the scales and exposing the sensitive skin to sand

it turns out sandworms dont like sand because its coarse and gets everywhere",2024-03-02 06:48:16
“be sure to leave a five star review this particular worm is always very professional”,2024-03-01 08:01:26
how did they get so many people on 1 worm haha,2024-03-01 05:23:05
i wonder how logistically they get a whole tribe of people into a single worm along with their supplies etc,2024-03-01 07:19:37
how the  do they get off the worms specially once they start adding luggage,2024-03-02 06:32:35
how do people get off though how did jessica and all that caravan get off,2024-03-03 01:41:40
can the fremei actually control the worms or just ride them,2024-03-01 09:16:20
way more legroom than any seat too,2024-03-01 05:41:28
they even got uber comfort with the basket seat,2024-03-01 04:44:26
whoever is selling thumpers must be making a killing they lose a thumper every time they take a uberworm,2024-03-03 01:51:40

 just call a worm bro im way too  up to walk back home right now ,2024-03-03 22:17:21
i still have to wonder how they get off them also how they can get large objects onto the backs of them too,2024-03-04 04:29:31
gonna launch a ride share app called thumper tomorrow,2024-03-11 03:21:44
they should unionize,2024-03-12 14:58:04
poor worms hear sound come out of hiding in anticipation of dinner get forced to be someones ride instead,2024-03-23 03:37:17
more like rickshaws,2024-03-01 06:40:34
i wonder how they get off the sandworms  i also wonder how they steer them so well  ,2024-03-04 05:01:13
i dont know if that was the intention but that was the one time my audience let out a quiet laugh,2024-03-01 08:08:52
"she’s great in everything

to me the best mission impossible movie is rogue nation because of ferguson",2024-03-01 05:17:29
you should see her in doctor sleep,2024-03-01 07:02:25
when she uses the voice on the assassin guys in the ornithopter in the first film swoons,2024-03-01 16:20:08
1010 would let her manipulate me into a galaxy spanning holy war,2024-03-02 02:50:48
my fave man  movie with her is doctor sleep  girl,2024-03-02 02:33:32

exactly to think there’s some  out here who was yelling at her on set is killing me haha she’s so beautiful such a great actress,2024-03-02 13:26:33
i fell in love with her in silo,2024-03-05 15:51:42
taking mommy voice to another level,2024-03-07 04:25:54
reckon she used that freaky voice power of hers whenever she and pauls father had sexy time,2024-03-01 10:47:49

if you liked that watch doctor sleep she’s unbelievable in that movie,2024-03-04 03:59:00
she is great in the tv series silo,2024-04-02 10:06:12
reckon she used that freaky voice power of hers whenever she had sexy time with pauls father,2024-03-01 10:48:33
they say “oi this is my stop” and the worm is like “can i get 5 stars” and they say “ahh you went too fast so 4 stars”,2024-03-01 21:58:42
"so long as youre on top as the worm starts to submerge youll just end up on the top of the sand anyway right

canonically being kept above the sand via the priedopen scales revealing the sandvulnerable parts of their anatomy eventually exhausts the worm as its not natural behavior for them presumably as they get tired they get a little easier to handle and less dangerous overall to manage which is probably important for the transport of nonfedaykin they also probably use smaller less powerful worms for this for a long range trip like the one to the south they likely ride them to their maximum exhaustion and then dismount

for riding them right into the thick of battle thats probably a great deal more risky and reckless as fitting the leadership of the lisan algaib ",2024-03-01 22:39:59
i was confused as to why the worms never went underground while they were riding is it some desert magic “we are in tune with the desert so we control worms” type deal,2024-03-03 01:16:28
i was thinking this also when paul proved he could ride the worm i was like…everyone is celebrating…is he gonna have to just walk back from wherever it dropped him off,2024-03-16 23:27:19
my theory is just that everyone has a little sled for this situation and they all pull them out at once and just say “okay on 3… everyone get your sand sled and jump 1…2…3 jump” and they just sled down a sand dune off the worm,2024-03-10 23:51:24
duck and roll,2024-03-02 09:57:35
this had me thinking about it the whole time even at the end when they went to war and arrived with three smaller worms ok somehow they get off it but wouldnt the worms just wreak havoc with all the noises,2024-04-08 01:20:24
also loved how it was done where they’re having this kind of outofbody conversation then feyd is like “i don’t recognize this area” realizing she’s been manipulating him the whole time,2024-03-01 07:15:24
"apparently the geide prime scenes were filmed with infrared cameras denis was on colbert and talked about how they were nervous about how the studio would take it because there was no option for reintroducing color since they filmed directly in infrared 

",2024-03-02 14:17:20
vibes overload,2024-03-01 03:55:39
same i didnt even know directors could do that mind blown denis,2024-03-01 04:08:42
the cinematography of this movie will be studied for decades,2024-03-02 09:43:24
there were so many incredible shots in this movie just mindblowing cinematography set design vfx costumes etc one scene after another of absolutely jawdropping visuals its was a nearly revelatory experience akin to what moviegoers must have felt when lawrence of arabia first hit theaters,2024-03-03 06:40:40
as a masters of the air watcher i didn’t know if those were fireworks or flak,2024-03-01 04:57:23
my apple watch alerted me several times throughout this movie that i was gonna lose my hearing,2024-03-02 20:30:49
guess you didnt get the twister preview before the movie then jesus i thought my theatres speakers were blown,2024-03-02 22:54:45
"i wore concertlevel earplugs in my dolby showing and it was still almost overwhelming 

its honestly pretty concerning that theaters are allowed to be that loud ive started bringing earplugs with me after an imax viewing a few years ago that left my ears hurting the next day and its been a godsend",2024-03-05 02:40:17
i felt my bigass recliner seat physically shaking during that scene it was incredible,2024-03-03 08:50:57
my imax screen vibrated so much sometimes that the picture went blurry which was fitting,2024-03-10 11:04:04
im pretty sure they used rocket thruster sound effects for the worms,2024-03-07 00:51:51
i actually felt like i needed to get my heart checked out after that scene i was physically out of breath,2024-03-10 08:01:21
i saw it in what ever version of imaxy theater has and it was literally shaking the seats,2024-03-08 21:31:55
my theater had great sound and it literally felt like i was on a theme park ride,2024-03-03 17:19:02
not so much a soundtrack as a foghorn symphony,2024-03-16 01:53:29
the imax theater i was in seemed to handle it better but yeah it was still very loud the other theater i saw it in with probably older speakers sounded like they were about to blow out at some points in that scene,2024-03-20 03:30:26
watched it in imax might genuinely be the loudest film ive ever seen and it was utterly amazing,2024-03-20 23:42:27
"chani i have some concerns

everyone else shush",2024-03-01 08:32:18
more like space muhammed but yeah,2024-03-01 12:11:58
thread,2024-03-02 10:39:13
i love how denis made chani an actual voice of reason it feels like there is no character in the original novel that says maybe this isnt right,2024-03-01 03:22:31
"it just feels like maybe these people aren’t the best role models for paul

its a shame because his only true role model was ripped away from him in duke leto

compare how pauls father talked about him answering the calling of being a leader in the first film to all of the advice given in this one i sincerely think if leto was around paul would have at the very least had a real sage to lean on for advice

ultimately by removing the duke from pauls life the emperor ultimately  his own rule in a selffulfilling prophecy kind of way",2024-03-01 09:48:27
" not to mention paul’s mother who at times feels like is filling her own agenda 

once she drinks the water of life her entire perspective is informed with the past knowledge of her previous reverend mothers and shes literally scheming and plotting with her unborn daughter that has the same memories and knowledge telepathically

thatll change a person",2024-03-01 14:16:58
"there were lots of examples of roles being reversed or changed and some great use of contrasts thematically and visually

paul bringing mohaim to heel using the voice after being helpless before her in part one

the emperor on his throne and all powerful above the baron before being brought low and appearing weak before paul

the baron himself before the emperor being physically unable to bow due to his size reluctance and lack of practice

stilgar being aloof and disinterested in letopaul in part one before becoming a mentor and then fanatical zealot in part two

jessica being a concerned mother and wayward student of mohaim in part one to becoming a cold and calculating reverend mother in part two

gurney being the harsh teacher to paul in part one to being easily outmatched by him in part two",2024-03-01 22:54:41
speaking of gurney part and him suggesting to use atomics its weird they didnt point out how they are banned in this universe and its authorization for everyone else to annihilate you if you use them offensively which im not sure if paul did in the movie to blow up that mountain,2024-03-01 08:41:40
thank you you explained exactly what i loved— each character isn’t just a side character to some side plot… all these characters and plots really feel well put together,2024-03-01 04:07:48
one of my favorite lines in the book is where paul says that stilgar  was no longer a friend he was a follower they totally portrayed that so well in the movie,2024-03-01 16:12:52
i’m not certain that i love the tonal shifts in jessica in this movie adaptation but it works well enough rebecca kills it of course,2024-03-01 04:28:21
the herberts wrote dune to be a very conscious warning and semisatire of the dangers of strong men dictators paul is meant to be scary and leto is meant to be selfaware,2024-03-01 12:56:31
"gurney is totally the yoko ono of this scenario

the scene where chani keeps trying to stand up and be the only voice of reason against a holy war that will turn the galaxy into a graveyard and gurney just keeps pushing her down and silencing her… in the moment it was funny but in retrospect it’s horrific",2024-03-03 12:54:07
ive always likened it to being an inversion of the heros journey refusing the call to action because he knows the true nightmare at the end of the road surrounded by mentor characters who push and pull him to the worst extremes of humanity its a beautiful story and really shows that the only difference between a hero and a villain is the point of view,2024-03-03 02:44:23
i had a great time but had some holes id love someone to be able to explain  why suddenly when austin butlers character comes to town can they just pelt the base with artillery  why do they suddenly know where they are and why didnt his brother do that earlier  also they keep saying the south of the planet is uninhabitable because this giant dust storm around the equater blocks them off  why cant they just fly in to the southern hemisphere from outer space  they have literal space ships and could explore the southern lands  it makes no sense to me,2024-03-03 11:07:54
"zendaya absolutely killed the acting in this role never overacted whenever something hit her character in her soul you could see just a faint microexpression of grief or disgust then back to her disciplined resolved face just a little twitch lets you know exactly how it affects her

x200b

also thought it was funny that her real name sounded so similar to just zendaya lol",2024-03-01 08:37:45
it’s like chani says to him something along the lines of their fates were already designed much of what makes paul become who he is by the end of the film is the combination of his mother gurney and stilgar and the ways they view and have used paul,2024-03-02 23:29:53
i was 100 thinking gurney was going to sell them all out after getting the nukes,2024-03-02 03:25:29
"literally though

long time no see i thought you were dead btw you need nukes bro i got nukes glass those bastards",2024-03-08 04:26:09
beautifully put,2024-03-03 04:09:17
and your left wondering how jamis would have guided him too not so subtly so is paul,2024-03-06 07:35:12

 the “send them to paradise” line has to be one of the coldest lines in the decade,2024-03-01 06:09:02
im glad they changed it to paul killing the baron as opposed to a two year old alia,2024-03-01 03:23:38
this and lead them to paradise,2024-03-01 07:08:15
i love that shot of the barons body dumped in the desert crawling with insects picking him apart the  ravenous eater gets eaten lol,2024-03-01 05:30:57
on my second watch i was kinda lingering on the lines between paul and leto from the first movie “and grandfather fought bulls for sport yes and look where that got him” with house atreides being associated with the bull it kinda came full circle,2024-03-01 03:52:47
wow i couldnt hear him say that line because the music was louder than the vocals,2024-03-01 03:47:10
my name is paul muaddib atredies duke of arrakis and voice from the outer worlds you killed my father prepare to die,2024-03-01 08:24:09
i liked how the  film makers were paying homage to alia killing the baron in the book with the gom jabbar by having paul say the you die like an animal line mirroring the reverend mother telling him that gom jabbar was to distinguish between human and animal and that whole interaction,2024-03-01 18:52:16
so much stabbin,2024-03-01 03:39:50
that whole scene was cold i was expecting the emperors soldiers  harkonnens in that room to engage paul and the fremen straight away however they all stood their ground and watched in fear as paul just walked up to the baron for the ,2024-03-01 11:54:20
“an animal caught in a trap will gnaw off its own leg to escape what will you do”,2024-03-01 04:21:03
it was also a reference to the box test because fatty will obviously fail like an animal,2024-03-02 02:17:36
as opposed to his father die fighting it was beautiful,2024-03-01 22:00:05
so glad you posted this i didnt hear what he said and have been wondering this whole time  definitely badass,2024-03-05 00:45:11
“yeah well tell me how your son is going to live in the future again”,2024-03-05 20:14:28
this scene had very what are you doing my son succeeding you father arthas vibes for me i loved it,2024-03-18 14:30:37
man i could not figure out for the life of me what he said during this part thank you lol,2024-03-19 05:50:32
same im going in imax with my dad as soon as hes free ,2024-03-01 04:06:25
would recommend going again somehow the really pivotal scenes hit harder my 2nd viewing,2024-03-01 06:34:50
absolutely loved how cool every mechanism sounded the fulton engineers guys who make the sound effects just forget the name did a fantastic job,2024-03-01 08:32:07
yeah greig fraser deserves second oscar for this,2024-03-01 07:40:14
pauls arc was really well done timo pulled it off so well,2024-03-01 13:09:16
"the use of the thumpers to imitate the diegetic beating of war drums right before the final assault was incredible

just an amazing fusion of sound and picture throughout the whole film",2024-03-02 05:31:37
the way the soundtrack meshes with the inuniverse events the sound of the orthopedocopters i know its wrong but its the word that intercepted my mind and it chuckled me so menacing outerworldly and just plain right,2024-03-01 13:19:28
" zimmer left a lot of his extended ideas for this film

one of my main takeaways the music in the first was unique and good but ive only relistened to the soundtrack once since as nothing really hooked enough for me to relisten  

several scenes here it really built up into crescendos and i cant wait to blast through it on some headphones in the office",2024-03-01 23:45:45
i was struck by the use of bells when pauls ascendancy was finalized,2024-03-01 20:47:56
" i can’t wait to go again

as someone who saw it twice already its better the second time the first time i was probably too tense about if it would live up to expectations the second time knowing its a masterpiece made me enjoy it so much more",2024-03-01 16:53:15
it’s also interesting that despite the bg inventing the prophecy and tipping the scales paul really does accomplish all sorts of crazy  see the future and defeat the invaders with seemingly no other options he obviously grows egocentric and power hungry but it’s hard to see what the preferable alternative is thus far in the story,2024-03-01 23:09:10
i also love how as the movie progresses he looks more and more and more like his father the hair and face almost resembled oscar isaac to the t especially during the finale,2024-03-02 02:00:28
the creepy freaky white skin and pale atmosphere on the harkonen planet was crazy well done,2024-03-02 09:17:20
regarding your second point there was a on overhead shot of him going through a crowd of fremen it stuck out to me that they avoided the “spot the main character” trope,2024-03-02 16:01:49
this movie had the best cinematography ever,2024-03-02 09:30:17
i was really hoping to get some of those atreides family pipes again,2024-03-06 04:41:10
" zimmer left a lot of his extended ideas for this film he really enabled the music to transport us to a new soundscape

i loved feydrauthas theme in the coliseumit reminded me of the opening of genesis by justice",2024-03-07 05:53:32
im glad the wailing was toned down this time it was too much for me in the last one and was bordering on  xl snyder cut territory,2024-03-02 08:02:00
the sound design was incredible absolutely amazing,2024-03-12 09:14:44
when i look at timothee i think of that rolling stone cover they did of that guy that was responsible for the boston thing,2024-03-01 22:25:13
i agree with the soundtrack there was a drum sequence that sounded akin to bane’s theme as he climbs out the prison the only gripe i have about his music choices is the motif of the screaming lamentation of a woman as a reoccurring one it’s nice but i feel he should have used it less,2024-03-03 11:17:36
" timothée went from an absolutely suave young man in the first act to a completely believable figurehead of religious fanatics

i was actually thinking that he still looked too lanky and kinda outofplace in some parts  and then i started thinking about casting whatifs on who else denise couldve cast in the paul role that could achieve the same kind of magnetism that chalamet had in the movie  closest i could come up with was dev patel but beyond that i couldnt think of any other young male actors that couldve pulled this performance off",2024-03-01 06:29:02
yeah but is it fanatics if he can actually see the future and read minds buuuuut hes still bringing the entire galaxy down so yeah,2024-03-02 07:25:43
legit the best performance of his career and he is only in the late 20s,2024-03-01 06:22:10
been feeling for a while that he’s the new leo teen heart throb looks but he has the acting chops and is making excellent career choices he’s an oscar winner in the making and i wouldn’t be surprised to see him go down as one of the greats of his generation,2024-03-01 08:39:13
"big time ive enjoyed chalamets previous roles but theyve never blown me away was beginning to feel that we were getting a little inundated with his castings

but this performance puts him over the top for me just wow",2024-03-01 14:32:46
back in the summer of 2014 i interned for a film company in nyc guy in program went to nyu with him and said he was going to be the next big star i hadn’t heard of him yet so sort of thought he was blowing smoke interstellar came out later that year and i was like wow he was right now…it’s like holy  that guy might have been more right about that than i’ll be about anything ever,2024-03-03 14:55:54
wonka was a smash success and his next movie is looking like it’s going to be a smash success also,2024-03-02 00:00:19
you could say the same for austin butler as well,2024-03-01 11:45:54
the last 3 movies ive seen him in were little women wonka and dune 2 his versatility and acting ability are top notch,2024-03-11 05:09:26
between wonka and his pointless appearance in dont look up ive been worrying that hes getting oversaturated in hollywood but this performance assuaged all my doubts,2024-03-05 17:02:09
i had my doubts with him even after film 1 because he’s so slight he looks like a strong wind would blow him over but he was exceptional i can’t imagine someone else doing better,2024-04-02 09:01:08
i know it’s not exactly the same as riding a giant worm but that scene gave me a visceral flashback to when i was first learning to surf the details in that scene are crazy and really pull you into the experience when it could’ve easily looked goofy,2024-03-01 03:17:31
the scale in this movie and previous one was massive and denis absolutely know how to put it on screen fraser’s cinematography was brilliant as well worm ride the atomic explosion ships cities arena scene with feyd  everything was jawdropping definitely a movie you wanna see on a biggest screen possible for you,2024-03-01 03:27:44
"just got out of the movie and  was that first worm ride was amazing the sound and visuals were bomb it was almost too good because i couldn’t stop thinking the rest of the movie how the  do they get off those things 

i also found the baby worm very cute whoops",2024-03-01 03:22:15
absolutely agree the anticipation of the worms arriving is so intense that scene alone was worth the price of admission,2024-03-01 03:18:13
a grandfather of a worm one of my favorite tropes is when the localspros are like “give it a try rookie… oh  that’s too hard for your first try… oh  he did it”,2024-03-01 03:34:14
that scene was insane and amazing in imax but really every scene was insane and amazing in imax  the geidi prime arena fight the impact of the voice in the final scene and the final battle to take arrakeen,2024-03-01 03:17:18
the only downside to watching this in imax is the fact that i didn’t have literal sand hitting my face at 300kmh sure i’d be bleed and die but it’d feel real it felt too real to the point i wish i was on a roller coaster instead ,2024-03-01 05:07:18
and the sound everytime the worm rammed into a sand dune i could feel it in my bones,2024-03-01 03:44:28
agreed another thing i loved is we didnt really get full on worm with riders on it until the final battles those worms coming in above the sand towards the sardaukar on imax was absolutely incredible i was grinning in my seat like a little kid,2024-03-01 03:44:22
i was blown away by how realistic that scene felt honestly insane that they basically made riding a giant sand worm through the desert feel 100 believable,2024-03-01 04:42:40
hands down one of if not the coolest scenes ive ever seen,2024-03-01 04:49:01
i wasnt expecting that scene to be nearly that compelling its so kinetic,2024-03-01 03:30:39
agreed that scene particularly stood out in imax absolutely incredible experience in theaters,2024-03-01 04:42:42
it worked really well in 4dx felt like i was trying to grip onto my seat with my  cheeks,2024-03-03 15:48:50
yeah i was gonna say that hey if youve already seen this part in the trailer this would be a good time for a bathroom break if youre holding it in and really need to go but  the scene just elevates itself in an imax theater,2024-03-01 06:22:56
that was my favorite scene especially in imax i was unconsciously pushing myself so far back into my seat i felt like i was in a centrifuge just incredible,2024-03-01 13:17:42
sounded like the walls were going to cave in,2024-03-01 17:43:24
i keep repeating this comment best use of imax sound systems i’ve ever experienced,2024-03-01 23:40:12
i stopped watching trailers since man of steel came out i mean that movie wasnt good but i remember distinctly waiting for scenes from the trailer basically ruined the experience,2024-03-02 09:53:55
"they gave away a good portion of the scene in the first trailer and it didn’t at all take away from the scene in context

i felt this away about the moment when you see the three sand worms emerging through the dust cloud kicking off the fremen assault id already seen the shot in the trailer but the way the tension is built and it breaking with that absolutely floored me",2024-03-03 08:26:06
this is why i dont watch trailers anymore i went in completely blind and it was amazing,2024-03-03 23:33:10
really felt like i was on the worm with him,2024-03-06 17:09:32
yes one of the best moments i’ve ever seen in a movie pure  chills,2024-03-10 23:44:29
i just got back from watching part 2 i had not seen or read anything about part 2  this is the coolest movie ever,2024-03-16 20:36:22
"heres villeneuve breaking down that scene   
lots of cool details like how the stunts were done and the challenge of filming it outside with natural light

earlier he did one of these breakdowns on the gom jabbar scene in part 1 also with vanity fair",2024-03-30 08:50:40
that scene was also the preview after the recent dune encore release in imax,2024-03-01 03:37:33
it was the final battle for me i cant even begin to describe it in words just so much going on in so many ways,2024-03-01 03:55:53
it was crazy just thinking of how he would even be able to do it with the hooks then when he threw it i realized the next step,2024-03-01 04:43:10
yeah this was one of my favorite scenes,2024-03-02 20:08:04
exactly this it reminded me of the interstellar docking sequence you just forget where you are and let the music and the visuals take over you i feel sad for anyone not watching that scene in imax the whole room shook and it legit felt like an experience i havent had in a long time,2024-03-04 02:58:20
only concern is i’ve heard messiah pretty much skips over the war while the war has been this huge setup in the films to the point of being part two’s direct cliffhanger i certainly hope that’s not skipped,2024-03-01 03:51:21
was there a doubt villenueve stated this would be a trilogy,2024-03-04 00:29:41
usually im terrified when a success breeds a sequel but from what ive read denis is a true believer and might actually be able to deliver heres hoping,2024-03-10 02:29:48
i still cant get over the inkblot fireworks can we get like two hours of that i was mesmerised,2024-03-01 14:09:59
the scale of everything in this movie and the first one just blows my mind i love seeing these enormous ships and vehicles and buildings the scenes with the spice collectors were some of my favorites,2024-03-03 00:27:09
sound in imax was kickass,2024-03-03 06:01:33
treat,2024-03-03 02:52:44
javier bardem having an absolute blast with this movie was so fun to watch,2024-03-01 03:04:28
"“i know about your grandma”

“no further questions”",2024-03-01 03:04:43
get yourself a hype man like stilgar,2024-03-01 03:04:41
"paul  does something

stilgar lisanalgaib",2024-03-01 03:06:21
hes so humble like the prophecy said he would be,2024-03-01 03:08:58
this movie went straight up life of brian a couple times and i really enjoyed that,2024-03-01 03:06:58
"paul im not the messiah

stilgar well only the messiah would say that",2024-03-01 03:13:39
lady jessica hes not the messiah hes a very naughty boy,2024-03-01 03:05:11
hes not the messiah hes a very naughty boy,2024-03-01 03:09:12
it was surprisingly funny at times,2024-03-01 03:06:10
monty pythons the life of paul atreides,2024-03-01 03:30:20
that got a loud chuckle out of the theater,2024-03-01 03:03:30
“he’s not the messiah he’s been a very naughty boy”,2024-03-01 03:09:59
javier bardem’s consistent fanboying was the best comic relief actually javier bardem’s everything was the best comic relief — i laughed so hard when he told lady jessica to not puke,2024-03-01 03:36:29
by the end of the movie it was like he couldnt physically hold it down so funny,2024-03-01 03:18:35
hes not the messiah hes a very naughty boy,2024-03-01 04:44:56
hes not the messiah mahdi hes a very naughty boy,2024-03-01 11:16:54
i definitely had life of brian flashbacks there,2024-03-01 14:46:03
hes not the messiah hes a naughty naughty boy,2024-03-02 05:43:37
this scene immediately came to my mind when stillgar started taking about how paul saying that he is not the mahdi actually means even more that he is,2024-03-02 23:49:40
you are the messiah i should know lord ive followed a few,2024-03-03 01:31:28
he’s not the messiah he’s a very naughty boy,2024-03-05 02:58:46
what have the harkonen ever done for us,2024-03-13 04:10:40
agreed this was such a smart bit of adaptation,2024-03-01 13:46:16
"i really like her uncertainty about paul after he came back from water of life

because in a way she is unsure if paul did came back or something else came back wearing paul’s skin",2024-03-02 02:45:18
completely agree it would have wasted zendayas role to have her just be kind of a cheerleader for paul who is totally on board for him to be lisan al gaib like she is in the book also cutting out leto 2 made sense for pacing and just screen time in general,2024-03-01 17:18:14
"in theory its a great change but in practice it felt forced people are in large part a product of their environments and we literally dont get any insight into why chani is seemingly the only fremen on the entire planet who is against pauls ascendance by the end of the movie

there is some lip service paid to northerners being less superstitious but by movies end we dont see a single person other than chani who hasnt bought into paul it just felt like the filmmakers wanting chani to have more agency rather than the story demanding it i get why they want her to have agency but the whole point of the story is that the fremens agency has been subtly and systematically undermined for centuries 

if they wanted to sell chani being different they should have explored the fact that her mother was liet kynes having a parent who was an agent of the imperium would at least offer chani a different perspective that could conceivably explain her detachment from the prophecy that sweeps up the rest of her people",2024-03-03 16:16:16
we got a thanos vs drax fight too,2024-03-01 05:13:04
"reminded me of the alien humanoid in prometheus

 austin butler played the role perfectly",2024-03-01 12:32:09
" i had a realization that josh brolin and javier bardem shared a couple frames since no country for old men but they were fighting together instead of against another and i thought it was extremely wholesome 

character development",2024-03-01 07:43:11
do they even share any frames in no country for old men,2024-03-02 20:59:04
i was contractually obligated to lean over and whisper to my mom no planet for old fremen during their first scene together,2024-03-08 01:52:18
copying another commenter here but they mentioned how the child actor in arrival was the weakest part of the movie i don’t know how well a child actor could portray a child with the intellect of an adult—and cgi just wouldn’t work i also think having jessica pacing halls talking to her unborn fetus added to the creepiness of both characters,2024-03-01 03:56:10
yeah if they want to play with it in messiah they can have an early scene where alia is a freaky kid otherwise i thought anya taylorjoy was a fantastic casting decision for adult alia,2024-03-01 03:27:29
some things just dont translate,2024-03-01 03:09:26
okay but imagine  just imagine  its danny devito as alia,2024-03-01 03:34:15
yeah on the one hand i was kinda looking forward to anya taylorjoys face cgid onto a freaky talking babybut it would have killed the tone,2024-03-01 03:45:07
totally agree a little girl being an adultlike soothsayer would have probably come off as bizarrefunny keeping her as an unborn tangible presence made it very eerie and cool loved the change even though i love the time jumps in the book,2024-03-01 03:59:09
"i actually love the brief glimpse that we see “i love you brother” chills

i do wish we could have the actors interact more though in that scene if i remember correctly alia is very supportive of paul for a long time maybe paul could have held her hand and speaks with her briefly for the film i want a little more humanity to the films than what i think books sometimes lack",2024-03-01 04:02:16
pregnant jessica talking to her unborn child was more unnerving than child alia couldve been on screen imo the book has the benefit of playing with our imagination and can force the uncanny valley aspect of a mature personality in a toddlers body but that in a visual medium would just come out as cute i think i have seen too many  talking toddlers with no mouth guard often enough to let that pass as scary or unnerving,2024-03-01 07:25:12
yes i can understand this change but my problem is with the timing in the book he need 4 years to gain the likes and respect of the freemen and make the guerrilla war in the movie is ¿few months its a nonsense too many things happen at planet and galactic scale on months in the last scenes you cant see the mother with a big curve either ,2024-03-02 23:40:35
an adult intelligence child might be genuinely the hardest thing from the series to adapt and thats saying something they made the right choice depicting it as they did,2024-03-01 09:34:07
they could just cast kristen schaal and make her look like shes a 3foottall toddler that sounds like louise belcher,2024-03-01 08:36:21
which means paul got to  the baron and it was just to  good you die like an animal,2024-03-01 19:26:21
agreed though i wsih we could have had more of the reverend mothers absolute horror at discovering whowhat alia is,2024-03-02 07:04:31
i agree but the barrons death felt underwhelming so i don’t know if it was an improvement,2024-03-01 03:20:44
aw but they leave out the coolest sibling interaction in the book paul leaving a prescient message for alia during the siege,2024-03-02 17:52:01
i thought they pulled it off fine in the miniseries,2024-03-03 06:33:18
"i strongly disagree it is an essential element of the weirdness of dune there are very few things i like from the lynch version but alia of the knife was very well done there which means it is doable coward move by dennis not to try

since he is not planning to do children it is understandable because alias  of the baron plays off in children",2024-03-03 22:05:09
twilight made that mistake so no other film has to no more superintelligent cgi babies it just cant be done without avoiding supreme goofiness or uncanny valley terror,2024-03-02 09:05:37
i think that the film established enough that alia was gonna be anything but ordinary,2024-03-02 09:42:24
one of the few child actor performances that ive seen like that is aidan gallagher playing five in the umbrella academy at 15 he really pulled off the 60yearold in a teenagers body shtick incredibly well of course alia is supposed to be much younger than 15 so i agree that it would be very tricky to pull that off on screen without interrupting the entire film,2024-03-10 08:23:06
m3gan couldve made it work,2024-03-01 07:54:54
would look like baby yoda,2024-03-01 11:28:40
m3gan arrakis edition,2024-03-01 14:13:35
i mean it kind of prepares for the other ridiculous stuff that happens in the later novels ,2024-03-01 20:35:16
waittttt is that what happened in the book sorry it’s been a few years since i’ve read it,2024-03-02 21:23:22
i believe the rumor is that messiah was green lit back in december,2024-03-01 06:09:10
villeneuve gave an interview on npr yesterday saying he wants to do messiah but needs a long break doing other things first,2024-03-02 07:51:27
what was up with the emperors ship giving off that fire stuff,2024-03-03 06:38:32
also a smart choice to just completely leave out leto21 it feels like an afterthought in the books as well,2024-03-02 00:19:37
bro literally brought his wifi his army and an airbnb to another planet for a camping trip,2024-03-03 11:30:14
the worms riding into battle gave me so much excitement and terror that i thought my heart was literally going to stop ive only felt something like that in roller coasters before,2024-03-16 11:09:01
" watching the dune movie trilogy backtoback will be the first true equivalent in experience to watching the lotr trilogy backtoback

i was about halfway through part 2 when this dawned on me as well 23 more years and a sit down of the entirely trilogy is going to lotr levels of  yes",2024-03-01 04:01:06
paul will be the antiaragorn for this generation if messiah gets released and the dune trilogy will be an antithesis to lotr itself a cynical take on prophecy heroism and a cautionary tale first reflects the trends of philosophy in the times we live in,2024-03-01 07:28:30
"dune book for scifi was practically what lotr books were for fantasy something that finally made the genre big and made people understand that these genres arent just for silly stories for little children


there are other parallels between them too like the authors son trying to complete his fathers work after he passed away and now you can add having a fantastic movie trilogy which is as close to a perfect adaptation as you could possibly get to the list of those parallels",2024-03-01 07:21:45
basically my thoughts  comparing this to the level of lotr just a masterful work of art in every single way,2024-03-01 04:12:04
"yeah this is going to be this generations grand opus trilogy ifwhen villeneuve finishes the 3rd film

i missed the original star wars trilogy due to being too young at the time  

lord of the rings was great and still stands the test of time  it was our generations grand trilogy

so glad were all getting to enjoy another great trilogy scifi again this time to join the pantheon",2024-03-01 06:53:56
man i really hope theres a third film the energy was just electric in the theater havent seen a movie like this in a long time,2024-03-01 09:16:02
yes i thought this same thing immediately came home and did a quick google search for when we can expect the third chapter …sounds like it could be as far off as 2030 but hopefully more like 2028 still worth it,2024-03-01 16:03:05
" oh and i’m seriously regretting having doubts about austin butler in this film man fing killed it to the point of almost stealing the show

he absolutely nailed that introductory fight conveyed so much information about the character and his relationship with the duke through  expressions alone and real scary charisma i 100 bought him as an alternative chosen one for the bene gesserit rather than as just a dude that paul has to fight",2024-03-02 19:59:51
wait theres a dune 3 coming,2024-03-01 14:20:30
"i have zero knowledge of the source material  never watched the movieminiseries or read the book  so the first thing i did when it ended was google if there was going to be a third 

gladly there is the next book in the series apparently skips the war and goes right into what happens afterwards could be interesting",2024-03-02 15:14:06
lotr has always been my favorite trilogy with rotk being my favorite movie and now im not so sure,2024-03-02 02:25:53
i was thinking nearly the same thing while watching this my thought was well scifi finally has its lotr quality trilogy,2024-03-02 22:10:34
100 agree definitely going to be a generational trilogy same as it was for star wars in the 80s lotr in the 00s and now dune in the 20s,2024-03-02 23:49:38
the only difference would be the first movie imo  i need like 3 hours of this stuff back to back please please if they release extended versions i will be able to die happy,2024-03-03 00:51:06
totally agree on all amounts about halfway through i just kept having this thought on how special this all is something im always going to remember,2024-03-03 09:02:12
as long as messiah is of similar quality,2024-03-01 07:23:45
sietch tabr calls for aid,2024-03-02 04:14:28
same but with the matrix instead,2024-03-17 21:10:35
literally just mentioned to someone tonight that watching the dune trilogy will be like those weekends i set aside to watch the extended lotr trilogy lol,2024-03-18 21:21:09
dune 1 was boring though right,2024-03-04 01:13:39
i think his baron was far weaker in terms of impact  visually interesting but the thoughts and machination we get from the books baron makes him a stand out villain i feel like the baron is more a presence than a person in the films,2024-03-01 07:50:33
"i think most of the changes made were for the better but the omissions really stung especially that they left out thufir trying to outwit the baron minimized the role of the spacing guild and didnt surprise us with count fenring

as a movie and as a sequel 1010  
as an adaptation of my favorite book 710",2024-03-01 07:41:01
"my thoughts exactly part 1 was dune book 1 and part of book 2 adapted almost perfectly with some minor changes and content cut

part 2 sticks to what is outlined within the remainder of book 2 and book 3 with some minor and major changes for me part 1 was the stronger film but i still enjoyed denis’ take on dune in part 2

i’m very curious to see how he will adapt messiah i’ve never read the book so i’m deciding whether to read it first or go in blind and read the book after plenty of time to decide i suppose",2024-03-01 19:45:41
part 2 did a way better job of conveying the mysticism themes that make the story such an interesting one imo part 1 feels basic in comparison,2024-03-03 06:44:53
"i absolutely felt this i feel dune 1 is a very solid almost literally translation of the book but not an amazing 1010 

this movie was just incredible because of the more diverse settings colors and fantastic pacing also i highly respect his changes from the novel",2024-03-01 10:04:46
"reinvented is a wildly strong word if you ask me 

reimagined is a much more apt way to look at it for me because there are a lot of changes some better some worse",2024-03-03 08:26:00
"i reread the book just before i saw the movie literally finished the last chapter this morning before catching a noonish showing the book had a lot of flaws that i never really noticed the first time i read it 

the book never really sells at least for me paul’s time as a hunted fugitive the actual fighting against the harkonnens and the paulchani courtship for lack of a better word a lot of this stuff is only referred to in the book but explicitly shown in the movie i was also disappointed that gurney is denied his harkonnen blood and that it’s alia that kills vlad and not paul or gurney

the movie fixes a lot of these flaws tho i guess what i’m saying is i think this may be one of those rare movies that is better than the source material it adapts while simultaneously being one of the rare sequels better than the first movie 

once i saw the “he who controls the spice controls the universe” stinger preempt even the wb title card i knew i was in for a good time",2024-03-03 00:38:20
im excited for it,2024-03-01 22:30:50
i appreciated that feyd rautha actually died and fought with honor too  both in that final fight and in his first scene it gave him a bit more complexity,2024-03-01 03:23:20
"i love how theres this yin and yanglight and darkness motif with paul and feyd its even reflected in their grab and armor respectively you can tell from the get go timothée chalamet and austin butler they perfectly work as foils both as actors and their characters 

paul fights with restraint and grace as feyd fights with a brutal and violent style i appreciate how feyd even in death compliments paul after he bested him",2024-03-01 03:45:25
and the entire fight isn’t scored either it was incredible,2024-03-01 04:03:36
loved it although i’m actually confused about the final death blow did paul have a hidden knife i didn’t understand the geography of the knives and the wounds,2024-03-01 04:11:00
one of my favorite scenes in a long time captivating and you’re just glued in from the third act to the end,2024-03-01 03:44:06
the fact that the plot had already diverged in noticeable ways meant a part of me wondered if feyd was gonna win impossible yet tantalizing,2024-03-01 04:22:42
loved that fight but i wish gurney vs dave bautista was an actual fight as well bautista went out too easily especially considering his role in part one,2024-03-01 07:18:30
hit me on the way home that both movies end with a great paul fight scene,2024-03-01 06:14:52
the editingchoreography was even better in this movie compared to the first i remembering feeling so so about the final fight but this was a significant improvement across the board,2024-03-01 06:17:40
the background music and sound all drop away and all you can hear is their breath and grunts it was spectacular,2024-03-02 21:43:14
it was great but i thought feyds death would be more gnarly like in the book,2024-03-01 04:07:16
my theatre was packed and you could literally hear a pin drop,2024-03-05 08:46:38
the sound of the blows and the knives was unerving  really made you think any strike could ,2024-03-01 21:38:39
" man i knew how that final fight was gonna end

you and paul both so funny when gurney says why does he take risks like that like my guy do you not get it yet",2024-03-04 00:39:57
greig fraser is also an amazing director of photography,2024-03-01 04:02:35
shoutout to richard king supervising sound editor  sound designer ron bartlett rerecording mixer and dave whitehead sound designer to name some of the key leads in the post production sound department,2024-03-01 06:34:07
sound direction is just magnificent,2024-03-01 05:23:33
more like an oscar sweep,2024-03-01 08:44:59
patrice vermette i think he’s been with denis since prisoners iirc and won the oscar for dune part 1,2024-03-01 10:42:03
oscar and theyll get it for sure no competition,2024-03-04 00:28:24
something tells me they found the people who already got that raise to work on this movie lol,2024-03-03 06:46:58
whips out a voice gun ill  muad dib your  head off,2024-03-01 08:21:01
in imax that stomp had the same intensity as the freaking nukes,2024-03-02 22:02:15
or maybe an homage to ending of fast and the furious 7,2024-03-03 00:16:31
early on i was thinking he wasn’t really hitting it as a cult leader type… and then suddenly there it was,2024-03-01 03:06:27
" watching that scene where paul uses the voice to say silence and one of the bene gesserit literally stumble you feel like youre being yelled at by an otherworldy person

also happy to see timothée get to do a scene that his fellow paul actor kyle maclachlan did 40 years ago in lynchs dune",2024-03-01 03:13:37
the “using the voice” scenes are so well done we watched a double bill and i forgot how great rebecca ferguson is when portraying it escaping with paul in the first film was fantastic in imax ,2024-03-01 03:33:15
"him addressing the fremen got me to say holy  outloud


timotheé was fantastic throughout the movie",2024-03-01 03:10:02
the scene with the fremen was so gripping and he was so impressive despite mostly speaking in a made up language he was really dialed in with this performance and did so well capturing pauls boyish naivete in part 1 growing to the hardened lisanalgaib by the end of part 2,2024-03-01 03:46:43
obviously it’s early but i think its very likely he gets a best actor nomination and i can’t imagine they’ll use any other clip than the scene where paul becomes the lisan al gaib would this be the first time an oscar clip is delivered mostly in a fictional language,2024-03-01 03:40:29
"when he shouted at the main bene gesserit you could feel it in your bones in my theater really amazing portrayal of the change from their first meeting

abomination",2024-03-01 04:21:50
your face is etched by adolescence your cheekbones jump toward what are youthladen eyes that slide down a prominent nose and onto lips of a certain poetry and the way you hold my gaze makes me fear my own age because something in me tells me you are going to offer me something and for now im not sure its going to be something  want anymore,2024-03-01 04:52:42
he absolutely brought it in this one insanely magnetic every second he was on screen,2024-03-01 03:14:41
if anyone watched him in “ the king “ he gave a phenomenal pre battle speech to his army kid has the goods,2024-03-01 05:20:49
the audience i was with actually cheered and applauded when he shouted never thought i would see that type of engagement with dune from the mainstream audience but it feels great,2024-03-01 03:20:33
his best performance since lady bird,2024-03-01 04:13:53
the audience whooped and applauded at the “silence” moment in my theater in sunday night so cool to experience,2024-03-01 03:35:17
"i feel like denis and others did a lot to build the atmosphere and create the shots to elevate these moments 

i don’t feel like they would’ve been as powerful without the direction cinematography and score 

not to discount the performance just to say that it all came together in such a complete way",2024-03-01 03:39:42
,2024-03-01 04:01:58
i feel bad for anyone who did not see this in imax i saw it sunday and have been on a high since,2024-03-01 10:46:24
" that “silence” voice was bloody loud in the imax theatre

i shat myself at that part felt that silence in my chest",2024-03-02 18:42:56
yeah ngl the sound was so booming at times it made my hair move which admittedly is a first,2024-03-03 02:37:32
he  needed the voice in southern arrakis speaking in a cavern full of hundreds of thousands of people as far as the eye could see yet they could all hear him,2024-03-03 17:54:10
"he might be the best in the world 

people here gonna have to realize it sooner or later",2024-03-01 03:07:12
that movie is so great in imax the bass are certainly working and in imax its making seats shaking,2024-03-01 08:30:44
hes got the it factor,2024-03-03 03:10:45
yeah i really was assuming it was going to feel a bit silly but man he was properly intimidating,2024-03-01 10:13:03
it’s written,2024-03-02 17:08:31
yeah gotta say… timmy killed it i don’t think people will make fun of him as much now,2024-03-03 17:16:36
him using the voice on the reverend mother…i almost  a brick,2024-03-24 02:47:33
that stuff is all sound design imo i think they’ll get an oscar for that,2024-03-01 23:28:08
he’s probably going to become one of the biggest actors ever,2024-03-02 22:40:20
you’ll be happy to know that all the scenes were shot using natural lighting denis insisted on it despite the challenges that created with film timing but it absolutely paid off ,2024-03-02 05:37:52
"it was great seeing every single freman stand up like you wanna test that out
especially chani the look of defiance on her face was superb",2024-03-03 05:55:17
"added to this was the absolute change in pace at this moment 

i expected that paul would be more authoritative on “the path” he sees but for him to basically override whatever ideas anyone else had about how to respond to the harkonens was way beyond my expectation

and same for the actor  you could sense the portrayal of conviction coming but for it to happen in the blink of a scene bravo all round",2024-03-03 15:45:26
yeah that was the best sequence of the movie i think when he singled the one warrior out and you realize that after the water of life he really could see everything that dude was a skeptic ready to  paul and then he was on his knees  great cinema,2024-03-06 04:16:19
think point 2 might just be your own perspective tbh chalamet has been incredible for awhile and has demonstrated his range quite a bit in the past few years,2024-03-04 00:47:53
" the audience doesn’t realize the actor is capable of such a performance 

have you seen the king that movie follows a shockingly similar arc to dune and really solidified my opinion on chalamet’s acting chops his “make it england” speech had me pretty floored by his performance when i first heard he was cast for dune the king is why i knew we had nothing to worry about",2024-03-25 03:35:28
the sound holy  i felt like i was right next to that ‘thopter,2024-03-01 05:25:03
top gun maverick dune avatar 2 oppenheimer and now dune 2 i wonder what’s next…,2024-03-01 07:06:21
honestly think both movies might have the best costume design of all time i struggle to come up with anything close just so cool,2024-03-03 01:14:00
furiosa is right around the corner it might be a contender for sound sound editing costume design and art direction also,2024-03-02 00:02:04
you forgot best picture best cinematography best director best actor and best supporting actor,2024-03-06 04:37:01
the costume design was the most impressive ive seen in a film for a while,2024-03-09 15:10:58
best production design costumes are winning for sure,2024-03-16 19:44:25
whenever alia spoke through jessica’s voice it gave me chills bad,2024-03-01 05:43:51
i loved the intro to the arena and the rising cacophony of hype when feyd is entering horns blaring also cant get the alien but addicting sounds out of my mind from that sequence,2024-03-01 11:33:58
scenes with the voice hits so crazy in the theatre i wasn’t able to watch part 1 in theatres and only caught the hbo release the soundtrack and sound design is just insane in a theatre holy,2024-03-01 19:48:37
11 out of 10 thats a bit harsh,2024-03-02 07:48:37
that shot of the first worm looming out of the dust storm in front of the sardaukar was absolutely chilling  and then seeing three,2024-03-06 23:12:45
my only problem with geidi prime is that the audience in the coliseum look too much cgi,2024-03-06 22:02:45
100 the setup for the final battle and the final battle was rushed the film should’ve been 3 hours,2024-03-01 16:37:02
to be fair the final battle was pretty much identical to the book depiction it starts and ends within the span of about one chapter the fremen attack and it’s pretty much immediately apparent to everyone that the imperial force is completely unprepared and outmatched,2024-03-02 22:20:21
it definitely felt like there were some scenes missing between paul gaining control of the fremen and when the emperor shows up like a preparing the troops for war montage or even just a beat to pause and let the characters reflect pauljessica interaction was sorely lacking as well,2024-03-01 18:34:30
it could have been an extra hour and i would not have complained,2024-03-02 04:13:08
"i felt the entire third act was rushed especially compared to the beginning where we spend so much time seeing paul become a fremen 

we dont even get a chance to reflect and realize the gravity of pauls actions once the climax ends it just cuts to the holy war also felt that the battle was won a little too easily 

i know im in the minority but i prefer part 1 over this",2024-03-01 20:49:18
agreed they started fighting and then like 30 seconds later they were already on the emperors ship,2024-03-10 02:06:48
agreed but at least it wasnt as rushed as in the book,2024-03-14 05:03:59
im concerned more people arent saying this it felt way too rushed,2024-03-09 16:48:02
but we needed those 20 minutes to watch paul ride a worm and make it into a giant spectacle why would we spend time on the climax,2024-03-09 04:01:43
"how he handled jessica chani and alia were absolutely brilliant in helping bring various themesviewpoints into the movie 

anyone that complains about these changes just dont understand why they needed to be made",2024-03-01 12:49:41
agreed my cinemas did a double feature on wednesday  part 1 and 2 back to back was really good to get that part 1 refresher before going in to part 2 and it was a bonus to have them both on the big screen,2024-03-01 08:57:18
"  i think its a definite you need to have seen part 1

i actually think not that much come to think of it you just need to know that the harkonnen are the bad guys and wiped out pauls family but thats made pretty clear in the movie itself",2024-03-01 13:24:56
"chani being the voice of doubt was a smart way to bring pauls internal conflict to the screen and it gave a lot more depth to her character it says a lot that the films closing shot was her

taking alia off the stage completely was for the best jessica talking to her unborn baby was chilling",2024-03-06 06:45:42
if we get messiah i just don’t understand how the chani changes hold up…if it ends here they’re fine as is,2024-03-03 08:29:32
"respectfully disagree i like the changes to chani in theory i was excited to see them going into the theater but in practice it didnt work shes the only fremen that voices any opposition to pauls ascendance by the end of the film and we dont get any insight into why shes different it felt more like the filmmakers wanting her to have agency than the story demanding it

id argue it shows either a lack of understanding of or lack of care for the material on denis part the fremen are proud strong people but their agency has been subtly stripped from them by centuries of plotting and propaganda herbert was showing the power and ills of these kinds of power structures and the film seems to get it in that great exchange where paul talks about how heartbreaking it is what the bene gesserit did to the fremen but in that same vein chani is fremen and as a product of growing up fremen would be subject to the same lack of agency as the rest of her people we dont get an explanation for why she is different  we get some lip service about northerners vs southerners but its band aid over a bullet hole given that we dont see any other northerners resist pauls rule at the end of the film",2024-03-03 16:34:50
"it was basically done already in matrix reloaded i know that was almost 20 years ago but it’s basically just replaced the water of life with techno music 

seriously though i think villeneuve probably felt  in general would have detracted from the power of the zealotry portrayed in the film like 15 minutes into the film an entire community just has  with one another and paul and jessica are both there as an audience we’d view them as crazed desert sexgoblins instead of an oppressed people desperate for actual hope 

i missed it too",2024-03-01 04:11:56
my only criticism is that they kind of ignored the spacing guild in this adaptation i think a scene or two showing how nobody  with the spacing guild might have helped audience understand why pauls threat at the end was so scary to everyone,2024-03-01 12:37:40
"the spice  was probably cut to ensure a pg13 sadly 

maybe it was filmed  if it was denis wont release it like other filmmakers do",2024-03-01 04:01:06
it’s definitely one of my visually favorite scifi movies i’ve seen it was beautiful all the cinematic shots were unbelievable ,2024-03-01 03:15:02
yeah i found it weird the fremen were outside so often especially at that ceremony,2024-03-01 03:57:56
no navigators ,2024-03-01 05:21:37
"pauls revenge worked better for me in the book because the betrayal and evil is more present throughout the story the revenge is less satisfying in the film perhaps its better to watch both films in one sitting

and then of course theres the omitted dinner sequence and the books more elaborate intrigues and underlying layers of power struggles and betrayal but definitely a visual feast i must admit though  that ive exhausted my quota of constantly whispering voices in strange languages with jacksons tolkien adaptations",2024-03-01 10:58:53
"i felt the same way walking out of this movie as i did when i walked out of jurassic park 30 years ago  its a watershed moment  this is the greatest scifi or fantasy epic film ive ever seen  if they stick the landing with the third one it eclipses both star wars and lord of the rings as the greatest trilogy of all time

i really cant say enough about how blown away i was by dune 2  i enjoyed dune 1 but i did not love it  there was just something missing as far as story and character development  whatever was missing though dune 2 had it and more  im stunned and impressed  incredible  phenomenal

the best portrayal of a messiah character that ive ever seen",2024-03-02 17:34:42
yeah how the absolute  does this have a 79 on metacritic this is one of the best things hollywood has put out in two decades,2024-03-01 13:59:33
scifi lord of the rings,2024-03-02 02:12:01
this movie is honestly one of the best portrayals of what dmt made me feel and think like that i have ever seen,2024-03-02 08:15:19
literally the best movie theater experience i have ever had it was ethereal,2024-03-01 06:15:32
there was a spice ,2024-03-01 22:28:42
it’s very average imo the final battle between the 2 armies was way too short also a 1on1 knife battle could decide the fate of the universe,2024-03-01 09:05:11
"glad they didnt put that in 

an  would have ruined the vibe of the film and i would not have sympathised with the fremen",2024-03-12 04:57:10
can you imagine the stench,2024-03-04 04:48:06
that’s a great insight and viewers can also shift where they engage with the film on repeat viewings,2024-03-01 03:45:35
" you can basically just tune out the story and let the sound and visuals wash over you

this is me i’ve never even seen the first one or read the books so i was a bit lost with the story though i got the gist of it but it was a beautiful looking movie and i had a real good time with it",2024-03-01 04:09:07
yeah this is one of those movies where every element is great  narrative themes characters technical features  and there should be something for almost everyone,2024-03-01 03:35:21
man i was worried my expectations going in were too high and even if it was good i was too hyped big nope still absolutely floored best theater experience since dark knight cant wait to go back 3 or 4 times,2024-03-01 12:38:23
really insightful and well said hadn’t thought of it this way,2024-03-01 03:19:20
"better yet even if you like none of that the action speaks for itself  this is up their with lotr and the og matrix trilogy for best pure action of the century i know denis says hed never do a superhero movie  and fair enough at this rate   but he really really should his batman would top nolans and thats something i dont say lightly

hed also nail an rrated punisher flick just saying fiege",2024-03-01 03:59:00
yup agreed these films are full on masterworks my only critiques stem from the source material bene gesserit not getting shot on identification seems… unlikely,2024-03-02 16:26:30
its a super complex story and a lot was going on in this one i definitely fell into the realm of getting caught up in the politics and realworld allegories along with the visuals just stunning visuals and impressive how dennis managed to pull off such a rich story that has so much depth so much intertwining and things to analyze,2024-03-03 06:08:51
as good as it was the first one was still better imo i guess we are going to see a third one too considering how its kickin it and on track to do better than the first,2024-03-06 04:12:08
very well said 1010 comment,2024-03-03 19:40:37
holy  you’re right the fight we never saw happen in endgame even tho draxs purpose was to  thanos,2024-03-01 14:16:12
thats one of my favorite movies id love to talk about whiplash,2024-03-01 03:18:56
now that you mention it she is just like the bene gesserit madame web a dune prequal,2024-03-01 03:24:48
no that has jk simmons,2024-03-01 03:19:05
my last four theater experiences were argylle madame web drive away dolls which was fine and this its insane whiplash,2024-03-01 03:18:35
not my tempo,2024-03-01 04:48:23
one of the worst imax experiences ever to one of the best imax experiences ever  madame web was baffling on every level and dune part 2 was just stunning on every level,2024-03-01 04:51:26
was it your tempo then,2024-03-01 03:47:29
madame web is a cash grab dune is what movies are supposed to be,2024-03-02 00:12:06
madame web was not quite my tempo,2024-03-10 11:44:23
why would you do that to yourself,2024-03-21 04:21:12
why oh  why,2024-03-01 04:47:41
which one is better,2024-03-02 04:11:59
they were both great times in the theater for me just vastly different reasons madame webb was the last movie i saw in la before i moved and it was such an awesome experience,2024-03-02 04:25:17
madam web not my tempo,2024-03-02 15:58:21
definitely not the same tempo,2024-03-03 07:59:58
yeah i loved how they turned chani into the embodiment of the doubts that paul has in his head its tough to show mental turmoil on the screen so turning chani into his doubts was a great move,2024-03-01 14:07:29
i enjoyed not just the better chani character and zendayas excellent performance but also the thing where the younger generation of fremen dont care about the religious myths really helped show the fremen as real people and not just a monolithic stereotype i dont remember the book really doing it that well,2024-03-02 06:56:22
chani doesn’t exist in the books,2024-03-01 16:17:08
yeah but we needed a bit more of herblink and you miss her,2024-03-06 04:20:35
"i misread your deployment as development and was wondering what development a cgi fetus

had a good laugh out of my own mistake",2024-03-12 17:09:26
id argue that chani was the embodiment of loyalty and love in the books she wasnt just a throwaway character in dune she was his moon the moon fell she was a fierce fremen i thought movie chani had less depth tbh,2024-03-30 05:04:49
yes and they also slammed on the gas for the jihad they literally boarded ships straight away,2024-03-01 05:49:44
correct,2024-03-01 03:53:41
ormaybe shes just having an extra long weird pregnancy,2024-03-01 05:45:52
whether the time jump would be included or not was my biggest question going into the movie but i understand why it was skipped it brings with it so many significant plot elements like alia’s character and paul’s son that it would have likely felt confusing rushed and impersonal even in a longer movie like this honestly it’s a complaint i have with the original book too the last third is so fastpaced that it hurts the development of the characters a bit,2024-03-02 21:46:56
i mean if they want they can probably try to explain it away by saying it was spice water of life or some bene gesserit  but as far as i can tell yes,2024-03-03 16:31:41
yes its possibly a plot hole but a pretty inconsequential one i just assumed the timeline was fairly similar to the books and she was just slowing down her pregnancy not really a huge leap of logic for a reverend mother to be able to slow a pregnancy when its very wellestablished that even a normal bg can choose the  of a fetus,2024-03-03 01:03:32
things i recently learned under 10 months  a little better lol ,2024-03-04 19:54:46
im glad you brought this up because it was something that kept popping up for me as i watched i polled my friends and there was a bit of a gender divide on who had thought of it and who hadnt which makes some sense our thought process has been that the water of life probably made it longer than usual because all of this in that time period seems improbable,2024-03-09 22:17:50
i think its because it feels timeless you know how some movies like rebel moon give away that it was made in the 2020s dune doesnt feel that way its highconcept scifi shot like oscar bait and im here for it im actually thinking of watching it again,2024-03-01 03:52:32
i was saying to my wife today that this is the 2020s version of star warslotr glad it happened to dune of all things,2024-03-01 07:31:39
said to my mate just before that this film is right up there with blade runner and empire strikes back as the best scifi that ive seen,2024-03-01 05:20:16
"think higher than that 

goat film trilogy is in play",2024-03-01 03:54:58
"ill get hate for this but star wars doesnt belong on that list  it was revolutionary at the time but its corny as  and doesnt hold up  

dune transcends scifi and is pure cinematic art",2024-03-01 17:16:07
"star wars even at its peak was never close to this

but lotr was",2024-03-03 04:22:59
this has to be the most laughable comment in this thread  maybe from a cinematography perspective but in terms of story telling so far dune 12 are several steps below both lotr and the original sw trilogy,2024-03-13 00:47:03
"this is what i told my dad i haven’t been able to convince him to see a movie all year and i see 23 a week i pitched this one to him as having an epic fight comparable to the battle for isengard in lotr 

he is now interested in seeing the movie ",2024-03-01 06:08:26
coming out of imax earlier i thought to myself  i think this might be the best scifi movie ever made,2024-03-03 11:56:46
agreed star wars ot lotr and dune are going to be the classics people are still watching 50 years from now,2024-03-06 06:51:13
easily,2024-03-01 04:17:42
she was something straight out of a horror film in this one especially the scenes of her wandering around the empty halls of the sietch talking to her fetus i loved every moment she was on screen,2024-03-01 11:11:39
and you cant even go cry because its a waste of water and frowned upon in your culture,2024-03-04 14:40:49
not only the actors everyone that worked on this film name a thing in a movie casting acting costume design set design editing cinematography music sound design vfx lighting stunt work prop design dialogue pacing all of it is top tier,2024-03-01 21:57:23
timothee has earned my butt in the seat at every single movie he stars in from now on i feel like we just witnessed a new leonardo dicaprio born the acting after the water of life was just insane his movements his voice his face he sold the scene insanely well im fully thinking denis believed he was the messiah right there lol,2024-03-02 12:12:38
same and it didnt even feel like 3 hours which says a lot villeneuve crafted every minute of it perfectly,2024-03-01 12:35:35
i’m going wait a few days before making my final judgment but how i felt immediately after watching this was how i felt after watching tdk esb and lotr for the first time just one of those films where every aspect of the filmmaking is firing at 100 and you just get something amazing,2024-03-02 04:32:18
youre right i was fully engaged all 3 hours of it,2024-04-08 02:16:14
definitely in addition to some scenes being recontextualized there were some of paul’s visions from part one i think that were morphed or called back to like when chani is fighting in the final battle she stops and turns and it is the same movementangle as paul’s vision of himself fighting as a feydekin sp from the first movie i’m sure there are other scenes like this,2024-03-01 03:36:24
there were a lot of bugs in the projector booths at lincoln square… somehow they added a unique character to the desert scenes,2024-03-01 03:33:23
"lincoln square rise up 

there are like 75 dune posters there lol",2024-03-01 13:32:40
in that opening scene of pet 1 she also asks “who will our next oppressors be” and then it smash cuts to paul now that was foreshadowing,2024-03-01 06:05:21
bro how about gurney waking up the stairs to shank the beast,2024-03-01 06:50:12
i was there too such a good show,2024-03-01 03:28:14
crowd was so hype lol,2024-03-01 15:09:07
thats my all time favorite theater really sad i cant see it there i moved,2024-03-03 14:13:59
just watched it there absolute insane in dolby,2024-03-02 04:16:12
in part 1 we see chani and jamis in part 2 its literally chani and paul doing the same thing dreams are messages from the deep,2024-03-04 01:22:08
i mentioned as well with zendaya in a way i felt this was kind of her movie especially that she is the good character seeing everything terrible happening how paul is using her people those two really crushed it here movie rested on their shoulders and they pulled it off,2024-03-01 03:45:01
i really feel like this movie is going to elevate the next generation of hollywood it’s epic and it features a handful of the big young stars florence pugh shines anya taylor joy even shows up,2024-03-01 07:28:20
zendayas got it too holy   her chani was incredible,2024-03-01 04:14:59
after he drank the water his hair was prime and he had the perfect flow going on for the rest of the movie ,2024-03-02 04:57:00
the rage she had in her look back was incredible as well what an amazing lead duo,2024-03-02 20:34:22
chalamet butler zendaya pugh are very much the next generation of alist actors whatever the ‘alist’ ends up meaning they have real presence here and i’m glad they didn’t go with no names,2024-03-02 05:54:56
timothy is the patrick mahomes of the movie industry,2024-03-01 03:56:23
had the exact same reaction been a fan of timmy for as long as ive been aware of him but i walked out of this thinking okay dude is a legit movie star,2024-03-05 06:37:25
him zendaya butler pugh seydouxtaylorjoy all have the juice incredible cast with a group of actora poised to take over hollywood,2024-03-03 19:44:30
that worm juice,2024-03-01 18:57:36
yeah nothing against tim but in the first movie i was wondering how this guy was supposed to lead armies thats how great job,2024-03-02 00:29:32
lol i kept calling him timmy too,2024-04-02 09:02:28
seriously villeneuve should get the blank check they keep giving to nolan he’s 10x the filmmaker and it’s not even close,2024-03-01 15:20:54
man i had that exact reaction when i heard denis was directing dune after seeing arrival i knew that  was in good hands just awesome,2024-03-02 03:52:42
"this is how i finally read dune i knew it was a book that people liked and that people said star wars was loosely based off but when news broke dv my favorite modern director was doing an adaptation i had to read it i used to love reading as a child and had gotten away from it in my adult life dune was the first fictional book i read in 15 years and it blew me away 

to have dv get the opportunity to do the adaptation and exceed all expectations in doing so makes me so happy its a fascinating universe and tragic powerful story so beautiful to see it on the big screen bravo frank herbert bravo denis",2024-03-03 19:13:51
i’d like to think frank would have been like  bro you cut out like 5 characters and made this all happen over a couple months,2024-03-01 05:00:05
the point of him telling her he would always love her right before taking the hand of irulan is that it was his way of telling chani his heart would always be with her but he needed to do what he needed to,2024-03-01 07:37:09
i love how she wouldnt cry not giving up her water,2024-03-01 15:55:17
i really felt like a michael corleone moment of shutting the door on kay with paul fully embracing the role of messiah,2024-03-01 14:05:42
i had to scroll so far down to see this comment everyones praise for butler  chalamet is so deserved but zendaya also killed it particularly in the last half,2024-03-01 05:32:52
zendayas warddrobe at the premiere kinda reminds me of florence’s from the movie end all silver metal,2024-03-01 07:29:53
space jesusnahin his own words he is worse than genghis kahn and a certain austrian painter,2024-03-01 09:23:27
i laughed at how she remained skeptical of paul’s prophethood even after she personally and unintentionally perpetuated the prophecy girl what more proof do you need,2024-03-01 08:58:59
after the other houses said we dont respect your ascension i dont get why hed have to go through with marrying florence if he has to go to war anyway mine as well pick his wife,2024-03-03 05:34:31
“i guess i’ll take one for the team and marry florence pugh if i really have to”,2024-03-03 13:24:18
 chani is such a heartbreaking character she loves him so much and now there’s nothing she can do to avoid what’s coming she tried so hard to avoid this but even she knew “our lives have made choices for us” i’m gonna be thinking about her character for a long long time,2024-03-06 04:07:01
" the absolute combination of rage and heartbreak in her final scene was beautifully acted

zendaya is born to act that way love it d",2024-03-01 08:51:28
i was so panicked and anguished at the very very end because i thought she was going to summon the worm and just let it eat her out of despair and grief,2024-03-03 04:25:02
well done in the movie but kind of weird considering book only apparently paul was essentially married to another with adopted kids basically the second he killed jamis,2024-03-03 05:06:42
i’m not super familiar with the books but isn’t she like reluctantly on board with all of it and still lives with him and bears his children in the next book does seem like a more realisticrelatable change that dv did,2024-03-04 00:35:48
im actually kind of scared to rewatch this again on streaming down the road watching this on anything lesser than a fullsized theater screen feels like youre not getting the full experience,2024-03-01 03:53:30
"i can think of at least two significant issues well to me at least the last act was a tad rushed and some of the dialogue was very on the nose overexplaining what the brilliant visual storytelling already conveyed

also while i have not read the book the emperor seemed too feeble and bland of a character in my eyes and ive been told he was more interesting in the book",2024-03-01 23:58:53
you mean lisan  al gaib,2024-03-01 21:37:56
nolan,2024-03-03 08:15:48
tbf to me it definitely did feel tragic i have never read the books but i immediately enjoyed stilgar and was saddened that his own personality was slowly sapped as he drove himself deeper and deepr into the fanaticism which i imagine was meant to be the case,2024-03-04 23:30:45
yeah i was wondering how he differed from the books because in the first movie he was very stoic and skeptical but here he accepted everything pretty fast,2024-03-03 14:20:49
when he smiled and kneeled at the war council i felt the same way as paul did in that excerpt i think they did a good job,2024-03-04 16:43:52
i think this tragedy is somewhat touched on in the film in the conversation between paul and jessica i think before jessica goes south paul yells at her about the religious fantaticism getting out of hand which mostly relates to stilgarsouthern fremens,2024-03-05 23:24:16
find the soundtrack of the movie and listen to it its incredible,2024-03-01 17:18:23
im glad the work with nolan but im also glad he moved on the thin red line is my favorite score by him but this had me so overwhelmed with the textures almost making a stylistic samples from other scores and their films messages the deep brooding and sometimes bordering on mongolian throat singingchoir feel like the meditative chants from koyaanisqatsi the bene gessirit wailing chants too sound so similar to bulgarian choir music and also similar to the score of ghost in the shell the score of gins has a japanese style marriage folk song with similar harmony from bugaria too the breathy percussive shots during the harvester attack also references the art design of ghost in the shell and akira the latter of which feature similar chanting and drum work in its score,2024-03-01 08:49:49
i really find myself preferring every note of the part 1 score to the part 2 might take some time i guess and some rewatches but the first one grabbed me instantly and hasn’t let go in 3 years,2024-03-03 06:00:31
i noticed this too i was thinking wow the lenschanging sounds organic and wet like an eyelid it was memorable and noticeable despite being such a small detail,2024-03-02 20:21:34
that such a cool note on the binoculars thank you,2024-03-10 12:17:00
the only change i didnt like but was the lesser of two evils was rushing the timeline his sister should have been a few years old by the end everything happened too fast particularly stilgars change from mentor to worshipper but there was no good way of telling her story at that age so i get it,2024-03-18 03:16:00
oh stewardess  i speak jive,2024-03-03 03:08:26
girl straight up just said luv u bro and dipped,2024-03-06 15:41:37
this prophecy is how they enslave us and make a simp out of him,2024-03-01 08:35:39
but i mean wasn’t the point kind of him warning her that even though he was about to arrange a political marriage his love is for her,2024-03-03 00:56:57
lady jessica pauls mother never married his father either she was just his concubine marriage is for politics but to reference the books history will remember both jessica and chani as the real wives not irulan,2024-03-02 13:38:00
near the end of the movie we see pyres of slain harkonnen and sardaukar being burnt in a clear parallel to the pyres of slain atreides at the beginning after the grandiose moment of victory it was terrifying to see it came at the price of becoming like the enemy,2024-03-01 19:44:08
"the first one was so set in building the world but this one could take its time exploring the characters the themes and the narrative in a way that truly made it a much better experience

and i say that as a big fan of the first",2024-03-01 03:15:27
this was his my beautiful dark twisted fantasy,2024-03-01 03:07:49
the book is that way too theres a biiiiig old learning curve that happens simultaneously with the fall of atreidies the second half of the book just one punch after another,2024-03-01 05:55:54
" i liked the first one but if i’m being honest it was a little slow
 
 
 
 this one was allout madness bravo denis

this second movie doesnt get to shine as good as it did without the meticulous worldbuilding and story setup of the first movie

dune walked so dune 2 could  ruuuun",2024-03-01 06:46:40
"the first half of the book is slow too but if you’ve never read it before the build up of tension keeps in interesting even after the trap is sprung the tension builds as we wonder how paul will survive let alone get revenge

then the second half of the book is amazing",2024-03-01 14:51:39
agreed would have liked a bit more focus on the war at the end though i know he  ton of it  really hope he starts releasing deleted scenes at some point,2024-03-01 03:56:19
i really disliked the first one and was a bit hesitant to see this one so glad i did it’s really something special,2024-03-01 04:49:34
yeah the first one was good for sure but this one is miles better first one was just a long introduction and yeah too slow,2024-03-01 08:44:03
hes just like me fr,2024-03-02 04:20:15
oh he’s much more ambitious than that he actually wants to rule the galaxy with zendaya but also marry florence pugh because he can,2024-03-06 09:22:21
 no ,2024-03-03 08:21:13
"the founding titan would be too humble to admit he is the founding titan so that mean he actually is the founding titan

no spoilers please cause i haven’t seen the rest of the undubbed episodes of aot but do you think the writer for aot was partly inspired by paul in dune,2024-03-07 07:36:41
 so true,2024-03-31 05:21:25
scrolling and seeing this comment gave me so much validation as i just told my gf 15 minutes ago out of nowhere holy  this is attack on titan and paul is eren,2024-04-03 06:22:11

" austin butler did a  good job of imitating stellan skarsgards style of speaking

there was the one moment in the control room where rabban confronts feyd  both stellan and austin are off screen and one of them is speaking it really took me a second to realize it was austin speaking and not stellan",2024-03-01 03:08:27
in the books he dies off page it’s a complete let down you get all this stuff about how he was going to brutalize the people of arrakis then he’s just dead after the fighting kicks off,2024-03-01 03:23:43
part 3 is getting greenlit like instantly lol the word of mouth on this one is gonna be insane,2024-03-01 03:46:57
here’s hoping austin butler keeps this voice for a while like he did elvis,2024-03-01 03:08:16
for a second i honestly that they were adding in skarsgard’s voice overtop of butler’s,2024-03-01 03:11:39
arguably you cant tell the story of muadib without messiah i fully believe well get part 3,2024-03-01 05:58:21
never a doubt,2024-03-01 03:07:20
if they don’t make part 3 i’m going to die how could you put that out there,2024-03-01 03:35:42
i thought rabban’s death worked he was a monster and a coward who didn’t deserve a badass death he picked a fight with one of the greatest living warriors in the galaxy and got instantly slaughtered like he deserved,2024-03-02 15:50:41
not having a 3 to these two movies would be a travesty,2024-03-03 04:43:54

i think its a good thing for an adaptation to slightly upset expectations for people who think they already know whats going to happen this was a good example of this without in any way disrupting the overall message of the book,2024-03-01 12:32:56
hadnt read the books my heart was racing i thought throughout the fight it was hinted that feyd was physically overwhelming and paul would lose and then it did seem like he lost you could see the faith leaving stilgars eyes for a moment,2024-03-01 17:51:26
the whole theater was dead quiet during the final fight audience was completely engrossed,2024-03-05 04:55:11
ive read the book and watched the first movie version and while i was watching this scene i was wondering  did they change the ending somehow here  it really had me in suspense,2024-04-09 05:43:15
itll be interesting to see how shes characterized in a part 3 but i dont think her path has really changed at all in all pauls visions shes still at his side during the jihad and he does mention at one point that shell come around when she realizes he had to take this path,2024-03-03 23:53:12
people seem to think just because he said she comes around mean she will ever fully trust him again the future he sees is not always right them getting back together does not mean she respects him but she still loves him could be a love hate romance,2024-03-04 00:49:02
" the way herbert wrote chani and generally any of the women besides a handful of the bg 

this film really put irulan chani the bg and jessica front and center and showed that all of this is their doing their  and their attempt to desperately claw back power

because hes a threat to them theres supposed to be a status quo also he threatened them its one thing to have a monopoly on spice but its something entirely different to threaten to destroy all spice production also the bene gesserit dont like him and they sway the houses  


 edit say  sway",2024-03-02 03:45:29
"because those things aren’t supposed to be concentrated in one person there’s a sort of checkbalance thing going on between the emperor the great houses the bene gesserit and the space guild that stops any one party from having too much power paul breaks the game

they really really don’t want someone to have unfettered and unchallenged control of spice is my guess,2024-03-03 01:38:47
hes completely right but they just want to maintain the status quo house corrino had been the imperial house for the entirety of the existence of the imperium,2024-03-02 02:41:42

that ‘thopter mounted gun was terrifying there is no outrunning that  lol,2024-03-01 18:46:54
was a little confused about who was sniping the harkonnens on the top of the cliff,2024-03-01 12:44:27
" the ornithopter machine gun shotgun thing

sooo much cool tech in this movie but they kept it fairly grounded and believable too which in turn makes it feel actually dangerous and scary like when the harkonnen’s are absolutely obliterating sietch tabr with rockets",2024-03-02 22:15:05

he split off to go to the temple while they all went to the southern sietch word is sent for chani to come see him after he drinks it,2024-03-01 06:55:46
i believe paul has the vision and then he tells chani that he will go south with her to help bring her people to safety but he’s decided to go to the waters of life first because of the vision so he splits off without telling her,2024-03-02 05:11:25
yea i also found that a little disjointed during the sandworm i didnt realize they were actually splitting off i figured it was just like a formation thing tbh,2024-03-01 07:20:04
"yeah this was my second viewing and was confused as well

maybe partially it was hard to tell who was driving each worm given the face coverings",2024-03-01 12:29:05
i didn’t understand why when they got attacked by fyedrautha led harkonnen that they fled when we had just established where the atomic arsenal was why not just attack back,2024-03-01 13:13:08
they definitely got told to cut it down from 3 hrs and imo the 3rd act suffered for it,2024-03-16 22:33:16
the most important inmovie reason is that it underscores pauls embrace of harkonnenstyle brutality as he transforms from a starryeyed hero into a bloody tyrant im paraphrasing but he follows it with a line like well fight like harkonnens the revelation that the noble atreides and vile harkonnen are one and the same after all validates pauls decision to abandon the heroic ideals of his father when the emperor insults the late duke by calling him weak right before pauls duel paul doesnt argue because he agrees,2024-03-01 13:50:39
i mean i dont feel it have weight in the story he is still a atreides and his fathers blood if the story tries to make something more interesting out of it it needs to make paul not only harkonnen but also not atreides,2024-03-01 03:58:44
"it reveals just how deep the bene gesserit plotting is the bene gesserit managed to get a child with blood from two of the fiercest enemies among the great houses the book also makes clear that its no coincidence that the emperor has 5 daughters but no male heirs all of the prophecies about the lisan algaib were planted by the bene gesserit lady fenring engraved a command that would paralyze feyd rautha and paul knows that such a command is there and explicitly refuses to use it everything was set up for a bene gessserit trained man to ascend the throne

the scene with the reverend motheremperors truthsayer saying that no matter what happened the emperor would lose his throne wasnt from the book but reinforces this",2024-03-02 05:01:26
it becomes much more important in the next couple of booksmovies,2024-03-01 04:12:06
"to reveal the full extent and culmination of the bene gesserits secret centurieslong breeding program 

the kwisatz haderach they were after wouldve been a child of both atreides and harkonnen blood the irony is that these two families have been sworn enemies for centuries but the film didnt seem to bother explaining that well they sort of did in the scene where lady fenring reports back to the reverend mother after successfully getting pregnant with feydrauthas seed

but there will definitely be more on pauls  jessicas little sisters harkonnen lineage in the sequels though",2024-03-01 11:15:49
it doesn’t affect this story that much but it’s important info the audience needs to know because book 3 has a story that is greatly affected by this information in case they adapt book 3 it’s a good thing they drop the news here instead of there,2024-03-02 00:19:38
next book is all about paul dealing with the consequences of his actions and the one after that is has a lot to do with the harkonnen lineage,2024-03-01 07:35:54
theres more to come from that from later books its a massive plot point so dont read anything cuz people might spoil it,2024-03-02 05:47:08
"as a movieonly it was clear that his surprise attack against the emperor and the harkonnens was inspired by the attack the harkonnen launched on his own family

he even said theyll have to fight like harkonnens",2024-03-02 00:53:45
"didnt paul say in the film because they are harkonnen is why the poison does not effect them

also when extracting the water from the harkonnen corpses the guy said too much chemicals in the blood to drink",2024-03-01 11:12:20
yeah,2024-03-03 03:33:47
paul is a product of genetic experimentation and breeding by the penne moshpit basically,2024-03-01 04:24:59
"another thing i noticed on second watch is how much feyd respects paul there are multiple shots of feyd examining paul and austin butler does such a good job of having these faces of admiration and respect even when he says “he’s bluffing” at one moment towards the end he has this sly smile on his face like “yea this mf is a formidable opponent”

feyds reactions at the end were awesome you could tell he just loved paul walking in on the emperor like he already owned the place and killing the baron he probably felt honored when he learned hes pauls cousin",2024-03-03 06:42:32
the harkonnens said she was a spy i expect she was hiding there to gather intelligence and bring it back to the fremen but she was caught,2024-03-04 14:24:59
i’m not sure myself but i loved her character i was sad to see her go like that long live the fighters,2024-03-03 12:04:12
i was wondering this too,2024-03-01 17:36:29
and did he really just flame her to death brutal,2024-03-05 03:24:55
i thought about that too really just the harkannens in general in the first film you get the notion that theyre being set up to be these epic strong villains but in this one you realize they arent  lol outside of feyd i suppose,2024-03-04 21:19:00
the 5 thousand year long breeding program by the bene gesseret to produce the kwisatz haderach played a major role in the books the fact that jessica was the baron’s daughter a byproduct of  and her producing a male heir produced a kwisatz haderach a generation earlier than intended the relevance is on a biblical scale but is really hard to express on film,2024-03-01 04:30:26
i read the book and honestly forgot it was even brought up in there until it came up again in the second one its not a hugely important plot point yet,2024-03-01 04:07:46
in the book its revealed way earlier when paul is having his visions in the stiltent right after atreides are massacred and the emphasis is way more on the bene gesserits breeding plans than the actual connection itself,2024-03-01 04:14:44
no it happens pretty much after they escape when due to exposure to the spice his brain starts leveling up and instead of dreaming hes seeing it unfold in front of his eyes combined with his mentat training to see it,2024-03-01 04:19:18
yes,2024-03-01 04:06:10
"in the book it happens during the part where paul is having visions in the desert it would’ve been in part 1 if they decided to it exactly like the book basically paul finds out through his visions tells jessica because she didn’t know and then she’s upset about it and that’s about it i think the movie made it more impactful than the book to be honest 

it is important information that the audience needs to know though this is crucial information that is a huge part to one of the books down the line if they ever adapt past book 2 audiences will be glad that denis didn’t leave this part out",2024-03-01 22:36:37
they didnt mention that mohiam is jessicas mother either which is from the brian herbert prequel novels so its noncanon technically,2024-03-01 11:32:22
i agree but vizzy that you,2024-03-02 00:29:42
yes he speaks like a totally different person  because he is like jessica after she drank the water of life they become an amalgamation of their ancestors memories,2024-03-03 17:54:46
dude sold the profound sadness that came with all that knowing i knew he was a good actor didn’t expect him to pull that scene off,2024-03-03 19:32:35
yeah i havent seen much commentary online but that was one of the first thing me and my friends discussed after seeing it,2024-03-03 19:36:32
i need to see it again a second time to get a better appreciation for it  my mind spent too much time comparing each scene to the book for me to be completely immersed,2024-03-01 03:12:26
its definitely got its differences from the book but this feels like one of those movies that is a good adaptation because it made reasonable changes to adapt to a visual medium,2024-03-01 03:36:33
saw in imax for my first viewing and dolby my second i think imax takes the cake purely for the visuals and scale,2024-03-01 03:58:32
i was mostly happy with how it turned out compared to the book however the loss of jamis’ extended funeral ceremony was a huge disappointment one of my favorite moments from the book,2024-03-01 03:49:46
felt underwhelming in dolby to be honest or maybe it was my theater i always prefer it to liemax but i think this movie might be the exception,2024-03-01 07:14:11
yes i wish they had mentioned the sciencegeoengineering that made arrakis into a desert planet which subsequently created its political inequalities all for spice also more on what spice actually does and why its important the spacing guilds role and its control over political entities i hope is a factor in part3messiah and the role of bloodlinefeudal manipulation still 1110,2024-03-03 08:21:48
did imax last sunday and dolby tonight dolby audio was definitely punchier although the full ratio on imax has a level of immersion thats hard to beat id say do both while you can a good time either way,2024-03-01 11:48:17
"dolby was great for my city the dolby is bigger than our imax and has way better audio

still missed a few lines because denis sometimes nolans his dialogue but still 1010 worth it",2024-03-01 19:14:22
it’s been so long since i’ve read dune the first book what’s the timeline like with the movies i ask cause i’d love to reread it but if it’s gonna spoil the next movie i’d rather not read it so i can go in fresh,2024-03-13 04:24:59
is it too loud in imax i really wanna see it at my theatre but also don’t want to leave with my ears bleeding haha,2024-03-01 05:45:09
i just saw it in dolby amazing imax is next for me,2024-03-01 23:41:28
i’m curious to see how they’d adapt messiah and also the reception considering  messiah is drastically more political than dune 1 has drastically less action and would have to be played more as a thriller if there’s anyone i trust though it’s denis,2024-03-01 23:48:58
there are some major changes from the books some characters left out or parts of their backstories omitted that is all okay in my opinion the core message of the books is there the feel is there this is the best possible adaptation that could have been done imo i highly suggest you give it a read though,2024-03-01 03:51:17
i liked the movie but i definitely get the vibe that denis got some notes to pick up the pace lol,2024-03-01 17:45:14
it’s fantastic foreshadowing for what happens when paul drinks the water of life too spoiler nothing good ,2024-03-03 10:03:03
i am ashamed to admit that i would probably also follow the cult of rebecca ferguson she’s that commanding a presence,2024-03-03 19:45:30
definitely a must buy especially if society ever collapses so we got that physical copy on lock,2024-03-02 10:29:15
bladerunner 2049 and dune part 1 are already my favorite 4k blu ray and part two is going right to the top of that list as well,2024-03-01 11:20:04
couldnt see this in an imax theater so im stoked for the 4k release since my folks have a 4k tv,2024-03-06 15:48:51
for me it was when the harkonnens started floating up the mountain and the duke yelling “they fly now”,2024-03-02 02:12:06
i dont know if youve read the books but the sardaukar are actually nerfed a lot more in part one compared to the book but the fremen taking them out so easily is actually pretty accurate the sardaukar are supposed to be unstoppable but the fremen take them out with ease and its supposed to be a constant shock to everyone how easy it is for them,2024-03-01 23:20:47
"i don’t necessarily disagree with your complaints but most seem to be things that are actually pretty faithful to the book

for instance i feel like the movie actually spends quite a bit more time establishing the importance of paul drinking the water than in the book they dwell more on how it’s made what it does and how men can’t drink it and they repeatedly remind both paul and the audience that he must drink it to become the one whereas in the book paul kinda just figures out on his own that he should drink it and does it offscreen and jessica is actually surprised and upset when she hears he drank it

and i’ve always thought the book ending felt pretty rushed so the movie’s ending didn’t bother me so much",2024-03-02 22:06:59
"couldn’t disagree more i liked part 1 but it was missing a lot of things for me the harkonnen felt one dimensional just evil  and  bad guys there was a lot of exposition in the dialogue which okay is unavoidable with a story like this but still it took me out of it a few times and the introduction of chani and the ending of the film in general was a bit weak imo

part 2 fixes all of those problems feyd gives harkonnen a whole new dynamic the world expands so much and stops holding the audience’s hand chani and paul both develop into infinitely more interesting characters sure there were some parts that felt rushed but in my opinion the pay off was there with all the character and story decisions",2024-03-02 19:29:52
the scene with paul addressing the fremen and the atomics flying overhead so  good,2024-03-02 08:19:03
i audibly said oh  the theater when that scene hit like how could you not  yourself seeing that as one of those soldiers,2024-03-02 05:08:18
i thought it was extra dope that they all reformed their formation after getting knocked around and killed by the atomics only for the worm to arrive shortly after gave them a little more credibility as an unbreakable fighting force that is completely unmatched by this new paradigm of war,2024-03-02 15:54:54
they get up ready to fight after a thermonuclear blast only to run when it’s wormtime,2024-03-05 08:27:20
without that holy war however humanity would go extinct,2024-03-02 08:01:57
shame they cut thufirs scenes someone noted that theres an extra wide trailer that shows thufir was actually present in feyd rauthas ceremony scene but hes cut off in the theatrical edition,2024-03-01 03:47:28
does it most of it wraps up pretty nicely in my opinion and ends pretty much where book one does too yeah they tease messiah but if this one absolutely tanks you can imagine this being an ending,2024-03-01 04:12:29
i don’t think he did very much in the second half of the book anyway so i was fine they just had him killed during the harkonnen invasion,2024-03-01 03:55:10
ahhh see for me the one thing that i felt was missing from this movie was the chemistry between zendaya and timothee,2024-03-03 09:23:10
i need messiah to come out like next year bro lol i’m itching already,2024-03-01 23:13:25
theres an interview of him on youtube in french channel is konbini saying he wants to take his time for the third dune and is likely to make another movie before,2024-03-03 07:05:34
"one lil thing regarding atomics

theres something quite important in the books thats not explained in the movies all great houses have nukes but using nukes against another great house means your planet gets glassed period

paul uses it against a mountain not a house so thats sort of a loophole this creates an opening for the worms and makes it so the storm batters everything inside even harder",2024-03-03 11:54:14
its getting to the point where you can maybe almost remove the canadian descriptor there he just doesnt  miss,2024-03-01 03:34:14
frenchcanadian maybe,2024-03-01 03:53:35
i still gotta give it to big jim cameron,2024-03-01 04:54:43
30 years from now he will on every list of all time greats,2024-03-01 03:43:36
canadian caladanian,2024-03-02 21:34:27
theyre not human beings theyre animals theyre brutal gurney halleck,2024-03-05 21:41:18
i thought that was  no one is like that and made me disconnect with the antagonist you are supposed to see a negative shadow of yourself in an antagonist ala i could become that person if i made some different choices senseless killing of two underlings around you like that does not create that connection,2024-03-06 02:08:46
with the flip and turn to the camera  yeah  and also a neat way of showing once again that his prescient visions arent always accurateone of many possible outcomes,2024-03-06 21:42:52
" same for the shot of stilgard leading the battle with the atreides banner at his back to me it felt like paul succeeded at corrupting the fremen to his own cause  
  
quote from the end of the first novel  
  
in that instant paul saw how stilgar had been transformed from the fremen naib to a creature of the lisan algaib a receptacle for awe and obedience it was a lessening of the man and paul felt the ghostwind of the jihad in it",2024-03-07 08:42:39
"its pretty much guaranteed dont worry denis wants to do it and this one is making good numbers

might be a few years though theres a significant gap of some years between book 1 and 2",2024-03-01 17:48:11
i love that villeneuve didnt wrap things up with a bow and really set up part 3,2024-03-01 18:24:18
i need everyone here to meet and appreciate my 2nd and 3rd favorite characters in the series i know we will never get odrade i have made peace with that but dammit scytale is amazing and i want everyone to love him as much as i do and hayt you all will love hayt,2024-03-01 18:00:49
they got done dirty though rabban especially taking ls all movie long,2024-03-02 14:17:46
lol the harkonnens were portrayed as jokes in this one way different than their brutal intimidating portrayal in the first,2024-03-02 16:06:38
he had like four lines total barely any screen time i definitely didnt get the sense he was emperor of the known universe and the calculating mastermind behind the harkonnen plot,2024-03-02 20:14:37
i think walken was good particularly his conversations with the baron and paul but i do agree they underutilized him and wish we saw more of the emperor,2024-03-02 19:58:17
walken basically did his best walken impression,2024-03-03 05:57:44
as much as i can be a fan of walken here i dont think the director wasted his talent i think he wasted it himself personally i thought he was the weakest of the main characters he just did not fit its as if he didnt even try very disappointing,2024-03-02 21:19:50
your not the only one who thought this their are too many wasted opportunities in this film,2024-03-02 20:30:58
i think its very very easy to read this story as a white savior story especially if you havent read all the books and they did pick a poc to play duncan so i sort of wished we saw where that went but probably wont and for good reason,2024-03-02 21:56:35
yeah i feel like those critics who are praising the  out of this film never read the books,2024-03-02 21:44:14
its off to a great start at the box office and it got a great cinemascore so i think dune messiah has a pretty solid shot at a greenlight villeneuve has two other projects in the works though rendezvous with rama and cleopatra so it could be a long time before messiah is released this actually works for the storyline as messiah is set 12 years after the ending of dune,2024-03-03 05:41:15
unless something comes out of left field this movie might already be a lock for best costumes at the oscars next year,2024-03-05 14:23:04
absolutely agree with walken him and stilgar being a comic relief were my only true gripes with this ,2024-03-05 07:50:06
denis has gone on record saying he only believes in the final cut of his movies  what is done is done and that is all that will ever be shown,2024-03-01 04:09:33
i adored the movie but was extremely disappointed that of all the things to change from the book they removed jamis’ funeral which was one of my favorite moments from it,2024-03-01 03:56:09
i absolutely loved this movie but it did feel like they were powering through it at times they did so with significant tact but i want that 4 hour director’s cut for sure,2024-03-01 04:38:45
"man i feel the entire dune book could have been three whole films if paced right there’s just so much stuff even i felt this film speed ran a few things

still love it though",2024-03-01 04:16:25
"im honestly relieved to read your review since i felt the exact same overall i loved the movie and will definitely watch it many more times i was impressed and enjoyed pt 1 on first viewing and only after a few additional ones did it become one of my favorites so i think it might be similar here but there were some really jarring parts


again this might just be me i also havent read the books but i felt like there were several times in the movie where were shown one thing and the next scene feels like it should have been several scenes later not interested in discussing particular moments with spoiler tags right now on mobile and overall i really really enjoyed it but yeah the editing felt rough and im expecting a better cut eventually",2024-03-01 05:37:59
just a fyi it wasn’t filmed with  imax film cameras  but digital so it’s not the original 143 ratio,2024-03-02 07:48:43
my audience applauded the nicole kidman ad at an amc showing which was funny,2024-03-03 01:50:16
i said that for the kong trailer and whatever the  that zendaya  tennis movie is,2024-03-02 13:50:20
for whatever reason there were no trailers at my theatre i loved it got to go right into the movie,2024-03-02 18:22:22
yes this was something they absolutely needed just a couple lines of exposition regarding their background why they were outlawed and how paul used a loophole would have done a lot,2024-03-03 15:21:08
seeing part 2 also made me appreciate them toning down the islamic influences from the book and for example replacing jihad with crusade given how islam is viewed by many in the western world and how bad people are at nuance that was probably for the best,2024-03-01 10:34:52
power over spice is power over all,2024-03-04 02:11:56
 abuse of power comes as no surprise ,2024-03-04 01:06:46
“power attracts pathological personalities it is not that power corrupts but that it is magnetic to the corruptible”,2024-03-04 06:21:16
thats so cool that you pulled through you passed your personal gom jabbar,2024-03-04 16:49:27
high praise indeed,2024-03-04 19:58:50
"the emperor is tough to play because he has so little screen time but yeah old quiet walken was not a great choice i can understand trying to have him portrayed as the outplayed ruler being twised around by bene gesserit but he just comes off as a ruler no one would have followed in the first place the old sci fi channel miniseries did a better job with giancarlo giannini who could atleast bring italian charisma to the role 


the ending scene of the first part of the miniseries for reference although be warned that the costume design budget for the show was very low


",2024-03-05 01:20:58
"thats what i wanna know

they just magically started blasting them from the skies in the right spot ",2024-03-05 04:33:06
denis definitely uses the ending to serve as a lead in to messiah  and it was a smart move,2024-03-01 06:43:57
cant wait for all the starship trooper esk misreadings how the holy war is a good thing lol,2024-03-01 08:36:14
imagine if they called it a jihad like they do in the books…,2024-03-01 07:05:28
there’s no need to utter it islamic fundamentalist nut jobs ruined that word,2024-03-02 11:56:16
"it is perplexing the way part 2 left paul and chanis relationship in the book its very clear that paul is marrying irulan for the throne but chani is his true wife just how concubine lady jessica is to duke leto 

but here pauls play for the throne via the hand of irulan is depicted as an utter betrayal to chani and the fremen people if paul and chani are going to be reconciled it feels like it will take most of movie 3 to negotiate it  which is not in line with dune messiah this may be a major clue that dune part 3 is going to veer sharply from the events of book which would not necessarily surprise me as the books only get stranger",2024-03-01 06:00:11
at this point i’m basically 100 convinced that the studios have already greenlit messiah behind closed doors even if it’s on dv’s timetable this movie felt like it was written with a confident expectation of being followed up by a part 3 in messiah,2024-03-01 07:59:40
i am sure denis can make messiah better def not an amazing book as far as i’m concerned trust dv,2024-03-01 05:51:02
the thing that bothered me was the lack of visions from the water of life,2024-03-01 14:53:54
i haven’t read the books so i was unaware of this time jump honestly it’s quite shocking because how could they have baby faced timmy and zendaya that aged up even with prostheticsvisual effects you’d surely have to recast them which seems detrimental to making money could denis do a part 3 without a time jump is it essential to the plot,2024-03-01 12:53:49
they used an ir camera for the outdoor shots of giedi prime so cool,2024-03-05 15:57:14
dang you did it right ,2024-03-05 08:14:03
i did this for blade runner 2049 in imax and it’s still the greatest theater experience of my life,2024-03-05 16:46:37
"what edible
did you take",2024-03-05 12:34:59
" thought feyd was kinda overhyped i saw some posts on here saying he was the ‘best villain of the ‘20s’

i saw all those posts too and left the theater wondering if i watched the same movie feyd was hella underwhelming paul atreides mom was a way better villain",2024-03-06 03:07:16
well he was telling us to walk without rythm 23 years ago,2024-03-04 03:04:56
the throne is my birth rite id be damned if sum desert mause was gunna put his greasy fremen hands on my birth rite,2024-03-04 21:57:16
agree he was miscast he just didnt bring anything to the role,2024-03-04 09:54:53
he was just like this tired sulky old man in an ratty old shift i was expecting old school walken having some presence and command,2024-03-04 02:41:42
"i agree there was no reason to cast him in that role other than him being a recognizable name and face

for me personally he wasnt terribly immersion breaking it helped that he didnt have much dialogue but i definitely wouldve preferred someone else that didnt take me out of the film lol",2024-03-04 05:15:47
walken and pugh were the only weak spots in terms of casting for me a lot of other options besides walken but i imagine denis wanted to work with him and thats fine too,2024-03-04 04:37:59
"i felt so too 

maybe there is an outside chance he still gets to shine in the next movie as a conspirator to dethrone paul he still remains alive but exiled",2024-03-04 03:28:56
he was great in the country bears,2024-03-04 12:45:15
all the fetus shots were her without makeup on,2024-03-02 06:30:18
and  fayd rautha,2024-03-17 01:26:02
saw it the other day and yes found giedi prime fascinating but was also thinking how tough life must be for your everyday harkkonen since every other scene some poor subordinate is having their head bashed in throat sliced stabbed neck snapped etci read up that their society is pretty much  or be killed to rise up the ranks in society,2024-03-26 13:32:37
i think a real failure of dune is the exploration of how just the normal people live and survive i think this was the first time we sort of had a glimpse of that yes giedi prime is extreme but ultimately this is how everywhere in this universe is people are cogs in a greater machine,2024-03-27 16:15:35
" as a solo story the change with chani at the end really works as a tragic twist in paul’s rise but curious to see how it’ll affect part 3

she comes around paul says so so its more likely that its part of his vision",2024-03-01 05:05:25
on a technical level only sure as a screenplay lead acting and overall best picture oppenheimer mops the floor with this otherwise very good movie,2024-03-01 21:24:03
i thought christopher walken as the emperor was absolutely hilarious i couldnt get past his voice at all either it just made me laugh,2024-03-01 05:57:27
agreed on the irulan thing i thought seydoux was playing her way back when we first got the cast list pugh did a decent job and the wardrobe department nailed it or should i say mailed it,2024-03-01 12:24:45
i turned to my brother when walken was shown as emperor and said are you  serious my only gripe i love christopher walken but hes not really the  emperor of the imperium,2024-03-02 04:19:10
granted i’ve only finished the first novel but i can’t imagine they could’ve elaborated on shaddam iv further and for that walken served his part he’s kind of a foot note in a way yes he has reasons to do what he does but he’s kind of a strawman for the imperium and the bene geserits plotting and scheming  if anything i’m more upset we didn’t get any insight to the spacing guilds politics of why paul threatening the great houses with the destruction of spice is a meaningful act but considering villenueves adaptation seems to be more paul and leaning on the genetic history stuff more than the greater landsraadguildspice politics i see why he condensed the final moments to “the houses don’t accept your ascendancy” and the jihad begins lol,2024-03-01 07:43:53
five long years he wore this signet ringup his asshe died of dysentery gave me the ringi hid this uncomfortable hunk of metal up my  two years,2024-03-03 03:15:38
my whole theater laughed every time walken was on screen he was a ridiculous terrible choice for the role but i feel like people are too scared to say anything negative about this movie,2024-03-02 07:55:05
the movies clearly explain the messiah myth was specifically implanted by the bene gesserit to allow someone like paul to take on the role he did,2024-03-03 06:27:52
" millions must die

billions",2024-03-04 11:32:58
" i haven’t read the books but something in this movie tells me that paul is not the all benevolent savior that will lead the fremen to paradise that he’s portrayed as by the prophecy  

you should read the books",2024-03-03 05:56:43
those trained in the bene gesserit ways are more resistant to their powers as reverend mother she is very deeply trained and with many years of experience paul using the voice on her was more of a your powers and position cant help you here flex than anything ,2024-03-04 03:26:01
yeah i mean if any movie ever made s worth watching in imax it’s this ,2024-03-05 04:16:02
"is it clear already what the bene gessirit’s endgame is it seemed to be breeding the lisan al gain to travel through space and time but now why are they playing emperor games


the endgame was creating the kwisatz haderach through breeding powerful families that is why they play politics so they can breed with them they thought with the kwisatz haderachs power he would bring about a better future a future under the control of the bene gesserit


the kwisatz haderach is paul but they didnt believe it was him until it was too late and because their actions made him hate them he does not have alegiance toward them hes a rogue and  up their plan",2024-03-09 15:12:44
it will outearn the first one with its eyes closed  wont even be close,2024-03-01 03:49:26
this movie will definitely make money  this movie is getting hype from every which way ive seen people who dont give a  about movies  both in my personal life and social media influencers  who are raving about it,2024-03-01 03:48:17
i think it’s a lock for 3 just maybe don’t invest in warner brothers stock,2024-03-01 03:37:20
oh itll make money and therell be a part 3 possibly at sony due to wbd being well absolute  but denis and legendary will remain in charge question is what happens when legendary greenlights a sequel without denis if part 3 is successful i doubt theyll stop there even if as a vague follower of the books they really  should,2024-03-01 04:10:50
the budget was 190 million so assuming it needs a 25x to break even thats only 475 million considering the first one made 400 million while being simultaneously released on hbomax during the pandemic i think this one will pass that very easily it can make money even if it doesnt get close to a billion so it should be fine,2024-03-01 04:45:59
i’m hopeful that even with their blunders over the last 4 years warner knows better than to mess with the next chapter of the dune saga,2024-03-01 03:51:59
my theater was packed,2024-03-01 04:21:52
the main big imax theater and the 2nd nicest theater pacific science center imax and cinerama respectively for the seattle peeps are essentially sold out for the next 3 weeks so i think this movie will be doing real well,2024-03-01 04:19:30
"i was at opening night during a general public transport strike in a city where nobody drives on a weekday for a movie that goes three hours and requires having watched a first part in a language that is not our official one

theater was packed people sat on the floor 

this will not flop by any sense",2024-03-01 14:07:43
yeahi wouldnt be worried about that,2024-03-01 05:44:44
this movie is gonna go nuts dont worry,2024-03-01 08:48:21
this film is selling out imax theaters faster than oppenheimer did  i cannot imagine this film doesn’t make at least what oppenheimer did at the box office,2024-03-01 05:02:21
it was made on 190 mil  they will recoup that easyyyy,2024-03-01 06:38:08
lets also not forget that this is march and so theres no real competition for it right now this will be playing for a long time probably like how oppenheimer was last year its still in theaters now,2024-03-01 12:15:30
"how much of the first not making that much money was caused by covid and the release on hbo max 

it feels like a lot of people saw the first one 

and want to see the second

also here in france its the biggest movie of the year and its also probably true for other countries even if america dont watch it you can be sure its going to be big worldwide",2024-03-01 14:42:17
this will break records you have nothing to worry about even remotely,2024-03-02 01:03:55
80mm through sat budget was 190mm  i think it’ll make money…,2024-03-04 04:43:28
lol this is not pandemic times part 1 crushed even then  this will do just fine worry not,2024-03-01 05:48:02
this will earn big and part 3 will absolutely happen,2024-03-01 06:08:13
94 is so specific i found it funny but good review,2024-03-01 08:54:43
paul and chani are teenagers paul is 15 and chani is around 13 at the beginning of dune whichexplains a bit not all of course of their behaviour,2024-03-01 11:38:35
dune paul strikes back,2024-03-02 01:37:23
the books are heavily influenced by sanskrit and arabic culture herbert spent a lot of time researching the culture to include the religious fanaticism and how easily susceptible religious fanatics are to propaganda,2024-03-03 14:39:51
its the story of overthrowing shaddam to control iraqiss for the valuable fuel source,2024-03-03 15:12:19
"yeah it was very interesting there was also other middle eastern influences for example calling the emperor padishah which is basically the persian word used to refer to the greatest emperors

there was also more narrative inspirations as well for example in islam imam mahdis mother is also a concubine",2024-03-03 14:57:09
in the book they just literally speak arabic because it was written in 1965 and hebert figured everyone reading it would find that alien and exotic,2024-03-04 01:32:41
loved the language and chani’s friend she was badass,2024-03-03 12:14:24
i stopped watching trailers for movies i know im going to watch 20 years ago  i close my eyes if its a preview at the theater ,2024-03-05 08:17:31
"agreed cant believe they spoiled the shot of the 3 worms
  wish i hadnt watched any trailers",2024-03-05 13:59:05
"that happens with all the trailers dude you just gotta stop watching them i keep my earphones on and close the eyes when a trailer for a movie i care comes on at the cinema 


just for fun i always watch them after the movie and they indeed spoil everything here it was so terrible with even the scene with the 3 worms spoiled and all of gedi prime ",2024-03-05 07:59:57
agreed,2024-03-05 11:01:16
idk man usually id agree but the first 5 minutes of the movie alone were full of astonishing imagery that wasnt even hinted at in the trailers for a denis movie i think its hard to spoil all the great moments because theres so many,2024-03-06 18:05:56
"i’d sign too


as someone who doesn’t even watch the trailers or sometimes don’t even read the plot i like to be surprised as much as i can in the theatre as i hadn’t read the book i would’ve loved not knowing what decision paul was gonna make in the later half of the movie but by the visuals spread everywhere we all knew there would be war",2024-03-05 04:55:25
cuts deep when you realize he had already made that difficult decision the only narrow way through of the future possibilities and prepped chani with his farewell “i’ll love you for as long as i breathe”,2024-03-03 21:44:47
ive seen it twice now im totally biassed because i love the book but this is absolutely up there with lord of the rings as being my favorite blockbuster of all time it feels so surreal to see dune put to the screen by one of the great directors of our time,2024-03-06 06:35:17
i thought he was perfect until he said his first line,2024-03-11 19:16:56
walken had zero presence as the emperor horribly casted,2024-03-12 12:48:32
i agreed that was the only mis cast out of a stellar cast they needed someone with better  acting it felt like walken wasnt really in the role as the emperor it felt more like he was reading off cue cards,2024-03-12 00:17:48
they exhaust the worm by riding it for a long period after it slows down they climb on top of it,2024-03-01 14:44:16
i mean imax cameras and film are super expensive nolan and denis are probably the only two directors right now that a studio would trust spending that much money on to actually utilize it properly nolan experimented with it i think in dark knight and each subsequent movie hes filmed more and more and more of his movies with the imax cameras,2024-03-02 03:18:56
"when a selected woman drinks the poison and survives thry are granted all the knowledge and wisdom of their female ancestors  so you become one with the order 

paul was part of a centuries long breeding program to create a male that can survive the process a male that can survive can access all the knowledge of both sexes and see into the future it’s a pretty big deal",2024-03-02 20:37:30
"i thought i missed something too but yeah it had to be deleted scenes

theres just such a large chunk of story cut there and it gives you whiplash

also harms the ending as it makes that part feel rushed as well but that was supposed to be fast as it was a coup de grace of all their efforts fighting",2024-03-03 00:07:21
they said a spy left behind real quick in my case i wasnt entirely clear on why pauls mentor turned up again the pacing was a little wacky,2024-03-02 23:16:48
agree i was lost on why chanis friend was left behind but i might have missed it maybe meant more to build up feydrauthas villain,2024-03-03 00:11:52
she stayed behind to spy and likely report back but was caught,2024-03-03 01:55:16
they probably know how to stop worms from moving,2024-03-04 01:19:59
little gliders so they safely float off the worms onto the sand as the worm continues on,2024-03-04 02:58:06
stop drop and roll just like us earthlings cmon man dont be daft unfortunately you roll for 14 mile and get sand all up your butt through your stillsuit they call it an arakeen enema,2024-03-04 02:13:13
i think over on rdune they explain that they tire them out,2024-03-04 03:08:54
that annoyed me too i guess cheni can fight and defeat sardaukar the same way duncan idaho can,2024-03-04 06:06:47
the entire final battle was a joke over in five minutes barely an inconvenience,2024-03-04 07:40:49
this and the scene where they travel from north to south while making a big deal about it but then seemingly effortlessly travel back north and all of sudden we are in the final epic battle would be my only gripes with the movie i get it the probably filmed these scenes but they ended up getting cut to keep things under 3 hours,2024-03-05 01:53:29
the best hypeman,2024-03-08 02:17:35
got back from my second viewing but i noticed the goggles bit my first watch too lol i just assume they flipped on by all the movements,2024-03-09 04:44:12
"on your 4th rewatch i want you to keep an eye out for something 

the scene after jessica takes the water of life and is talking to paul letting him know he will have to eventuallypay attention to paul

that is not chalamet thats his stunt double",2024-03-09 07:31:09
yeah them not including he gives water to the dead was a bit of a sin  that was the first domino falling in the fremens acceptance of him,2024-03-03 16:57:33
agree  people were sad it didnt happen in the first movie and now with jamiss body they still had the opportunity but i guess it just never made the final cut im curious if they ever filmed a scene to that effect or if denis just did not care about it at all,2024-03-03 15:30:07
i love how they had florence pugh causally draped in spiky iced out medieval chainmail and it just makes sense,2024-03-04 22:55:14
"i got chills from that monologue

timothees got it",2024-03-05 05:15:55
someone called it dune in the first film as well,2024-03-05 04:04:20
 where are we some kind of dune ,2024-03-05 08:16:02
"lets just say paul is the worst thing that ever happened to this galaxy 

 gets pretty dark",2024-03-10 02:22:49
the visions paul has where billions die to famine are um foretelling,2024-03-10 03:02:41
i didnt really get her character shes supposed to love him but doesnt even seem to like him and theres no explanation for why,2024-03-01 16:18:05
i thought i was alone in feeling this i thought their “chemistry” was non existent…their romance didn’t work for me it felt very run of the mill ya romance and it could have and should have been more,2024-03-01 20:02:41
agreed,2024-03-01 21:13:28
well you cant predict how people will speak 8000 years in the future so anything would seem wrong people speaking in medieval tongues would be just as wrong as contemporary conversation lol,2024-03-01 17:12:08
"from the first scene i was just in pure excitement i didnt watch trailers have always wanted to read the books but havent once this was announced and dennis v was directing ive ignored all promotional stuff 

36 years old unaware of this world as a whole not filled with cgi characters and jokes havent had a feeling of wonder in many moons",2024-03-03 20:12:22
i havent read the book but wasnt it heavily implied the marriage was a political one when paul told chani he will always love her,2024-03-03 20:46:31
"although i understand the directors reason by leaving aside alias story we got that pauls entire exile lasted only a few months 

in a couple months he brought raban to his knees forced the baron back to arrakis convinced all the tribes and the emperor to come if we abstract from the movie its all too rushed

and for chani to leave paul alone and abandon him because he was forced to follow the path is pure invented drama and goes against the love story weve been told on top of that it seems unnecessary to me it is in the third part of the story where this character really will shines with her own light",2024-03-03 20:40:06
i believe the punctuation in the beginning was because it was translating fremen speech and in the latter half it was showing what was being said with hand signals instead which arent gonna be full sentences but rather short sentences enemy right or something like that,2024-03-01 03:36:07
the lack of sunburn was on my mind for the entire movie,2024-03-01 04:57:16
her being pregnant when drinking the water of life causes the unborn daughter to also have the powers of a reverend mother ,2024-03-01 19:40:09
she just her unborn daughter fully aware of herself and her entire genetic heritage this is problematic,2024-03-01 20:16:24
"jessica drinking the water of life while pregnant causes alia  anya taylorjoy to essentially become a reverend mother in the  in the book she is born and they cut to her having full blown adult conversations with the fremen as a 2 year old

edit you can see it in the movie the umbilical cord to alia turns blue with the water of life infectingchanging her along with jessica",2024-03-02 04:44:39
disillusion movie was epic in how boring it was i find it hard to believe you sat there and cried for 5 minutes,2024-03-06 02:16:39
couldn’t agree with you more i like the world building in the first and i found there was a better blend of drama and action don’t get me wrong i really enjoyed part 2 and it had some great performances from chalamet and butler but in my opinion the first film was better paced and like you said left you wanting more all the comments praising the movie as the best thing since sliced bread is odd i believe blade runner 2049 is better than dune part 2,2024-03-02 03:21:30
nah i dont think u will get downvoted you still obviously enjoyed the movie i did not find it slow though i could have sat there for 2 more hours and not noticed the time lol,2024-03-01 03:54:41
the first one didn’t feel like 3 hours and left me wanting more out of the story this film felt like 3 hours i definitely enjoyed this film but you could definitely feel that the pacing was slow seen some comments saying the pacing was too quick no idea if we watched the same film,2024-03-01 04:07:05
its a bunch of dune fan boys its similar to people who say star wars episode i is the best movie ever,2024-03-01 15:23:22
"i don’t want to come across as trying to change anyone’s mind about it but i’ll give my perspective as to why i preferred the pacing here than in part one specifically as someone who hasn’t read the book 

in part one so much of the first half of the film seems to be filled with an absolute ton of worldbuilding a decent bit of it is about arrakis but there’s also a load about the wider politics of the empire and almost every ounce of that feels meaningless to have learned by the second half of the film once paul and jessica have escaped i find the earlier inclusion of some scenes — like when paul learns about the sacred palm trees or the discussions about the formality involved in the handing over of arrakis to house atreides — to be superfluous i don’t feel any driving action in the first half even the scene with the sandworm eating the spice harvester — which is incredibly well done — doesn’t seem to move the plot along at all merely show the power of the sandworms and begin to hint at paul’s vision with the spice 

almost all of the second half of that film is just about the desertetc and very little about the specifics of the galactic politics that the film has dedicated so much time to there are people after paul and jessica but that’s all i feel i need to know at that point i get that they’re super necessary and have absolutely no suggestion on how to change it for the better but the shift in weight and focus just felt a tad unbalanced the assault of arrakis feels like it comes too late in the film to be the inciting incident but simultaneously too early for it to be the climax had the film ended when paul and jessica spent that first night in the tent i think i could’ve appreciated it more

in this one while yes it takes a long time before feyd to show up i understand perfectly the conflicts that are propelling the story forward largely in part due to the set up in the first film many of the fremen believe paul is their savior so those beliefs combined with paul’s own desire to avenge his father and his people push him and the fremen to attack the harkonnen which in turn causes the baron to increase his grip on the planet through a handful of measures including bringing in his nephew to take control 

most of the slowness in this film comes across in my eyes as time spent building up characters one of the main deficits in part once to me there’s just a much more clear backandforth of wills and goals here than in the first film but again you’re totally valid in your own opinions",2024-03-01 07:32:24
this movie wasn’t close to being slow,2024-03-02 03:55:15
there are millions of people on reddit  it shouldnt be confusing that not all of them share the same opinion about things i didnt find this movie to be slow and i also enjoyed it more than part 1 that doesnt make either of us wrong,2024-03-01 14:15:58
they definitely streamlined plot if they kept everything then i think the duke would still be alive 6 hours into the movie,2024-03-01 03:44:04
further down the saga looking back to his reaction here probably wouldnt be as comedic its a sad path towards fanaticism,2024-03-01 17:11:07
the books have some funny moments but theyre so serious that i cant blame the film for making things funnier,2024-03-01 16:57:20
"the orbital cannons and laser weaponry are so op in the dune universe shields nullify this that’s why you generally see hand to hand combat with blades blades can penetrated shielding 

house atreides got their  rocked because that  yueh disabled the arrakeen shields in the night harkonnens destroyed atreides ships from orbit and sent in op sardakuar to finish the job

the emperor got bodied the same exact way the atomics destroyed the shields allowing strafing runs and free shots for the lasers lasers are op as  you see it with the fremen just cutting through the spice harvesters small note i can’t remember if it’s explained in part 1 but the fremen are superior hand to hand combatants to the sardakuar ez w for paul",2024-03-02 09:12:25

" yeah i was very curious to see how they did that

but oh well

i think it wouldve had to be weird cgi if they did it because theres no way you get a young enough looking child actor to read the lines half decently of a child character let alone talk like an adult and do action scenes",2024-03-03 01:07:32
don’t quote me on this but i’m pretty sure the secret chamber is just a hidden cave system and the ‘family atomics’ are indeed just carted around when they move planet hiding them would have been the work of one of the advance teams,2024-03-03 04:42:54
i want to say they mentioned her name at the beginning and on geidi prime when fenrig was there but at the end they just shortened it to princess for convenience sake,2024-03-04 01:12:43
they landed behind the shield wall where they would have been safe from the worms if paul hadnt nuked holes in the shield wall for worms to get through,2024-03-04 01:23:49
"1 hubrisoverconfidence who would dare attack the emperor with his personal elite army

2 his position which was supposed to deter attacks do to the shield wall was ruined by pauls use of atomics

3 no one knows the fremen can even rideuse worms",2024-03-04 01:20:39
"well first just because the emperor would lose their support doesnt mean they are going to support paul just because the support of the previous emperor would topple doesnt guarantee support of the new guy

with that being said its also a little more complicated of note its been a long time since i read these like 20 years but going by my memory there is first needing to understand that not all of the houses were instantly on the same page of what happened to the atreides and the involvement of the emperor but even if they were aware you need to remember that this dune series is sort of like game of thrones in a scifi world and even though one character thinks or says something is going to happen a certain way sometimes things happen unpredictably

the revelation that paul has the abilities and the connection to the bene gesserit breeding program make many of the houses distrustful and even fearful of his intentions what is the extent of his power this is not clear to them also the bene gesserit are basically known for their scheming longterm planning and manipulation so there is probably some concern among the houses if that might influence the emperor like the man behind the curtain power structure

also religious concerns not all the houses are believers and supporters of this fringe religion and with paul being a messiah like figure there is worry of the imposing of religious beliefs and practices across the empire leading to possible conflict

so while the emperor was displaced as expected they do not immediately jump in line to support paul as the new emperor for these and i am sure other reasons",2024-03-04 07:19:12
"theres two separate things going on here

1 the bene gesserit planted a bunch of fake prophecies in fremen culture so that jessica could manipulate them in the movie it kind of sounds like the bg did that over the course of a few months specifically for the pauljessica situation but in the books its just a standard thing the bg do everywhere over the course of centuries as part of their longrange contingency planning just in case they need ways to manipulate a population at some point

2 paul is the result of the bene gesserit breeding project to create a superhuman who can see through time when the bene gesserit talk about the kwisatz haderach thats not a prophecy its a plan the bg are not actually religious nuts theyre scientists the spooky religious  is just a tool they use to control others 

paul does end up fulfilling all of the fremens prophecies but thats not because of any mystical reason its a combination of a they were specifically set up for him to take advantage of and b because hes superpowerful he can actually do all of the  that the prophecies promised their messiah would do",2024-03-04 16:58:06
"i think its ambiguous in part because paul is a messiah to some and not others the bene gesserit sisterhood has been doing this giant breeding program to produce a very specific person with special abilities paul is indeed that person not prophecised in a religious sense but the result of an extremely long intermarriage scheme to produce a person with supernatural abilities so in that sense paul actually is special and has special abilities

on the other hand there is the prophecy of the mahdilisan algaib the one who will free the fremen and lead them to paradise this prophecy is invented and spread by the bene gesserit for their own benefit the idea is if needed they could use the prophecy to influence events on arrakis which jessica does",2024-03-04 15:41:38
"i guess you could interpret it in multiple ways but personally no i dont think it is real the bene gesserit are masters at planting myths throughout history that become legendsreligions so they can exploit them later they carefully crafted this line of events to bring forth a believable messiah

although you could argue that since paul does do the things he was written to do he does fulfill the prophecy in a way like if i predicted a bunch of made up stuff about my kid and it ended up happening like yeah i made it up but then it happened so isnt it kind of true

where it gets a bit blurry with that line of thinking though is that the bene gesserit can force people to do things with the voice though like the part of the prophecy where the desert spring would revive the messiah from the dead well yeah that happened but they made it happen against her will it wasnt like it just naturally happened",2024-03-04 14:59:48
"correct they made her an actual character

in the books she just went along with paul and had pretty much zero agency",2024-03-05 00:21:04
yeah in the books hes described as 72 years old yet looking no older than 35 red hair a thin face and cold eyes i thought the casting throughout was phenomenal aside from this,2024-03-05 14:58:52
"yea i almost have to assume hes had some health issues or something i mean dudes getting up there

i cant imagine it wasnt a conscious choice to bring such frail energy to the role i prefer the actor from the miniseries by a bit",2024-03-05 15:44:59
the emperor is supposed to be kind of pathetic compared to what his reputation implies he’s desperate to make a male heir yet is surrounded by bene gesserit that scheme to make that not happen,2024-03-06 22:18:40
totally agree was expecting a tywin lannister tier performance instead he completely phoned it in 0 effort went into that performance,2024-03-06 11:43:27

" why was feyd able to destroy the sietches i thought their safety came from their secrecy but it was actually just rabbans unwillingness to use artillery what

the secret of arrakis is that the fremen exist in millions in the deep desert the south not the 10s of thousands most of the galaxy believed  the seitches nearer the northern territories were known and not secret

the use of artillery was  a surprise because it was an ancient weapon  shields had made all projectile weapons obsolete  in the book its the atreides that retreat into some caves after the harkonen attack  they cant go in because its too defensible 
 unable to draw them out the harkonen use  artillery to destroy the cave entrances and seal the atreadis in  dooming them

in the logic of the book this would be like going to a modern war with a catapult  its just entirely unexpected  you have to suspend your disbelief a little since its understood that shields cant be used in the desert that everyone doesnt already have ak47s but hey

this scene is transposed on to the the fremen in the movie  they cant go in because the fremen would easily  any invader  so feyd destroys the mountains around them

if paul can see the future

after he takes the water of life to become the kh he does literally see the future but only possible futures and even then not always in their entirety nor does he know which possible future will come to be so it can be useful or strangle you in uncertainty or if you rely on your precience too much cause you to fear risking any decision for which you cant see a clear result

in the specific case of the fight with feyd paul had no visions at all except that he was likely to die",2024-03-06 16:07:38
i never got the impression he can see the future to that degree which combat engagements would be childs play,2024-03-06 12:42:54
paul can indeed see the future he actually sees possible futures while your question makes sense and i dont claim to be able to fully understand it myself the answer is simple if you accept he sees possible futures and that he chose the one shown in the film there is nothing else to it he just sees the future and what happens in the film happens because he chose such a future maybe he sees that to win that fight he has to do that and be wounded and thats the only possibility in which the aftermath of him being emperor happens i think it is also worth mentioning that once paul sees possible futures and has also unlocked his ancestral memories there is no sense of time for him he knows what happened and what will happen as said in the first film the kwisatz haderach is a being beyond time and space paul is literally  xd,2024-03-06 15:36:29
yeah i was confused too as to how they suddenly now knew exactly where their seitch was i told myself oh i guess they happened to find it now and that was about all i could come up with,2024-03-06 16:08:36
"its one of the many many plotholes introduced by keeping the developments of the novel without keeping the reasons and motivations in the novel

in the novel feydrautha wasnt ruthlessly oppressing the fremen more effectively than rabban  rabban was desperately squeezing arrakis for all the spice he could get while in the perceptions of the people ruling the planet eliminating the fremen  in actuality the fremen decided to take their civilians back to the southern home sietches to avoid the worst of the fighting and deceive rabban

note  the fremen civilians were so formidable that an attack force of saudarkar that penetrated the southern regions was forced to retreat in disarray with major casualities from a defense force formed of old men women and children  and only by desperately using their own ship drives as improvised flame weapons

the sietches locations werent widely known and in the novel the fremen decide to abandon the northern ones so that they wouldnt come under direct attack 

rabban was intended to persecute the workers and maximize spice production then be replaced by the kinder and gentler feydrautha who would then be loved by the people  as the baron notes oppression is a relative thing  thats why feydrautha is introduced in the same scene the baron appears in and why rabban never appears onscreen in the novel

paul can see the future but in the novel pauls actions had opened up a period of immense uncertainty where even the tiniest random factor could change the future completely leaving him and the spacing guild navigators blind

the fight is very different in the novel  the fighters are equally matched and jessica takes paul aside to whisper that the bg often implant a control phrase in people they see as dangers and urges paul to use it to win  paul refuses  at one point in the battle feyd gains the upperhand and pauls ancestral memories begin demanding that he use the phrase  he gasps out i will not say it and feyd is so startled by this nonsequitur that he gives paul an opening to lethally stab him

as to why paul demanded the battle in the first place thats a very complicated question and one of the points of the novel is that there are multiple possible motivations that were not explicitly given  one reading is that its a suicide attempt on pauls part one last desperate attempt to halt the jihad  paul eventually realizes that it doesnt matter whether he lives or dies the entire human race demands change and upheaval and the jihad will occur no matter what",2024-03-06 18:36:14

the atreides family nukes to blow a path in the mountains throws the sardaukar into disarray because they did not expect it no one uses nukes in the empire its seen as suicide since the rest of the empire would immediately nuke the offender 


then the fremen come in riding worms the empire didnt even realize worms could be ridden or controlled and the sardaukar and harkonnens would have never stuck around when a worm showed up before how do you respond to a bunch of giant monsters showing up


sardaukar are seen as the strongest force hands down in the galaxy no one would attack the imperial army outright unless all the major houses were in on it the emperor saw coming to arrakis as a massive show of force and power the idea that any army could actually stand up to him was absurd no one knew that the fremen were actually quite numerous or that being raised in the horrible conditions of arrakis made them superior warriors by far than the sardaukar 


so suprising the imperial army with a force no one considered could even exist then forcing the other great houses to stay out of it or risk the spice being destroyed and all space travel ending ",2024-03-28 00:47:13

this movie was like the anthesis of everything that hollywood is about these daysnothing is safe or formulaic and it feels like an actual artist is making the decisions vs a roomful of studio executives,2024-03-04 14:10:59
the original scifi coming in to show its grandkids how its done again,2024-03-02 15:26:41
they didnt specifically mention anything regarding that scene  but rabban had been shown to be pretty dumb  incapable throughout whereas lady fenring had assessed feyd to be intelligent and even a potential future emperor candidate,2024-03-02 23:29:12
"highly certain its explained in the books but no here its just part of the huge story cut for time 

theres gotta be a 3½ hour cut of this movie that explains it and runs a little smoother there and they decided instead of multiple spots being a little jarring having 1 spot be super jarring",2024-03-03 00:10:05
"no it was just lazy plotting feyd wasn’t necessary at all rabban and the rest of the harkonnens had already been established as violent and destructive mad men who would have done that exact same thing 

the witches wanted feyd there because he was another “prospect” but he never felt like a threat because he needed his opponents drugged at the arena",2024-03-02 23:08:07
the plot decided that in order to make him scary and competent he had to find the hideout somehow,2024-03-02 22:42:06
absolutely incredible movie ive never seen any other blockbuster that has this combination of amazing spectacle and thematic depth,2024-03-06 06:36:58
in the book it was over a few years but they didnt want to do that especially because alia would be a little child  and a creepy toddler running around and killing baron would look way out of place on a big screen,2024-03-06 12:03:43
" but i just wanted a bit more of the battlefield fight and pauls ascension to the emperors chamber would have happily sat in that theater for 10 more minutes

agreed the final battle felt a little tepid all things considered though i suppose when one side is riding sandworms into battle they have a large advantage

but that final fight between paul and fayd was badass the choreography was fast and the editing gave it real punch",2024-03-01 03:07:36
"i too went to see this last sunday for the imax fan event part two is one of those films where watching it on large premium formats really enhance the experience and villeneuve harnesses that so wonderfully 

its truly a film that really lives up to its epic proportions and i can see this become one of the greatest scifi sequels of all time for this century and generations to come",2024-03-01 03:09:10
it’s everything i needed it to be 1010 from me,2024-03-01 03:02:37
agreed  on the harkonnen point pauls realization that he was part of that bloodline  subsequent decision to embrace war was chilling,2024-03-01 03:58:00
"the first real action scene where they attack the harvester was so so satisfying

a clever detail that i absolutely was blown away by was that you dont even see her fire on the helicopter before it blows up the gunner shoots at paul paul dodges it by hiding the gunner immediately pans to chani pointing the launcher at himi was fully expecting to see her fire the launcher but the gunner was too late by the time the gunner panned over to her she had already fired

i loved that detail it completely avoided my expectations of what normally happens",2024-03-01 06:21:49
theres no bagpipes in this part that alone is enough of a reason to watch part one imo,2024-03-01 05:37:33
" the first real action scene where they attack the harvester was so so satisfying

i have to disagree  first i couldnt figure out why the harvesters were different than in the first film  did harkonens take them when they left and the atredies broughtbuilt their own and the harkonens brought them back  

but what really got me was the way they just pretty much mowed them down with the ornithopter  in the book its always implied that the fremen are way better at killing the harkonens then they are them so to see half the group get taken out by just guns seemed disrespectful",2024-03-01 04:06:31
the chani thing is so  like what’s she gonna do go live as a hermit in the desert that scene was so  and unnecessary,2024-03-01 05:01:42
zendaya just doesn’t have the range of an actor she’s only capable of playing one character i used to be her biggest fan but as i got older i started to realize her acting is nothing amazing i think now she’s more of a product rather than an actress,2024-03-02 22:16:15
"nah i thought it was good  shes a desert warrior she starts out kinda reserved starts to get a bit more tender with him then gets more worried about him then straight up betrayed

x200b

there was only a few of her and tims readings that i thought could have used another take  oh and butlers i felt like i heard his elvis at one point

x200b

everyone else was great esp bardem ferguson and brolin actually came in really well this time",2024-03-02 10:31:23
it could have been better but also could have been worse i also agree that the chemistry isn’t super convincing,2024-03-02 12:28:32
i’ve seen it twice and i thought her acting was by far the weakest so did the two friends i saw it with huffed and puffed like an angry kid is actually how i would describe her acting,2024-03-02 08:07:43
i thought she was great her little eye twitch at one point felt very real and relatable,2024-03-02 08:20:38
"i felt that as well for the first half of the movie and then somehow didnt mind it later

maybe its her hype but somehow you felt her hype in comparison to the other actors",2024-03-02 10:18:04
it felt flat she at a sharp tone of constant aggression and the entire story arc of of her character was completely redone as compared to the books,2024-03-02 07:10:21
"the reason he called it brilliant is that conventional ballistic weapons were considered outdated and irrelevant at that time  at a minimum these weapons would be have to manufactured and retrofitted to the ships since they werent being used at that time

x200b

does that qualify as brilliant  well maybe not but thats the reasoning behind it",2024-03-04 03:12:19
as a huge dune fan i agree it was meh wasn’t bad but wasn’t amazing either   they rushed the  out of that ending,2024-03-01 23:18:00
i feel like theres a great movie in there its just been edited down to the bare minimum needed to tell the story its a shame denis doesnt do extended editions,2024-03-02 21:18:14
but the cinematography  is what everyone seems to say  the cinematography is as unaffecting as a ton of cgi is if you dont care about the story or characters  and i def didnt after part 1  not gonna see part 2,2024-03-03 01:23:23
"i finally got around to watching it and this is the comment id most agree with i still enjoyed it a lot but i felt like there were a fair few scenes where something had obviously been left on the cutting room floor  

you see the bare minimum of how feyd has begun to resume spice production but there could have been so much more to show what makes him a much more effective leader than the incompetence of batistas character",2024-03-26 09:53:04
so spot on they really kept the movie from being outstanding to me,2024-03-01 07:24:00
yeah the whole thing was almost completely emotionless with the exception of some yelling,2024-03-02 03:28:23
"there has to be a scene cut from that trial 

“don’t talk to the jinns”

sees chani 

trial over",2024-03-01 06:23:39
it took me a minute to realize the ambush scene was actually happening and not just paul having a vision while on his desert trial lol loved the movie but much like the second half of the book its definitely a bit rushed in places,2024-03-01 07:17:27
nailed it,2024-03-01 11:40:37
"im glad someone shares a similar opinion about the film almost everyone is raving here but i felt part 1 was much better than what we got here 

the third act is just badly rushed and  we dont get any time to really reflect upon pauls actions and the gravity of what it is about to bring i feel they shouldve added some more dialogue of his inner conflict to highlight the sinister undertones of his becoming lisanal gaib 

also wish the final fight was a bit longer barring the fight with feyd ratha the whole thing felt a bit anticlimactic",2024-03-01 21:24:04
if im to be honest a lot of the story problems are baked into the book im rather surprised the script made as much sense of it as it did,2024-03-01 11:57:28
"while i really like that movie i also noticed some odd things keeping it away from being perfect  but it is still great so keep that in mind

for feydrautha it didnt helped that much that his third arena opponent would have actually killed him if he hadnt that shield device this lessened his prowess as a fighter when one unknown fighter is able to  him it would be really strange if he would have killed paul in the end because of that

most other problems that i had were about world building the fremen were never shown to build technology but they used big  lasers to  the spice harvesters had rockets and obviously instantly knew how to flight the sardaukan space fleet in combat 

generally the world building in case of technology and usage of this is lacking a lot",2024-03-01 12:10:06
" walken barely has any time to make this emperor an actually formidable foe and he turns into a meek pliant  which was very disappointing 

this was clearly intentional hes an impotent old man a relic of a declined dynasty he was only a threat in the first place because he lashed out against a younger rival out of insecurity his role in the story is to be supplanted by a younger and more vital opponent",2024-03-04 22:15:55
i felt the opposite unfortunately he took me out of the film a few times unfortunately i think chalamet just doesn’t work for me loved the film otherwise,2024-03-02 07:55:02
nah there were some very rushed moments in the 2nd half of the film spectacular movie no doubt but im absolutely spoiling for the extended 4 hour editions of these films ah la lotr,2024-03-03 05:42:31
after seeing the deer hunter and king of new york i thought christopher walken was an awesome casting choice,2024-03-06 06:29:57
i agree totally miscast,2024-03-06 01:58:05
dont forget pugh unwisely attempting to match his accent,2024-03-06 02:01:38
i really liked the movie but i have to call a spade a spade at times it felt like a 4 hour movie being crammed to under 3,2024-03-02 13:55:34
"ive been struggling to articulate why i disliked this film and you nailed it


it took much of the cool and intriguing parts of the first film and dccomicd them into uninteresting tropes",2024-03-03 06:20:41
you definitely don’t deserve the down votes you’re dead on this was a very good movie and i enjoyed it quite a lot but it isn’t even top 10 all time sci fi films,2024-03-02 18:25:59
i couldnt agree more with this,2024-03-03 04:41:11
i liked it overall but i have to agree some of the cuts and skips from scene to scene were pretty jarring,2024-03-02 09:31:00
"most of the issues stem in many ways from the book imo essentially a lot of exposition is missing in the movie because its just heaps of internal monologues and the book itself also ends rather abruptly which explains the jarring pacing of the end not that this excuses denis from not finding better solutions  but thats a reasoning as to why the movie is like this

theres also the fact that the first movie only covered like a 13rd of the book so the 2nd one is where all the meat resides this leads to the 2nd movie being far larger in scope than the first which makes it feel like a very grandiose sequel it genuinely does improve and expand the world from the 1st movie and those aspects combined with gigantic epic end battle which it actually isnt because in traditional denis fashion they decided to spend all the budget for only 30 seconds of footage gives it those lotresb vibes its just rare in general for sequels to actually improve the original and be more than redoing the first movie but with a few tweaks so dune part 2 feels like a grandiose sequel when in reality it isnt really a sequel  its just the actual main meat of the book and part 1 was just a prologue",2024-03-03 00:07:31
nolan and villeneuve are easily two of the most overrated directors it would make sense they both  each others egos both have peaked and their quality is declining im with you this was mundane and these simple fans already knew it was going to be an all time film for them without even having seen it,2024-03-03 13:27:14
timothee standing in front of a massive throng of tough fremen saying no one would dare try to fight him had me crying with laughter i dont care if he can shoot lasers out of his eyes you just cant make that scene work with that actor im sorry they should have found a way to work around it idk but timothee shouting menacingly is a joke,2024-03-07 20:44:06
because lest we forget different people have different opinions you didn’t care for it that’s all you needed to say if other people praise it you don’t have to dismantle their praise you can just move on wasn’t made for you and that’s okay ,2024-03-04 15:47:47
"i completely disagree the film was genius and probably one of the best adaptations of all time  the whole time i kept being blown away by the fact that it felt like it did nothing but add to dune the little details in my head due to being a book reader felt so rewarding  i never felt disappointed at the things not in the movie instead i felt thankful for the additional time spent on the characters like chani the culture life in the sietch pauls journey etc

x200b

my friend who hasnt read the books never got bored and instead his curiousity at certain things were piqued  for me i just felt like i had extra context for what was going on

x200b

additionally this is a movie made for the theater and was such a powerful humanistic experience  i absolutely adored it",2024-03-02 10:26:01
nolan is starting to really disappoint me especially as my favorite director of all time first the calls to risk your life to see the cinematic masterpiece that was tenant during covid then the utter let down of oppenheimer and now these comments hes become really good at the hype machine ,2024-03-05 05:56:01
" portraying timothée in a menacing manner is a tough feat to pull off and it really wasn’t done effectively which just shows it’s a casting issue

timothée portrayed a 16year old very well

when a 16year old proclaims i am paul muaddib atreides duke of arrakis how intimidating is that ever going to be

no the fact of the matter is that a young man who wouldnt be old enough to buy beer today had access to future knowledge had access to an arsenal of nukes was trained in persuasion techniques and was commanding an army of experts in combat that had become extremely loyal to him

but you might not know that by looking at him thats the menacing part",2024-03-02 17:46:47
nuanced opinions are mainly dead,2024-03-04 17:45:35
"i can understand why they avoided using the word jihad the original book goes as far as one of the distant fremen ancestors referencing the hajj

personally i wouldve preferred them fully accept it but yeah probably for the best they didnt because it wouldve been all anyone focused on with talk of this film moving completely from the quality of the movie to irl politics and inspirations",2024-03-02 16:09:35
" they somehow managed to make stilgars faith comic relief and horrifying at the same time


that being essentially the main crux of the film is  genius by denis what a masterpiece of a film",2024-03-02 16:49:34
cant imagine would have done it any favours  here in the uk atleast he directly references jihad in part 1 and i was quite pleased they didnt shy from it again in part 2 that said the term fundamentalists was a bit jarring after the second time so i wish theyd just gone full dune respect the effort though and if it gets some soft mum or rightwing nut claiming conspiracy then thats a bonus,2024-03-02 16:56:28
thought the same thing as soon as i left the theatre,2024-03-03 12:08:37
"there are actually coffeetable books of this type which you can buy

look up the art and soul of dune theres one each for part one  two as well as dune the photography iirc",2024-03-03 13:08:33
its a tease for her full length role in the next film,2024-03-03 13:03:06
honestly it felt a little like fanservice because they knew there would be people upset that alia wasn’t born yet in this movie,2024-03-03 14:31:33
i mean zendaya kinda did that in part 1 lol she also pretty much just appeared in pauls visions,2024-03-03 17:58:15
" a lot of similarities to the later seasons of attack on titan

considering how the book was written in the 60s hope people recognise that its attack on titan that heavily took inspiration from dune  not the other way around",2024-03-07 09:12:26
my take on rabban was that he was just a tantrum throwing bully he would have all those outbursts but a baby but he was actually just a  bully who couldnt fight like when they went looking for paul and he saw them come out of the dust he just ran away like a  so to me it made sense that gurney rolled him hard,2024-03-09 05:09:51
i would agree the fight scene at the end with him could’ve been longer and more fulfilling but i think his character overall was actually exceptionally used for a character who is really not a main character at all he got the perfect amount of storybuilding and subsequently story fallout the scene where he attacks the sietch and runs away from paul i thought was one of the best scenes personally from the beginning the show pretty clearly that he has no grasp on the situation that he’s reacting poorly and out of desperation and that only amplified when he finds out the fremen just destroyed their large spice depot which they say in the movie destroyed like 50 of their total spice harvest leading him to attack the sietch his pilot surveyor resisting him breaking is neckthat whole scene was so good to me,2024-03-08 14:49:23
" dave bautista was poorly used in this movie

i agree same for skarsgaard  they just didnt give any time at all to the harkonnen so its just be evil  your servant fail at spice production",2024-03-08 17:25:05
rthathappened,2024-03-02 01:38:00
people booing in the theater did you watch this at a zoo,2024-03-01 05:15:01
" and to top it all timothy has zero leadership energy

its weird how hes both good when he screams and shows emotion but is absolutely wooden in other scenes too wordless and too stoic although in those instances since we know timothee can act id say the screenplay and direction didnt utilize his strengths enough

also not a fan of the romance of paul and chani started off nice when they are speaking to each other on the dunes about fremen differences then it just felt like a weak typical romance between two characters forced to smooch because script said so",2024-03-03 00:30:03
walken disappointed me  he was too casual as the emperor,2024-03-04 01:40:30
where tf do you people live where there’s so much action going on in the theater ,2024-03-01 04:16:52
i agree people are glazing like crazy they’re talking about it’s similar to lotr wild,2024-03-03 00:10:55
oddly some people clapped at the end of the movie for me but i agree with you mostly some really cool setpieces action scenes and a good amount of refreshing weirdness like all the geidi prime or water of life stuff but  the overarching plot was just not compelling for the most part timothee and zendaya were honestly not impressive lacked chemistry and i just didnt care about them the first third of the movie was more engaging but after that i was basically just waiting for paul to start turning in a dictator,2024-03-10 04:17:30
man what a  this movie i was i was waiting for the interval to come,2024-03-03 18:08:53
nail on the head chalamet is just not a good actor,2024-03-02 07:23:19
go figure when the director is recently quoted as saying he hates dialogue and would do a movie with none if he could  so essentially his ambition is to make computer nature screen savers,2024-03-02 22:51:37
imax it’s the only way you can get the expanded aspect ratio part two is shot entirely in imax aspect ratios,2024-03-01 03:57:19
"if you have imax 70mm or one of the full imax aspect ratio screens absolutely choose that

if not i’d recommend dolby cinema",2024-03-01 04:04:50

"it’s been a while since i’ve read the book but i think it’s explained that 
they have an alliance with the smugglers gurney as well as the choam syndicate which i don’t think is mentioned in the movies but they basically control all the legitimate business of the galaxy they also have the emperors fleet now",2024-03-01 16:04:11
navigators cant do  without the spice which no one can create in big enough batches to supplant arakiss importance,2024-03-01 17:02:07
wasn’t rabban near there that one time in the storm when all of his guys got ambushed,2024-03-01 16:17:46
there are smuggler groups that operate on the planet  he basically gets roped in with them after the main battle and more or less gets lost in the confusion of the transition back to harkonnen control  the guerrilla attacks on their spice production,2024-03-02 02:08:34
dude its already 2 hours and 40 minutes long i liked the movie so id be cool with a 4 hour cut but i dont think most contemporary audiences have that kind of an attention span,2024-03-02 21:53:48
"centipedes were just stilgar talking of potential dangers and the djinn talk was the intro to stilgar being very religious and superstitious 

paul getting sent to the desert was a setup for chani to follow him and to start their relationship",2024-03-03 02:02:56
yeah this movie kinda of reeks of it was supposed to be longer then it was and the studio decided to do deep cuts,2024-03-02 20:23:09
because paul has become a religious zealot  off his own hype who will lead her people to war,2024-03-02 21:03:52
"he did what he said he wouldnt denied being the profit the entire movie to avoid a future of billions dying in his name

after gaining the ability to see futures he did exactly that leaned into the prophecy to start that war",2024-03-02 21:03:05
"the worms get tired and then just sit there on the surface 

probably shouldve had someone like explain that to paul and with that the audience given how many are asking this",2024-03-03 01:12:42
when they ride south it almost looks like paul starts steering his worm away from chanis  then next time we see her shes landing an ornithopter  there are definitely scene missings,2024-03-03 04:55:53
i firmly believe frank herbert watched lawrence of arabia and then said ill do that but in space  too many parallels to be coincidence,2024-03-03 04:53:30
basically that the atreides line of succession was not destroyed by the harkonnens paul was going to defeat the baron take control of dune and tell any other great house that showed up what really happened,2024-03-03 14:16:41
no doubt also no portrayal of paul crying for jamis its big in the book,2024-03-03 22:32:52
this was a truly sad thing,2024-03-03 20:59:08
i was kinda suprised by that considering denis wants to adapt messiah as part 3 they mentioned the guild briefly in part 1 i think but it seems with this one theyre just not bringing up the guilds at all to simplify things so im thinking denis may just be tossing the spacing guild altogether so as not to have people really confused in part 3,2024-03-03 23:58:48
i was never here,2024-03-04 03:18:09
"small correction the turning point was the drinking itself after that he was able to see past and all possible futures before he was only able to see glimpses the harknonnen part was sort of a shock value realisation because the atreides and harkonnens were enemies by centuries but now their bloodlines were merged in paul

i think the comment about key to winning refers to the harkonnens being ruthless and cruel and by embracing his role as messiah and the path of vengeance he will be responsible of millions of deaths",2024-03-03 22:24:06
it’s not the harkonnen part of the bloodline that makes him turn but the fact that the poison fully unlocks his prescience he himself is opposed to the idea of enslaving people through myth and religion so what did he finally see that made him pick the path of the messiah that’s what the rest of the books cover and hopefully we get to see a glimpse of in villeneuve’s next installment,2024-03-03 22:08:49
gurney had connections with smugglers its not explicitly stated thats how he got that message out but it was explicitly stated that gurney had connections with smugglers,2024-03-04 06:03:50
in the books fremen have ships which they use for smuggling spice also i cant remember if navigators pilot all ships or just the heighliners the big ones they use for interstellar travel but now that paul has control of spice production the navigators guild is basically enslaved to his will,2024-03-04 08:30:20
think she stayed out of pride,2024-03-08 03:49:58
its not clear yet because chanis character does not do that in the books nor she is against pauls holy war so even book readers we dont know what will happen with her and paul,2024-03-08 09:11:42
"i dont think i really understand any overly complex themes 

i mean youve got duty over love  but thats kinda a trope at this point 

paul felt forced into being the prophet although what did he expect after he kept provoking the harkonnens eventually they would retaliate so severely he would have to up the violence 

this seems more like a boy who wants revenge and will stop at nothing to get it while pretending he is conflicted about it if he was actually conflicted we didnt see it until after he had already set the wheels in motion  

it would be interesting if paul had you know tried to live peaceably with the fremen and move on only to keep getting dragged back into the war despite knowing from his visions it would only end in bloodshed 

i havent read the book but i imagine that conflict is better presented than just a kid wanting revenge and not caring how many die to get it because hes got the power needed to do it",2024-03-13 06:44:20
"nah paul was actually in a coma while his body was fighting off the poison what woke him up was that extra drop of poison that chani administered to him like a jolt to spring him back to life

the desert spring tears was just a movieonly thing not in the books i think the whole purpose of its inclusion was just to add another layer to the fabricated lisan al gaib prophecy what appeared to have happened was that jessica intentionally set up the whole scene in that cave so that the fremen onlookers could witness this final step of the prophecy coming true she even used the voice on chani to do it the tears didnt actually do anything to wake up paul it was all just a show staged by jessica in order for her to convert the remaining nonbelievers to pauls side",2024-03-17 21:07:31
"the bene gesserit simply tried to keep paul and jessica alive as fall backs for the breeding program they dont want genes going to waste even if paul wasnt a girl like they wanted 


they set up prophecies across countless worlds to manipulate cultures and better control the population they werent expecting paul and jessica to hijack the prophecy to start a religious uprising and definitely didnt expect paul to become anywhere near as powerful as he turned out to be",2024-03-17 03:41:35

"the other houses came there in the first place because the baron had already spilled the dirt on the emperor to them

they didnt accept paul because to them his house had already been wiped out and even he himself was supposed to have been dead for months now so even if he  his mother were still alive why would they accept him as emperor over them when they themselves could attempt to take advantage of the power vacuum from shaddam apparently stepping down they have no idea what paul  his fremen army are capable of after all",2024-03-18 11:37:27

the nukes were only used to punch a hole in the mountain range so the worms could be brought through they werent used near any people also nuclear weapon effects dissipate far quicker than hollywood makes people believe the nukes wouldnt have any effect on the people or future plant life of arrakis,2024-03-23 22:55:47
story is not good enough to be on that level visually it was stunning but the story was just above avg first half of the movie is paul being perfect at everything and refusing to go to the south and then suddenly he just gives in for no stated reason and takes the worm blood and from then on his personality is completely shifted to dictator mode it was not a complex story like the dark knight,2024-04-01 07:48:34

same i liked it dont get me wring but it be nice to get a conclusion,2024-03-01 03:05:01
thats kind of how it was in the book unless im misremembering they plan the attack it happens and then paul basically had control and is forcing demands of the emperor guildmans etc ,2024-03-01 07:13:05

twitter is dumb af lol,2024-03-04 04:09:43
go figure when the director is recently quoted as saying he hates dialogue and would do a movie with none if he could  so essentially his ambition is to make computer nature screen savers,2024-03-02 22:51:02

visually stunning sure but thats about it",2024-03-01 09:42:17
yep im 100 with you it was still good but i was definitely disappointed every single time i would be excited about a scene they would just skip past it pacing and editing were really poor,2024-03-01 05:12:03
"i feel like meaningful dialogue was almost nonexistent sure the visuals were cool but everything feels so hollow 

the side characters are there just to prop up the main leads and have no life of their own paul and chani were quite dull and the chemistry between them really awkward the villains were really one dimensional and nothing about them was really explored bautista seemed like a gigantic angry baby in every scene he was in and i really wanted him to give me more 

i just feel disappointed because i really liked the first one  where i felt the world was more alive",2024-03-01 21:47:51
yes especially with that pod jessica was in,2024-03-02 06:31:20

"the movie had to make a trade off either keep the book timeline of 4 years with alia being 2 or 3 at the end and events making more sense time wise or keep alia out of it at the cost of scenes blurring by and the timeline seeming very rushed 


the problem of course being that trying to make a serious dramatic movie is very tough if one of your characters is a toddler with the personality of a grown woman",2024-03-05 04:34:44
they revealed jessica was pregnant in the first movie and chose not to have the fightin toddler so less than 9 months as compared to the years in the book,2024-03-05 05:28:15
i feel like that was somewhat intentional the book has a timeskip and instead they just got kinda ambiguous with the passing of time the only real touchstone we have is that jessicas daughter isnt born so that gives us a time limit,2024-03-05 03:09:56
"calling paul a villain is indeed a bit much   but let me list some things that the films outright say  show which makes paul an antihero at least albeit perhaps a tragic one

both films state multiple times that the fremens lisan al gaib prophecy is fake propaganda that was planted by the bene gesserit over many years to manipulate them paul too is shown to be aware that its fake he sees a vision in part one  in the tent where he inhales spice in the air following the atreides massacre  of a holy war that could happen in his name involving the fremen one spanning the entire galaxy killing billions perhaps and yet in the ecological station scene the very next day he tells liet kynes that he will become the fremens messiah  use them to gain revenge against the harkonnens  the emperor  all despite knowing that the fremens prophecy is fake and that his plan could possibly result in the terrible war he had visions of he repeats something similar to jessica in the beginning of part two  i must sway the nonbelievers and use them to disrupt spice production thats the only way to get to the emperor 


he can see the future he can speak brand new languages just because and he comes back to life in a ritual no man has ever survived

none of this is because hes an actual hero of prophecy though  pauls abilities are the result of him being the endproduct of a millennia long eugenics program by the bene gesserit the kwisatz haderach paul  jessica are essentially posing his sciencegiven kh abilities in front of the fremen as fate given making the latter believe that its because hes the lisan al gaib of their fake prophecy so that he can seize religiopolitical power over the fremen primarily for his goals

he rejects certain actions because he has a premonition that theyll end badly but then has a new premonition that we dont see and acts on it

yeah this is why i still said he isnt a villain more like a tragic antihero while it was both selfish  manipulative of him initially to use the fremens fake prophecy to control them for his revenges sake after spending time with  getting to know them he does genuinely begin to care for chani  her people him taking off his atreides ring while saying father ive found my way and then showing anger at jessica for continuing to manipulate the fremen refusing to go south etc all being evidence of his real change of heart

 i called him tragic because after the sietch tabr attack being forced to go south and then seeing the visions after drinking water of life he really didnt have a choice anymore but to seize religiopolitical power over the fremen but things wouldnt have reached such an extreme loselose scenario ie get annihilated now versus surviving but also starting a holy war that kills billions in the first place if he hadnt selfishly picked this path for personal revenge at the end of part one despite knowing the risks from his visions  jessica had even suggested that they simply escape offworld using stilgars help back then  paul was the one who refused at the time the actually right thing to do really was him taking the l and escaping rather than manipulating an entire native population and then leading them to a galactic jihad primarily for his revenge at least to begin with

before you say what about the fremens liberation note how paul himself didnt say a word about that in either the ecological station scene in part one or the beginning of part two it was only after he started actually caring for the fremen that this too became a main goal for him rather than just a side effect also note that the fremen were able to survive relatively well against the dumb brute rabban  and it was only the more aggressive attacks under pauls command that led to rabban being replaced by feyd the attack on sietch tabr and so on",2024-03-21 10:41:52
"nah i disagree i mean i dont agree that hes a villain either if anything hes a very tragic character who i massively feel for but he aint a hero and the movie tells you that


obviously hes a charismatic triumphant leader no one would follow him if he wasnt and as the audience we are kinda in their shoes as we see his rise to power it is epic we are supposed to get caught up in the frenzy too

but the sheer amount of cosmically negative and spooky music whenever jessica and paul talk about him becoming the prophet the way in which stilgar gets increasingly fanatical all of pauls tears throughout the movie his defeated look when he says lead them to paradise chani as a character is basically a walking flashing billboard that screams what paul is doing is bad and the holy war begins holy wars have never been anything other than horrific

paul is was a good person at heart  into tragic circumstances i dont think hes evil but he certainly unleashes evil in order to fulfil the terrible purpose hes burdened with

the movie doesnt scream this guy is evil but it sure as  tries to make you stop thinking hes a hero by the end of the movie i think its so well done",2024-03-21 21:38:41
nope i 100 agree with you i chuckled anytime they showed pauls silhouette and during chanis battle rampage at the end who are they kidding,2024-03-02 05:40:48

the fremen are trained in the weirding way it’s the novels it’s likened to teleportation of up to a meter at a time that’s how fast they fight this was one of the show don’t tell that they chose to do ,2024-03-03 22:21:45
the space guild being mia is baffling  they had such drip in part one  was looking forward to seeing them,2024-03-04 01:39:03
"1 we see that jamis is still in pauls head he mistakes chani for him  then he has some bonding with her 


2 what is there to explain here all of feyds best scenes from the book except his very early introduction one which would have made part one even longer added to the budget etc were included here  executed really well most people have nothing but praise for butler  the scenes hes in


3 are you new to watching movies killing off subordinates for no reason is a usual activity of psychotic characters in positions of power and why is it moronic when the ones he killed are so easily replaceable  he faces no consequences for killing them


4 unnecessary she was clearly shown to be on the fremens side chanis friend  the fremen predominantly used guerrilla tactics  so ofc a few of them were spies as well


5 it says a lot about how extreme fremen culture is that they have so much water on their desert planet but refuse to drink it  not just because its randomly holy but because it was being saved for their dream of creating a green paradise on arrakis in future under lisn al gaib  essentially transforming the ecology there using that water someday it also made feyds later destruction of the same even more tragic


6 fremen were clearly mentioned to be on equal footing with or even stronger than the sardaukar chani is fremen as well the sardaukar were also vastly outnumbered  unfamiliar with the terrain fremen tactics etc its similar to how far more advanced highly trained soldiers in even our real world sometimes end up losing to guerrilla warfare


7 paul orders the fremen to stop killing the smugglers after confirming that its indeed gurney also gurneys loyalty is to the atreides not some random smugglers he just happened to be working with at the time


8 youre just being a troll arent you you literally just mentioned the smugglers in your previous comment so its not as though you arent aware of such routes offworld being present which the fremen can make use off to send a mere scroll


9 the film works as it is without involving the spacing guild theyll surely feature more prominently in the next film 


10 as far as the movies are concerned unless explicitly shown to be alive later like gurney or the  gladiators that feyd killed every other known atreides character is dead although some noname survivors were mentioned by gurney to have been smuggled back to caladan


11 the enemy harkonnens  the emperor arent the biggest threat in this film  its the holy war that paul could and does trigger by seizing religiopolitical over the fremen 


12 the emperor already knew that war was coming plus everyone at arrakkeen were used to feeling complacent against worms fremen etc while they were within the shield walls natural mountain barriers etc

 not to mention being overconfident in the sardaukars strength  like a whos gonna be  enough to attack us  lol attitude  also busy taking the harkonnens to task 


more than half these questions were so dumb  nitpicky the last one is the only somewhat legitimate criticism youve said but i bet you arent even gonna read this comment",2024-03-03 14:51:22
" why talk about the pool of holy water if it has absolute 0 use in the story

the fact that the fremen want to terraform the desert out of the planet may be relevant in part 3

 no mention of the mentat thufir

this one is a shame though if they were gonna cut him why put him in part 1

 when they tell us that there a millions of fanatics ready to fight  it kind of deminishes the level of threat of the enemy

intentional",2024-03-04 01:27:12
" 11 when they tell us that there a millions of fanatics ready to fight  it kind of deminishes the level of threat of the enemy  they were not millions of arakis  right

there were millions of fremen this was discussed in the first movie and each of their fighters are far superior to sardukar even children and old women defeated sardukar one on one in the books",2024-03-04 10:51:00
i respect your opinion regarding timmy’s acting but when he was preaching to the fundamentalists i felt it was very convincing and was a key moment of evolution for his character and his beliefs,2024-03-02 07:39:25
"if you only take account of this movie i suppose you’re right however the harkonnen had the upper hand the entire first movie the fremen weren’t confident in themselves until they had paul as their prophet i think they said early on that “the more north you go the more likely you are to die” the world building in the first movie tried to hit pretty hard that the harkonnen vastly underestimate the fremen not just their fighting skills but the actual amount they had the only thing stopping the fremen was resources

pretty much when you take their shields away have superior warriors and now have a leader who understands how to beat these people of course you steamroll through them 

if you’re interested in the books perspective rabban was cut off from the rest of the harkonnen pretty much just left to fend for himself with no help so it was even worse in the book",2024-03-02 00:57:56
the water scene was kinda rushed but i dont understand how like two relatively minor things make you dont like the other 2 and a half hours of incredible filmmaking,2024-03-04 23:00:01
youll get downvoted for saying the truth the pacing was off,2024-03-04 23:05:31
"you probably need to watch it again and pay closer attention

they are riding the worm and a worm breaks off which is paul going to the temple to drink the water of life since he knows that its part of his destiny to be able to see clearly he realizes he needs to do this after sietch is blown up and wasnt able to see it coming

i guess it is a little weird to have 3 cuts back to back to explain the stuff that happens after paul drank the water but it wasnt particularly hard to understand that they first send for lady jessica who then sends for chani its obvious to assume this all didnt happen with an hour or so im not entirely sure what was confusing about this scene tbh lol

there are scenes earlier in the movie showing him stabbing feyd in short visions i think around the time he says there is a narrow path to victory",2024-03-04 21:05:02
"yeah pacing wasnt the best

paul gets stabbed with his own knife and then when feyd is so sure he won and puts his guard down paul pulls it out of himself and stabs feyd im pretty sure you can hear it all",2024-03-04 18:41:22
"i loved part 1 but part 2 had tons of issues i wanted to love it but i just couldnt

thats interesting because i felt part 1 had far worse pacing issues than this one 

to me part 1 was just a decent scifi film but part 2 is a great one",2024-03-04 21:24:25
" for me i felt deflated and depressed at the end i felt like ok he won but hes not the person he used to be and this isnt where he wanted to end up

i think you understood it",2024-03-03 17:12:55
he did what he did for revenge he said it was for the people but really that’s the true reason,2024-03-03 15:30:04
if you can’t wait for the next movie perhaps you should peruse the books to see the dark descent of paul character in the series,2024-03-03 17:09:16
your parents have the wisdom of age while you have the idealism of youth thats basically the reason for how differently you reacted to the ending i think,2024-03-04 10:48:03
"also why end on a scene of chani once again giving her stank face there’s galaxy spanning decisions going on at the palace with a messianic figure but we are instead focused on the messiah’s jilted exlover weird

isnt the reason obvious it was to make sure that audiences didnt leave the theatre thinking that they witnessed a heros great triumph  but instead dwelling on how paul had in effect wronged betrayed  hurt chani though we know that after a certain point he had very little choice in the matter

 her character in the film is used by villeneuve throughout part two to indicate how the audience is supposed to be feeling about pauls actions at each point  a necessary step considering how many antiheroes including paul himself from the book had been mistakenly idolised by many in the past",2024-03-20 14:57:06
"funnily enough most nonamericans seem to be unfamiliar with his usual walkenisms so his performance as the emperor which is anyway just for a couple of scenes works fine for us

heck villeneuve seemed to have subdued or reined in his more eccentric impulses  resulting in a sufficiently controlled performance of a paranoid  jealous old ruler as was required",2024-03-01 05:10:36
i thought he was good,2024-03-01 05:21:38
"miscasted

miscast",2024-03-01 06:22:56
"  zendaya chalamet and pugh were all inconsistent in terms of actingdelivery at moments zendaya just being a huge miscast in my opinion 

felt like chalamet got more interesting in the second half and chani got worse towards the end all she did was scowl and i was getting irritated with her presence almost and she is not the character we should end on a cliffhanger shot denis that whole end sequence was too rushed too so that audiences are confused at timothees sudden bloodlust to send everyone else to paradise or choosing irulan etc",2024-03-03 00:59:46
yeah that last act really rushed through heading south and the transition to being the chosen one through to overthrowing the emperor scenes were jumping all over the place,2024-03-02 14:21:33
dune 2 is more fun and more people will like it but dune 1 is the better film you can tell that denis received studio notes to pick up the pace and the storytelling suffers for it,2024-03-03 02:32:13
agreed,2024-03-02 08:52:18
this is the first comment that ive seen that captures 95 of how i feel about the movie so thank you for this even if its not the most popular opinion,2024-03-01 11:19:55
"as a book reader i did find myself getting annoyed at things that they could have been far less confusing for general audiences if they just added one or two lines of expository dialogue

in the books most of the great houses have stockpiles of atomic weapons however it was decided period of time that i can’t remember ago that it’s a war crime to use them as weapons and if you do all of the other great houses are basically contractually obliged to all team up and wipe your house from existence

in the book there’s a “shield wall” that protects arrakeen from the worms it’s a natural rock formation similar to the mountains that surrounded the empire’s encampment in the movie

paul ends up using his family atomics on the shield wall instead of firing them at human targets which is a clever loophole because there’s nothing in the convention that forbids you from using atomics for other purposes as long as they’re not being dropped on people with the shield wall blown open paul is able to bring sandworms into the conflict which is a decisive factor in his victory

i think that’s something they could have explained with like two lines and it would make the giant hidden atomic stash feel like much less of a random asspull",2024-03-01 08:47:13
great recap and summarizes really exactly how i feel solid film but feels a near 180 in tone and direction compared to the first which i can rewatch hundreds of times and will continue to do so this one not so much some very odd choices with characters and pacing,2024-03-02 06:17:16
tell me you haven’t read the book without telling me you haven’t read the book,2024-03-01 04:47:21
"the nuclear weapons weren’t really used to resolve anything it large the initial attack but didn’t cripple them then it was used to threaten the great houses but wasn’t used 

it did come out of nowhere but wasn’t super important",2024-03-01 05:52:17
just want to point out a great villain doesnt need to be multidimensional whatsoever to be good the villain was lacking because his death felt premature not because he was one dimensional,2024-03-01 07:05:47
"oh yes felt a bit like it was edited by
michael bay  no time to breath and little character building it should have been two films the emperor was also a let down  didn’t seem threatening or menacing at all i still loved it overall and think it’s an amazing achievement but the first one was better",2024-03-01 11:56:00
he finally realises that he has no choice but to go south after sietch tabr got massacred by feyd which paul couldnt foresee  prevent with his limited prescience plus chani tells him that the survivors were refusing to go south without him,2024-03-03 13:05:52
"i was okay with it because i have read the books 

but i thought they should have extended that scene a little more and showed how he saw the writing on the wall and then show how his visions had fundamentally changed after he took the water 

i think it would’ve helped the nonreaders of the book understand more it was really my only gripe about the movie because it was such a fulcrum of the story and they zipped by it",2024-03-03 14:34:06
"i think so

i caught that its the scene where he fails to accept we faili die as the alternative to the holy war  because he was hoping the guerilla campaign would be enough and thats just fallen apart

but thats not set up completely clearly",2024-03-03 13:00:41
my prediction was that zendaya would be a weak link in 2 and that seems to be true her personal brand is bigger than her talent,2024-03-03 02:36:15
"i think it is more about the raw material chani isn’t that strong character in the book ofc it is 2024 and given zendaya’s star status they have to give her more agency however that agency isn’t materialistic to the story

the underlying problem being although chani is firmly against paul ascension into this half manufactured half inevitable godhood she really didn’t have an alternative to it they are hunted by the harkonnens they have to go south after that point of plot her rejection to paul feels more like throwing a tantrum all she could do is to yell at people but that feels really ineffective to say the least 

the character is written as really passionate independent and brave but she is left with a plot that her input is ultimately irrelevant",2024-03-01 06:40:20
quite the reverse  i thought she was fantastic here  and i know i’m not alone in that,2024-03-01 06:40:33
510 tbh bad acting too long probably a crazy budget that took away money from a smaller better development we need to demand better for the money we give these studios,2024-03-05 05:47:22
what a hilariously pretentious comment lol,2024-03-07 14:38:17
or maybe its just not stimulating to people who dont understand the story because if you think it was mostly flesh and sinew and no meat you completely missed the entire point,2024-03-04 17:04:22
"i think its because villeneuve cares more about landscapes and shot composition than his characters when the film is kinetic it is electrifying but the fremen scenes just drag endlessly and we are no closer to knowing anything about any of those characters than we were at the start of the film

chalamet is also just terribly miscast in this role he looks like a strong gust of wind would blow him over zendaya does not have the acting chops to do anything with chani  i spent the whole film imagining what florence pugh would have done with that role",2024-03-02 05:35:30
the movie doesn’t do a great job accentuating it but once jessica and paul take the water of life they have the memories of all their ancestors this knowledge fundamentally changes them and makes them think about the universe differently,2024-03-02 02:14:05
or feyd once he became emperor,2024-03-02 22:06:41
the problem with what you are saying is that your assuming that they are adapting the book well while i agree visually dune is very very good from a story telling perspective its definitely lackingtakes alot of liberties away from the book the second movie had alot of wasted moments where i feel like the studio pressured the director to cut out large parts of the movie to save on time,2024-03-02 21:29:19
yeah i disagree heavily he makes a lot of changes from the book to show even more so that paul is not a savior especially chani,2024-03-03 02:21:09
"one of frank herberts issues with the reaction to the book was that enough people mistook the message so he ended up writing dune messiah as a follow up to really drive it home

the movie i think made things a lot more on the nose than they came off in the book and in comparison to previous adaptions especially the 1984 lynch movie where paul is for all intents and purposes the savior i would hope people would get what the message is",2024-03-03 02:58:55
i just saw pauls ascension as being both terrifying and his becoming a savior i dont know why one has to exclude the other particularly when the first two acts of the film hammer home the notion that his taking power will lead to great death and a holy war but he also delivers the fremen out of the desert like moses,2024-03-03 04:35:37
the third act is so rushed that i dont think the intended message lands very well,2024-03-03 03:12:15
yeah why wouldnt they chani clearly hammered this point and the movie ended on her face paul also spoke about it several times earlier in the movie,2024-03-03 06:45:27
the baron was very badly wounded by leto’s poison,2024-03-05 16:14:40
the gas attack by leto kinda  him up,2024-03-05 15:41:37
"in the movie nobody knows until paul takes the water of life this is a plot hole because when jessica takes the water of life she would have had access to her mothers memory but this isnt shown to the audience

in the book paul is already having prescient dreams at the start and he figures it out when theyre fleeing into the desert in the middle of the story",2024-03-22 01:24:07
she wanted paul to go south and ally with the other tribes but she didnt want him to declare himself the messiah and ruler of the fremen remember the bit at the beginning where she talked about all the fremen being equal and paul said hed like to be equal to her she respected paul as a fighter but since she didnt believe in the prophecy she accurately saw his claim of being the messiah as a manipulation of her people she wanted the fremen to rule themselves not submit to pauls rule when paul took power by declaring himself messiah and then emperor it made her question if he really had the fremens best interests at heart,2024-03-01 07:34:30
"she wants whats best for her people but within fremen ranks she even shows that she doesnt like the fanatics because their believes are based on lies the bene gesserate meddling starting thousands of years ago she knows if they go their route of winning freedom by giving power to the fanatics there will be repercussions

at the same time the harkonnens  suuuuck and shed rather see them toppled and give her people a better chance to live freely  she knows he can be a great leader but gets upset with the fanatics meddling and using their worm  to power him up fundamentally changing the guy shes grown to love

at the end though a final straw for her was seeing paul making the deal with the emperor for the princesss hand  paul claims to not be just a foreigner yet in that moment he still prioritizes a foreign custom of marrying another royal family to gain power  she doesnt give a  about royal houses and all that  so she takes it up on herself to walk out to make a statement

paul can see all now though so her told her those sweet little nothings before hand as a way to help patch things up with her down the road",2024-03-01 09:08:50
she has always been a voice against paul being the lisan al gaib she understands paul’s struggles for going south but also knows that he has to go she turned more when he said he was going to bomb the spice fields bc it became clear that he was not going to respect the land,2024-03-01 05:56:34
i’m the books they call it a jihad but that wouldn’t go down well with today’s audience,2024-03-01 07:00:37
lea seadeoux is the hot french woman in every franchise,2024-03-02 00:14:01
ask stellan how he felt lol,2024-03-26 19:16:04
 i kind of feel the same might feel differently on rewatch definitely “felt” epic but didn’t care for the characters we were i guess supposed to really care about chani but she’s just not a captivating actress on screen ,2024-03-09 05:54:30
exactly how i felt to a t,2024-03-06 02:07:45
clearly your father was a weak man,2024-03-06 07:31:21
"the dune universe is clearly not for you then

you found it boring we all get that but why spam every comment on how much you didnt like it rather than move on

its not like you are changing anyones opinions or the box office of the film by spreading negativity those who love it have already seen it some even multiple times",2024-03-06 04:23:40
exactly how i felt impressive film but so boring at the same time i really hoped i’d like it but i just couldn’t keep my eyes open…,2024-03-20 03:37:24
im sorry to hear that,2024-03-06 11:46:32
"in the mid70s there was an attempt to make an art housestyle dune movie with dark psychedelic visuals hr giger did lots of the storyboards but the movie didnt happen some of those elements made it into alien and the 1984 dune movie and dv included them as a nod to that history

for more background on the the first failed dune movie check out the documentary jodorowskys dune",2024-03-03 05:28:03
i liked feyd and butler’s performance but i do think he was overhyped mainly because he’s barely in the film when he was on screen he was awesome and i liked the design but he only shows up a few times,2024-03-03 11:31:13
 the hype for this movie has convinced me the masses no longer understand what a good movie is ,2024-03-05 05:41:27
"this is an insane opinion to call this movie boring and slow you literally have to have a brain that’s rotten beyond repair from tiktok and short form instant gratification content 

this movie is not slow in the slightest the first one maybe but this movie was so densely packed and if anything rushed through some things too fast",2024-03-03 14:57:38
"as someone who greatly enjoyed part 2 and thought the movie was great i also feel people are blowing the praise slightly out of water 


like it was a good movie and i enjoyed the themes the movie covered but people talk about it like its the second coming of jesus actually funny considering the subject matter",2024-03-03 07:08:04
the story isn’t about how paul overcomes the antagonists it’s about how paul becomes the antagonist,2024-03-03 13:26:42
i just started the first book and feyd shows up very early in the book you can get a sense of how kooky he is pretty early butler portrayed how the book describes him pretty dang well ,2024-03-06 00:30:55
youre correct about everything except 5 it was the same scene over and over i couldnt tell you the difference between the first time they fought in the desert and the 8th time they had ambushed the other side ,2024-03-05 05:59:33
" there was no reason to make changes like this

i can think of a few reasons for those changes namely to give chani something to do more interesting than being pauls adoring housewife as for jessica she kinda recedes in the background in the second half of the book and this gives her a bit more agency

 this film seemed to have missed the point of the books

did it frank herbert 1985

 dune was aimed at this whole idea of the infallible leader because my view of history says that mistakes made by a leader or made in a leaders name are amplified by the numbers who follow without question

i dont think the movie missed the point of the books at all if anything its made clearer in the movie than it is in the books",2024-03-01 21:55:44
"to address one particular bit i think the idea of stilgar being affable friendly wholesomeseeming and even comedic while engaged in this religious rhetoric isnt some kind of tonal miss its to show the different sides of this kind of belief 

ultimately this is a character who goes from being pauls mentor to his closest friend and advisor to his most loyal right hand servant in warfare and violence on a massive scale he truly believes in paul hes filled with real positive emotion

send them to paradise how does stilgar react with the biggest smile of his life as he prepares to set off on a galactic jihad that kills billions i really hope we get the genghis khan and  conversation in the third movie feels like something denis would skip for his distaste for heavy dialogue but its so interesting",2024-03-01 22:20:39
"its treating its audience as  and does not need to do so

bruh there are people idolising tyler durden eren yeagar tony soprano walter white don draper logan roy  countless other such heavily problematic characters even today

heck some people who had read the first dune novel alone had mistaken it for yet another white saviourchosen one story too as opposed to a deconstruction of those tropes

so i absolutely dont blame denis for deciding to make the films themes more evident  emphasising more on whichever traits  actions of these characters served those themes better the visual medium doesnt have the luxury of pages of internal monologue to clarify such things after all

as for chani you do realise that herberts writing of this love interest in the 60s is definitely dated today right chani being given some actual agency  a personality that functioned as an ideological foil to paul  jessica made her way more interesting than the nth scifi native culture girlfriend",2024-03-01 20:57:52
if the actors are screaming thats due to the writing or direction not the acting,2024-03-01 20:40:25
i agree with your point on chalamet’s performance i never really bought into him as paul literally everything else in the film is pretty  perfect in my eyes,2024-03-01 20:55:18
in the book its 3 years here it has to be 78 months assuming they did the change because of his sister in the book wouldnt work on screen ,2024-03-01 07:41:14
"she was going to be as important or at least close to the reclamation of arakkis

i dont think she was set up to be specifically important to the reclamation of arrakis just for pauls future which she was heck she was also representative of the nonbelievers among the fremen so when he went about gaining her love  trust he also ended up being trusted  loved by the erstwhile nonbelievers as well

not to mention the part where she was literally the one who confirmed the prophecy to everyone beyond a doubt by being the one  or at least appearing to be the one  who made paul wake up from his coma after he drank the water of live via her desert spring tears  this was the last step to him gaining control as the messiah of all fremen after all",2024-03-01 07:21:00
"i think the confusion is

1 they end up switching knives
2 paul gets stabbed by his own knife
3 feyd stabs paul with feyds knife and reveal is that paul pulled knife out of his gut and has stabbed feyd with it    ",2024-03-01 13:44:06
i think 3 total stabs happened between the two characters,2024-03-01 13:43:45
imax 70mm is only happening at 13 theaters worldwide iirc just watched it last night in that format and it was a great time stick to your guns and maybe catch a second viewing in dolby later when you have funds,2024-03-01 16:50:28
i would do imax you’re very lucky to have the opportunity and this is probably one of the best possible showcases for it,2024-03-01 19:50:13
"spice turns peoples eyes blue all fremens eyes are blue due to prolonged spice exposure pauls eyes turning blue were to signify that he had spent enough time in the desert and inherent spice exposure due to being there the only standout is jessicas eyes turned instantly blue due to the water of life

a lot of characters in dune are morally grey in this movie they definitely leaned into the manipulative side of jessicas personality and the bene gesserit plots",2024-03-01 22:09:29
theyre going to go from world to world and bring each one under pauls rule,2024-03-01 22:19:57
they announced her officially during the movie’s premiere,2024-03-01 22:32:08
i wonder how much she got money for like 12 seconds of showing face and whispering for like 20 seconds,2024-03-01 22:43:22
he was a bit tougher in the books but very dumb  he basically gets used by the baron to make feyd look good,2024-03-02 03:52:48
any imax you can find you need a big  screen and the best sound you can get the sound design is even better than the first one,2024-03-02 04:07:42
it was amazing in imax particularly the sound haven’t seen it in a regular theater to compare though,2024-03-02 04:02:30
i believe their planets sun only emits infrared so denis shot the whole sequence in infrared thats why the bene gesserit womens outfits went from black to white as they went from the artificially lit interior to the open arena under the infrared sun,2024-03-02 03:57:02
that was the color of their sun idk if you noticed but some characters are in color and once they step outside they become black and white,2024-03-02 03:56:39
pauls worm split off on his own to drink the water of life chani arrived when she realized what was happened,2024-03-02 18:58:44
"she wanted the house to fall but wanted the bloodline they worked so hard and got so far making to survive 

she wanted paul alive and knew paul needed his mom

she just assumed theyd find a smuggler off the planet and go into exile not join up with the crazy tribal populace and become their leader it glorious jihad",2024-03-02 23:59:26
"to not  paul and his mother

probably cos she knew they were also harkonnen",2024-03-02 23:22:18
"in the book you come to find out he escaped the ambush with a number of men  they try to survive in the desert and end up falling in with a bunch of spice smugglers his fighting ability and leadership allows him to quickly ascend their ranks 

in the book paul receives word from his fremen spies that they spotted a smuggler that was still carrying atreides markings paul suspects it might be gurney and sets up a spice trap in the desert they capture the smugglers and then paul reveals himself

in the movie it made it seem like it was total chance but it wasn’t like that",2024-03-03 01:13:34
"did paul get stabbed on purpose to trap feyds knives on his body

yup paul redirected the stab to a nonlethal part his right chest i think it was and used that as a distraction to go for the killing stab 

wish that part was a little clearer but its a nice thing to look out for in your rewatch",2024-03-03 15:13:10
"remember the fight paul and gurney had while training in the first movie i have you you would have joined me in death paul is the superior fighter so it wasnt that feyd was intentionally going for nonlethal attacks he was giving his all being prescient now paul knows feyds arrogance and uses the move he learned from gurney to lull him and deliver the killing blow himself 

thats my take at least",2024-03-03 18:50:26
you are supposed to understand the seductive allure of paul while realizing paul is a bad thing,2024-03-04 00:48:21
exactly paul is not even sure if he likes paul by the end of the first book,2024-03-04 00:32:33
paul never wanted the mantle of leadership but kept getting  into it he’s more of a tragic figure than a hero or villain,2024-03-04 01:38:04
"one of the big things with dune is there isn’t really any traditional “good guys” 

think of it like how america and britain are portrayed to be the “good guys” geopolitically but in reality there are no good guys in that realm",2024-03-04 01:26:11
yes,2024-03-04 00:42:34
yes,2024-03-04 01:08:19
so frank herbert wrote the 2nd book dune messiah to really cement that paul is not a herosavior in my opinion fh didnt intend for people to hate or like him after the events of dune messiah i pity paul but i dont necessarily like him i think this movie ended the way it did so that people kind of hate paul so that hes not seen as a hero,2024-03-04 00:38:44
yes one of the main themes of the book series is to beware of your heroes in the end paul is not a good man he spreads death and misery across the galaxy,2024-03-04 06:09:54
it stops at the train station for everyone to get on or off,2024-03-04 02:32:58
chani’s attitude there is a major change from the books however it’s my belief that she’s now pregnant with either leto ii or the twins,2024-03-04 02:46:33
"bautistas character beast rabban was actually greatly expanded on from the novel hah  
  
but yeah the entire point of his character is basically to rage and be violent and make feyd look good by comparison because feyd can actually be intelligent and fake being nice if needed",2024-03-04 10:35:19
it isnt explained in the movies yet but there was a war fought against ai and thus they have advanced tech but not digital or ai assisted its all been eradictated,2024-03-04 14:45:47
chani is rightfully mad because hes using her people for his own power and goals,2024-03-04 22:32:52
the still suits filter and recycle all body fluids  is obviously at the very top of that list,2024-03-05 06:44:52
yep this is explicit in the book and the 80s movie,2024-03-05 04:35:21
"the voice made her do it she was actually happy that paul was alive but hated to be part of the process

not sure what you mean about the stronger voice at the end",2024-03-05 10:22:56
"he uses two things from the first movie  
  
he took gurneys youd have joined me in death move from the sparring session and flipped it around on feyd  
  
he applied the lesson from the gom jabbar an animal caught in a trap will gnaw off their own leg to escape while the human will endure the pain to draw in whoever set up the trap and  them paul takes a couple of nondeadly hits from feyd endures the pain to draw him in close and kills him",2024-03-07 08:35:04
" can someone explain what happened at the end with the knife fight i could have sworn that paul was stabbed in the chest but he later removes the knife from his shoulder

you’re confusing two knives paul gets stabbed close to his chest but nonlethally by his own knife and then directs feyd’s knife into his shoulder while he kills feyd so he pulls feyd’s knife from his shoulder",2024-03-08 01:58:08
"while i agree it’s disrespectful i thinks it’s more than that

i believe jamie says this to paul in the first movie and paul repeats it as a response to not knowing how to respond they are both m a foreigner saying “hello” back despite not knowing a word of english

the interesting parallel is that both feyd and paul are aligned to become the messiah and the outcome of the fight shows how wrong feyd would of been to adopting the freman culture cementing even more that paul really is the one",2024-03-09 00:12:35
i depends on your perspective that phrase is a fremen battle cry before a duel to the death because they fight with crysknives which are made from the teeth of sandworms these knives have a tendency to break during a battle which pretty much means death for the wielder since feyd doesnt use a crysknife hes probably genuinely hoping for pauls knife to break against his regular one om the book paul kills feyd with his own knife so its whatever,2024-03-09 05:50:44
there was something about the way he said it that made it seem like he was mocking the saying itself like a yeah yeah lets just get on with it and do away with the formalities,2024-03-08 18:22:51
"pretty sure they needed someone to hold off the advancing forces so that they could get to where they needed to go  

a single fremen is a fierce warrior including the women and children they’re strong and capable enough to take out even the most trained fighters even when outnumbered they communicate their fierceness even more in the book ",2024-03-09 23:31:57
she was referred to as a spy its possible she was hiding but got found,2024-03-10 05:49:37
its revealed in part one,2024-03-10 04:06:36
desert power,2024-03-11 07:00:50
pretty sure villeneuve said he won’t do a director’s cut won’t even release deleted scenes,2024-03-10 23:42:06
"lets be honest this tightly packed movie did not to show such a process lol  i just have faith that the fremen are absolute masters at their culture they definitely dont get on the sandworm as roughly as pauls first try so they did a good job leaving it to our imagination


but someone should get illustrations going asap ",2024-03-12 05:38:26
carefully,2024-03-12 04:59:33
"1 its not really explained and i dont remember what happens to the rest of gurneys men in the book the dialogue in the movie is a little clumsy because hes working with spice smugglers but also says they smuggled people offworld

2 they want to stay in the shadows they dont want to draw more attention to themselves

3 arrakis has probably been a desert planet for longer than the fremen have been there

4 this is a big plot point that the movie omits completely there isnt satellite surveillance on southern arrakisthe spacing guild is preventing it in exchange for massive spice bribes from the fremen thats the reason why the harkonnens so vastly underestimated the strength of the fremen",2024-03-15 04:48:59
it wasnt exactly power he was after it was revenge for his father he knew that taking this path would lead to the deadly holy war he saw in his vision but he took it anyway,2024-03-17 20:47:54
"thats the implication i think take the emperors ships board and take over the great house ships in orbit spread from there to crush all resistance the movie streamlined things alot with the ending by removing the spacing guild


in the book 


the spacing guild has a monopoly on space travel theyre the ones paul threatens with destroying the spice which would also destroy the empire so the spacing guild bows to paul which forces the great houses to as well the holy war is the fremen unleashing their religious fervor on the galaxy with the spacing guilds submission the fremen are free to use guild ships to go out and eradicate any religion that opposes their beliefs",2024-03-21 13:40:43
it did thats part of why he stopped spending time with her,2024-03-27 16:09:29
he learned it from his mother and the fremen it wasnt a big secret where and how to get the water of life the issue was just that anyone not trained as a reverend mother would die in horrible agony from drinking it alot of the movies events were very rushed and compressed though so it makes sense to be confused on it in the book he lived with the fremen for around 3 years waging guerilla war before taking over the empire the water of life scene was a more drawn out event with paul being in a coma long enough for chani and jessica to constantly be guarding his body from fremen trying to treat him like a corpse,2024-03-30 03:59:02
"the movie is definitely cramped together and events run by too fast 


the harkonnen ancestry doesnt really become important until later on in the series for paul its more of a shock that the man he hates the most is actually his grandfather and reinforces his disdain for the bene gesserit and their scheming 


paul wanted to avoid going south because that would set him on the path of his visions and he wanted to avoid that at all cost as he said to chani early on the fremen should have their own destiny and be free of outsiders and their prophecies but when paul has to finally go south and drink the poison he fully sees what lies ahead and realizes he has to follow his visions in short he has to start the holy war and  billions in a bloody jihad but that future is much better than if he didnt follow his visions in which case humanity would decay and die out


the book definitely delves into everything more and isnt cramped so much like the movie is",2024-04-08 01:53:36
"i don’t think i’ve ever seen anyone interpret the fremen as ‘full of life’ 

they live on one of the cruelest most dangerous planets have been subjugated by colonialism for centuries and you thought they were a happy people

maybe dv did a bad job of imparting how miserable and dangerous arrakis is in the first movie it was one of my minor quibbles with the film when it released probably didn’t want to make the movie too dour",2024-03-02 15:37:13
pathetic that youre getting down voted for expressing a contrary but valid opinion this is the biggest reddit circle  movie since dark knight,2024-03-04 16:57:31
"no more insight  you got loads about the messiah character and religious elements 

you got to see more worlds  more characters with involvement",2024-03-04 11:02:36
wasnt there just one massive battle in dune 1,2024-03-04 08:07:56
i was honestly surprised that they managed to make their romance feel very real and almost sweet the book overall is very dry so i just never bought their relationship fully in it,2024-03-01 07:18:33
" stilgar being a comic relief i hated it so much i understand them trying to make it more approachable but flanderizing such a badass character was not it  
  
eh i understand the complaint but i think it was a great decision given how it was done  
  
ive seen it twice now and noticed both times that it started out with people laughing at his fanaticism and somewhat farfetched justifications but as the movie went on the delivery gets increasingly more serious and the audience stops laughing  
  
we go from a life is brianesque he denies it which makes it even more true to stilgar begging his messiah to  him just to respect tradition and eventually boarding a ship to go commit horrible atrocities in a holy war for his messiah eyes gleaming with joy the stark contrast works perfectly",2024-03-05 09:47:39
i liked stilgar in this because it first its funny and by the end its terrifying,2024-03-05 13:53:57
i feel like they did a fantastic job with stilgar slowly showing his descent from badass leader of the fremen to fanatic religious follower especially when paralleled with chani who gets more and more disgusted by it all,2024-03-05 16:53:24
i have not read the books either but i watched youtube things the emperor is like 75 but is supposed to look 35 so it was a choice to cast an old dude and make him old idk i liked him he did have this weak gravitas to him ,2024-03-05 07:59:27
felt like everyone on the main cast gave their all in this movie and walken kinda just mailed it in,2024-03-05 23:27:19
isn’t that the point though  the emperor isn’t a mighty man he’s just an old dude who has power because his father before him had power etc,2024-03-06 00:25:15
"yeah and honestly i dont think zendaya is a good enough actress and i think tc a bit of a miss compared to the first 

i preferred the first mone especially on the rewatch as it felt like we were building towards something epic",2024-03-07 03:02:15
sucks youre being downvoted neither are good actors people just have such low expectations,2024-03-04 18:57:20
jesus thank you every scene with them was so painful to watch didn’t help that zandaya isn’t great to look at ,2024-03-09 05:52:50
i disagree they may not have had the sensual connection they we’re used to seeing in movies but they appeared to have genuine affection for each other which seemed endearing to me,2024-03-01 03:12:19
yeah in the books he fights fighters one on one that are given a drug which amps them up and makes them pretty much mindless killing machine not lumbering easy targets,2024-03-01 04:22:17
"idk i didn’t get that at all feyd is shown to be a really good fighter not just fighting for sport that was the entire point of him fighting a non drugged atreides fighter remember the atreides are known to be very good fighters he bested one of them he also fought very well against paul in the final scene and although you expect paul to win or know he will win it was still suspenseful 

also plot wise he’s really important to motivating paul to go south which is what kickstarts he messiah ascension feyd starts bombing the sietches",2024-03-01 06:02:00
without reading the book i probably would have hated it actually just finishing it not long ago so i was able to pick up on a lot of little detail that definitely werent explained helped a ton i can understand why others will hate it ,2024-03-01 07:53:17
the film already feels a tad too long for me and you want three films for the first book lol,2024-03-01 10:21:35
"that’s just dune for you it follows the heroes journey plot outline to a t the emperor got bodied because of the delicate rock paper scissors combat ideology of blades shields and lasers the atomics wiped out the shield allowing the fremen laser weaponry to make quick work you see this earlier in the movie with them absolutely destroying the spice harvesters 

it was explained by duncan idaho in the first movie that the fremen are superior hand to hand combatants to the sardakuar gurney also states that 200 fremen combatants are enough to storm arrakeen and defeat the harkonnens",2024-03-02 09:41:54
"my friend is a huge zendaya fan and i just had to tell her “look fam she is a style icon and a beautiful woman but i havent and still dont understand what her appeal is as an alist actor in terms of talent and this film did nothing to help that fact” lol 

she told me to  and to watch euphoria then come back she did fine just like…not sensational",2024-03-06 05:48:57
honestly i chalk that up to the pacing the beginning moved very fast they clearly had a lot of ground to cover to the point where it was jarring at times i thought zendaya was fine but i wouldn’t say she was the reason why the romance didn’t land ,2024-03-06 06:41:15
so disappointing the chemistry is one thing but her technical skills were completely exposed here she was the weak link of every pivotal scene she was in,2024-03-06 01:59:21
zendaya was great best part of the film without her the film would not work,2024-03-06 04:22:57
i found the exposition to be really tight i dont know how you could call something bloat that was stuffed in when it was literally a 2 second line of dialogue in a 3 hour movie,2024-03-04 17:00:31
excellent analysis dont know any of this lore and i think i saw the dl dune on scifi channel once many years ago so i dont remember anything significant but comparing this movie to the first it just felt uninspired very big studio big budget no heart im astonished at the positive reception calling it a modern day lotr felt very marvelesque ,2024-03-05 05:31:56
not saying your opinions are invalid  but the source author never had much interest in battles or large scale combat dune is mostly about subterfuge political scheming and power struggles all the big battles happen in a flash and then the following chapters are dealing with the aftermath of the results,2024-03-01 23:56:49
i mean one of the central themes in the novels is how religion is used as a tool of statecraft,2024-03-02 01:22:53
it is part two of three basically the third movie is being planned,2024-03-02 05:49:19
"this felt like a part two of three

lol near the end i was thinking dont you  dare 3 part the first book

then like the book things just ramped up fast",2024-03-02 05:55:05
that’s my only question can they get the worms to stop so everyone can climb on or does everyone have to ninja jump on there all at once it seemed like they could control which direction the worms went so they definitely could steer,2024-03-03 06:18:41
" rabban a coward  
  
there is nothing in the first movie contradicting that  
  
 feyd is said to care about honor but fights drugged men in a coliseum  
  
he is the heir hes not allowed to put himself at any real risk he is obviously happy to be allowed to go allout against a real enemy for once though  
  
 and threatens vladimir claiming you tried to have me killed  
  
all part of the game  
  
 the emperor just shows up with his entire army which is strategically moronic  
  
part of that is hubris part if it is that they believed they would be safe behind the shield wall with an entire army of what they belived were the best soldiers in the known universe  
  
they did not expect paul would violate the cultural taboo on using nukes they did not know fremen actually ride sandworms and they did not know how strong the fremen were nor how many of them there was  
  
 then the great houses just show up with one call historically those calls go unanswered in the face of an emperor  
  
they just found out that the emperor had violated the balance of power agreement which their entire culture was based on once that box was open they all knew that any of them could be next if they happened to become too powerful so of course theyll show up  
  
 what about the sardaukar they made short work of them this movie but they were near unstoppable in the first movie  
  
the sardaukar are still powerful the fremen are better this is repeatedly shown and mentioned in the first movie as well  
  
 stilgar was a serious character in the first movie and a clown in this one  
  
he was honestly funny several times in both movies but the comic relief bit in this one was mainly to serve as a contrast and help highlight the corruption of paul and the fremen  
  
he starts out with some funny lines which the audience laugh at including the life of brian style he denies hes the messiah which makes him more the messiah paraphrasing but the delivery becomes increasingly serious as the movie progresses and no one is laughing by the time hes begging his messiah to  him just to follow tradition and eventually boarding a ship  eyes gleaming with joy  to go commit holy war atrocities in the name of the lisan algaib",2024-03-05 10:12:51
"i have not read the books either so we have a similar entry to the movies  

i think you made a great point about walken there was something i couldnt quite grasp that didnt work about his character and it was that he was out of place so many other characters were so adorned and altered that it was easy to believe that they were these galactic characters the emperors daughter with her headpieces the fremen with their nosepieces and the harkonnen with their monochrome existence then thereschristopher walken in a shiny robe",2024-03-02 05:17:46
im curious which parts stood out to you with regards to chalamets performance apart from the sequences where hes rallying the fremen to his war which were good most of his other scenes felt very much middle of the road not bad not standing out either,2024-03-02 07:30:56
" for example i thought austin butler’s character would play more of a role in the films by the way they were talking about him but basically died semi off screen

what does semi off screen mean he died on screen obviously",2024-03-04 23:28:52
"if that’s your thoughts then why discuss them taste is subjective 
you do you man",2024-03-02 04:34:47
wow youre basically reading my mind agree on every point,2024-03-03 22:52:53
"i think book readers shouldn’t go into these movie thinking every detail is gonna be kept in the movie or that it would be entirely consistent with the book in such a short time the makers of the movie will choose to tailor it towards movie watchers rather than book readers and they need to make it so that the watchers are able to keep up with what’s happening without confusing them and overwhelming them with an overload of information 

i do agree that the second half felt rush in some parts but it definitely feels like there  is more likely to be a director’s cut on the horizon it’s not a written rule but movies usually aren’t this long or even longer because then theaters won’t be able to make more profit if you cut the movie down to 1hr and 30 minutes rather than 3 hours then the people who want to profit from this can make double the money because they get to do twice the number of showings in theaters and that’s probably the root of all this profit so when we think about why this part is sped up or why that part is left out or not fleshed out or changed it’s probably because of the aforementioned restraints

edit also to have alia come into the picture now will risk the focus of this film which is entirely about paul ascending to this  like figure and his vengeance and i guess that is why they chose not to have alia be born because if so they’d have to write a four year old stabbing an old man and if that were to happen they’d have to develop alia even more in this same film which would take time away from the focus they want",2024-03-03 13:42:50
i believe the changes were made because denis couldnt make a movie with alia,2024-03-03 13:14:56
as a fan of the books i feel the same way i cant enjoy it as much as everyone else not because of the changes but bec of the very poor story telling i loved the first film and remember feeling like the book really coming to life i consider it one of the best ive seen but i cant say the same for the second movie,2024-03-05 05:36:04
youre tripping they had that celebration after his success in combat saving zendaya,2024-03-03 12:56:25
"i haven’t read the books yet but to me part 2 was so much better than part 1 the first one was amazing on a filmmaking level but i really didn’t connect with the story or the characters paul seems like just another timid good guy the harkonnen are stereotypical angry and  villains and it seems to build up to a very standard revenge story

part 2 completely changes that it expands and elevates all the characters and story elements paul’s shift in personality is perfectly executed and so enthralling to watch the new characters are all great and the story in general becomes so much more complex and interesting compared to part 1 add to that villeneuve’s amazing directing and filmmaking in general and dune part 2 is a definitive scifi film of this generation",2024-03-03 13:35:17
"felt the same sadly although i have not read the books the second half of the movie still felt stupidrushed at times and some of the character decisions felt forced to list my major grievances against the movie  

  
1 chani alone going against the flow of her entire tribe seems  at least make a rebelnonaligned group or something which she leads or is a part of  personally i think she should have been written to be supportive of paul maybe use another character to oppose paul

2 should have shown more of how drinking the blue liquid changed paul they hinted some things but they didnt lean enough into the horror aspect of it which i loved in the first part 

  
these are all i remember at the moment but i loved the first dune a lot more everything flowed more naturally in the first movie they should have pushed some content to the 3rd part of the movie in order to make drastic character changes more digestable to the viewers",2024-03-03 17:32:07

"all the warnings about not believing the spirits out in the desert i thought pauls spirits were appearing as the people he knew took me 10 minutes before realizing this wasnt a spirit induced hallucination 

zendaya arriving in a helicopter after paul drank the water of life also confused me when did she get a helicopter",2024-03-01 23:50:20
same it’s like a scene was cut there,2024-03-01 23:46:29
"my dad said the same thing when coming out and going through  the reason we came up with was perhaps it was to show just how easy of a task it actually was for paul 

stilgar gives him the speech about it being difficult but weve heard countless times that lisan al gaib will know their ways maybe anyway 

the editing was perhaps a little wonky on that part",2024-03-02 00:40:12
yeah the battle scene was a little short that said the battle takes place basically entirely offscreen in the book so the movie actually did expand it relative to the original maybe if theyd been willing to make a 3hour movie it could have been longer,2024-03-02 06:45:15
he always was going to be super op he’s a male descendant of the bene gesserit that’s why the reverend mother wanted him killed and the atreides bloodline snuffed out he would usurp the control they had over the universe,2024-03-02 09:52:35
he became the kwisatz haderach,2024-03-02 10:13:31
"well he was lucky too to gain access to atomics that was before he was able to see future scenarios and pick the one he wanted

then again you could argue that even without brolins character showing up once he drank the water of life paul would simply find out the location of the atomics by seeing one of the futures where brolin shows them to him

that is how op his power is",2024-03-02 09:59:32
there was a 3 years time jump in the book they shortened it to 69 months in the movie,2024-03-02 14:12:43
"i havent read the books but i believe the emperor and the houses go there at the request of the spacing guild because they know paul has the ability to destroy spice production which would basically end their civilation as they know it remember that line about  he who can destroy a thing controls it

as far as the scroll goes guess thats one of those things you just gotta suspend your disbelief on",2024-03-03 00:07:38
"1 kwisatz haderach is a superbeing with immense prescience  bene gesserit abilities that the bg had been trying to create through eugenic programs over centuries so a product of science in a version of our universes distant future where spice exists  is discovered

lisn al gaib is just the chosen onemessiah of a fake prophecy that the bg had planted over centuries on arrakis they do similar manipulation of local religions on other planets as well to control the people there if ever such a need were to arise paul  jessica are essentially posing to the fremen that his science given kwisatz haderach abilities are actually because hes their lisn al gaib of prophecy paul  jessica refer to the fremens prophecy as fake multiple times in this movie itself 

pauls prescience aside him being able to ride the grandfather worm first try was just a coincidence chani is actually forced by jessica through the voice to give paul her tears to wake him up after his water of life coma  in order to make the desert spring tears part of the prophecy appear real jessicas use of the voice in this scene chani saying she didnt like her desert spring name earlier on  the reason now being revealed to be its association with the prophecy she hates are all changes from the book made specifically to emphasise how jessica is making the prophecy seem real to the fremen how paul actually wakes up is also told to the audience earlier on after jessicas water of life scene  transmuting the poison through bene gesserit training whether paul who has by this point embraced becoming the lisn al gaib was intentionally waiting to wake up until he recieved desert spring tears or if he had woke up exactly then by coincidence or just being exposed to water of life again  mixed with her tears  as in the book is unclear

in any case no  the kwisatz haderach isnt the same as lisn al gaib  one is a real planned result of science the other is a fake chosen one of fate that paul is just pretending to be

2 the ocean is only in a possible future it doesnt exist yet

3 no paul actually does see a possible future where seas  vegetation are developed on arrakis ecological transformation of the planet is a big theme here

4 paul only drinks the water of life after he goes south btw he goes south despite the terrible futures he had seen till then because sietch tabr got massacred by feyd he was upset that he couldnt foresee  prevent it through his currently limited prescience and because chani tells him that the survivors were refusing to go south themselves without him

5 yeah paul has an easier time with feyd in the book cos he could foresee pretty much all his exact moves but a onesided fight like that is what would have underwhelmed most other people as opposed to the more tense one with feyd seeming like a decent threat in the film also religious fanatics are just as ridiculous as stilgar is in the film even in real life",2024-03-03 09:04:22
the lisan al gaib is not the kwisatz haderach lag is a bene gesserit get out of fremen jail card a common tactic they have of spreading prophecies on planets where they think they might need to i dont know stage a rebellion or something it is just a propaganda tool to control a population the kh in contrast is the culmination of thousands of years of work to create a psychic that will finally something or other i dont think that the kwisatz haderach would have ever been meant to be a public figure but just a bene gesserit secret probably held safe in a bottle and taken out to do fortune telling or similar,2024-03-03 08:37:26
"1 already got answered very well by throawaypeko

2 its just a vision arrakis is a desert planet no water there cool visualsmemories of caladan thats all

3 not really he will do anything for fremen and most of what he does is for them to have better future thats like one of his primary motivations

4 he couldnt forsee feyd destroying tabr this scares him and he never wants to experience that again to not be able to predict the danger that could harm those closest to him to get proper vision of the future not just random fragments he needs to drink the water of life and thats what he does again one of his main motivations is for his friends and fremen to have good future 

5 in the book paul is basically a  after drinking the water of life he sees many futures sees a narrow path how to get the one where fremen and his friends prosper and then just follows it the fight in the book is then just paul following a script basically he knows exactly what feyd is gonna do in every moment that would be kinda boring for the film so they made it a bit more entertaining",2024-03-03 09:16:14
thats probably against the rules of kanly the formal vendetta between great houses,2024-03-04 19:20:23
its a duel so theres rules of  honour and all that  if he was going to use his powers to make him  himself there would be no need for a duel i am curious though how powerful the voice is as someone who hasnt read the books i know in the first film they use it to wreck those people who had captured them,2024-03-04 18:56:47
because that would be lame fremen culture would want him to properly duel,2024-03-04 22:58:51
"theres a big deal made in the book of the fact that they cant use nukes against each other as the other great houses will take revenge mad style paul has to make a big point that he nuked the mountain not the harkonnens or the emperor

for real life radiation is a surprisingly small issue from nukes",2024-03-05 15:49:09
it isnt explained in the movies yet but there was a war fought against ai and thus they have advanced tech but its not digital or ai assisted its all been eradicated,2024-03-05 15:00:09
"there are explanations but if you really take a critical look at it it does kinda fall apart just accept it and dont think about it too much truthfully there are a lot of powerful stuff that they should theoretically have access to as an interstellar empire but the scope of the series dictates that such weapons would be too impossible to balance shields means you get cool sword fights and less guns mad theory ai war and resulting ai ban take out the complexities of trying to balance weapons that invalidate conventional armies

it all leaves a plausible explanation for why a single planets worth of freman are able to successfully combat the emperor and great houses and tell the plot they want to tell",2024-03-05 23:48:45
it didnt make any sense to me either took me right out of the movie,2024-03-06 02:18:23
feyds posse of  eating goth girls is an invention by villeneuve and not in the books knowing the harkonnens they were probably feyds property and were subject to extreme physical  and psychological abuse,2024-03-06 00:16:36
"fremen while adept at surviving and traversing the desert are not nomadic they live in mountain cave communities called sietches remember that big pool of water stilgar showed jessica that was the water basin of sietch tabr collective pooling of water in tribal sietch communities is how fremen survive on arrakis sietches are also where they make all their goods such as stillsuits and thumpers

the baron rigs the fight and leaves the prisoner undrugged to suprise the audience it appears the prisoner slipped through the cracks and is now attempting to  feyd who bravely defeats the enemy in fair combat and is seen as a strong hero of house harkonnen the book gets a little crazier with it since both feyd and the baron have a running theme of trying to assassinate eachother the baron ultimately doesnt care if feyd lives or dies either way he can play it to his favor politically ",2024-03-07 03:02:07

i mean we literally see them massacring a ton of fremen while bombing the areas they lived in and if you recall when feyd goes there that one fremen girl stayed behind and he literally told her he was gonna have his way with her and torture her as the only thing left for him was pleasure


you quite literally did not need to see him do or say anything else because its already heavily implied how much of a piece of  he is to me at least


i mean the fremen girl stayed behind likely out of pride and hes not even capable of giving her an honorable death but the quite literally the exact opposite of that",2024-03-11 15:38:28

"1st point it’s established in the first movie that the fremen are superior hand to hand combatants to the sardakuar they just lack leadership hence paul

2nd point i can’t recall if it’s explained in the movies but you’re right lasers are op as  but the shields nullify this and when you shoot a laser at a shield it’s implied bad things will happen ricochet and or atomic like reactions shields are weak to kinetic weaponry the rocket and blades pass through shielding it’s a weapon balance ideology akin to rockpaperscissors",2024-03-02 10:11:40
yea just saw it today agree with the pacing you mentioned but like you said probably had to cut hopefully a directors cut will be available as for some of the logic stuff will have to watch again but might be easily explained for me it was a 97 outta 10,2024-03-02 05:32:56

"yeah i agree i think the emperor would have worked better if he was visually intimidating but shown to be indecisive and easily manipulated

like the first movie starts with the herald of the change which gives a taste of the emperor’s power but this movie never features such spectacle—the emperor is upstaged by a messenger go all out require people to literally crawl to the throne have the room packed to the brim with sardukaur do something to show that this guy is the emperor of the universe

then edit some scenes a bit like when the emperor learns that paul is alive instead of having him walk away in silence instead have him get angry and proclaim a plan just to have the reverend mother come in and quickly convince him to pursue her plan

this shows the audience that the emperor is a paper tiger without the movie awkwardly telling us that the emperor is being controlled by the bene geseret",2024-03-02 02:01:59

" although the harkenens just randomly killing their minions constantly was cartoonishly bad directing  it had 0 impact by like the 5th time it happened weirdly amateurish well for denis to keep visiting 


that behavior seems to be in line with the type of people that they are and if thats how theyre portrayed in the books i dont see how thats something the director should be faulted for


 the emperor falling for the world’s dumbest trap was…insane why was your daughter and whole army or even you there  really sloppy writing where character motivations went out the door


he fell for the trap because they were all misinformed as far as they knew the whole planet only had about 50k fremen not literal millions of them who as it turns out are actually the best trained soldiers in the universe iirc not only did they not know about the atomic bombs or assumed they couldnt be used for whatever reason the usage of atomic arsenal is prohibited so never in a million years did the emperor or any of them expect to face such a ruthless first strike which disabled all of their defenses


as per the wikia


 atomics harbored a pronounced psychological and social stigma and were rarely used due to traumatic historical events their prohibition was enforced by the great convention which dictated that the offensive use of atomics is grounds for planetary annihilation


 the destruction of part of the shield wall by paul atreides just prior to the battle of arrakeen which led to the defeat of the forces of house harkonnen and the sardaukar and the the ascension of house atreides by using them on the shield wall and not directly on the opposition forces paul was able to circumvent the great convention paving the way for his ascension


as for why he brought his whole army we already know how he was jealousafraid of pauls father and his growing popularity it was just a pompous display of force i guess hes the emperor after all also hes dealing with the harkonnen whom he used to do his dirty business and im sure hes well aware of what kind of people they are who knows what theyd try to pull if he came around unprepared and they realized they could take advantage of it in some way",2024-03-09 11:05:13
" the emperor falling for the world’s dumbest trap was…insane

the bit where someone informs the emporer that the sandstorm will interfere with the shields and best to retreat to orbit  only for the emperor to ignore the advice seemed like a lousy plothole surely there could have been something wrote that made it believable


zendaya not having an accent was really bad should have dubbed her lines and fixed it post production",2024-03-10 06:05:15

but yeah it’s bringing televisual storytelling to film and it bothers me that both of denis dune films do it back to back i would argue against your inclusion of dead reckoning just because that felt more like an ending than either of the other examples as much as i liked across the spiderverse the incomplete nature of it was a big issue for me for 3 blockbusters to do it last year was unbelievable i can only assume infinity warendgame are to blame",2024-03-03 11:36:39

"no way man the time spent on the fremen was extremely rewarding  without expanding on them it really would have made the film seem old fashioned and out of touch just another dances with wolves or other white savior uses brutal savages to win narrative  it was actually kinda perfect to me how it humanized them in the book they basically become useful violent savages that paul just uses as a tool  

x200b

the point of dune is that chosen ones are bs it was propaganda laid down by the bene gesserit and paul falls into it anyway  stilgar becoming a zealotrous fool is part of that",2024-03-02 10:37:55
your 1 point is spot on im curious how non book readers view the importance of spice,2024-03-03 19:27:19
for the second point on chanis resistance maybe its because of her intimate relationship with paul she knows him a lot more than the other fremen still that seems more likely to have the opposite effect,2024-03-03 19:41:35
the absence of the guild killed me and they basically glossed over all interstellar travel it seemed like the harkonnens could just be wherever whenever i also love the designsfx challenge of simply putting a navigator on screen,2024-03-04 05:49:03
"for your second point i think most of the fremen from northern tribe descent like the ones chani is laughing with when jessica is doing the water of life ceremony dont believe in it but then the harkonnens bomb that main northern sietchtemple and so im assuming a lot of the northern non believer fremen die in that attack plus jessica was also converting people behind the scenes like how she has that speech to her unborn baby about conversion starting with the most vulnerable 

so i think its not that chani is the only skeptic but is the face of the nonbelievers and then a lot are killed in that one bombing i could be wrong though because the casualties on that fremen base was a bit unclear",2024-03-03 19:42:42
"i think to your first point they will come into play in part three 

they are vital to the war with the great houses and forcing that sense of order and fear upon them but given this movie was more about the harkonens and the emperor we dont really need the guild yet 

but from a movie perspective itd make more sense for him to find himself struggling in the third movie and then the guild are introduced in a more fleshed out manner sort of akin to geidi prime fleshing out the harkonens in part two",2024-03-03 19:40:25
" the fight in the book worked

no it was anticlimactic there too but i agree with you that i miss feyds hidden blade tricks as well as the way he cheats in the arena fight in the book like feyd has so few personality traits to begin with he cant afford to have any taken away from him",2024-03-04 01:23:30
from a visual and art perspective no from a story telling perspective it does it better,2024-03-02 21:44:52
yeah rabban was completely anticlimactic gurney oneshotting him was such a lackluster waste of having a weapons master get revenge for his men heres hoping nobody replies with that was the point,2024-03-01 22:49:20
the scene where rabban runs away from a physical fight with a 150lb boy was a bit much,2024-03-03 09:54:54
changing chanis character was critical as it allowed denis to introduce and explore themesideas from dune messiah into this book it gives the fremen more depth and gives the audience more to think about,2024-03-02 18:53:05
you’re not   i felt that when i watched but i chalked it up to having to move the story along  there were probably some difficult decisions on the cutting room floor,2024-03-01 08:59:58

"tldr  you should read the books  

 why again is spice so important  

space travel is dangerouscrazy etc warhammer 40k actually got a lot of their inspiration from dune long story short spice lets the navigators get through space without it no interstellar travel  

 and to that end how is paul gonna make dune a paradise while not giving up spice and thus crippling everyone i guess thats a big plot point for the next movie  

yessss read the books  

 if the other houses arent going to listen to him anyway why still marry the emperors daughter surely that would clear that problem from the table and he can go back to chani while also then killing all the emperors people for betraying his father and is he not also the harkkonen next in line with the 3 leaders gone and him the grandson maybe there are others in line i guess but he has claim to at least two houses  

movie slightly different than books read them  

 and to that end did all of the atreides go to dune

drinking the water of life is akin to gaining a third eye add onto that the fact that the harkonnen were growing increasingly cruel and desperate his hand was forced and he gave in in the book its a bit more explicit because his son not in the film is murdered by the harkonnen which is ultimately what leads him to commit,2024-03-04 03:36:23
feyd ratha firebombed sietch tabr and paul felt he was backed into a corner ,2024-03-04 02:08:45
paul wrestled with the idea to go south the whole movie but only after the harkonnens destroyed sietch tabr he knew the only way for the fremen cause to survive was to evacuate south  and he also knows the miunte he goes south theres no point in fighting the prophecy anymore because of how southern fremen already view him  its basically checkmate in his fight against his own prophecy  so once it happens he basically gives it and takes it to 100,2024-03-04 04:37:14
harkonnens were fighting dirty he had no choice at that point,2024-03-04 02:49:35
"if you think about it it’s a main character trait of paul going back to the first scenes of the first movie he doesn’t want to be a leader he keeps getting convinced by others and circumstances keep throwing him into that role

eventually he is backed into a corner where he has no more choices so he throws himself into the role  it brings him no joy",2024-03-04 01:30:45
there is a scene in the movie he was asking for advise and the advise is to drink it,2024-03-04 01:26:05

i dont like the exclusion of spacing guild as theyre the real power brokers of the imperium and not the emperor but thats my only disappointment paul getting their support through blackmail by holding spice trade hostage was crucial to his success,2024-03-04 13:30:39
well it did seem to radicalize and unite all the fremen to instantly kick their ,2024-03-05 05:24:24
"he might not have known about them in part 1 they say the harkonen massively underestimated how many fremen there were they were able to harvest spice well enough for almost a century so i guess they just never investigated further seems kinda dumb but then everyone seems kinda dumb in this universe i gather the justification is there was a war against ai at some point so theres no smart technology or maybe some hapless harkonen advisor suggested looking for the sietches and rabban bashed his head in because he was having a bad day

it was only with pauls guidance that the fremen actually managed to disrupt spice harvesting to a significant degree which motivated the harkonen to go on the offense",2024-03-06 00:00:35

believe it or not it is just as abrupt in the novel they actually changed a couple of things that wouldve arguably made it even more jarring to some people if they were kept in,2024-03-30 03:16:10
the big problem with adapting dune is that the novel really needs 3 parts in a movie format otherwise everything is way to cramped and rushed even so the movie actually drastically increased the amount of action compared to the novel herbert was never really interested in the action scenes he just wanted to describe the politics and culture of his universe ive seen people talk about how the movie ends right when the war is breaking out and how much they want to see the warfare in the next movie but the second book picks up after it is mostly over and plays out like a court political plot rather than a story of war,2024-03-29 17:44:34
"personally i think the short battle scene is just nice and is as impactful which accurately aligns with fremens skillful skirmishes and guerilla assaults i also feel that the abruptness of the attacks in the third act reminded me of one of the most successful ww2 strategies of all time  blitzkrieg  which is full of shock and awe elements  
  
i prefer this as opposed to draggy cgiladen battle scenes in mcu and other mcufied movies recently im getting tired of long draggy battles with unnecessary dialogues",2024-04-08 05:39:37

finally a sane comment in this sea of endless praise you hit many of the thoughts i had lingering after my viewing felt like bardem was the only real actor who got to bite into real acting your thoughts on feydratha i think apply not only to just him but every character in this universe were not shown enough and it leaves that feeling of something missing empty and generic it feels like the ikea version of dune a functional piece of furniture that lacks any real punch or flair also controversial but didnt think zimmers score was anything special or innovative,2024-03-03 22:48:40
"i’ve read a few criticisms of the movie that are completely valid and i agree with so i wouldn’t classify it as flawless and maybe literally not a “masterpiece” because of that

the problem is that its highs for me anyway are so far beyond anything i’ve seen before that any minor shortcomings are completely negated by the era defining experience it is in its totality it’s almost hard to grade because of this it’s not perfect but it’s a 1010 higher if it were possible compared to anything else",2024-03-07 01:20:16
" it doesnt quite land an emotional punch or have the same level of heart that some of the best of all time have

i do agree  on a good day  id call it a masterpiece but never an unqualified masterpiece  a masterpiece of science fiction  sure all day long

 i feel like denis pulled off the impossible of adapting this book into a movie that is accessible for everyone and does tell a legit fascinating story

exactly  another director could do something interesting im sure but to do any better you need more time  and that would be a mini series",2024-03-06 16:48:37

at least that’s what i saw",2024-03-07 22:09:04

"yeah idk but it seems like the water removes most of his personality and he becomes fully invested in making his visions reality 

i dont really get what the point of starting a holy way is but apparently the bene gesseret had to know this was going to happen 

they must have some kind of plan but man do their plans involve a lot of dying for hard to explain reasons 

i suppose with the fremen having more power in the system maybe they can up total spice production or something  getting control of that populace will end up costing the system so many lives though",2024-03-13 06:36:44
"also did we ever see the army from part one with the throat singer and the thousands of human sacrifices

they were with the harkonnens who annihilated house atreides in part one  also trying to hunt down paul jessica liet kynes etc later at the observatory

in part two they were the army accompanying the emperor to arrakis totally overwhelmed by the worms  fremen army guided by pauls prescience",2024-03-03 09:09:04
its not about the war its about pauls rise to power using the bene gesserit propaganda as well as how paul and jessicas psychological transformation from the spice change the movie actually has way more scenes regarding the war than the book,2024-03-06 15:04:00
have you read the book it’s the same way and the holy war is skipped over as an exposition dump,2024-03-06 14:49:14
the spacing guild missing in particular is unforgivable to me  it isnt like they have to take up much screen time  plus they had the best costumes in the first part,2024-03-04 02:08:04
no the brown nosing fans are always the first to see and overreact same thing happened with part one once the more mature fans watch it youll see the true reviews,2024-03-03 13:29:26
its the same honestly a little bit more action more focus on paul and chani everyone else gets the same screen time as the first which is very little,2024-03-03 07:30:27

"  why change pauls plan for destroying the spice to setting off nukes above the deposits 

i agree with a lot of what you said but this makes perfect sense in a movie already relentlessly dense with weird settingspecific concepts i get why they dont want to go into the details of fictional ecology when they already have the nukes to explain ",2024-03-04 18:21:05
"i was wondering about the emperor too is it ever explained why he pulled the harkonens out only to sell them part of his army to take it right back or is that explained in the next one 

i definitely think the movie would have benefited from some political intrigue like the first one had if you had asked me to guess the plot before seeing it i probably would have hit every major beat in the movie 

also what is the deal with guns vs swords in this world i get you cant use the shield in the desert bc it draws worms but why are the harkonens walking around with swords still they just get sniped in the face its so dumb",2024-03-07 19:34:01

"jessica drinks the the water of life which is basically superduper concentrated spice that is poisonous to whomever consumes it but bene gesserit like jessica are trained to possess complete mastery over their bodies own chemistry and are able to transmute the poison those who survive this ordeal achieve access to the memories and personalities of their female ancestors but only the female ancestors the male line being a dark void and are known as reverend mothers during this ritual a reverend mother near death can also pass along her own genetic memories to another carrying on the line so jessica contains within her mind the personalities and memories of generations of reverend mothers before her as well as all of her own female ancestors

however because she underwent this ritual while pregnant her unborn daughter alia was awakened to full consciousness while still within the  and just like her mother also gained access the memories of her female ancestors and reverend mothers this is considered by the bene gesserit to be an abominable act since an unborn child does not have their own established persona to wrangle all of the other personalities living within their mind and keep them from taking control

in pauls case hes the kwisatz haderach the endgoal of a centuries long bene gesserit breeding experiment to produce a male who could access both the genetic memories of his female and male ancestors and when combined with his prescient abilities would essentially become omniscient a being able to see and perceive all across all of time and space this is what happens to paul when he drinks the water of life the bene gesserit intended to use this male as their instrument to guide humanity along an ideal path but he was born a generation early and thus out of their control",2024-03-02 02:33:48

"it can mean a few things but one of pauls promises is to terraform arrakis 

in the first movie the way he convinces kynes to help him is by saying if i become emperor id turn arrakis into a paradise

they value stability over everything else paul is an unknown to them and has already threatened to destroy all the spice which would be like someone threatening to destroy all the oil on our planet,2024-03-02 16:14:40
"one thing they cut from the movie is that in the book while the emperor and paul are having their argument over the spice fields the guild navigators in the room basically go “uh we’re gonna go with whichever option doesn’t completely destroy the production of the substance that runs our entire economy”

the other part of the equation that is “he who controls the spice controls the galaxy” is that the navigators who actually fly the ships by using the spice have more power than the emperor himself  by threatening the spice fields he has the navigators under his thumb  this has given him enough leverage to overthrow the emperor but it’s still an unstable situation because paul is doing it at gunpoint",2024-03-02 16:49:31

the other houses having not seen the power of the fremanpaul upclose under estimate them inherently just like the harkkonen and emporer before them because for centuries the native powers of the freman were viewed as week and uncultivatedunadvanced 


so major power vacuum plus refusing to bow before what they think is a weak force is what causes them to inherently not immediately accept their immediate rule without an up close show of force",2024-03-02 16:47:42

to add to 1 in the book paul is constantly aware of the path he is going down and is trying to avoid the jihad millions of deaths in his name at a certain point in both the book and the movie it gets to be more of a well its going to happen regardless of what i do so i might as well try to mitigate how bad its going to be,2024-03-03 05:58:17
"1 when paul becomes the kwaisatz haderach by drinking the water of life he can see all possible futures and the past lives of all of his ancestors in fact he can talk to all of his ancestors or at least their souls so instead of seeing just fragments of possible futures in his dreams full of death and ruin he sees what must be done to save all of humanity 
2 to install the atreides in power she believes in them they are basically the lawful good house in fact the events of the first book are really put into motion by her actions paul was never supposed to have been born bene gesserit can choose the gender of the child through their training and she was supposed to sire a girl the kwaisatz haderach was supposed to be a woman and therefore a bene gesserit the bene gesserit came to know this and advised the emperor to just exterminate the atreides",2024-03-03 05:47:19
"pauls mother lady jessica was actually the daughter of baron harkonnen the main villain of both films and the man who killed his father no one knew this because jessica was the result of bene gesserit messing with the bloodlines of royal houses and getting impregnated with female heirs they could control we saw another example of it when fenring seduced and got knocked up by feydrautha

this essentially means paul and his bloodline are part harkonnen and his maternal grandfather killed his father",2024-03-03 06:45:38

re 2—he sort of explains it but i get that the stakes aren’t quite clear what i got is that he’s choosing to be the lesser of two evils still a great evil but less so order through strength and all that either they all die and the galaxy goes to war anyway or he wins by being ruthless and the war happens billions die but it’s still less than what would have occurred had he not,2024-03-03 19:28:54
re 1 paul originally offered to stay behind to cover their escape but was talked out of it so i assume chanis friend ended up being the one to take that job feyd mentions she killed 9 harkonnen troops so i guess it was a duncanidaholaststand kind of situation that or she just really doesnt like the south lol,2024-03-03 20:02:03
drinking the water of life gives you limited sight into the future but it also gives you the memories of generations of ancestors and jessica isnt evil per se she is bene gesserit who have planned and plotted crossing great genetic lines for centuries to produce someone like paul who can drink the spice essence and survive and as such have the potential to extend the survival of the entire human race since he can now see into the future she is ensuring that her son realizes this potential which is something that has been planned for generations,2024-03-03 19:29:58
the water didn’t turn him evil per se but allowed him to see the future clearly such that his decisions in the present may seem questionable but are the only way through for the fremen to survive,2024-03-03 20:32:37
not the dark side but as he called it the narrow path where he and his side would survive and lead to a better future even as he said it would lead to many dead and having his fanatical legions unleashed into the universe,2024-03-03 19:52:36

i think it is there to show that the baron is still suffering long term effects from letos poison he kills the assistants for failing to cure him completely,2024-03-11 01:39:12
thats the wrong question  the right question is how do they get the luggage and the reverend mother off of a moving worm,2024-03-14 03:30:58
she does she really does its just that to protect him and alia she doesnt have much choice but to follow through with this plan,2024-03-27 16:10:25
i thought it was matt smith ,2024-04-06 07:41:06
what an interesting comparison what parallels were you seeing i love the iliad and never thought of this,2024-04-06 20:34:48
"they mention it briefly and with the announcement that the 3rd film is going to get made we might hear more about it it is quite possible they didnt like the way the cgi for it turned out in early iterations or just decided that it wasnt something they wanted to pursue  

with how its integrated into the fremans fighting style after paul ascends it was probably something that would be a pita to do the cgi for when theyve just established that theyre badass fighters through exposition  id still love to see it though same as you",2024-04-07 01:46:47
shes different from the book yes personally i think it worked quite well and zendaya pulled it off,2024-03-02 07:18:50
they rewrote the entire character arc she was supposed to be the supportive rock and knew the entire plan and all of pauls anguish about going south the plans for emp daughter and his own internal struggle her being angry and running away at the end was disrespectful to the original also his sister was suppose to be a full grown women and an assassin by the time emp arrived and she killed harkonanbaron,2024-03-02 07:14:45
"not sure how they will reconcile it but i think they needed to have chani in order to show that paul is ultimately the storys villain 

there would have been too much internal monologue without her",2024-03-02 17:13:46
i feel the same i liked it but the third act felt rushed,2024-03-03 02:25:16
it wasn’t a sequel it was the second half of one book it followed how the book was set up,2024-03-03 01:38:55
that was one of the themes that dv went for all the men you think were powerful and presented as kings were at the mercy of others bidding even paul,2024-03-02 18:45:32
he was given way more buildup and attention than the book in the grand scheme of things he’s a minor character,2024-03-02 23:35:35
yeah that didn’t establish him as a threat at all it was strange especially when he ran to uncle to complain,2024-03-02 23:02:46
"honestly i agree with you in a lot of ways i otherwise love the first book and the dreamlike mystical quality it has but all the bene gesserit were so cool and powerful wannabedeep politiking kept hitting me like a brick wall and throwing off my groove every time it came up and it just gets worse as the books go on and herbert starts typing with one hand 

in comparison i really like how the dv films handle the bgs and i cant think of one change they made that i dont agree with to me paul killing the baron was very cathartic chani and feyd both felt more wellrounded and i really appreciate how they handled alia im not a fan of little kid with adult personality characters because it always feels like the author just didnt want to bother writing an actual little kid making her a literal fetus in the  talking to and through her mom actually helped sell me the weirdness that herbert intended",2024-03-09 07:04:06
"i think it could have been half an hour longer to be honest the pace in the second half is relentless but it does make for an epic action movie comparing it to 2 towers is fair the story remains incomplete 

however the story is fundamentally different than lotr lotr is good vs evil with a happy ending dune is sort of like morallygrey vs chaos it asks itself do ends justify the means and it doesnt really provide an answer 

youre not gonna get that crowning of aragon emotional payoff in dune",2024-03-03 17:53:15
same for me i thought the book was just ok as well to me blade runner 2049 and arrival is more my style,2024-03-08 00:02:12
yes better than melatonin asmr or rain sounds 1010 best movie to fall asleep to,2024-03-01 15:29:20
"yeah in the book things ramp up pretty fast going into that domination of a final battle 

but in the movie its hurt by a massive story rush forward before it making that fight seem rushed too

like in all that time we skipped in the movie that seems like it was canonically maybe a week tops his sister is supposed to be born and be like 3 before the final fight",2024-03-02 15:25:23
thats interesting because my showing had everyone in an awkward sort of silence as people got up and left it was pretty full too,2024-03-03 05:28:04
he survived by joining a band of spice smugglers and has been smuggling spice the entire time while waiting for a moment to exact revenge he was fighting anyone or anything that is an obstacle to his spice smuggling that includes fremen and harkkonnen,2024-03-04 08:12:14
yeah absolutely loved the film  but i was a bit confused by that scene,2024-03-04 11:03:41
metal gear solid please,2024-03-09 00:52:34
ironically george lucas got a lot of inspiration from dune lot of parallels between paul and anakin,2024-03-09 01:28:24
"no

plenty of people to do sw content we need good people working on less mainstream things like dune",2024-03-10 06:15:41
my dad and i actually thought that was bill skarsgard lolll he looked just like him,2024-03-10 03:30:34
oh he would have ate that role too you’re right but i think austin did amazing too so i’m ok with it ,2024-03-09 08:04:17
it was an amazing scene the difference drawn between pauls gom jabbar trial and feyd rauthas was striking one acted like a mother and the other like a seductress,2024-03-09 23:06:23
chani having a very clearly american accent totally took me out of it was she not able to act with an accent,2024-03-10 05:54:22
"counter the white savior narrative

this is the ironic side effect of removing the thing i think the movie misses the most from the book  ecology  the fremen of the book arent sitting around waiting for deliverance  they have their own goals and they already have their prophet  liet kynes   by stripping out the ecology of dune the fremen lose their purpose thus making paul their savior",2024-03-11 19:24:54
i suspect alia was just too weird to translate into a movie  once the decision was made not to include her the timing for pauls son doesnt work either,2024-03-11 18:52:24
choam directorates were mentioned in part 1,2024-03-11 23:53:47
the baron being her father isnt that important at the moment it really just illustrates the sort of breeding program the bene gesserit use and it explains why they wanted feyd and his dna,2024-03-27 16:13:08
"religious fervor is a massively emboldening force and it’s something that can unify swathes of people and inspire them into fanatical action there were always enough fremen to overthrow the outside governing forces on the planet but they never unified against their common enemy in any meaningful way until they had what they understood to be a literal  calling them to action i found that part of the movie to be pretty convincing

as for chani it’s funny you say that because irulan emperor’s daughter basically ends up becoming the alltime champ mvp of cucks paul marries her strictly for political expediency refuses to  her under any and all circumstance and keeps chani on the side as his true lover partner and mother of his children",2024-03-01 08:56:58
"im not saying youre wrong you probably arent i havent read the books

but thats just kind of something you have to live with regarding any cinematic adaptation of an epic novel they all have to leave some things out or alter others just to ensure it translates well to its new medium 

now i cant say if they made good or bad changes but changes are necessary thats all",2024-03-04 21:21:54
in the book he just tries to run arrakis does it badly then gets sabotaged to  even more so feyd can take over as governor of arrakis,2024-03-05 15:43:49
just the brutish enforcer character on the harkonnen side  to do grunt work rage react to stuff  have stuff explained to bautista played him well though,2024-03-05 15:16:12
its how he was written he exemplifies brute force and nothing else he lacks the cunning thats apparent in other harkonnen,2024-03-05 15:40:55
the book ends at the same place this does honestly the books ending is even more abrupt  it ends on the scene of paul becoming emperor and claiming irulan as his wife,2024-03-01 07:26:41
yeah i kind of prefer the first one as well since i felt this film was too rushed though this could be because i read the books though i have to rewatch the film again to be sure as i’ve enjoyed part 1 more on rewatches,2024-03-01 05:31:20
thats incorrect there is a mentat 55,2024-03-01 08:56:35
my understanding is that a lot of his visions manifest as jamis speaking to him,2024-03-01 13:48:42
all the geidi prime crowd scenes needed were some podracers ,2024-03-01 15:51:55
the sandworms are drawn and frenzied by shields but also shields can react catastrophically when hit by laser weapons i think mostly these are why shields arent on but there may be other reasons at times,2024-03-01 16:58:41
the shields attract worms,2024-03-01 16:59:32
yeah dudes shouted no shields laser hitting shield  mini nuke,2024-03-01 17:05:36
thanks for explaining,2024-03-01 17:08:57
" im still a little confused on whats the fake religion implanted by the bene gesserit and whats real


this obfuscation is somewhat the entire point in a thematic sense it goes to show how powerful the bene geserit are in religious manipulation so powerful that most dont know whats planted or not but it also plays into themes of religious fanaticism that is inherent in humans in the real world as well


i love it just like in the book you see stilgar slowly transform from a friend of paul to a worshipper",2024-03-02 16:40:55
"the bg did this universe wide they would plant the messiah story on each planet sometimes customizing it to the locals and their customs it was done only to give their sect potential safe passage if any of them would get stranded or imprisoned on these planets

so it wasn’t really an entire religion it was just a messiah story  just like on earth we didn’t have one messiah or messiah story we had many then people would form religions around these stories as people would present themselves as the possible ‘one’",2024-03-02 16:26:23
"it was created by the bene gesserit while they were already in full manipulation to be a seedling for further manipulation if needed

then paul just went and actually did it with jessica believing he could

as to the answer of whats fake and whats real i think the bene gesserit knew it was one day possible if the perfect specimen were in place but while they were trying to create the perfect specimen they wouldve never let them get into position unless as a last resort

the fremen were being manipulated with the religion but then it became so strong it was real and so real they would get their holy leader",2024-03-02 16:24:03
"its mostly real in the sense that the bene gesserit have been working for hundredsthousands of years to bring about the kwisatz haderach a male with unprecedented bene gesserit powers for all intents and purposes the one  they allude to this in the first movie the reverend mother talks about jessica disobeying  the bene gesserit wanted jessica to bear a girl but jessica switched the gender to male in utero jessica talks about how she probably did bring about the kwisatz haderach in paul and it comes to fruition

only female bene gesserit can survive the water of life but the kwisatz haderach was foretold to survive it as a male bene gesserit and obtain essentially unlimited powers of prescience

on the other hand the prophecy that the fremen believe in was put there  seeds were planted  by the bene gesserit in arrakis as part of the missionaria protectiva over centuries it was meant to help bene gesserit obtain safe passage among the locals in case they needed it on the oppressive planet  they allude to this in the first movie as well  kynes notices how paul wears his stillsuit and thinks he might be the prophecy etc

so paul really does have the powers and is the kwisatz haderach the fulfillment of bene gesserit prophecy  at the same time the story of the prophecy was planted within the fremen and the fremen fall prey to pauls ascendance",2024-03-02 18:18:12
paul and his mom are not good people,2024-03-03 00:51:41

if im not mistaken the entire dune trilogy was written before george lucas ever released star wars,2024-03-05 02:01:58
its literally spice wars,2024-03-04 23:01:10
i mean dune came first so star wars is like a cartoony version of dune,2024-03-05 06:30:05
yeah it felt like star wars for a new generation,2024-03-05 00:49:01
george lucas clearly stole some concepts from the book,2024-03-05 04:43:38
guns don’t really exist in the dune universe the fremen make use of blow guns which is what they attacked the harkonnen with at the start of the movie and you wouldn’t use lasers against them because friendly fire is a real thing and it would  to set off a nuke in the middle of a fight,2024-03-06 00:17:44
because that was just some  david lynch made up,2024-03-05 23:19:02
that was made up purely because a line paul says in the book goes “my name is a killing word” referring to how people  in his name,2024-03-06 22:03:19
"feyd is given the test and he presumably passes

paul passed because hes able to withstand the pain feyd does because he gets off on it

lady margot fenring reports that he loves pain  humiliation finds pleasure in them etc presumably both giving  receiving them  essentially that hes a  probably what she meant by him being sexually vulnerable as well",2024-03-06 19:15:33
wasnt the test on feyd just to see if it was worth carrying his bloodline paul was tested for a different reason,2024-03-07 00:25:13
"what is the importance of spice in the dune universe and not something like water


they say it in the first movie spice is the only known fuel for interstellar travel thats why the baron says he who controls the spice controls the universe water is plentiful just not on arrakis",2024-03-07 12:13:07
the very short answer to your first question from a very nonexpert on dune is that they need spice for space travel at least for great distances its a vital piece for the empire and i think it also prolongs life,2024-03-07 11:29:18
did you watch part 1,2024-03-07 12:36:54
"spice is a hallucinogenic drug that has three notable properties it prolongs human life it is extremely addictive to the extent that withdrawal from it can  you and when taken in large quantities by certain individuals allows for prescience

the spacing guild navigators are mutated human beings specifically engineered to consume massive amounts of spice which then grants them the ability to see across large stretches of space and time and therefore safely plot courses for their ships without the spice they cannot navigate and interstellar trade commerce and diplomacy would cease being possible leading to the collapse of interstellar civilization and the deaths of billions from spice withdrawal

so the spice must flow",2024-03-07 19:28:58
feyd did nothing wrong,2024-03-08 14:40:37
"shashikla friend of chani was left behind as a spy but she got caught

2 i dont know i think they just finally found it 

3he is a mentat and trained as a bene gesserit these are mind skills they practice since millenia due to not having computers the water intensified these skills i guess im not completely clear on this bookwise",2024-03-09 07:48:28
"2 the secret of arrakis is that the fremen exist in millions in the deep desert the south not the 10s of thousands most of the galaxy believed seiches nearer the northern territories were known and not secret

this map is from  the book it shows all the known seitches of the north the pole but anything to the south towards the equator is just marked the great flat aka desolate

",2024-03-09 14:33:35
within just the movie with no book context its explained that paul has to understand his past first to understand his future jessica reveals earlier in the movie that the water of life gives you the memories of many past lives once paul drinks the water of life he confirms that his visions are much clearer now previously in the movie they were vague like how he didnt recognize it was jessica in his starvation vision with his ability to clearly see the future he can now pick the exact path to make him emperor of which there is only one thats what hes referencing by a narrow way through hope this helps the book has a lot more details but the movie does stand on its own with its explanation,2024-03-09 20:34:32
paul couldnt foresee feyds massacre of sietch tabr with his limited prescience the water of life would open his mind and let him see all possible futures including the narrow path that let him win,2024-03-10 10:27:59
no that wasnt in the book the harkonnens in general are pretty different in the book but dv took a different tone i personally liked it,2024-03-09 20:32:20
there’s a point in the book where the baron does tell feyd to  a bunch of women in the harem house as feyd tried to  the baron but the baron still wanted him around ,2024-03-09 23:34:47
 baby jessica’s baby lol,2024-03-09 23:33:27
"also where the  did chani get a helicopter

from gurney or any of their raids on the harkonnen etc

in the books its clearly mentioned that the fremen buy stuff from smugglers by trading spice",2024-03-10 10:20:54
my one tiny complaint is that some of the edits were a bit off but i understand they have to cut a lot out to get the movie under 3 hours i bet there’s a scene where they show her getting into the chopper,2024-03-10 15:10:51
"i think it was just a device to get the audience to engage with the idea that paul is not the hero also it gave the fremen more depth to show that they don’t think like a monolith

i expect chani and paul to reconcile although i am excited to see what they do with the next movie as denis has shown that he’s not afraid to veer from the book",2024-03-10 04:11:34
i think paul at one point says she will come around so im guessing theyll reconcile later on,2024-03-10 04:44:00
"the movies pacing was really not much different than the books at the end for what it is worth

i think it had value personally as soon as he was revived after drinking the water of life he had clarity on what was to come for him there was no point of further anticipation or reflection",2024-03-14 22:59:51
i love imax because of how big it is but i never go lower that a certain point i really dont know how people watch it like this,2024-03-18 15:32:40
her character was only in the first book so itll be interesting to see if they bring her back in any role if the next book is adapted ,2024-03-23 22:49:34
in that instant paul saw how stilgar had been transformed from the fremen naib to a creature of the lisan algaib a receptacle for awe and obedience it was a lessening of the man and paul felt the ghostwind of the jihad in it i have seen a friend become a worshipper he thought excerpt from the end of the book they didnt change stilgar,2024-03-27 02:36:11
i have not read the books but i agree regarding stilgar he seemed very nuanced in the first film but he definitely became a follower far too easily for my liking felt rushed in that regard,2024-03-25 12:19:13
the love story between paul and chani just didn’t come through and it’s the one plot turn at the end that means anything i can’t blame chemistry they were never given the chance to express it,2024-03-25 01:33:54
"i actually liked the jessica turn gave her much more relevance to the story compared to the second half of the book and made her a lady macbeth figure 

stilgar i was mixed i did like his character in the book a lot more",2024-03-25 21:29:13
it was more of a battle than a war paul lured the emperor there by declaring himself duke of arrakis the emperor was expecting to squash a small rebellion but had no idea paul had amassed a large army by uniting all the fremen and had accessed his familys nukes the giant sandstorm and worms basically wiped out most of the emperors ground forces,2024-04-01 02:50:58
meanwhile ive seen it 5 times hahah its so interesting how a movie that almost everyone loved and is now one of my favourites can leave others totally unmoved art is weird man,2024-03-21 22:21:34
k,2024-03-05 08:37:56
"that’s the tragedy of his story in these parts

he didn’t want to become this but he was forced to by the bombing of the northern strongholds and the reason the northern strongholds were attacked were because of him and the freman attacking

he tried so hard to not go to the south but was basically forced to",2024-03-02 05:36:38
"thats the tragedy of the whole story  he didnt want to become what he did at the end  he knew it would happen and staying in the north was his way of resisting that  he is faced with the choice of either keeping his personal integrity and beliefs chani and inevitably dying along with the fremen and everybody he loves  or he accepts these powerful gifts represented by his powers and the atomic weapons  stilgar  his mother and gunny and not only saves everybody he cares about but gets justice for his father  from the moment he drinks the water of life he knows what  become and the jihad that will come with it 

the overarching narrative of dune as a whole is you shouldnt give absolutely power and faith to a single charismatic leader  denis tweaks it to make paul more sympathetic and resistant towards his inevitable rise to power

at that point of the movie where he drinks the blue water  he was completely lost  he was afraid to face the fanaticism that surrounded him and he is basically told by the spirit or whatever is lingering by jamis that he needs to see clearly

but doing that leads to the grim reality that he can see all possible paths and the only way for him to win is to sacrifice everything he is and has

he chose to win at any cost instead of dying

what i think is even more telling is that there were probably ways for him to have survived but he chose in the end to revenge his father and people  he chose to be paul instead of mauddib",2024-03-02 08:10:13
thats how youre supposed to feel paul is a morally ambiguous figure and i think the  movie did a good job of emphasizing that,2024-03-02 06:43:09
" but alia not being born and creeping everyone out was a real let down

unfilmable without being cheesy in my honest opinion",2024-03-03 01:59:04
" pauls decision to just immediately go to war

biggest problem with time compression in movies from books movie shows us a few months less than 9 since the child isnt born the same time period in the books is years which allows for the development and events to occur which eventually lead paul to his decision",2024-03-03 14:47:15
thats the problem with adapting the first dune novel content wise it works best in 3 parts but it would just lead to criticism that the first two movies would be way too boring and nothing happening which we already saw with part 1 in two parts you have way more action in part 2 but it leads to everything being rushed to fit the ending in,2024-03-04 03:14:22
i thought playing up the interpersonal conflicts was a very smart narrative choice to convey  information to the audience cinematically since we dont have the novels internal monologues by externalizing internal conflicts were able to get information without it feeling overly expository and learn characters thoughts without the dialogue feeling hamfisted,2024-03-05 04:17:49
the time crunch became mandatory once they decided how they were doing alia which was probably the right choice,2024-03-05 03:14:24
i have no idea how they’ll deal with the time span in the next film,2024-03-05 02:40:03
i would give all my earthly possessions and become dvs  for him to put as much love as he has given to dune as star wars,2024-03-01 23:28:29
ya that bit threw me off too i think we’re supposed to assume that chani voluntarily went to join paul and helped him pass the test the harvester scene comes later after he’s passed,2024-03-04 17:38:29
i believe that was just his training montage portion of the movie lol like that was just him becoming a fremmen they didnt have the time to showcase all of it in its detail the desert trip was just a task for him to prove himself,2024-03-04 21:27:33
because the point of that scene in terms of a movie sense was to start his romance with chani it didnt actually matter what happened that night because the montage of him slowly integrating his way into their culture implies that he passed didnt seem confusing to me at all,2024-03-04 23:01:56
"it’s to showcase a time jump 

all of this happened within about a 69 month period of time 

it’s different in the book tho something like 23 years instead",2024-03-04 18:08:21
"been a while since i read them  i think denis smoothed it out to a reasonable degree  but im seeing other comments new to dune saying it seemed kinda rushed in the last part  

i thought the movie did a good job though there is some streamlining to avoid a longer movie",2024-03-06 16:51:23
herbert wasnt very interested in battles or wars he almost always handles that stuff offbook so if thats what you are referring to then no they dont add any of that into the movie if anything there is even less,2024-03-06 18:23:40
are you serious,2024-03-08 14:09:47
yes that was very much a problem sequence they cut to the battle scene and i immediately wondered what the  happened thought he was going to have some kind of quest,2024-03-12 12:47:05
"i agree with you on 1 but as ive said when commenting on this issue i think rabban was always depicted as brawn over brains hes just a pushover with a lot of power because of his lineage and thats it i have no clue if hes different in the books but in the films thats how he seems to be portrayed so it doesnt come as a surprise to see him run with his tail tucked between his legs at the first sign of trouble or for him to be so quickly owned by gurney at the end it does feel super anticlimatic sure but i think thats the point in the first movie i recall rabban executing a lot of soldiers who really cant do  besides wait for their deaths he never came across as an actual intelligent capable fighter


 the emperor didn’t really feel menacing or powerful at all


i think thats the point hes just someone with too much power and influence whos growing more jealous and suspicious as he grows older hence the whole strike against the atreides as well


 important people being on the front lines all the time were lame whether gurley or paul


paul had to absolutely be on the frontlines and prove himself at each and every turn if he wanted the fremen to see him for who he really was that was absolutely essential to the story up until this point


 sardaukar being weak was lame but i read many comments it’s the same in the book the fremen and desert power is underestimated


its not that the sardaukar are weak as theres a lot of things to consider for one the baronemperor were lead to believe that there were only roughly 50k fremen i think thats the number in the whole entire planet of arrakis when in fact there were millions of them and as it turns out theyre an even greater force than the sardaukar themselves


the other thing is that they never expect for atomic warheads to be availableused by paulthe fremen as their usage is forbidden which is something that absolutely caught everyone off guard and destroyed their defenses which allowed a straight path for the unthinkable number of fremen to flow in along with the desert power that only they have tamed


with all of this in mind and who knows what else i could be forgetting its no surprise that things turned out the way they did",2024-03-13 14:32:00
"why was chani so upset at the end
i get it on an emotional level but if you look at it logically

youre asking us why a character is upset an emotional response  a reaction like that isnt governed by logic alone even in real life especially not in situations as extreme as what these young characters are going through having said that heres my take

paul seizing religiopolitical control over her people using the fake prophecy with the help of his eugenicsgiven powers is exactly what he had been promising chani for the entire film that he wouldnt do i dont want power im not the mahdi the mahdi should come from the fremen i just want to fight beside you i would like to be your equal etc  these are what paul used to tell chani so everything he does after taking the water of life was a total betrayal of all that

i agree that paul didnt have much choice except to seize power after sietch tabr was attacked  then postwater of life seeing how every other remaining possible future at that point led to their annihilation but paul had never told chani that this was the only narrow path to their survival only jessica was present when he explains this so according to herfrom her perspective  he really was going against everything he had promised her solely to gain power over her people for his personal revenge against the harkonnens  the emperor another instance of poor communication  selfcentredness on pauls part which made chani upset in the end was how  unlike in the books  he didnt explain to her that his marriage with irulan would be a purely strategic one talk about adding insult to injury

her entire culture as she knew it being changed into one of bloodthirsty religious fanaticism the man she once trusted  loved seemingly dishing out one major betrayal after another  who wouldnt be upset in her situation heck even if paul had tried to explain things  she would still have been rightfully angry imo because even the best case scenario at that point which is what happens in the rest of the film is all of her people getting turned into blind followers of this manipulative foreigner  going off to  billions across the galaxy  

 its even arguable that the more honorable way at that point was for the few million fremen plus paul to just fight as best as they could  ultimately die note how this is how the fremen usually think anyway  having so much water from their dead saved away but never drinking them even when dying of thirst etc


 if you want the liberation of the fremen then paul chose the only correct path 

also you seem to be under a misconception that the liberation of the fremen was pauls primary goal here think back to part one after house atreides got wiped out  paul  jessica speaking to liet kynes he had already seen visions the previous night of there being a huge risk of a horrifying galactic war being fought in his name and yet he says out loud that he plans to become the fremens fake messiah in order to use them for his revenge against the harkonnens  the emperor not one word was spoken by him about wanting to liberate the fremen 

even in the beginning of part two he tells jessica that they must convert the nonbelievers in order to disrupt spice production as the only way to reach the emperor  again no mention of liberating the fremen while he did eventually decide against this plan after getting to know  genuinely care for chani and the other fremen by then the events leading to jihad were already set into motion even accelerated by jessica such is the tragedy of this antihero 

but make no mistake there was once a choice mentioned in these films by which he could have led to a far better outcome for all parties involved instead of prioritising so much on his revenge his father didnt believe in it perhaps paul did because of the harkonnen in him he could have simply taken the l and escaped the planet using the smugglers instead which is what even jessica had suggested at the very end of part one this was surely the right thing to do after seeing how seeking revenge could lead to such a horrifying galaxy spanning holy war

 he didnt care about liberating the fremen at the time fremen themselves while somewhat oppressed   were still surviving relatively well against the dumb brute rabban remember it was pauls more frequent  severe attacks that led to rabban being replaced by feyd and sietch tabr getting attacked in the first place if paul hadnt joined the fremen to selfishly seek revenge despite the risk of holy war in the first place none of this would have happened

 the first film had begun with chains voiceover ending with the question who will our next oppressors be the damage that paul  his mother did to the fremen turning friends into followers sending them off to   die for him on other planets etc is arguably far worse than whatever rabban could have done the fremen arent liberated theyre just being ruled by another  lying foreigner now this is kinda an allegory for how western countries sometimes empower religious fundamentalists in the middle east for their own agendas usually oil under the guise of liberation islamic revolution of iran and certain events in afghanistan come to mind",2024-03-19 22:43:35
" 
 i get it on an emotional level but if you look at it logically what was paul supposed to do
  
well theres your answer they are in an emotionallyconnected relationship she loves him in these situations logic is often not part of the picture  
  
next time your so and you get in a fight try saying if you look at this logically and see how far that gets you haha",2024-03-24 07:45:36
i think she understands that he is no longer paul atreides he now has all memories and pain from the future and from the past and to reference some popular culture much like bran stark becoming the three eyed raven  he’s no longer brandon stark he’s so much more than that now and the same is true for paul the man who woke up and took control of the fremen is not the boy she fell in love with hes something different now,2024-03-19 21:47:51
" 1010 cinematography

brown and murky throughout no",2024-04-07 14:38:22
could you explain to me what pauls motives are what is paul trying to accomplish become a messiah free the freman use the spice change the planet to green its not clear to me after 4hrs of dune 1  2,2024-03-06 13:40:03
i found it incredibly boring,2024-03-06 01:59:59
did we watch the same movie,2024-03-01 08:10:31
i felt part one had more room to breathe and i liked that part two has more to get through and definitely picks the pace up a tad so yes you might like it more,2024-03-06 01:43:55
if you didnt like part 1 part 2 wont change your mind imo,2024-03-06 03:31:16
it’s much more action packed,2024-03-06 01:36:53
"its kind of the inverse pacing of the first movie

in part 1 it starts with exposition and some action then the next hourish is super slow and mostly worldbuilding then in the middle theres a few action scenes and a big battle and the plot mostly wraps itself up after the midpoint

in part 2 it starts with action settles down into exposition and character dialogue then some more action then settles down some more then hypes itself up at the end and kinda anti climatically resolves itself in one super rushed battle scene",2024-03-06 11:33:02
"no part 2 is very boring 

x200b

the world building also took me out of the film from time to time sometimes they could shoot each other sometimes they couldnt sometimes they had shields sometimes they didnt didnt make any sense to me and took me out of the movie not nearly as much as the movie just being so so boring",2024-03-06 01:59:37
" silly walks which were kinda goofy 

yes it is  the fremen walk is integral to how they survive the desert when everyone thought the most important planet in the universe was 99 uninhabitable so unfortunately it would be pretty hard to leave out  walk without rhythm  im like thats my secret im white i have no rythm

and it’s kinda boring to me how without exception every harkon is just a straight evil dude who loves being bad for badness sake the trope of “ill even  my subordinate” is so played out and happened like 6 times only with the harkons 

agree 100  i was looking forward to more baron and rabban  theres a whole subplot to barons schemes in part 2 of the book that they left out that shows his cunning and deviousness  instead its just killing your highest advisors because you cant implement a pip  it leaves them far less interesting  

 
  combat spins

again part of the difficulty is the book  part of the bg training is the weirding way which is this hyper control of the body that allows you to move with great speed think super ninjajedi  thats how jessica bests stilgar and paul bests jamis in the first movie totally outclassing them to the extent that stilgar says the boy is toying with jamis  bearing in mind jamis is a great fremen fighter and the fremen in general are better than the sadukar

so they kind of have to film this super fighting method that is already just kinda more space magic and spins are on the menu again",2024-03-06 15:56:11
" why didnt they use guns instead of knives

they do but only in a limited capacity  they have maula pistols that should poison darts  no it doesnt make sense that in the desert where they cant use shield so dont need to worry about the laser gunshield nuclear explosion reaction that everyone isnt running around with ak47s

just gotta go with the story on that point",2024-03-09 15:06:24
personal shields stop bullets and shooting one with a laser causes a nuclear explosion taking out the shooter as well  most fighting is therefore done with swords except in the deep desert  shields arent used as their vibrations attract worms,2024-03-09 09:51:40
do you think these movie could be our generations highlander 2,2024-04-05 04:28:20
i was also a bit disappointed at first with her reaction at the end but i think it isnt entirely paul marrying irulan its also recognizing that paul has become exactly what he kept telling her earlier in the film he would not,2024-03-03 02:43:38
"disagree wholeheartedly it’s a change from the book but a good change imo 

chani never wants to paul to seek the throne he promises to reject his role as “messiah” and just be a fighter but then he rises up and takes power and takes irulan’s hand in marriage 

chani is characterized as a skeptic of the prophecy and to see paul use it to take over the imperium and take another woman’s hand… her running away heartbroken is the only ending that makes sense and was perfect to me 

what denis did here was he made her a way more compelling character and utilized her to help nail home the point that paul’s victory is not a “good thing”",2024-03-03 01:59:02
i see what you are saying but say that scene happened and chani was straight away just like cool i get u bro with her characterisation leading up to that point the audience would just be  i dont think she was weak either i dont want to say her characterisation was better by any stretch but just different and in a way that still worked,2024-03-03 02:00:50
eh very few call him a villain in all seriousness though hes more often considered an antihero,2024-03-03 11:06:29
i think the idea that he is not the hero either,2024-03-03 11:06:53

what is a villain if not a person who does evil things knowing theyre evil to reach his personal goals,2024-03-03 15:10:21
they dont say melange they dont say landsraad they dont mention guild navigators theres a lot of book terminology that has still not come into play,2024-03-02 08:23:35
they explained the importance of spice at the beginning of part 1 scene where paul listens to the audiobooks about arrakis before he goes there,2024-03-02 08:11:30
that was all explained in dune part 1 no,2024-03-02 08:11:46
yeah i enjoyed the movie but i think they could’ve have done a better job explainingshowing how halting spice production is detrimental to the imperium it seemed like most of the fremen rebellion scenes were framed as harkonens losing troopspower,2024-03-02 16:38:58
even my baby started crying during the ending credits she wanted so much for the movie to continue,2024-03-02 20:45:13
over on rdune someone speculated that in the next movie paul will lead humanity on the golden path and become a shai hulud  emperor,2024-03-04 03:10:57
"that was intentionally done by denis

 “i think herbert wrote it as a warning against leaders that pretend to know what will happen who pretend to know the truth who might be lacking humility”

he believed the overall message of dune was that power corrupts and that pauls ascension to the throne would leave the galaxy worse off than it was beforehand",2024-03-04 01:48:38
did you not watch the movie the fremen are all about honor doing that would have been unhonourable and detrimental to their cause,2024-03-06 03:12:14

"i thought the same taking a man down with nothing but the sound of your voice would have been a way scarierrespectable tactic than the battle of the twinks 

he could have made them bow he would have gotten his way either way but without blood shed

what did you miss ,2024-03-10 02:25:36
if pacing was your issue with the first one this one is definitely faster and has more action however it is also even weirder than the first one so if you found that aspect of it offputting the new one may not be for you,2024-03-01 06:56:23
it’s definitely faster paced and more action driven than part one,2024-03-01 06:56:59
if you want the best sleep of your life yeah,2024-03-01 15:31:14
it wasnt in part one and she was his daughter through the bene gesserit mating program ,2024-03-01 07:11:01
chani to me was always the most dull character she serves only to be pauls help mate and you have no idea why paul is so obsessed with her so these changes are fine for me,2024-03-01 12:01:35
"thats one of those details that get lost in the bookmovie translation

the threat of someone having a shield up when you shoot a laser gun is so devastating that people dont even risk it",2024-03-01 13:07:39

"i don’t think the changes were that dramatic he changed chani and stilgar in order to incorporate more ideas from dune messiah into this book and give the fremen more depth

he delayed the birth of alia but you still get the feeling that something is wrong with that girl

he had paul  the baron instead making for a more satisfying ending

he focused more on the bene gesserit and set them up as the antagonist for the next movie 

all in all every change was for the better imo my only complaint is that certain scenes weren’t allowed to breathe in the second act and it could feel too rushed for some people but that’s the pitfall all fans knew would be likely",2024-03-03 23:21:12
a lot of the adaptation changes bring this section of the story more in line with messiah and make a transition into the storyline of messiah make more sense personally my hope is that messiah is adapted relatively faithfully into part 3 and then they stop not because i care about preserving faithfulness to the source material but because i believe books 3 are  lol,2024-03-04 00:51:43
"in addition to what lancemate already said theres also hubris  
  
they were sure the sardaukar were still the greatest fighters in the universe they were sure they were safe behind the shield wall  
  
they also had no idea that paul had access to the family atomics nor did they expect him to use them wasnt really expanded on in the movie but using them was a huge cultural and political taboo as any great house using atomics would previously have been instantly wiped out by the other great houses  
  
basically it would have normally been fine for him to come as a show of force and control but that plan did not account for a messiah figure who had united millions of zealous super soldiers while also being able to see the future  having no issue with firing nukes at them",2024-03-04 10:22:52
"they had no idea how many fremen there actually were millions came from the south which was thought to be inhospitable in the books this is explained as a conspiracy put in place by the spacing guild who have secret trade deals with the southern fremen for spice for their navigators

"the frenen have many of these large stockpiles of water it is their long term goal to use this water to transform arrakis 
i assume gurney’s smuggler contacts would be one way of getting a message off world
the frenen army have the advantage of being led by paul who is the kwisatz haderach and can see possible outcomes of different actions their superior fighting skills fanaticism and courage teamed with paul’s ability to see the best way forward is what makes them unstoppable ",2024-03-05 21:39:22
"the books really get into the ecology of the planet but basically there is enough water to have a thriving world but most of it is locked under the sands with enough water they could irrigate the land and with time change the climate the saraha desert wasn’t always a desert for example it became one when all the trees were cut down and there was nothing to trap the water it’s also not only water from the dead at least in the books they collect moisture from the air with wind traps  

secondly the fremen have contact with the spacing guild who control all interstellar travel the guild depends on spice and the fremen bribe them with spice to not allow satellites over arrakis to help them stay hidden that’s why there’s so little intel on the south of the planet anyway they could send a message that way or one of the many fremen in arrakeen could probably find a way ",2024-03-07 11:42:34

i’ve seen about 10 people say the exact same thing bill is a great actor and i hope he does more diverse projects to establish his acting range but austin butler is an academy nominated actor who has had worked on broadway with denzel and in a tarantino movie before he was cast for dune before elvis was even released the way i see it even if bill and austin competed for the part austin probably won that role",2024-03-06 18:25:34

"its a movie invention to give her more character shes not a religious believer as shown early in the movie and the faith of stilgar and the southern fremen rubs her wrong because she sees the prophecy as a way to keep fremen enslaved she falls in love with paul because hes of similar belief wanting fremen to free themselves and be better than their crippling traditions 


but when paul finally goes south and accepts the future he turns into everything she hates hes leading the fremen on a religious jihad and reinforcing their faith in prophecy and tradition sending the fremen out in the end is the last straw where she storms out in disgust at what the fremen are now 


he does mention earlier on that shell eventually come around when she sees that this was the only path forward and his visions of thr future have her at his side so its only temporary but shows that shes not onboard with all this religious fervor ",2024-03-04 00:23:03

that was my biggest worry and denis pulled it off he was even able to bring in themes from dune messiah and present them in this movie which he probably felt was important in case this was the last one ever made",2024-03-01 12:51:49

"theres no accounting for taste but the fremen when properly unleashed are galaxyconquering fanatics as paul is shaping them into that force it makes sense that rabban realizes hes way out of his depth in fighting against them because frankly he is

hes cruel and violent and while hes not cunning hes not really  or at least hes smart enough to notice hes losing badly in fact hes the only harkonnen in the movie who seems to be actually terrified of muaddib and proves to be rather right about that isnt he

anyway the power leveling of the fremen kind of requires that previously formidable obstacles become inconsequential nuisances sure a big fight between gurney and rabban might have been cool but just my personal opinion i thought it was pretty badass to show him just get punked maybe rabbans off his game from his loss in power and favor maybe gurney is just built different but i kind of liked how each of the harkonnens went down differently revealed to be not as strong as they thought desperately clinging to their ambitions and power when it would not save them and the most sadistic of the bunch goes down in honorable combat",2024-03-04 18:01:46

"other than the fremen going off to war the ending is quite different from the book

 the emperor genuinely liked leto and wouldnt have called him weak the reasons for attempting to end the atreides were 1 they were becoming too popular among the people and 2 leto was a cousin with male heirs while the emperor had none

 lady fenrings husband who is a master assassin declines to  paul hes a failed attempt at creating the kwisatz haderach and feels kinship with paul

 the other great houses that arrive at arrakis are the ones who do accept the transition of power the ones who dont show up are who the fremen go to war against

 chani is much more of a passive character in the book paul and jessica assure her at the end that she will be his wife in all but name chani in the movie is a device to show the audience that paul isnt a hero",2024-03-15 05:29:48

also i think its important to note that paul doesnt choose his path to save people from starvationdeath  those billions die because paul chooses the narrow path to victory he chooses his own life and the lives of people he loves at the cost of countless deathsat the hands of his fremen holy war",2024-03-28 15:38:04

yes i read it a couple years ago after the first film but i refreshed myself by reading the wikipedia summary before watching part 2 ended up loving it,2024-03-03 15:24:58
yes and honestly i think the movie doesnt explain a few things well enough particularly pauls transformation which i imagine seems weirdly abrupt if you didnt read the book,2024-03-04 01:36:42
yes i was kind of pleased by several of the changes the film made to the ending then again there was no way of telling if dune would have a sequel when it was first published,2024-03-03 08:50:09
"i didn’t read the books and am purely a movie watcher 

but my interpretation of the ending is that chani felt betrayed by paul and chose to go back to her desert life rather than help him wage his holy war like the rest of the fremen but if paul’s vision of the future is true her and paul will eventually reunite and things will be better again 

i think paul could’ve easily told her the future and all he foresaw so she would be less angry but it might  up the future he planned around he did warn her about not wanting to go south though despite her convincing him to so i guess she’s angry but at the same time she knows this and can’t really blame him entirely",2024-03-03 07:59:08

why would the great houses recognize his claim whats in it for them

irulan is a symbol that can help speed up his legitimization just because shes not a magic win button doesnt mean she has no value

why would leto leave the atomics on caladin when he moved himself his entire family and all of his forces to the far more valuable arrakis youre right that paul shouldnt be surprised theyre on planet but thats not the same thing as knowing where they are",2024-03-07 19:20:26
" also why would the emperor even travel to arrakis just to shame the baron seem awfully convenient for pauls sake  
  
why would he not  
  
he has the entire army of sardaukar at the time believed the be the greatest fighters in the known universe  
  
hes behind the shield wall which protects them from sandworms large vehicles etc  
  
he has no idea that paul has access to the family atomics nor that paul is willing to use them as that would be a huge violation of universal agreements and cultural dogma  
  
they had no idea that there were so many fremen that they were so united or that they could ride sandworms  
  
seems perfectly safe to just swoop in and bring peace",2024-03-07 23:34:45
i think if you are really invested in the minutia of the answers to these questions you will find them answered in the book also questions along the lines of “why would the emperor go there” show that the conceit of the characters in this honorroyalty imperial empire based world are simply not understood were the duke of all spice production to be sent an email informing him of his firing that would be cause enough to revolt against such a pathetic emperor,2024-03-07 20:23:21
"jessica used the voice on chani to force her into making the desert spring tears part of the fake prophecy appear true to the fremen

paul had already mentioned after jessicas water of life scene that it was possible to neutralise the poison through advanced bene gesserit techniques so him waking up exactly then is either a coincidence or a response to the drop of water of life mixed with chanis tear or because he was waiting on purpose until she did her part because by then paul had fully embraced becoming the fremens messiah

the prophecy itself can sound corny because its a centuries old religious thing not to mention fake propaganda there are cornier stories in actual religions irl just because theyre from so long ago after all",2024-03-08 13:44:51
i don’t think what chani did had an actual hand in reviving paul like lady jessica said he’s still alive but with low vital signs jessica forced chani to do the tear thing so it fits into the prophecy “desert spring tears”,2024-03-08 10:03:39

"she wanted paul to be a military leader but she didnt want him to be a religious leader because she didnt believe in the prophecy herself she felt accurately that him claiming to be the messiah was manipulative  that he was using religion to control her people in ways that went beyond just earning their trust with his fighting skills 

early in the film she talks about how all the fremen are equal to each other and he promises he wants to be equal to her declaring himself a messiah let alone emperor of the universe obviously goes against that 

more generally she thinks that the fremen should liberate themselves and that the fundamentalists are weakening themselves by counting on an external messiah to swoop in and save them since paul initially denies being the messiah she thinks theyre on the same page but after taking the water of life paul embraces his role as the messiah which makes her deeply uncomfortable she loves paul but hes not fremen so shes not sure hes actually acting in the fremens best interests by seizing power",2024-03-02 06:52:02

idk i know this is heresy in this sub but i still prefer watching movies at home i have a very nice setup that is not unattainable by any means by someone who lives alone and it easily rivals the 20 tickets and everything a theater can provide

the spice harvester was not a harkonnen one but an illegal independent operation i think thats why they gave the harkonnen ones that preposterous buglike appearance so we would notice the difference,2024-03-03 04:58:13
i thought it was because a lot of the fight scenes were set in the desert and its said in the movie that the hum of the shields attracts the sandworms,2024-03-03 05:58:25
shields merely  the sandworms who just eat you and your shield,2024-03-03 08:06:02
a fair question my headcannon is that shields are ubiquitous in the dune universe so most fighters specialize in melee combat some of the harkonnen troops notably do have rifles like the one who nearly shoots paul in the first fight of part 2 probably because theyve adapted their battle strategy to account for the unique conditions on arrakis the sardaukar are outworlders and have not adapted to fighting without shields which is why they only carry blades seems a little farfetched that the best fighting force in the universe wouldnt prepare for that but to me that can be explained by their own hubris at never having been defeated in battle overall it fits into the larger theme of the emperor underestimating paul and the fremen so i let it slide,2024-03-03 05:34:24
the green paradise is either a terraformed arrakis or other green worlds paul is starting a huge big terrible war,2024-03-03 06:07:26
"so when stilgar asks what he sees for arrakis paul says a green paradise because that is what stilgar wants to hear thats his dream a green arrakis with vegetation and good living conditions remember at the start where hes showing jessica the water reserves meant to one day green arrakis that was also the dream of kynes she mentions it in the first movie and really in depth in the book but that dream was put on hold once they discovered the spice

not to spoil much of the next part of the story paul does start that process of terraforming arrakis once he becomes emperor so its not an empty statement but at that time he is simply saying what he needs to say to have everyone proclaim him the lisan algaib

but at the end when he says send them to paradise he is literally saying to go beat the great houses into submission hes starting the holy war",2024-03-03 11:45:38

to gain prescience he has to to become muad dib and the kwisatz haderach all in one read up on the concepts of spice prescience and reverend mothers in the books to become a reverend mother a woman drinks the water of life its said that no man would survive it but paul being the kwisatz haderach is the exception to this rule he drinks the spice essence as a reverend mother would survives and can now see certain things in the future,2024-03-03 19:16:04

"power in the dune universe is a balancing act while there obviously is an emperor there is still a balancing act with the spacing guild monopoly on space travel bene gesserit and the great houses where power is shared 

paul doesnt just become the emperor he gains full control over the spacing guild as he ends up exerting full control over spice production he who can destroy controls a thing the guild not only needs the spice for space travel but the navigators are addicted to space without which they would not live additionally the bene gesserit also require spice to a lesser degree 

by gaining absolute control over interstellar travel and commerce you can imagine the great houses feel incredibly threatened with effectively all their power being removed 

also the use of atomics in the dune universe is a huge nono its established in the novel that if a house were to use atomics against another the offending house would be wiped out by the rest of the great houses while paul uses atomics against the shield wall and not people it wasnt a good look

there are also dozens of major religions in the universe and so the rise of a self proclaimed messiah as emperor is also problematic and pauls jihad ends up wiping out all other religions",2024-03-04 15:58:58

the kwisatz haderach is the prophesized male who could undergo the ritual  paul then unlocked the genetic memories of both the male and female family members  this combined with the spice and his training as a mentat human computer gave him millennia of data about human behavior and the ability to predict the future",2024-03-09 09:36:19

thing is no one expected or even deemed it possible for atomic warheads to be used because their usage is outlawed although they were used here in a loophole kind of way because they didnt target any actual humans directly which is what blindsided everyone and utterly destroyed their defenses


as for why he decided to bring all his troops hes the emperor its a show of force type of situation he knows all too well i hope the kind of person that the baron is no way hed show up without a mighty force to back him up but other than that yeah hes the emperor so such a formidable display should be normal especially in this case where he was literally called out by paul atreides",2024-03-13 14:41:02

 there are maula pistols which fire poison darts and are used alot on arrakis by the fremen who dont use shields but the fremen use hit and run tactics and benefited from the empire always underestimating their numbers and capabilities its just not worth the effort to ressurect an extinct technology that may not make a difference in hit and run attacks by the time the empire realizes how strong the fremen actually are the fremen control the empire and have free reign to wipe out anyone who opposed their religion ",2024-03-21 13:51:08

dont put your suspense on if paul will succeed its the same if worrying if harry potter will succeed in any of the movies the real suspense is pauls struggle to stay away from jihad and fall into interstellar violence eg he didnt want to be lisan al gaib he refused to go south but how he slowly inches towards the prophecy,2024-03-02 07:36:34

ill admit im a little underwhelmed but i do think i need a rewatch definitely an epic and i think the 3rd film has the potential to be an all time great,2024-03-25 12:18:06
" feyd rautha was a bit too moustache twirling his evil so overexaggerated  
  
the harkonnens in the novel are basically campy cartoon villains  
  
 and he just walks around looking bored overshadowed by his daughters plotting and screen time  
  
just like in the novel  
  
 the monochrome on geidi prime didnt do it for me i know its meant to be artistic but it didnt look like that in the first film it was too much too exaggerated   
  
it didnt look like that in the first film because they were indoors for every scene its only the outdoor shots and shots near windows which are in infrared any indoor scene on giedi prime looks like in the first movie  
  
 how abruptly and pathetically major players died  raban and especially the baron going from full on constant perverted terror to just lying there helpless and getting stabbed   
  
thats the point  
  
 the worms in dune should have looked like the krayt dragon in the mandalorian  
  
why thats not consistant with the novels or any adaptation  
  
  the whole no one lives in the south and its impenetrable thing they are living in a super advanced future im sure they could at least scan it and see   
  
they have very limited technology in this world and the harkonnen were consumed by hubris and tunnel vision enough that they didnt try looking closer  
  
 we didnt get an explanation for the leather spider creature  
  
we didnt need to  
  
 overall this film felt far less alien than the first   
  
disagree but also wouldnt getting explanations for every little thing make it even less alien then

no",2024-03-03 21:46:03

it can be talked with those trilogies but it will never overtake them even though lotr were some of the best movies ever made i’ll stand by that they still didn’t have quite the same impact star wars did so star wars and lotr will always be better for those two reasons but so for the duenntrilogy can at least be in the conversation,2024-03-01 05:23:43

what was your least favorite piece of dialog,2024-03-01 13:53:58
did you watch the first movie,2024-03-02 14:49:53
"1 in the books they slide off the side of the worm or exit from the tail also the worms get tired and stop eventually
2 as implied earlier that scene the emperor did not know how many fremen there were and he certainly never dreamed they could overwhelm his defenses as well as defeat his sardaukar in open combat the nuke which took out his shields –and the worms– would have been a surprise as well you might say he was punished for his own hubris
3 the slow blade penetrates the shield as explained in part 1 fast objects such as projectiles have a harder time piercing through so sustained pressure is necessary
4 the armor does seem ornamental all things considered which wouldnt be too weird considering the myriad displays of symbolic military tradition already present in the dune universe i guess its better than nothing if youre not using a shield",2024-03-02 14:58:05
" how did they take the emperor so easily

another commentor largely covered it but in the movie they didnt portray pauls threat to wipe out the spice as important as it is in the books the spice is used to extend life and those that use it enough are addicted to it and will die or at least face very adverse consequences by being unable to use it any longer the bene gesserit get their abilities from the spice the spacing guild navigators who provide the ability to travel in space get their abilities from the spice so paul threatening to destroy it all wrecks all of that so much so that the emperor has to consent to paul marrying his daughter and stepping down from the throne",2024-03-02 18:14:07
pay attention next time,2024-03-02 17:07:43
"thats not at all what happened as denis villienueve had total creative control and is a huge fan of the books since he was a teenager

the pacing at the end of the book is itself quite accelerated as intended by herbert to give a sense of how quickly pauls newfound prescience was able to swing things into motion which is the point of it as a cautionary tale that religious fervor can very quickly accelerate into a roaring river of change for the worse

part one and part two is intentional  theyre best thought of as a singular story  in that way a lot of the elements in the second movie are grounded in the first so they dont feel unjustified

it really worked for me  i love slower dialogue character driven movies as well the holdovers is one of my favorite recent films  but theres nothing wrong with an accelerated plot if it has a purpose  birdman 2013 has a widly rapid pace and that movies fantastic",2024-03-21 01:31:10
" bloated no patience practically threw any of part 1’s transcendental style 

disagree its bloated  but i agree with the rest  i wrote elsewhere it feels like part 1 had more room to breathe  i feel like theres just too much to get through with part 2  i feel like thats the most common criticism of the movie everyone wishes there had been a little more of this character or that faction or politics to in this case slower pacebut its just too much  cuts had to be made  i think its wonderful what we got even if part 1 has more of that ethereal dream like quality",2024-03-06 16:17:30
"i think its not just that shes mad hes going to marry irulan its that shes mad he wants to be emperor of the universe in the first place which is what made marrying irulan necessary 

their whole romance in this movie started with him saying he wanted to be equal to her and then at the end he starts making people bow to him and kiss his ringand thats when she walks out shes clearly not happy about the irulan thing but i dont think romantic jealousy is her biggest issue so its a difference from the book but i think it makes sense for her character as it was changed for the movie to be more anticolonialist even if paul had still been willing to marry her i think shed still be angry at how things played out  paul marrying irulan is just the unhappy icing on the cake for her",2024-03-01 07:15:41

" half of the movie is paul not wanting to be the messiah and in the middle after 5 minutes he quickly changes his mind and starts blasting

i think youre glossing over a huge huge catalyst for this change as if you werent paying attention or were getting confused because admittedly there is a lot going on in the movie",2024-03-04 10:04:50
"most of the things that you’re complaining about aren’t relevant to the core story we don’t need to hear about every character’s backstory or where they came from or who their parents were it’s just not relevant and the movie already has a lot of ground to cover

 there is ridiculously large amount of water that stilgar shows jessica do the people have access to this water


stilgar literally says that no one would ever dream to drink a single drop of that water even on the verge of death because its sacred


 they are in the desert how on earth are they growing anything to eat wouldnt it be like trying to grow food in the saharah desert death valley


they showed they had like windtraps which allows them to collect water and likely grow food underground as well theres also animals they can hunteat


 not one scene in the movie showed the desert people doing anything other than sitting around talking


wrong theres at least like a couple of scenes where you see them eating one of them in fact takes place not even 20 minutes into the film where they even have the fremen make fun of paul because he apparently couldnt take the spice in his food


 how are these people not dying from lack of food and water


they do have food and water and did you forget their suits literally preserve all moisture and dont let anything go to waste


 also why are there no children teenagers among them

"the example you cited of the changes the film made is actually a perfect example of adaptation to screen keep the same idea but condense and simplify we didn’t need to know how paul was going to destroy the spice the point is that he’s holding it hostage 

i swear there will always be fans who will refuse any alteration in the name of adaptation you can’t do a 11 adaptation of the latter half of the novel it’s not cinematic at all the changes are all made in the name of taking some very dense weird material and distilling it to its core ideas yeah some things will get lost in translation but that doesn’t make it a poor film",2024-03-06 18:46:54

"i dont know how these huge perma aggressive  worms all of a sudden just stay at the surface at a constant speed

its not explicit in the movie but did you notice how these little pores were exposed as the hooks pulled on the worm ridges according to the books doing this would make the sandworm instinctually want to stay up and maintain position to avoid clogging them with sand they dont necessarily travel at constant speed they eventually slow down as they tire out which makes dismounting easier 

also how does a pregnant woman mount and dismount such a thing

no idea about that lol",2024-03-03 15:16:08
"

the trembling effect on the sand before a sandworm appears probably echoes above experiment that shows how sand can become liquidlike through a process called fluidization its probably how the worms are supposed to travel through the sand the pregnant woman was carried inside a sedanchair like construct i may be wrong but the worm appears to constantly rotate its body that is covered in germs that seem to be opening up when exposed to air on the surface thats how they get slowly carried to the top once there they block those germs from closing and keep the worm from burrowing back down as to how you get hundreds of fremen up there at the same time no  idea  perhaps you jump from dunes on their tops similar like what paul did sandworms were inspired by dragons as per frank herbert in the books the oldest ones can grow kilometers long",2024-03-03 18:20:13

i believe shaddam iv was paranoid that leto would try to overthrow him leto was more popular than him and had the most powerful military of all the houses,2024-03-01 05:40:25
he was concerned that house atreides was growing too powerful and duke leto too popular and saw them as a threat to himself i think they talked about this in the first movie more but the book also goes way more indepth,2024-03-01 05:30:00

"i don’t think so while the new “dune” movies are visually stunning great special effects costumes etc they lack the sense of fun that “ star wars” did when it was new in 1977  with  “star wars” you wanted to see it again as soon as it was over because it was like nothing you had  seen before  i was 15 in 1977 the “dune” movies by nature of the story don’t seem to me like something i would rush out and see again right away 

the only recent movie viewing experience i can think of that was like “star wars” in 1977 was “avengers endgame” on opening night with the entire theater audience so excited to be there to the story conclusion of the mcu movies at that time there was  so much to take in during “endgame”  i ended up seeing 3 times the first week it was in n theaters",2024-03-02 21:49:31

if they are pregnant this imbues all that knowledge and wisdom into the fetus it becomes conscious this is seen as an abomination among the bene gesserit because they have no way of knowing if this person was worthy it also could potentially dilute or sabotage their lineage of reverend mothers with a rogue thought process

dune definitely did a good job showing what a transition to true evil is not blackwhite evil but one where its understandable and relatable but still leading extremist religious jihad across the universe is pretty evil,2024-03-03 09:07:09

ive been thinking about it and it honestly fits better narratively to have paul be the one to  him pauls entire life has been ruined by the baron there is much more narrative tension between the two meanwhile alia wasnt even born when the  went down she just kinda drops into the second half of the narrative randomly in the book for frank herbert to get rid of the baron because the character doesnt matter much anymore by that point in the book since the emperor has more or less taken over as main antagonist by this point",2024-03-04 18:16:38

i think he said grandfather you died like an animal,2024-03-06 16:04:28
pauls biggest hypeman,2024-03-02 06:48:17
ok but have you seen mother,2024-03-02 13:25:01
i hope we get an snl skit where everything is as it is written with this guy  the prophecy says he will be a great worm rider  paul falls off and bites the sand  he will first fall as it is written but get up and try again and succeed  he tries again and falls eventually as it is written  he finally manages to ride a few seconds eight seconds as it is written  later paul is picking out a shirt from his closet and moves his hand to a red one the madhi will don a red shirt as it is writt paul moves his hand back and goes to a blue shirt a blue shirt as it is written,2024-03-04 03:59:52
yeah i didnt buy it tbh didnt feel like the same person from part 1,2024-03-03 13:49:12
already played that role in to the wonder,2024-03-13 02:04:35
didnt even recognize it was him,2024-04-07 20:33:26
that one super out of place scene near the beginning where hes giggling like a schoolgirl over paul being humble  killed me ,2024-03-03 09:46:00
"very true to his book character he was always a believer 

i cant  wait for dune 3",2024-03-04 07:16:04
"i did not expect the humor and life of brianesque quality his dialogue broguht to the movie but i loved it

i also feel like that part when he is wounded and yells to paul i dont care what you believe i believe was very powerful and hit really hard",2024-03-04 22:01:51
i couldnt get over that like 1520 minute span in the movie where several times stilgar was like paul i humbly offer my life please take it,2024-03-20 20:45:59
reminded me of davos seaworth stannis is the one true king,2024-03-18 08:14:35
stilgar was morpheous,2024-03-28 21:41:41
just got out of the theater and this made me lol,2024-03-03 11:16:49
now replace paul with neo stilgar with morpheus chani with trinity and the prophecy well with the prophecy,2024-03-03 16:50:28
“and it is wet too  bless the maker and his water  bless the coming and going of him may his passage cleanse the world”,2024-03-05 03:13:48
"watery 

muaddib gives us water with the very air he releases",2024-03-09 15:28:27
as it is written,2024-03-03 12:09:36
chani hes not the mahdi hes a very bad boy,2024-03-07 05:02:13
as written,2024-03-10 08:00:38
he gifts us this bounty of putrescence to remind us how much we should value those fragrances we find pleasant,2024-04-08 18:51:34
it was very intentional they clearly made him a comic relief to make the movie more friendly for gas,2024-03-05 06:21:42
paul hardly had time to pull the two knives out of himself before the hype engine started,2024-03-05 14:14:13
" this movie is way funnier than the first one especially whenever javier is on screen


now that stilger survived this movie unlike the book canon i wonder if there will be more comic relief of him in the next one or maybe as the leader of the inter galactic jihad he will be more like his character from no country for old men ",2024-03-03 02:50:04
not as herbert book as written though they really changed the tone and the characters in this movie contrary to the first movie that was very faithful to the book,2024-03-03 02:50:42
stop spoiling godemperor,2024-03-03 14:08:55
resistance to individuals is futile ,2024-03-03 11:09:26
 he is the result of thousands of years of genetic breeding projects by the bene geserit he is the heir to one of the great houses that was so powerful they were given the most important planet arrakis and he was wildly successful in guerilla warfare battles against the harkonnens we see all of this onscreen,2024-03-04 15:52:32
"paul had a lot of character flaws in this movie though

also i think prequels anakin would be a far better example if you want to point out double standards young boy gets into a spaceship kills trained baddies because something something midichlorians come on",2024-03-14 14:26:28
unlike rey he has plenty of weaknesses and character growth rey would have never gotten stabbed in a duel,2024-03-07 03:51:29
he was a fully realized character though it didn’t end there his religious fanaticism was played straight but was unironically funny as well it was still fully formed,2024-03-01 18:57:33
he didnt really come off as mocking to me in that scene more the total psycho heard a fun phrase he liked and was like i like that may thy knife chip and shatter,2024-03-02 14:11:13
"i also loved how they made the characters get tired paul was wheezing for a few minutes because of how exhausted he was anyone whos even casually sparred in real life knows how extremely tiring it is to fight and thats something most movies get wrong i loved how realistic it felt in dune

another project that gets this really right is that daredevil show on netflix",2024-03-10 11:08:45
they both moved so fast too was awesome,2024-03-16 21:05:28
yeah this was my nitpick with the first film the atreides v sardaukar scenes felt overly choreographed this movie corrected back,2024-03-17 21:14:32
it was a fantastic final battle i’m glad it wasn’t over too quick either,2024-03-12 02:54:28
first half of the dual was great second half paul started doing backflips like a star wars scene,2024-03-21 13:44:01
yes that triple horizontal twirl paul did was very technical and grimy,2024-03-03 04:58:44
i feel attacked have an up vote,2024-04-01 03:23:35
an interesting read i like it for me however i was referring to paul the duel that makes him emperor and gives him control of the spice flow the thing that allows him to win because above all else “the spice must flow”,2024-03-04 00:04:54
this is the take,2024-03-10 08:06:37
fight scenes in books are clunky to read this was no exception,2024-03-03 23:29:38
 mate if you can afford it get a home projector and watch films using an entire wall,2024-03-04 02:24:13
they better not crop it give me the tall aspect ratio,2024-03-05 06:35:54
"never gonna happen sadly director has openly said he doesn’t release director’s cuts extended editions or deleted scenes he’s the anti peter jackson what you see in theaters is only film that will get released

i wish peter jackson could sit down with him and change his mind lol",2024-03-19 02:00:42
a thing that lets you actually own your movies with higher quality sound and picture,2024-03-11 05:13:26
its a fancy dvd  curious how you have never heard of one they’ve been around since the mid2000’s,2024-03-20 12:11:19
i thought i was the only one who saw this and loved it lol just the embodiment of “fyi i did not plan this  just happens”,2024-03-02 22:48:48
yeah only them two standing and looking at each other was kinda funny,2024-03-03 13:02:12
"he practically married irulan in order to have legitimacy to the throne purely political had he not done that the imperium would have resisted him more and more violence would have ensued

it was the “slim path” but also the “least violent” path the movie didn’t show it as much but the books constantly reminded you the torment paul went through from his visions any step or deviation from his destiny meant more suffering and worse things to happen both to him and everyone around him",2024-03-02 14:52:59
in the books it’s a purely political marriage so he can have a legitimate claim to the throne and it’s made clear that while he’s marrying irulan chani is still his actual love just like how jessica was the duke’s even though she was never married to him they basically went a completely different direction with chani characterization this entire movie which i think was good choice since in the book she doesn’t do much beyond just blindly loving paul and has no other real traits which would have come across extremely bland on screen,2024-03-04 06:15:23
"speaking of

drax still 02 vs thanos in hand to hand",2024-03-03 21:18:28
"oh man you’d get a kick out of reading the next few books 

the final line of book one which was concluded with this movie was lady jessica telling chani “history will remember us as wives” 

it is a triple loaded statement in book one we know that the histories will be written by princess irulan she writes with great respect and empathy for paul but makes it clear they have a loveless marriage and he is still fixated on chani among other things second it’s a reference back to duke leto whose dying regret was not marrying jessica and emotionally neglecting her for the sake of politics lastly it is in that forgiveness of leto an acknowledgement paul is repeating the sins of his father ",2024-03-08 17:42:31
in the book he takes irulan as his bride and chani as his concubine much like jessica was to leto chani bears his children and irulan gets the title also she raises the children after chani dies,2024-03-03 19:27:05
the hand gesture when he describes the narrow path he must take is superb as if he were moses cutting the red sea in half on his way to the promised land of paradise and victory only fulfilled by the golden path,2024-03-03 11:21:53
and his sister literally told him through jessica that he should save his hand for a better match,2024-03-09 14:52:07
no perhaps about it i thought that was pretty clearly what was going on otherwise why would he do it,2024-03-06 14:44:10
"in the book chani and the emperor’s daughter very clearly understand what the arrangement is and it’s very clear paul is marrying her in name only but will be staying with chani as his real partner 

this change was the only thing i didn’t like about this movie honestly this understanding in the book gives it one of my favorite moments and favorite lines when reverend mother jessica who had herself “merely” as far as title was concerned only been his father’s concubine pulls chani aside and reassures her “history will call us wives”",2024-03-17 03:36:45
"in the books it’s blatently explicit that paul marries irulaian for politics



   he says something tot he effect of we will be married but you will never know my touch my love or my interested  i married you to control the throne oh and btw chani over there is my actual love and we are going to have more kids despite your dad killing my son",2024-04-01 03:33:58
he married her because house corrino has led the imperium for generations marrying irulan legitimizes his claim to being the emperor chani getting mad and running away is actually an awful change to the story,2024-03-03 03:04:21
perhaps  he literally says  do what he has to do to take that slim path everything he is doing is to further that goal,2024-03-28 17:52:16
this part made me laugh you have this epic bittersweet song playing after the shock she just went through but to me she was just calling a cab in the rain because  her ex boyfriend and his religious political bs she was going back to her place making tea and crying her eyes out under the covers,2024-03-02 15:57:36
yeah but youd think chani would get it  especially being a fremen where you do the best thing for the group instead of for yourself,2024-03-02 23:23:17
"in the books it’s obvious because each chapter begins with historical texts written by irulan telling us about her husband emperor paul atreides



in the movies they had to plant that idea in our mind early so paul basically spelt out a version of this to the fremen planetologist in the first movie people who are surprised by this turn of events probably missed that line which to be fair did go by pretty quick she just laughed off the idea a boy who just lost his whole house still planned to become emperor


also i haven’t read enough of the book to know if a similar scene happened there


but the idea is you don’t need future vision to know marrying irulan is the quickest way to the throne future vision just helps paul plan things better the principles don’t change",2024-03-05 18:47:55
"i dont think it’s necessarily fair to depict chani as depicting herberts views rather than his conception for a science fictional society of buddislamic desert nomads

edit he didn’t start to insert his weird views on women until  emperor lol",2024-03-02 18:26:52
it  me off too if the movie set us up for believing chani was betrayed even if he still loved her by all appearances she was no longer going to be in his life she has to accept his destiny was taking him in a different direction,2024-03-05 13:43:16
lady jessica never married duke leto and had paul and alia for the duke the duke never married lady jessica and kept the option open for political reasons she was his concubine and yet he loved jessica more than anything this is how it was reconciled with cheni paul has to marry the princess irulan its political for the emperium cheni is his love and concubine my recollection of dune messiah is foggy but i think i remember he distanced himself from irulan after a while she wanted to get pregnant but he wouldnt touch her but i may be misremembering,2024-03-03 07:06:31
tell her that in the books chani wasnt even mad,2024-03-04 22:14:34
well i think he was essentially apologizing for what he was about to do and emphasizing it was something he had to do not what his heart wanted,2024-03-02 15:55:29
"yeah the film didnt do that part of the book justice 

in the book paul says to chani that irulan will be his wife but she shall have no touch no desire no love and no children and chani will be his concubine and then lady jessics comes up to chani as well and reaffirms that paul will only ever love her",2024-03-02 15:09:28
yes thats the point of that scene,2024-03-03 17:00:16
"quite the opposite that was the point

‘what i’m about to do it’s because i have to you are who i want’",2024-03-09 23:51:11
hes right though thats pretty typical politics,2024-03-16 03:20:33
the great houses choosing war fits a bit better with the holy war i think,2024-03-02 09:53:25
no she gives no  in the book,2024-03-03 15:13:46
kind of a spoiler tbh as their troubles with this in messiah is a big plot point,2024-03-03 13:24:27
really wish they would have released it on more 70mm screens we got oppenheimer in my city but the only one for dune in my whole country is on the literal other side of the continent,2024-03-01 14:39:25
you can feel the explosions in your chest and the worms in your feet,2024-03-01 23:28:12
dolby cinema is the complete experience,2024-03-03 11:17:42
i saw it at the alamo drafthouse and walked out thinking i’ll see it again in a dolby or imax theater,2024-03-01 12:45:36
honestly i prefer dolby cinemaatmos the picture and audio quality are so much better especially the low end which is great in this movie,2024-03-02 19:37:17
just got back from the imax showing just…,2024-03-02 21:29:46
best cinematic experience ive had,2024-03-05 18:16:28
i like my cinemark on the xd screen more than the local imax,2024-03-02 03:45:16
i saw it in cinity 4k laser with high brightness and wide color gamut  dolby atmos and the contrast going from the dark harkonnen scenes to the bright desert was insane,2024-03-05 00:25:03
i actually feel a little bit let down i didnt see it in imax,2024-03-03 04:27:32
they need to seriously upgrade the seats in our local imax so uncomfortable,2024-03-10 21:30:47
i couldn’t find an imax showing in the free time i had when it came to the final battle when the first sandworm emerged the top part of it got cut off by the screen and i was a little ,2024-03-05 16:53:57
just watched it the second time did 5 grams shrooms to go with it  blown away again imax experience was unforgettable the soundtrack the emotions the undertones of  power and  undertones did it for me,2024-03-23 00:01:50
i  you not  the movie knocked over my popcorn on my table that has never happened before in a movie i’ve seen,2024-03-06 03:31:33
i just finished it in imax seriously amazing,2024-03-07 13:47:15
just got out of seeing it at the bfi imax largest screen in the uk and it was a proper 70mm film print amazing up there with interstellar for the best imax experience i’ve seen,2024-03-09 23:36:47
just saw it for a second time not in imax and it cemented my decision to see it a third time in imax,2024-03-10 19:56:27
specifically in dual laser imax,2024-03-14 00:00:58
dolby was pretty dope,2024-03-17 02:00:29
as someone that is sensitive to motion sickness in your opinion what are the odds i will hurl if i watch this in imax,2024-03-20 20:48:02
the visuals are certainly a big part but the sound design  that magnificent sound a big part of that movie would be missing just watching it through the tv or headphones,2024-03-02 06:45:54
"same there’s a genuine feeling of sadness i have knowing such an experience is inherently temporary applies to lots of big event type movies of course but this one hits the hardest 

well br49 might be up there too 

best hope is that the success leads to it being showed somewhat regularly at those smaller theatres that do classics but those ain’t normally imax",2024-03-01 14:44:17
i have a 77 oled with surround sound and it will never be as good as what i just saw in even a nonimax theater ,2024-03-03 14:21:18
i rewatched the first one on netflix the day before and it felt so weird it’s not even the imax ratio it’s standard,2024-03-03 00:13:55
my consolation is if i don’t find the time to watch it on imax during this first run this is exactly the sort of movie that gets imax rereleases,2024-03-05 16:55:12
if there are any wb people lurking please bring it to the imax app on vision pro,2024-03-04 05:36:05
i like being able to pause it and look at the beauty of an shot so there are some benefits when it hits streaming,2024-03-04 15:03:39
i risked getting covid to see dune 1 in imax,2024-03-03 00:34:17
"closest right now is with the apple vision pro and airpods but that has the downside of being a one person experience

for a communal big theater feel imax is still unmatched",2024-03-10 01:15:09
i just watched it in screenx some kids where talking until 30 minutes in the movie more than one person told them politely to ,2024-03-02 23:51:21
witness,2024-03-04 01:50:05
that still remains one of the best theatre experiences ive ever had,2024-03-07 05:24:14
literally said the same thing leaving the theater  just an absolutely enthralling experience,2024-03-08 07:10:13
 best dolby movie experience the seats were  shaking half the time,2024-03-04 01:51:16
what was the other,2024-03-09 17:25:51
you hit the nail on the head  its a movie that immerses you in a world for a few hours theres few that can do that,2024-03-09 17:25:28
im curious what you disliked about the first one and liked about the second i watched part one again a few months back and part two this past weekend and they feel very similar in tone and pacing  what did the second film bring to the table for you,2024-03-18 22:51:00
"just going to warn you the series doesn’t really hold up after book 2 imo i stopped after book 3 because i had lost all interest at that point 

absolutely worth reading at least the first book though",2024-03-04 14:13:01
what were the biggest changes,2024-03-07 00:38:18
your mom rocks ,2024-03-08 05:33:25
having a simultaneous streaming release didn’t help,2024-03-09 10:48:41
it was definitely because of covid wb simultaneously released all their movies that year on streaming so none were really box office successes,2024-03-12 08:50:22
i saw this as paul understanding feyd was the kind of person who would relish the moment of death and used that as his only opening he had to take a mortal wound to bait feyd into a careless flourish,2024-03-01 16:56:39
i was nearly sure they would do a sherlock holmes style thinkingthroughthesteps kind of thing since thats basically what happens in the book but really glad they just let it all play out in real time very cool sequence,2024-03-01 22:35:52
paul making that move pretty much furthered the legend of him in front of everyone who witnessed the fight especially now that hes heading into the holy war against the great houses,2024-03-02 00:34:40
they even prepared you for this with his fight in the stadium hes full of arrogance and hubris and fights accordingly it is on brand for him to get the winning blow and then gloat about it,2024-03-02 11:18:02
also lines up with the ornothopter earlier where they could only attack it when it was attacking them,2024-03-02 02:05:18
i was expecting that scene to be another vision then it goes back and the fight is only a few seconds before paul stabs him in the face showing how he can view different timelines so clearly now,2024-03-03 08:42:45
john wick chapter 1 moment,2024-03-01 13:23:05
was anyone else confused by feyds ability though he basically slays drugged up combatants and is nearly bested by some ordinary tech guy who isnt drugged  but paul deeply struggles with him i didnt fully buy it,2024-03-03 13:53:10
"paul lets himself get stabbed in a nonlethal but very nearly lethal spot so he could go for the 

he was stabbed in the stomach first then kills feyd rautha with what looks like the same exact wound he already shrugged off",2024-03-04 03:06:51
and gourneys first training scene seemed to reflect the same moment in dune 1,2024-03-03 22:42:06
that fight was rigged from the start paul can literally see the future it was still an amazing fight scene though,2024-03-04 02:08:09
i think he just did it so that he could  feyd with his own weapon  the emperors weapon therefore being twice as boss,2024-03-03 00:24:04
thats the ending to samurai champloo xd,2024-03-03 04:10:46
his shield only drops when he fires ,2024-03-09 07:44:30
this part confused me a bit because earlier feyd nearly died in the colloseumesque arena if he didnthave his shield so to me he didnt feel like such a difficult opponent to paul,2024-03-06 23:05:15
he kinda does that twice lol,2024-03-06 23:57:48
very our flag means death,2024-03-08 20:22:11
"edit for names

absolutely nobody cares why you made an edit",2024-03-22 14:10:49
its reminiscent of the way that he showed chani how to take down the thopter while its attacking,2024-04-08 15:54:53
it’s also a total callback to that scene in part 1 when he’s training w gurney,2024-03-05 05:18:16
its also a payoff for his training scene with gurney in dune part 1 where he gets stabbed in the same spot,2024-03-04 06:49:33
also very early in the story when hes sparring with gurney gurney does basically the same thing to paul,2024-03-01 15:52:27
"honestly emperor and harkons were beyond  from the beginning lol 

path to victory is insanely busted and always will be",2024-03-02 02:09:19
" so clearly paul knew this was coming and how to win

since paul drank the water of life he basically knows everything thats going to happen hes kind of cheated this wasnt a fair fight lol",2024-03-01 08:50:36
chekhovs crysknife,2024-03-02 04:04:29
feyd killing the atreides guy in the arena played out similarly too he lets his opponents blade push forward to get leverage to strike,2024-03-04 06:40:30
"yep which is why he took the duel to begin with despite the protestations of the others the film at that moment even has gurney halleck say why is he so reckless

because hes not being reckless at all its all part of the plan",2024-03-03 00:28:35
paul has a vision in part one where chani kills him during an embrace in this same way,2024-03-05 20:07:39
"non book reader here

i was so convinced the vision he saw was that he needed to die in that fight for his people to win the war and that he was going to die in that fight  breathed a sigh of relief when he didnt",2024-03-07 18:30:42
its also the same move he used on gurney in the first movie,2024-03-02 23:31:27
and the bene gesserit explain this about how they can control him,2024-03-04 04:09:27
i just rewatched it and it looks like the blade in his stomach is still there but it also doesnt make sense that way so maybe i was seeing things,2024-03-05 06:36:35
why did feyd stick his blade into pauls shoulder though and not his heart,2024-03-27 21:49:31
"but why the second stab feyd did was to pauls shoulder non lethal

he shouldve gone for the throat or something paul was weak",2024-03-05 15:50:09
this its not exactly the same but its definitely a call back to gurney training where he teaches paul about the surprise attack i thought of that immediately,2024-03-01 14:56:29
the movies parallel each other the finale of both is a wellplanned surprise attack on arrakeen then paul participating in a 1v1 duel to the death,2024-03-05 14:53:55
oh good point i was thinking  hes gonna grip a bare blade but yeah no  the dude already tolerated the box test,2024-03-01 14:35:11
i love how it shows how both gurney and duncan trained him for this duncan even pulled a blade out of himself in part 1 to continue fighting,2024-03-01 17:31:26
yea the way they introduced feyd was so  bad  shielded up strongest bad guy with 2 weapons actually struggles against a random prisoner fron house artreides but somehow he almost wins against paul who is shown to be one of the best if not the best fighter in the series also what does feyd even add to the story that rabban couldnt just replace rabban with feyd from the start of dune 1 skip the horrible feyd introduction and nothing changes,2024-03-31 21:18:17
"he was initially stabbed in the side of his stomach that blade stayed there rautha then gets control of paul’s knife and paul grabs it with his hands and deflects it into his shoulder while that knife is in his shoulder paul removed the blade from his side and kills rautha with it then removes the blade from his shoulder

the whole point which is explained better in the books of course is that paul sees the only way to win is to play into rauthas weaknesses paul lets him think he wins the fight by allowing himself to get stabbed in a nonlethal place which makes rautha relax for a split second this was foreshadowed in the way they destroy the ornithopter by attacking it when its shields are down as it fires and in the first training scene fight with gurney

also it kind of echoes rauthas own fight where he lets his opponent control the knife in the gladiator fight to toy with him",2024-03-03 13:50:03
"i was really looking forward to him in this movie but then i remembered he died taking down some sardaukar in the last one and it was thanos who survived


i forgot what happened to the family’s mentat did he die in the last one too",2024-03-05 15:03:10
idk if you’re trying to be funny or not paul’s own dagger is in his side that he was stabbed with he removes this as he’s being stabbed in the shoulder and kills feysrautha,2024-03-01 04:52:42
where did you get that,2024-03-01 05:04:21
sad that you get downvoted people care more about hyping and quoting the movie for upvotes than actually discussing the film  i miss the imdb discussion forums,2024-03-01 09:09:51
well he can neutralize poison now,2024-03-01 19:20:24
a teeny dystopian flick are you  kidding me,2024-03-02 22:15:49
also arrival,2024-03-01 13:22:08
he’s been working with some of the best cinematographers and effects teams in the game they deserve just as much credit as his visual direction,2024-03-02 10:51:06
i have never been so unnerved in a movie than sitting in the front during arrival when they show the full scale of the aliens,2024-03-02 03:07:28
"also greig fraser the death star scenes in rogue one are by far the greatest at showing scale in star wars and the villeneuvefraser combo for dune has been flawless

he really has an eye and vision for this he also really beautifully mixes cgi and real terrain,2024-03-03 21:22:03
the spider scenes in enemy prepped us for this,2024-03-02 18:37:14
he’s always been good but baby boy just taught the masterclass on cinematography i can’t think of any movie that holds a candle to this in terms of visual storytelling dialogue acting cgi and world building the closest is lord of the rings but these top that for me i didn’t think the lord of the rings trilogy would ever be beaten but  am i happy to witness it,2024-03-08 23:04:58
see ops moms,2024-03-04 04:12:17
the portraying giant objects oscar goes to………………,2024-03-05 05:09:15
he achieves something that i think christopher nolan either has trouble with or avoids by choice  scale everything feels huge distant as it should,2024-03-10 04:30:52
i watched part 1 before part 2 and the atreides’ castle on caladan were soooo blade runner,2024-03-10 06:33:05
villeneuves next movie will feature willem dafoes pp then,2024-03-14 07:12:50
huge  spider over the city in enemy,2024-03-17 22:50:31
,2024-03-04 04:05:24
the thopter shootdown scene near the beginning where theyre dodging around the spice harvester was small scale but just an insanely tight scene,2024-03-03 01:52:40
that made me come to the realization that if theres ever some sort of mass effect adaptation villeneuve needs to direct it lol,2024-03-03 13:13:20
yes although the lasguns were a bit too effective against them they didnt even need to let them land just reversesnipe them from the ground,2024-03-02 14:29:29
big  spiders,2024-03-16 04:21:27
yeah noticed that too  in the shot where he sees a narrow way through,2024-03-03 23:26:25
yes he used the nukes of the atreides house to bring down the natural wall that protects the city from the sandstorms that allowed the sandworms to enter,2024-03-01 23:15:39
"overconfident he underestimated both the amount and skill of the fremen and overestimated the capabilities of his own stagnating sardaukar

his troop advised going to orbit but the emperor was so supremely confident he ignored the suggestion which would have kept him his throne",2024-03-01 22:57:15
"in combination with the other comment arrakeen is also protected on all sides by natural and  or artificial walls that protect it from sand worms 

it was only through the use of atomics that they managed to clear a way for their worm attack without which i think it’s less clear if they would have won 

basically it was actually quite safe until a wildly unexpected and unlikely thing happens",2024-03-04 18:29:39
was is the sandstorm being burnt off by the ships shield i didnt catch why was the fire there,2024-03-03 23:27:18
just an incredible shot,2024-03-03 04:56:33
ironically a much better nuke then oppenheimers,2024-03-02 16:19:56
easiest shots to match the cgi lighting to the hdri ball lol,2024-03-02 08:36:08
bro i thought they nuked some ships or harkonenemperor bases but they blasted the wall of the city,2024-03-03 16:40:59
saw it in the dolby digital and oh boy what an experience i been up since 6am but now i dont think ill be able to sleep til at least midnight,2024-03-03 03:46:03
"this movie was chock full of some of the best vfx work ive ever seen

as was the first film i think when we have such quality vfx it makes you appreciate it a lot more verses stuff we have seen a lot recently",2024-03-02 00:57:25
i mean its the year 10000 or something i’m sure they’ve created something with the power of a nuke without the radioactivity,2024-03-03 23:23:15
"sandworms prescient intergalactic warps anti gravity mystical potions mind control

and youre concerned about a mythical atomics 10000 years in the future theyre not even clearly defined as nukes as we know today",2024-03-09 08:57:49
they were likely hydrogen nukes well tuned to not be a wasteland of radiation,2024-03-05 01:13:00
i think thats why chani and the other fremen in her assault group are wearing those fancy helmets as protection against the radiation dont know the answers to your other questions though,2024-03-05 01:02:39
“abomination”,2024-03-01 06:45:02
charlotte rampling is an incredible performer,2024-03-01 04:56:07
"another reason it was so powerful is because it’s a reversal to their last meeting she had him completely and utterly under her power and at her mercy but there was a glimmer of his power

seeing him surpass her power and bring her to heel was powerful",2024-03-01 22:30:47
she also said abomination  is that forbidden in the beneg ways,2024-03-01 13:44:45
“the actress” academy award nominee charlotte rampling shes amazing,2024-03-02 09:20:42
did you just refer to the great charlotte rampling as the actress,2024-03-01 11:03:21
then bitterly mumbling he’s an abomination ,2024-03-02 22:22:23
she was shocked for like 2 seconds then was like eh when you play all sides it looks like we won anyway,2024-03-03 06:26:54
" i wanted him to  her too i had a little arya stark  list for the characters in there

 baron harkonnen gut him and feed him to worms

there’s a line that got cut from the books where he says “this is my don jabar” referring to her box and poison needle test he has put her in the position she had him in the beginning the bg order must now endure however much pain he says they must or he will destroy them  ,2024-03-08 17:32:33
yeah definitely,2024-04-08 00:12:04
" the actress

go watch the verdict",2024-03-07 05:21:55
almost thought she would tug a braid,2024-03-09 17:56:05
"i thought he called jessica an abomination which is a reference easter egg to alia being called an abomination for having awakened before being born but that scene cannot be used here since in the films timeline alia is not yet born during this part

  
i dont know why they made alia not yet born in the film i wonder if villenueve thought having a smartass 2 year old with space magic powers would lessen the impact of the climax",2024-03-01 04:52:48
"its so  good in imax

it rumbles through you",2024-03-02 03:16:43
when jessica told chani to do it with the voice it was like getting stabbed in the ea such powerful sound design made better by being on imax,2024-03-02 15:44:20
just came back from a screening and the sound design was amazing felt every single vibration in my seat and the voice gave me shivers every time,2024-03-01 16:22:35
i just got out of seeing this in dolby and the rumbles were so strong during that scene it actually took me off guard for a brief moment that was perfect to what she was feeling i am so glad i was able to see it in dolby for the sound balancing too so good,2024-03-03 00:43:30
i loved that brilliant call to the book while still keeping in line with the movies story plotting,2024-03-02 02:52:19
reverend mother is calling alia an abomination and simultaneously scolding jessica for creating such,2024-03-01 05:53:17
my theatre cracked up it was perfect,2024-03-02 14:28:02
this is the first movie ive seen in imax and i could literally feel the impact of the sound of the voice through the speakers it was freaky,2024-03-13 02:02:28
that’s supposed to be alia she calls an abomination denis seems to have decided it was impossible to not make alia look  so he skipped it,2024-03-02 04:49:29
i wish they would have included the spice  nobody ever points out the darkness in paul that they feel and fear they just kiss in the desert after stilgar nonsensically sends paul out into the desert alone and chani disobeys and follows him because she is wiser than everybody else in the story and knows best,2024-03-01 16:03:57
tbh his expression screamed i wanna fuuuck this guy more to me lol,2024-03-12 17:14:05
youve been hit by a cupids arrow,2024-03-21 07:59:47
i would have been  if someone did that in my theater,2024-03-12 08:35:37
“okay he’s not allowed to do that during a knife fight right i  hope not”,2024-03-05 16:58:47
holy  i haven’t read the book but now i want this more than anything,2024-03-10 07:46:43
yeah i was totally waiting for it,2024-03-12 18:08:52
i also caught that butler nailed the baron’s accent which added a level of creep to the character well done,2024-03-18 05:36:37
i dont think that line really made much sense though in the book shes screaming abomination at alia and has to nearly be removed from the room for freaking out so much but with the movie not doing the 2 year time jump it doesnt fit as well for her to be calling paul an abomination,2024-03-03 03:27:34
scared to death scared to look,2024-03-05 11:25:00
i assume he also thought it would make his legend greater,2024-03-03 07:23:07
not sure if it was intentional but my theater laughed at that scene,2024-03-01 21:20:08
those creepy hook people felt denis as ,2024-03-01 08:29:32
youd see slight skin tones when they were inside which makes sense because it wouldnt be direct sunlight negeating the color spectrum,2024-03-01 18:27:17
that blue through the binoculars is brilliant on denis villeneuves part it shows the audience this black and white isnt an artistic flourish this is how everybody is actually seeing it,2024-03-04 05:36:51
i got weirder more animalistic versions of the royal jedi killing guard praetorian guard maybe the guys that wear red but essentially the dark souls version,2024-03-01 08:34:31
theres also the part where we actually see color is in the interior of the stadium which then grays out once they go outside i found it impressive how they were able to combine artificial and real color simultaneously,2024-03-02 06:18:24
the working theory is that the weird spider mutant was actually the dr’s wife… which was a result of the baron experimentingtorturing her,2024-03-02 05:49:01
those were the phyrexians,2024-03-01 13:26:58
we also got the dukes healers and feyds girls,2024-03-02 17:38:09
dont forget feyds cannibal harem,2024-03-03 14:27:48
oh yeah  were those heads,2024-03-01 20:21:50
wait until they adapt chairdogs,2024-03-03 02:04:54
you know what was cool  the rangefinder on those binoculars went up and down in the alien language  you could see the last digit go up and down,2024-03-09 04:31:28
"oh yeah those hook men  


basically the crayfish monsters from thief 1 and 2",2024-03-03 05:05:41
there was color on the benes cheeks when she seduced feyd,2024-03-05 04:30:28
to be fair the biological experimentation stuff is mostly done by the tleilaxu who aren’t really introduced until dune messiah,2024-03-10 01:37:17
i dont understand why the shield generator didnt create any colour though are we meant to believe the blue and red colour of the shield generator is a reflecting light not emitting it,2024-03-06 11:51:21
"what i missed was those weird spider mutant pet things from the first movie i wanted more weird stuff like that 

having not read the book i also wouldnt have minded some more creatures when stilgar is sending paul off on his first journey and tells him to keep watch for giant trapdoor spiders and centipedes i thought we might get some more creatures but nay not a big criticism though its fine without them",2024-03-18 15:51:04
same with giger reference i have to imagine the design team and denis used those designs as reference,2024-03-03 03:57:56
that perfectly captures my characterization of the film it feels absolutely breathtakingly fresh even in the modern era of cgi and scifi films like every scene felt like a brand new experience completely blew me away,2024-03-11 00:42:02
is that type of star completely fictional or is it based on something,2024-03-09 03:58:15
apparently they shot it all in infrared it looks  incredible,2024-03-21 21:29:13
 rofl,2024-03-03 17:12:28
is that the crazy thing i thought that was the whole point to show how far we’ve strayed in that future,2024-03-02 22:14:21
it was so cool to see the designers just embrace the geiger style and go full ham with it the movie in that ways pays huge homage to the old jodo dune dream it was beautiful to see come to life,2024-03-01 10:05:32
giger,2024-03-01 10:12:22
was gigers original works from the 70s included or was it just the cg artists mimicking his style,2024-03-01 19:06:44
secundus and sardaukar,2024-03-03 07:38:46
even the spacecraft reminds me of arrival all large ships just sort of effortlessly float around seemingly without any sort of propulsion,2024-03-18 05:52:52
you did they were in the shade of the sun so their natural colors were still there until the sunlight bleached it away,2024-03-03 04:30:25
"same the whole art direction is insane

just sad we didn’t get more of salusa secundus and throat chanting ",2024-03-10 13:21:57
i wouldn’t even say they looked “practical” just real,2024-03-12 04:34:06
honestly this flm might well have the best cgi ive ever seen it looked unbelievable genuinely you couldnt tell it was fake,2024-03-20 23:20:35
and the black goo is just fireworks who could have thought,2024-03-03 00:40:37
do you have a source for that it seems easier to just turn everything to grayscale in post,2024-03-03 08:07:34
i mean it’s the year 10000 so beauty standards may have changed so that they are considered beautiful,2024-03-03 22:16:26
great britain,2024-03-03 07:39:31
yeah that was def a bit on the nose still a good scene tho,2024-03-01 15:34:48
there were a couple unsubtle scenes and snippets of dialogue throughout that i didn’t love yeah,2024-03-02 16:52:04
i thought it did a good job of showing the harkonnens renewed efforts in subduing arrakis feyds getting this massive invasion force that rabbon didnt have,2024-03-10 03:53:29
you can tell it’s not a flashback because when they show the characters going from the interiors to outside in the scene they transition from coloredlit to monochrome i thought it was such a unique transition,2024-03-02 07:25:14
they commented on it in the dialogue saying something about “our black sun”,2024-03-01 06:46:56
think about camera exposure the more exposed to harsh sunlight the more things becoming radically black or white,2024-03-02 06:04:08
in the establishing exterior shot before feyd encounters margot in that hallway you can see that the fireworks are being shot up from the ground,2024-03-03 07:48:02
agreed the visual effects were jaw dropping for the most part but those crowd shots and the  marchmilitary parade thing just weren’t quite there was giving star wars episode 1,2024-03-03 16:30:17
its like watching the engineers from prometheus like where theyre from,2024-03-02 02:14:55
maybe a spinoff series like what we get with marvel universe its always sunny on gedei prime,2024-03-04 05:53:26
according to frank herbert it’s gaydee,2024-03-06 21:54:02
yes geeeddy,2024-03-03 06:18:58

"really  i thought he was the 1 totally miscast actor  i could only see walken on the screen not the emperor and it felt completely out of place

plus i was annoyed by some of his pacing in the final scene",2024-03-05 18:32:11
has denis ever given an explanation as to what drew him to casting walken as the emperor because my headcanon is its entirely due to the weapon of choice music video and denis had to wait 20 years to see this vision come to fruition,2024-03-03 19:10:17
no eggshell just as was written,2024-03-25 15:39:40

so did paul it is like the water of life changes people into having an almost inhuman prospective of things",2024-03-01 11:37:35
she is really on full vengeance mode this movie it is portrayed so villainous yet deliciously sinister,2024-03-01 08:07:18
"  she took on an ominous almost villainous presence in almost all her scenes right after she drank the water of life  

i had a moment during this where i realised what exact itch was being scratched in my mind and it was that this was what the sw prequels should have been like in regard to anakins fall to the dark side being an increasingly powerful and radicalised prophesised one with a powerful figure on his side pulling the strings in the background palpatine  

it felt like all those times you wonder about what if insert good guy actually takes up the bad guys offer to join forces",2024-03-01 23:29:12
she became just like mohaim by the end and the transition made total sense paul’s resentment of her for her meddling hurt her deeply in part one but in this one the grand plans have taken priority,2024-03-01 22:42:35
which is why i loved the second to last scene where you see her overlooking all the ships taking off and going to war not paul but her it really drove home the point that she’s the one with the real power,2024-03-03 18:40:42
yeah that final scene with chani was the only one where she wasn’t operating according to some grand strategy she said good luck just because she wanted to,2024-03-05 17:00:15

symbolic for the character she wears the trappings of her position but is not trapped by them",2024-03-04 19:23:44
fremen language id say,2024-03-03 16:34:45
i agree but i feel like this is portrayed terribly in the film one conversation with jessica is all we get i feel like they really lean into the paul as a “villain” whereas i always read the book as he was a reluctant tragic hero,2024-03-04 04:24:04
paul “ the least deaths i can possibly manage is like 60 billion the universe is such an ahole”,2024-03-05 17:14:07
is that how it goes in the book  i read it about a year ago and dont recall her being super antijihad,2024-03-04 21:55:16
" the problem is hes now no longer ignorant of all possible outcomes

gave me major arrival vibes in that respect",2024-03-12 03:59:10
this also results in the golden path,2024-03-10 07:35:02
what are the worse alternatives why will things get so much worse if he doesnt go all  messiah,2024-03-31 10:18:23
denis wants to make it and has said he’s already working on the script but he is also writing other projects so it’s not confirmed if dune 3 will be next or if he may direct something else first,2024-03-02 08:45:07
they want to do more and this is already on track to make profit third will easily be messiah,2024-03-02 12:29:38
yes dv said hes almost done with the script but doesnt want to rush anything i just hope that means its not longer than 2 years cause i cant wait that long,2024-03-02 10:39:59
"its confirmed but its not set in stone exactly when 

dont listen to anything the trades and such say the actualy conversations are done in secret and happened in 2022 or earlymid 2023 rumors already indicated part 3 was a done deal when part 2 was tracking high for its original 2023 release they just arent making official announcements yet as these are complicated shoots and scheduling for all the people involved  basically they have all sorts of options and stuff in various contracts and have to execute the options and are working out the details to do that and time it right for public release

legendary who owns the dune rights will make the film there is no chance the owners of legendary dont take the money",2024-03-03 22:23:14
it’s not confirmed but most likely the script is almost finished according to sources,2024-03-02 10:04:11
yes,2024-03-02 07:43:09
well dv already has a draft for it and dune 2 is doing incredibly well so yes seems likely,2024-03-11 05:23:51
did you see the menu that was the first film,2024-03-01 11:24:00
one of the things about the books is just how badly the landsraad underestimates the fremen because they only care about arrakis as much as they can extract resources from it turns out there are a lot of fremen the landsraad doesn’t even know about and that just illustrates how scary the fremen are when weaponized by someone like the lisan algaib not only are they secretly the best fighters in the universe but also actual ninjas,2024-03-03 23:10:22
the empire thought there were only a few thousand fremen there are actually millions,2024-03-04 01:09:19
"forget the numbers how do they have the competence to attack all the great houses their power came from the home field advantage they can use the sand worms hide under the sand and yeah they’re good fighters too but in arrakis 

i haven’t seen much that would convince me they could fly spaceships across the universe to attack other sandless planets they seemed fairly backwater actually well adapted to their environment but no great technological innovations or anything great house should just be able to pull back and shell the planet until they’re all gone",2024-03-04 01:24:37
chanis entire increased role was pretty much all to show that he still has clear regret in his actions without having tons of exposition to explain that to the audience,2024-03-03 18:03:12
eten is very blatantly inspired by paul in dune although his experience i feel is more tragic and deterministic,2024-03-08 23:14:52
from other comments here i understand that he can see the one tiny narrow path where the least amount of people die somehow thats the one beginning with his holy war,2024-03-10 13:31:10
the mentats and the guild are really being left out despite their importance in the universe,2024-03-01 08:46:45
even after splitting it into 2 parts,2024-03-01 05:37:31
i think the first movie stayed pretty true to the book this film did cut and change a lot of content i think some of it for good reason paul ascending and seeing the past future and present all at once is probably pretty hard to translate to a visual medium,2024-03-01 09:17:57
like paul and chanis kid ,2024-03-02 21:46:26
"this is the main reason why while i love these two films i still think that a miniseries or a full series if they adapted all books is the best medium to adapt dune especially nowadays when tv series look as good as films house of the dragon looks almost as good as dune

edit do people here only watch films once and solely in imax imax theatres aint exactly common outside the us either",2024-03-01 22:28:33
in the book he joins with the baron cause he distrusts the lady jessica for something that was cut from the first movie makes sense to just leave him out and we should have seen it coming since they didnt cast an alist actor like for everyone else,2024-03-01 07:13:51
oh the books had a whole subplot with him being captured by the harkonnens and then trying to take them down from the inside,2024-03-01 07:45:10
hes coming back for messiah i guarantee it,2024-03-01 07:52:14
can you link it,2024-03-01 10:58:53
denis didnt make those shorts though they got a few other filmmakers to do it the only solid one was watanabes anyways that one goes hard as ,2024-03-05 07:16:39
"some nonsense that he believes what makes it to the theater is what should be left as the final version and doesnt want to show anything else that was left on the cutting room floor

imagine if we only ever got the og version of the original blade runner ",2024-03-01 07:37:24
alliance with fremen,2024-03-03 17:01:27
at least a release of the imax ratio on home media,2024-03-01 18:43:33
i loved how when paul said “may your blade chip and shatter” to feyd he kinda smirks and says it back  as he never heard it before but kinda liked it like “heh…right back at ya” moment lol,2024-03-02 07:19:35
when they were in the hallway after the coliseum with the fireworks going off up and down the hall ,2024-03-01 20:50:21
ya the transition as well from normal lighting into their black sun looked so great as well really great visual world building i was wondering in the trailers how they were going to make it work for the black and white scenes there and it just worked a treat,2024-03-01 22:58:18
same style of inkblots from arrival too,2024-03-01 23:14:13
i wanted to know more about the horns goons in the field that would help feyd out were they creatures or men,2024-03-03 04:04:26
feyd stole the show for me his  acting was so absolutely brilliant,2024-03-01 03:56:21
"austin butler is a possibly goat voice actor in waiting too apparently 

between this elvis and the bikeriders where he appears to speak relatively normal dude can really throw his voice around",2024-03-01 04:13:24
and this is so fking memorable it is a great interlude from the overall yellowish tune the main plot is going yet it still advances the plot in a great way the bene gesserit gonna be  my all time favorite shadow organization that controls everything behind the scene they really plan everything the capability of the sisterhood is beyond my imagination from deniss portray,2024-03-01 08:43:09
"you know while smaller i really felt like this was butlers ledgerjoker role

people never thought heath a guy that was in a knights tale could pull off the joker in such a dark sinister way and now look at what butler has done here pretty amazing and should shoot his career even farther",2024-03-05 08:25:56
yeah absolutely adored the visual design of that bit worked perfectly,2024-03-01 08:42:13
matrix walked so that set design could run,2024-03-03 23:39:04
felt like i was thrown into some sci fi mad max arena fight the arena announcer was goat,2024-03-04 07:43:10
i dont really get his plot though like you said it seemed he was a deuteragonist of sorts but his storyline just kinda stalled out and ended in a knife fight i feel like i was supposed to care about him,2024-03-02 04:47:06
the entire thing is a visual feast it felt like every shot was breathtaking,2024-03-01 03:37:01
the audacity of this movie to make the monochrome scenes the ones i want to rewatch most based on beauty alone,2024-03-01 05:51:17
greig fraser is so  good every shot in this film was so so so well done so many shots just had me in awe,2024-03-01 06:50:58
you have a wonderful production designer cousin,2024-03-01 10:26:26
that triangular coliseum was chefs kiss that was such a scrumptious sequence only way to describe the entire time we’re on geidi prime,2024-03-02 09:25:52
that hallway during the fireworks and celebration was bopping  ,2024-03-02 04:19:51
my favorite segment of the whole film,2024-03-01 16:51:34
the whole movie was a visual feast,2024-03-06 14:01:49
they managed to look the scenes on geidi prime really alien despite them being humans obviously great visuals as well with the lack of colours and the npcs being clonelike and their weird applauses,2024-03-01 07:25:43
"everyone on giedi prime being bald was super funny

is it a mandate from the baron do they all love the baron so much they do it out of solidarity doubtful is it genetic does the black sun cause hair loss",2024-03-01 08:57:31
yeah everybody there is in uncanny valley area,2024-03-01 04:14:02
thats exactly what i thought  i guess its the effect of their sun,2024-03-01 04:34:02
the architecture was so gigeresque and it they also look a lot like the engineers too especially during the parts on geidi prime,2024-03-01 09:00:47
the alien engineers from alien same guy geiger did all the concept work sort of,2024-03-01 07:45:43
" they are like the cousins of the alien engineers

engineers ugh our weird cousins are visiting this weekend quick release that weird pathogen weve been testing and tell them not to drop by because were quarantining",2024-03-01 23:32:45
i love imagining how brutal life on giedi prime would be seems completely totalitarian,2024-03-03 01:30:00
all of the geidi prime scenes were straight up nightmare fuel  very well done,2024-03-04 06:56:43
their water is filthy too the harkonnens fascinate me to no end,2024-03-03 03:24:48
 yes some of the architecture even had a geiger quality to it,2024-03-04 23:10:04
ok so i wasnt crazy and the colors did flip,2024-03-01 03:32:08
the black to white robes was striking visually amazing shot,2024-03-01 08:28:59
yeah that shot was  mesmerizing,2024-03-01 20:56:08
i think the shot last exactly the minimum necessary to trigger that association and then abruptly cuts back,2024-03-03 04:05:54
right makes it look like nothing else out there which is exactly what denis excels at most of all,2024-03-01 03:39:26
were accustomed to seeing bw photography of visible light so when we see bw of infrared light we intuitively know that it looks wrong giving it an otherworldly feel that most people cant identify ,2024-03-02 02:28:28
i still dont get how their hairlessness relates to their sun,2024-03-04 01:22:01
their sun is just so badass and edgy its literally shining infrared light,2024-03-01 08:09:35
just a movie invention,2024-03-18 16:09:10
like this,2024-03-02 04:09:24
too late  a guild navigator now,2024-03-04 10:29:37
that was a baby id hate to see how big those suckers get once fully grown,2024-03-01 03:53:13
it’s like the futurama slurm episode,2024-03-01 16:45:12
star wars does show a lot of dune influence i don’t know if george lucas or anyone’s confirmed it but it’s pretty uncanny,2024-03-05 17:25:49
gatorade flavours are blue yellow orange etc everyone knows this,2024-03-01 20:05:57
you eat a lot of fishfilas,2024-03-02 09:14:56
i would like that in the passengers cupholder,2024-03-02 23:03:54
try our newest flavor blue worm ,2024-03-02 23:20:56
"agreed

 i thought it was refreshing she was skeptical of the prophecy and less passive in regards to pauls strategic marriage to irulan",2024-03-01 22:55:35
the syfy mini series which i love even if its low budget covers those points,2024-03-06 19:05:27
additional changes the emperor was originally sad at killing leto atreides and acted all depressed book goes into detail mentioning leto atreides looked similar to the sardakur and he suddenly felt haunted by his leto looking guards also he mentions if only irulan had been born earlier and married leto,2024-03-11 08:44:11
it also doesnt make any sense given where spice comes from or even in the context of this movie the spice fields as opposed to everywhere else in the movie where spice is just blowing around in the breeze,2024-03-04 05:12:40
two dune movies and i still have no idea how the navigators uses the spice to nagivate the galaxy,2024-03-06 11:14:46
baron is dead so i doubt it unfortunately,2024-03-04 00:40:58
apparently they actually filmed scenes with thufir and also count fenring but they were cut,2024-04-08 09:34:37
i actually thought chani was too passive in the booksthough ive only read the 1st one agreeing with everything paul did even choosing irulan as wife as paul goes into detail about how he will never love her or something like that angry chani brought in some intense moments in the film,2024-03-15 04:03:53
i agree with the other commenter where i love chanis change in the movie shes basically pauls lapdog in the book and lets him walk all over her i also like how in general theres at least one fremen individual not fully onboard with how things are shaping up having it be the one closest to him is that much more meaningful,2024-03-19 16:51:12
chills she conveys so much without moving a muscle,2024-03-01 10:16:24
in that moment the fremen children realized that they were the vulnerable target  there was nothing they could do to resist their reverend mother,2024-03-01 16:25:55
i dont remember jessica being so sinister in the book like she obviously supports her son but shes so proactive about it in the movie and has very little respect for the fremen,2024-03-03 06:26:39
its disturbing because it feels like a legit discussion youd think bishops and leaders of other religions are having right now on how to convert more people to joining their cults and take more power,2024-03-04 03:42:22
she was talking inside her head not out loud,2024-03-10 08:06:46
just gave off so many realworld vibes of white colonizers feeling the need to fix and convert those who live on the land to be colonized and used up for resources,2024-03-03 06:02:54
just in case you didnt get the hint she clarifies its the ones that fear us after cutting away from scared women and children,2024-03-14 06:43:52
shes speaking telepathically to alia they basically just saw jessica pacing back and forth,2024-03-10 15:43:48
"sort of  thats the scene where she explains exactly what shes going to be doing and who to the rest of the movie just details how utterly effective she is at this task 
  
its mostly in the contextual details  who she is with who goes from challenger to worshiper who guards her how many handmaids she has she becomes the spearhead of pauls cult and we see it play out with startling effectiveness in real time 
  
at the end of it theyve converted a people into an army ready to commit and successfully carry out an interstellar crusade weaponizing their hope of a green arrakis to do so",2024-03-10 05:12:36
butler really proved he’s got the guts for a complex eccentric role i originally considered his casting pretty shoehorned for the sake of marketing when it was announced but im happy to admit i was wrong he was so good and we always need a good ,2024-03-01 15:02:25
now i want to see austin butler play a klingon,2024-03-01 04:47:15
such a great performance by austin butler although his head was indeed quite large and was giving megamind at some points,2024-03-01 16:25:42
i was worried that hed still be in elvis mode,2024-03-02 19:49:19
"i remember reading somewhere that butler in this role reminded villeneuve of mick jagger when i saw the trailers i thought hmm he kind of reminds me billy howerdel from a perfect circle if we were going to compare rock stars obviously due to the shaved head and general build but when i saw the movie i got where villeneuve was coming from 

all respect to sting but butler killed it no pun intended in the role",2024-03-06 00:15:05
i saw elvis for the first time the other day and didnt recognize him here or hear that he was supposed to be in this at all,2024-03-04 01:56:22
i could only see jesse eisenberg as lex luther when he was in that bald cap ,2024-03-08 18:22:31
was waiting for him to say thank you very much since he claimed he simply cant shake the elvis accent instead of admitting he just wants to sound cool,2024-03-01 08:32:41
i really thought he was bill skarsgard the whole time i didnt know until the credits it was elvis,2024-03-01 21:16:09
according to austin butler he based his voice off of young stellan’s performances,2024-03-10 02:02:42
i didn’t look too much at the cast beforehand honestly was like ‘is that bill skarsgard’,2024-03-14 05:56:43
man i’m surprised people liked feyd’s voice it screamed 1984 dune weirding module to me,2024-03-01 16:13:43
felt like i was genuinely watching stellan’s son he was scary good ,2024-03-01 03:34:23
"my big problem with him in elvis and bikeriders was hes supposed to be this super likeable guy that everyone is inherently drawn to but hes just a pretty face   like there isnt any charisma or anything that endears you the audience to him in the same way all of the characters are  



as feyd rautha however that vacancy really lends to the characters sociopathic nature",2024-03-01 03:23:45
he’s a  incredible actor,2024-03-01 07:27:34
he was so scary and those closeups they do and you wanna look away but also want to stare i am glad they showed his coming of age thing,2024-03-01 05:03:23
there was a shot of him i think it was when paul kills the baron that they cut to his reaction and legit looks like he comes in his pants right there and then watching it happen,2024-03-03 08:33:13
honesly any doubts people might have had about him after elvis should be washed away by this performance,2024-03-01 03:58:22
mama theyre taking me to arrakis,2024-03-02 19:29:12
he put in so much work the script gave him almost nothing he had to build that character practically all on his own and he did like as much as i respect zendayas work in this movie she was given so much material they gave austin nothing and he made everything with it,2024-03-04 00:29:42
the editing of that movie really took away from his performance second half of elvis is a acting masterclass,2024-03-06 05:39:57
i feel like there was a hint of sting in there too,2024-03-16 11:54:13
i really dont get it seen so many people say something similar hes perfectly fine in this but idk why that performance is praised so much,2024-03-01 03:48:27
he was honestly scary,2024-03-01 22:03:15
he’s also incredible in masters of the air,2024-03-04 00:21:54
dude was channeling bill skarsgård from it,2024-03-01 18:25:29
"totally there were a few scenes where it felt like i was looking at a lion on the sahara about to  its prey

captivating performance",2024-03-02 23:55:41
him absolutely loving having that knife so close to his face was great,2024-03-03 04:12:02
i thought of that too when i thought he was giving snakevibes in the arena fight someone else said lion,2024-03-03 06:53:13
my only big criticism of the movie is we didnt get enough of the harkonnens in general   like i wouldve been more than fine with trimming some of the  off pauls story in the beginning to give them all more screen time,2024-03-01 05:01:37
i think the unhinged psychotic type villains are the most fun to watch he really nailed it you could tell he put work in to make that character the best he could but still had fun with it,2024-03-09 06:46:06
honestly i’d say he’s better than the original idea too sting butt  ,2024-03-01 04:51:16
bill is the only answer,2024-03-02 17:40:16
yes i was very confused to hear space elvis when he was presented to us and then for that to disappear completely,2024-03-01 07:58:06
same that first line sounded exactly like elvis,2024-03-03 04:50:16
i dont think this is the type of role for barry barry is more goofycreepy than he is damningintimidatingfierce,2024-03-01 07:04:41
"wasn’t keoghan first rumoured to play feyd anyway and then replaced with butler 

as much as i like him as an actor i think butler was the better choice keoghan is too tiny  imho ",2024-03-10 14:01:34
yeah he kinda plays the same elvis character in masters of the air ,2024-03-10 21:57:37
i thought he was bill the whole movie until i checked the cast he really reminded me so much of pennywise,2024-03-05 21:13:32
i think hes a sincere actor and really loves the craft will hopefully fully embrace character acting,2024-03-16 12:04:38
and in zoey 101,2024-03-10 07:19:39
i wonder if they shot his response to the pain test mentioning he enjoyed it worked too but seeing it would have been interesting,2024-03-01 06:27:35
can i stick my  in the box,2024-03-02 17:48:29
hes like how much for a take home gom jabbar,2024-03-02 19:45:24
sexually vulnerable,2024-03-03 22:36:18
can i keep the box ,2024-03-04 04:31:55
pinhead approves,2024-03-06 00:18:16
"i didnt notice this


does the book go into detail about what happens when his hand is in the box",2024-03-03 07:47:13
lea seydoux with bene gesserit training is just unfair,2024-03-01 22:12:03
just ask wes anderson and hideo kojima,2024-03-01 09:04:21
lea ,2024-03-02 21:09:40
"alrt i didnt read the books so i feel like an idiot now because i thought that was princess irulan

i had to look up léa seydoux and florence pugh just now that clears up some confusions i was having lol",2024-03-01 21:13:49
shes a weird mix of seductive but cold truly femme fatale vibes,2024-03-16 11:57:27
yeah,2024-03-03 12:45:24
well let she try to  me lets see,2024-03-12 12:54:50
feyd would probably think his body being eaten by the desert was pretty badass too,2024-03-01 04:59:57
"i actually kind of love how he didnt seem upset at all he clearly respected paul and was happy that it was someone great like paul who killed him the way they played his character and scenes was brilliant because it honestly felt like he would have been disappointed to win 

hes like someone in the fighting game community he wants to fight someone who can give him that l",2024-03-01 08:05:51
yuck  i dont know what harkonnen valhalla smells like but it cant be good  like leather sweat and    gross,2024-03-01 12:43:45
harkonnen valhalla is just infinite time in the mud bath ,2024-03-02 04:55:10
also he’s barely of age and lea seydoux is already pregnant with his daughter one might say he died before his time but he might say he’s just doing speed run 100 speed run even as i’m sure he was technically the head of house of harkonnan for like 15 minutes before he died,2024-03-05 17:36:54
"i would love if he could gloat before he dies about how paul will now deal with all the  of ruling 

poor guy never had a chance despite being a psycho",2024-03-02 02:13:05
"i imagine everyone in the known universe except for fremen would have been happier and better off if feyd had won 

the bene gesserit were right",2024-03-01 20:46:39
being killed by his cousin,2024-03-08 01:20:29
plus paul was fighting dishonorably he has prescience so the fight was cheated,2024-03-01 13:15:35
we’re just going to keep throwing that word around huh…,2024-03-01 17:47:57
can finally erase sting in leather underpants from my mind,2024-03-02 17:50:47
yeah i loved the fact that he had to test his blades on real flesh and his  he keeps in tow appear to be fed only slaughtered  meats,2024-03-03 04:10:58
"i was worried about austin butler because ive found him too boybandish in previous movies but im happy to say i was wrong he played the role well

i like that all harkonnens have a growl to their voice",2024-03-04 22:02:18
he was my favorite i must read too much dark romance because i found feydrautha exceptionally attractive my toxic trait is thinking i could change him,2024-04-02 08:56:47
he was predictable all his story beats were boring and it didnt make sense that he was able to beat the drug free prisoner ,2024-03-01 10:00:58
yes he was actually pretty chill,2024-03-03 21:55:52
would be cool if this would explain the origin of the honoured matre order,2024-03-02 17:50:11
is it confirmed theyre making more,2024-03-02 07:33:01
are we actually getting other movies,2024-03-03 04:10:09
i like when it goes over the top at times because the books are over the top most times,2024-03-01 07:53:53
just a little bene gesserate voiceplay before hand,2024-03-01 07:39:35
when shes debriefing with her bene gesserit homies afterwards she says the bloodline is secure or something and holds her belly they do a lot of breeding of the noble houses,2024-03-10 02:19:18
have you read the books the harkonnens are meant to represent the absolute worst in human decadence and depravity which is meant to contrast against the atreides being paragons of honor and integrity they even toned down some aspects from the books such as the baron being a  being shocking is kind of the point,2024-03-03 14:41:47
my favorite line in the movie,2024-03-01 14:37:15
can you explain what this meant i was confused by it,2024-03-03 04:04:54
what does that even mean,2024-03-03 04:26:45
i legit teared up during that scene it wasnt sad more like  triumphant and intimidating but emotion definitely welled up,2024-03-11 00:48:17
absolutely loved that switch from im not the madhi guys to bow before me for i am the end times,2024-03-02 09:13:16
probably my favorite scene in the entire movie because its when he commands the fear of  into every tribal leader and also avoids having to   follow the rules by killing stilgar you can feel the power he wields in that scene just from the audio and cinematography fantastic,2024-03-02 01:58:07
it was his best scene in the movie he was absolutely captivating i knew it was y’know an omen of the coming bad times but i was smiling so big,2024-03-05 23:22:20
great scene  throughout the movie i couldnt help think at times  chalamet is kind of scrawny rather than a tall slim bad   im not buying him as a great warrior  but after that scene  lisan al gaib,2024-03-04 18:47:35
i legitimately teared up wasnt expecting to but something hit me there,2024-03-11 00:49:01
i never thought chalamet could give me chills but when he said dune i got tingly,2024-03-23 07:04:03
the craziest thing this filmed pulled off was making timothy chalamet seem badass,2024-03-03 03:22:38
using superstitious peoples beliefs against them is easy when you have the power to see across the arrow of time,2024-03-03 16:58:36
well that’s just sensible if i don’t kneel this guy is going to start reciting my browser history,2024-03-05 18:59:24
nothing like religious fervor and dead bodies to usher in a new dynasty of imperialism,2024-03-03 11:04:19
i dont get it he went from wanting to be accepted into the fremen fighting for a common cause and fearing their worship of him so they already did worship him to screaming for their fear and obedience what for esp if jessica already laid so much ground work,2024-03-05 13:52:29
im reading the wheel of time right now too,2024-03-03 00:07:52
" yes exactly 

my original comment was really mainly for the mom joke but im glad people also did a serious analysis of it haha",2024-03-12 01:31:47
thats because thats what he is its all a big  trick hes using sci fi drugs to gain information he might as well have someone on a radio reading facts into his ear,2024-03-03 03:48:42
villeneuve himself said he picked chalamet because he comes off so young on camera which is exactly what was needed in the first part of the story,2024-03-01 20:29:58
"perhaps chalamet deliberately leaned into the boyish humble portrayal extra hard

100 yes in one of the scene where theyre waiting outside of cave see his body language he was standing there awkwardly like doesnt know what to do with his legs he moves around and get closer to chani and friends we instantly feel that nervous energy because weve all been there so very deliberate indeed",2024-03-02 12:38:19
i mean yeah dune is a coming of age and coming into superpowers story so that does seem very likely its just good acting to do that,2024-03-01 13:23:27
you guys didnt watch the king and it shows,2024-03-01 17:28:58
my exact thoughts by having him seem so “sincere” and innocent it really highlights the contrast of him taking control of the fremen and accepting his role as their leadermessiah and forthcoming emperor of the known universe,2024-03-02 23:27:03
in the book there is definitely a shift after he crashes the ornithopter,2024-03-02 19:39:50
this was 100 by design,2024-03-03 07:42:45
that was the biggest thing denis said when making the first film he liked tims boyish quality,2024-03-03 16:42:19
pretty sure he did i watched the king before dune part 1 and he looks a lot older in the former when watching dune i was surprised he looked so young and boyish,2024-03-04 06:35:52
going into the first movie i had originally thought it was a really dumb casting decision oh how wrong i was,2024-03-12 09:02:40
yeah the first movie makes you forget that this actor is pushing 30 only for the second one to hammer it home he doesnt look any less young and twinkish but he suddenly carries himself with such force and authority,2024-03-01 14:03:29
anybody feel the walk swag looks similar to feyds bro tapped into his harkkonnen side to make it a win,2024-03-03 12:12:53
not to mention timbertree sportchalet being in the room with josh brolin and javier bardem as well,2024-03-01 11:32:05
i love how you butchered timothee’s name but got skaragaarfflsnad accurate,2024-03-10 07:46:01
yeah that movie sold him for dune well worth it,2024-03-03 11:54:26
hes really good in the king on netflix ,2024-03-02 02:36:06
hes already close hes now worked with  wes anderson dennis villeneuve christopher nolan and greta gerwig and he already has a best actor nomination,2024-03-14 04:24:01
even denis said it and he’s right him zendaya and florence are the next generation of superstars no one their age comes close,2024-03-07 10:40:20
you would think a theatre kid like him would have clearer diction,2024-03-03 01:07:12
i had the same feeling sitting in the theater like i havent seen an epic fantasy done this well on this scale since lotr both thought to be unadaptable im so ready to see the epic conclusion to the trilogy,2024-03-08 22:03:47
in some ways yes and in some a hard no dune will lack the lighthearted parts that will make people include it into their day to day life of course it will be popculturally important but to imbed itself as deep as lotr i doubt that,2024-03-11 00:05:11
"lotr released at a time where movie going was at an all time high dune pt 1 went to streaming first cause of a pandemic i remember rumors pt 2 might not have ever happened whereas lotr was a calculated gamble that filmed all at once

i had a group of zoomers behind me in the theater and they were just as engaged as any millennial  gen x  boomer that was in the theater",2024-03-04 06:51:40
people forget that lotr had plenty of fun characters too that you could root for and have a laugh with in dune like 95 of everyone is an  trying to  each other 2 wildly different stories and just because their scale is similar it doesn’t mean you could say they’re equals or have the same cultural impact,2024-03-07 07:18:19
agreed lotr was a genuine phenomenon dune is very popular especially in “film bro” circles like reddit  twitter but i would argue it’s not as wide reaching as lotr was the box office has been solid but it’s not even as big as your average peakmcu film,2024-03-04 14:20:21
its a shame scifi only wins technical oscars at least as far as i know,2024-03-10 23:20:07
i didnt like lotr but really liked dune,2024-03-05 21:16:07
as someone thats seen  all over titkok a lot of zoomers are also into dunebut to be fair i was maybe 6 or 7 when the lotr movies where taking off and i thought they were boring for years too but i still appreciated em,2024-03-10 03:29:02
why not this generations star wars,2024-03-03 23:51:10
same same,2024-03-07 01:30:06
that 3rd film will literally be epic space battle after epic space battle and denis directing it sign me the  please,2024-03-20 23:34:22
agreed the visuals are great but everything else is well short,2024-04-08 04:19:49
what “people” this post is full of praise for him so i think the majority response is positive,2024-03-01 15:10:09
with the slow panturn of his head as well i was laughing imagining the handprint,2024-03-02 00:06:24
yeah for real that slap sound must’ve been added in post because no shot he didn’t even have a mark after that one,2024-03-03 08:06:17
i think i can make a steelman arguement for why that makes sense jessica says his vitals are so low theyre practically unnoticeable maybe he just doesnt have the blood flow that soon coming out of the trance,2024-03-11 10:13:51
he absolutely deserved that slap he lied to chani and was manipulated by his mom to make paul what he said he wouldn’t become he’s a ,2024-03-05 05:30:48
its crazy how you know why people laughed,2024-03-03 20:10:34
"keep your moms prophecy out mah  life

dont forget the operatic woman too the scene ultimately works but  does it have that cheese",2024-03-02 06:25:44
the perk of being chief pantheon ’s wife huh,2024-03-02 17:37:12
each to their own but i felt disenchanted by the slap felt like a very american response,2024-03-03 15:26:36
lols she ran off to get a bandaid,2024-03-02 05:06:12
tbf shes dating tom holland not exactly a bad alternative lol,2024-03-20 23:27:51
we stani,2024-03-02 20:57:31
honestly when she showed up on screen it was kind of a jump scare didnt know she was in this,2024-03-01 03:34:36
"true

 she looks almost but not quite human",2024-03-02 22:33:37
cant wait to see how they include her as a child in dune messiah for part 3 maybe like how they added hugh grants head to an oompa lumpa body in wonka,2024-03-01 14:33:44
those bulbous eyes haunt my nightmares,2024-03-01 21:36:19
its the eyes,2024-03-03 12:29:26
it’s in the eyes chico the eyes they never lie,2024-03-03 11:12:08
i thought that fetus had wide eyes,2024-03-03 16:00:43
i managed to avoid that news and it was a iaw dropping moment for me,2024-03-02 15:02:17
i wish reddit still had awards because i would award this comment so hard,2024-03-05 00:21:22
1010 would be driven mad by,2024-03-05 01:48:38
bruh,2024-03-01 09:27:32
it was unnerving too  felt very rosemarys baby,2024-03-01 03:36:49
it’s so weird yet makes total sense in this universe,2024-03-01 06:07:56
haha yea and you see even the devout followers getting creeped out a bit,2024-03-01 22:03:16
she even had to tell her to shut up at one point,2024-03-05 19:16:17
i sorta assumed this was part of the prophecy as well,2024-03-01 06:13:40
i am so ready for anya taylorjoy to go back to her horror roots and play abomination alia though  i hope they could do children of dune,2024-03-01 05:45:05
non book readers ain’t ready for abomination anya,2024-03-01 07:27:03
loved jessicas little eye twitch as if saying yeah so,2024-03-02 07:17:13
paul bomb the nation sure thing boss,2024-03-02 00:02:06
where else does this happen,2024-03-01 13:48:27
i think it would have been hard to portray alia as she is in the book without running into a cgi renesmee kind of issue like its maybe a bit hard to do without being cheesy or cringe i guess they transferred people being weirded out by the allknowing baby to chani getting creeped out by the level of reverence for paul and general nonbelievers,2024-03-02 12:39:21
i thought it was a great choice having a toddler running around with centuries of memories and knowledge would have just come across kinda hokey i was actually a little worried about it beforehand,2024-03-02 04:06:42
" paul was just like oh my sisterfetus is chatting with you thats cool whats it saying 

and then after drinking the water he could speak with her too",2024-03-03 18:51:53
i watched the movie high so correct me if i’m wrong but did i interpret it correctly that jessica at first was losing faith in paul as the kwisatz then switched to the sister she said “the kwisatz haderach will be born in the south” but then switched back to paul after he drank and survived the liquid and turned emperormode,2024-03-04 14:24:11
baby got special abomination powers from the water,2024-03-01 05:39:36
"in dune sometimes people are born as “abominations” when jessica transmuted the water of life she gained the memories of all the reverend mothers before her  the memories of all her maternal ancestors because alia was in utero when she gained those memories alia also gained the prescience powers  memories that jessica got in addition to knowledge of the voice fighting style survival skills etc

just imagine for a minute how  creepy it would be to make baby noises at a newborn only to have them quote the book of revelations at you in perfect english now tack on psychic powers and supernatural knowledge additionally abominations are vulnerable to being possessed by their ancestors so if the baby happens to be a descendent of genghis khan whole new level of terrifying",2024-03-01 05:54:23
people already gave you the answer but ill add the the  addition that theres a passage where alia described how frightened she was during the ceremony because she was suddenly filled with consciousness while still trapped in rebeccas pitch black  and had no idea  was going on or why she couldnt move at first,2024-03-01 07:54:19
"it was because she drank the water of life blue juice while pregnant alia the baby was basically jump started into consciousness in the  while simultaneously gaining all the millennia of past memories from previous reverend mothers along with jessica minor spoiler coming up for the next books but i don’t know how to do the block out thing










she also gains some prescience of her own but not at the level of paul’s",2024-03-01 05:40:57
the baby gained full awareness and the memory of all her ancestors while still in the   youre not supposed to do it while pregnant because babies that get all that power and knowledge usually dont turn out well,2024-03-01 11:50:29
in an instant the undeveloped mind of a baby gained millennia of knowledge and had that be its first experience of consciousness essentially a  in human form,2024-03-02 22:59:12
your self is the summation of all your memories and experience the baby has none of that and now has like a thousand generations of old lady memory crammed into it the baby has no base to fall back on to float and is swamped by all this other  from predecessors it is overwhelming and a unpreparedweakened mind is at the mercy of strong memories its not a stable combo,2024-03-03 06:06:11
i also love how bardems portrayal of stilgar as the movie progressed became more and more fervent and fanatical  he started the movie as eh maybe youre him ultimately to let me offer my life to you just so you can speak in this gathering,2024-03-01 06:14:17
and its so grim a scene in retrospect,2024-03-01 04:00:29
right i love that portrayal like a boomer leaving a facebook comment lol,2024-03-01 05:00:59
"only the true madhi denies his own divinity

well what sort of a chance does that give me alright then i am the madhi

he is his is the madhi",2024-03-01 09:06:07
when he did the mind blown hand gesture was the funniest part of the film,2024-03-01 07:36:38
"i think there was a hard cut to that too

paul i’m not mahdi

cut to

stilgar he’s so humble such a mahdi thing to say

fundamentalists i know right",2024-03-02 21:49:54
hes not the kwisatz haderach hes a very naughty boy,2024-03-02 04:00:48
"really did a great job of characterizing a religious genetic and not making them a bumbling fool or intangibly evilcruel 

braden gave such a humanity to the character",2024-03-01 15:11:35
absolutely ive read the first book and for some reason it didnt totally click that theyre basically space muslims but his portrayal really drove that home,2024-03-03 05:39:47
bardem with the unintentional incredible comedic timing on those line reads,2024-03-02 01:37:32
same the whole crowd cracked up and looked around at eachother great moment,2024-03-03 00:51:40
i lost it at that didnt think thered be much humour in the movie,2024-03-07 13:57:22
but stilgar isnt always that way in the novel  hes slowly converted from an independent leader to a creature of the lisanalgaib and its one of the things that makes paul afraid,2024-03-06 18:40:45
"i got a dirty look for laughing at that line hahaha 


i had liked the movie but my theater audience made me feel like things i was laughing at weren’t intentionally funny and in my head made me question if the lines weren’t meant to be funny and therefor kinda bad 

i’m glad i had my initial reaction reaffirmed here lol",2024-03-18 04:08:57
except stilgar was not one of the blind fanatical he later holds pauls children in his hands and entertains the thought of murdering them ,2024-03-04 00:18:37
its such a good riff on that joke to play it utterly straight,2024-03-01 04:02:58
oh it was definitely life of brian,2024-03-01 04:58:31
you are all individuals,2024-03-01 13:25:37
“he isn’t the mahdi he’s a very naughty boy”,2024-03-01 16:17:00
people at my screening laughed at that line and i totally took that as validation that they recalled life of brian,2024-03-01 20:41:06
i don’t know it’s terrifying but i think it’s still often played as a joke it was just ridiculous to the point of humor but because it was still believable it made it also scary,2024-03-02 01:18:46
i say youre the mahdi lord and i should know ive followed a few,2024-03-02 02:17:13
one of the last scenes of him entering the ship will yelling got the point across vividly,2024-03-02 02:24:09
"this scene  

  
",2024-03-03 21:23:56
but im not the messiah,2024-03-05 21:00:57
"and of course the cinematography that scene right at the beginning with the harkonnen dropship contrasted against the sand and the sky might as well have just said buckle up for almost three hours of this

but we already knew itd be like that",2024-03-01 03:53:48
the last one after he kills rautha was one of the funniest moments ive seen in a while stilgar seemed so eager to just spurt it out and not let the moment pass,2024-03-01 13:40:41
kind of reminded me of 2016 as well how it all started as a meme and then the guy actually got elected,2024-03-01 15:47:10
that scene was portrayed as something sinister and terrifying and it was incredible chalamet did a good job instead of sounding cocky like a kid he sounded angry you want me to be your messiah fine ill be your messiah and bathe the galaxy in blood fergusons jessica expertly paved the way too,2024-03-01 04:46:10
i haven’t read the books but i think he is not the mahdilisan al gaib but kwisatz haderach as i understand mahdi was made up by the bene gesserit to keep the fremen under control while kwisatz haderach is actually real so later on he is using the mahdi prophecy to reach his purposes,2024-03-02 22:52:51
its probaby hard to be humble when you can literally see all futures and how to get to them  you truly would be the one with the know it all ,2024-03-03 03:48:25
“… how shall we  oh mahdi”,2024-03-01 04:21:36
thats interesting how those people would view that movie,2024-03-03 18:34:05
as long as “no country” exists ,2024-03-01 12:24:47
absolutely not but it did solidly him as maybe my favorite actor ever,2024-03-01 14:26:12
no this is my favorite bardem performance ,2024-03-01 06:45:12
"paul farts hot  hard

x200b

stilgar  lisan  al  gaib ",2024-03-03 03:49:51
because jesus wasnt humble about being the son of ,2024-04-01 05:18:14
“let him cook”,2024-03-01 04:51:38
it was but i got choked up at seeing gurney so proud of paul for embodying the duke the house of atreides needed,2024-03-02 04:08:49
meanwhile jessica being like woah slow your roll kid maybe oh never mind actually you seem to have this fanatical holy war schtick down even better than me go off,2024-03-02 18:14:02
there were so many scenes that the trailer gave us an incomplete version of like the assassins line from the emperor and indeed chania being comically pulled down right after a weighty line,2024-03-01 18:27:57
she was warned but her skepticism failed her it was sad to see her have to suffer through becoming a  in a game she never wanted to be a part of,2024-03-02 04:15:57
gurney was hilarious with  yeah religion psycho cult use it,2024-03-03 18:56:16
only for him to eventually stand and smile at paul with the face of a fanatic heartbreaking,2024-03-04 00:38:01
"path to victory is inevitable  

at least he didn’t go full viego when chani died imagine that",2024-03-02 02:18:50
that was worth the price of the ticket for me,2024-04-10 06:09:53
i’m just happy he overruled that  “ the leader to be leader” tradition haha,2024-03-01 05:01:35
his voice when not speaking english was genuinely so commanding i wanted to follow him to battle,2024-03-01 06:39:04
yeah that scene gave me chills i did not expect that from him at all,2024-03-01 06:30:01
watch the king if you havent he already showed he could be a master at these types of character arcs,2024-03-01 18:26:01
i’ve rewatched his speech from the king 100 times i love his performance there this one jumps over it his delivery weaving through both languages gave me goosebumps probably had goosebumps for the last 90 minutes of the movie straight to be honest,2024-03-02 04:50:48
my partner and i were talking about that as we left the theater when he finally decides to wield the religious power he’s been offered it’s kind of shocking how quickly his entire presence transforms when he starts giving violent speeches in that booming voice it’s hard to believe it’s even the same actor really impressive performance,2024-03-03 12:38:13
walkin through the crowd of fremen with a presence like he was about to drop the hottest album of the year,2024-03-02 03:34:54
i loved how he literally turned into a badass and i mean he sold me he literallyi wouldnt  with him,2024-03-02 12:37:35
totally hes developed as an actor in these movies i was skeptical at first but  hes proven himself,2024-03-03 03:27:45
i think thats what makes that scene so scary hes tim chalamet the most baby faced young dude in hollywood when he starts calling people to war it hits more than if it was a more traditionally rugged actor,2024-03-03 16:24:18
same that was the main thing i was tentative about can chalamet reach the level intensity needed thought he did a great job,2024-03-03 01:31:55
i was sold on him as a  ruthless leader after watching the king on netflix he cooked so hard in this film,2024-03-04 23:23:02
he’s good in the king playing a similar role if you enjoyed him in this,2024-03-05 16:15:32
you should watch the king he was fantastic in that,2024-03-06 22:06:44
honestly when he spoke fremen it reminded me a lot of how much presence emilia clarke had when speaking dothraki loved it,2024-03-10 19:52:35
yup,2024-03-02 12:16:57
the film helped him but he sure did step up i also didnt think he could show intimidation but it worked,2024-03-03 21:35:36
definitely did not but his robes helped ,2024-03-04 00:20:50
"100 

we started out with paultc as a young and insecure teenager in dune pt 1 but paultc in dune pt 2 is a terrifying man he was so tall against that fremen when he drank the water of life and his whole attitude shift after drinking was amazing to see",2024-03-04 16:02:02
and that as a call back to when the duke keeps his head of security after finding the harkonnen assassin in the concrete,2024-03-01 06:57:58
same thing his dad did in part one when he didn’t accept his general’s resignation ,2024-03-02 08:54:03
and also as a im the mehdi i make the rules,2024-03-02 02:44:50
i also loved that line it was a nice contrast to the culture and structure of the fremen society that paul is a part of but still outside of previously in the film paul kind of ran with all of it but he clearly was like  no in this moment,2024-03-03 00:39:06
he said that almost exactly in the book,2024-03-03 21:42:39
“look at me i’m the protocol now”,2024-03-05 19:18:31
it was a great nod to new testament stories of jesus arguing with the pharisees about jewish law very fitting in a messanic story,2024-03-11 03:57:22
thats what happens when you finally drink the koolaid er worm juice,2024-03-01 06:17:53
i mean he did warn  imma go 11 once there,2024-03-01 05:33:29
he said hold me back and they didn’t listen smh,2024-03-01 23:47:33
and i took that personally  michael jordan  paul,2024-03-01 08:18:24
kiss the  ring ,2024-03-03 04:05:53
i felt like i missed something it felt like in one scene he was insisting going south was not an option for him and a scene later he was just strolling on down did i miss something in between that changed his mind,2024-03-03 23:13:21
i dont really understand why he drank the juice it didnt seem like there was any pressure to do it,2024-03-03 21:08:49
see i’m not entirely sure all that talk about not going south wasn’t just performative he started out saying he had to sway the nonbelievers and it looked like he chose the path of “reluctant hero” to manipulatewin them over even the confrontation with his mother was pretty public and likely part of the ruse,2024-03-05 16:42:38
bro said “i am the danger” with his whole chest,2024-03-11 03:12:53
the whole third act makes you remember that while paul is the protagonist it doesnt exactly mean hes a hero,2024-03-01 08:12:04
this is the anakin story we didnt quite get with the sequels,2024-03-01 08:09:06
this whole movie made me sad the sw films arent better between the harkonnen family and the bg mind tricking everyone its a shame weve not seen sith have the gravitas and imposing presence they deserve only vader comes anywhere close and really just in that one scene at the end of r1,2024-03-01 18:57:53
him and his mom had anakinpalpy energy ,2024-03-02 12:27:24

interesting that baron harkonen also name dropped the fremen name for it in the first film,2024-03-01 13:44:07
what are we some kind of dune squad,2024-03-03 02:48:20
 chills just thinking about it,2024-03-01 20:14:54
did people gasp for real here in sweden no one made a sound  but were always quiet in the cinema,2024-03-03 00:29:48
i  gasped  one of the best title drop moments ever everything about that scene was powerfully done what an insanely great cast it really feels like so much of the movie is literally lifted out of the books from my brain,2024-03-09 03:01:33
roll credits,2024-03-04 23:37:23
i certainly gasped it worked,2024-03-05 23:25:03
i didnt get that part a girls name was dune so the franchise is named dune,2024-03-01 08:06:23
roll credits,2024-03-03 09:04:42
ive been a chalamet doubter but the dude nailed his role in this movie that scene had me apologizing in my head for doubting him,2024-03-01 08:27:42
he didnt just act like he wanted the throne he wanted the throne he needed the throne,2024-03-01 03:52:41

idk if its cause of the framing from reading grippin gfs thigh but i read  instead of direction and it fully made sense to me,2024-03-25 18:17:11
i mean it was very faithful to the book they win the battle almost immediately there as well,2024-03-01 23:38:09
still disappointed the dinner scene was left out in 1  hope it exists in outtakes somewhere,2024-03-01 14:37:36
that was maybe the only time i felt like there was too much restraint theres probably more buildup to the fight than the actual battle,2024-03-01 22:38:20
the 8 hour directors cut of both movies stitched together will be legendary,2024-03-02 19:48:36
herbert has said the ending was meant be intentional schlock and sort of a parody of action or something along those lines he specifically said schlock though i believe,2024-03-03 23:13:17
dune part ii extended edition,2024-03-01 14:31:45
yeah i need like 35 more mins of fremen vs sardukar there i know they were supposed to basically dominate the battle but they were inside the palace quite suddenly minor complaint though movie was still fantastic,2024-03-04 14:09:41
"idd the siege was too short not enough worms
where is the directors cut i need it in my veins",2024-03-04 10:58:35
i think it was perfect i think as an audience we are desensitized to the sweeping epic battle scene… there have been so many since lotr they have gotten totally played out,2024-03-03 17:36:01
lol,2024-03-03 19:04:51
i dont know what you think siege means but that aint a siege,2024-03-04 11:24:11
this is exactly how i feel about this movie it felt like the sort of movie that only comes around every couple of decades truly special within the first fifteen minutes i was like completely blown away,2024-03-02 03:35:15
those were harkonnen in that scene sorry not trying to be picky,2024-03-02 01:46:28
i read dune messiah over the weekend right after seeing part 2  its a pretty significant change in tone but i absolutely love the ending in that book i would be totally fine with dvs dune being a trilogy and not the full series,2024-03-04 18:26:42
that first scene was absolutely brilliant  reminded me of the famous border scene from sicario  what an awesome bit to grab you into the world ,2024-03-04 13:56:11
i anticipated this and booked two screening on two back to back days today was the imax version tomorrow on dolby i might do a 3rd consecutive day lol,2024-03-01 18:59:58
this movie has a lot of rewatchability for me it is like when the dark knight was released and i watched it multiple times,2024-03-02 23:10:19
"ive looked at my watch after 40 minutes of the movie somehow it felt kind of slow    
then paul mounted the worm and the scene imax viewing has like physically pushed me into my chair    
next time i looked at my watch after the ending scene i could not believe how fast those 2 last hours flew by    
what a movie",2024-03-14 10:50:15
this is how i felt watching it certain things needed a bit more explanation and if i didnt know the ending was based on a book i would have thought it was bit clicherushedetc,2024-03-09 16:25:39
i would happily sacrifice 30 min from act for 30 min in act 3 there was nothing wrong with act 1 but act 3 really needed some more breathing room,2024-03-03 21:21:03
you gotta do a fluid restriction before going i was dehydrated as  but i survived the whole thing without needing to get up,2024-03-03 22:07:44

i had to leave during the geidi prime scene for my bladder even tho i cleared everything before going in my wife told me i would regret it right after i came back,2024-03-16 08:33:02
i would have watched an entire movie of him just feeding that dog,2024-03-01 13:10:22
facts,2024-03-01 10:21:53
absolutely the pacing in part 1 was much better than the pacing in part 2 im also annoyed they didnt really show pauls powers like they did in part 1 in part 2 they just tell you but in part 1 they showed you,2024-03-03 21:24:14
ok im glad im not the only one who thought this i was loving the movie till paul drank the water of life everything after that felt so rushed and kinda spoiled my enjoyment of the movie i wish there was even another 20 minutes to flesh out all of those scenes,2024-03-09 16:39:42
stilgar disapproves of releasing your water,2024-03-14 23:17:25
they’re not really in the book though,2024-03-05 04:31:02
"that’s just how “the voice” works in the books  it’s one of the things that makes dune so hard to adapt to film  

the books sort of explain that it’s not some superpower it’s just being so incredibly articulate and having such an incredible command of rhetoric that you can basically force people to do anything by simply saying the right thing in the right way  the book explains that everyone ultimately does it all the time  it’s basically the purpose of language  

i could probably “force” you to punch me in the face if i insulted you in certain manner  i could “force” someone to fall in love with me if i understood them and said the right things 

“the voice” is basically just comprehensive perception combined with a total command of rhetoric  the people who are really good at it are simply clever people who have been trained to understand the subtleties of verbal communication to the point that it’s essentially a superpower  it’s easier to explain that in a book than on screen",2024-03-01 15:17:31

it’s incredible considering how big their mouths are,2024-03-01 11:36:42
does that make them the waymo of arrakis then,2024-03-24 05:18:45
i believe you wait until they get tired,2024-03-01 03:32:21
my recollection of the books is very hazy but i recall one passage which suggested they basically tire them out and another that might have implied that they leave the hook in to prevent the worm from diving and becoming a predator again  no warranties on decades old memory though,2024-03-01 03:42:47
yeah the movie provided a visually appealing sand ride but not one that makes sense like the book explains  basically the worm slows on the surface so the first one up steers the worm back to the group who climb up the side using their hooks like mountain climbersin lynchs they drop ropes  as for getting off its the opposite  they climb back down and jump off  only the first on is different and runs towards the tail as the worm burrows and then jumps off,2024-03-01 03:55:56
i want to know how they got the big basket jessica was sitting inside on the worm,2024-03-01 13:52:08
or how they load 20 people on them with cargo and  palanquins  they built a  burning man camp on top of the worms wheres the worm loading station,2024-03-02 05:54:43
lol and there was also 100 people on one at one point ,2024-03-01 05:40:49
thats something i wanted to see when they showed pauls first worm ridethey never showed it in the film   i was thinking they jump off when they get near where they want to go,2024-03-01 04:45:14
also no idea how they get like 50 people set up on the same worm it took paul all he had to hang on to one,2024-03-01 23:13:20
how do they get jessicas palanquin on it,2024-03-02 12:32:04
hit the ol sandspin shuffle,2024-03-01 03:50:14
i have no idea how they get the whole gang on there with the travel basket,2024-03-02 19:41:55
everyone except the person controlling them jumps off and then the worm rider rides them to exhaustion before finally jumping off themself,2024-03-02 04:26:55
you yeet just yeet yourself into oblivion and pray,2024-03-04 09:19:08
exactly what my friend was asking me how tf do you apply the brakes,2024-03-03 10:12:51
the first time you see jessica and all her luggage on the sand taxi was amazing,2024-03-03 10:50:57
"i was wondering the same thing every time they were wormriding hey thanks this is my stop 
like how do you get off",2024-03-04 13:27:57
they stop where the pin stops,2024-03-01 11:36:11
i want to know how they get multiple people on at the same time let alone jessicas palaquin,2024-03-06 03:01:38
how do multiple people get on with supplies and all,2024-03-07 03:52:09
im sure they just pull over in a bike lane and put their blinkers on,2024-03-13 04:00:57
it’s only gonna cost you your life if you fail to attach and steady yourself ,2024-03-01 03:34:20
still costs an arm and a leg,2024-03-01 11:29:32
no surge pricing,2024-03-01 03:44:07
ain’t that the  truth,2024-03-01 04:28:47
this was my gripe as well they cant circle back for more people the worms are so long  as well as supplies  jessicas little pod thing,2024-03-07 03:53:18
they never showed it godfamit,2024-03-04 00:18:57
"they seem to steer them with the hooks opening and closing that flap of skin seems to reveal some kind of hole that keeps the worm on the surface instead of diving under the sand

theres a part where paul diverts slightly on a worm so they definitely have control over them instead of just straight ahead i imagine closing one side of that flap of skin would force the worm to turn a certain way or something",2024-03-01 11:04:39
the hooks lift up the scaly bits which expose sensitive parts underneath and the worm responds by rotating to keep the exposed parts away from the sand that allows the fremen to steer and keep from being crushed between the worm and the ground,2024-03-02 15:54:24
definitely meant as a bit of a comic relief moment that turns far darker in retrospect as we see what it leads to,2024-03-01 21:06:27
same but i was confused  ive read the books and every scene with stilgar in it was furthering his character down the path of religious fanaticism  it didnt play humorously for me  i even asked my brother why people were laughing,2024-03-03 13:37:22
" i dont know if that was the intention but that was the one time my audience let out a quiet laugh

absolutely was stilgar is funny af in this movie not much humor to be had in dune so its a good departure from the terrible",2024-03-16 01:15:57

silo is great with her,2024-03-02 07:13:09

reeeeebecca fergusoooooooooon she dips beneath the lasers cooling torus,2024-03-01 23:37:23
without spoiling anything i do worry how silo will go when theres massive amounts of story to be told that doesnt involve her character at all,2024-03-02 11:21:09
rose the hat does it for me,2024-03-03 04:08:30
as a swede its so fun seeing swedish actors act their  off on a stage this big both her and stellan skarsgård are amazing,2024-03-04 12:10:14
you see it,2024-03-01 05:56:42

thats actually my favorite mi movie for that reason as well and i never tire of it,2024-03-10 20:44:31
i really didnt enjoy her character in silo but i think that was more an issue with the show than her own abilities,2024-03-24 03:12:30
oh yes i have hottest villain ever,2024-03-01 07:15:51
rose the hat is one of my alltime villains ferguson embodied her so well,2024-03-01 16:25:56

mine is mission impossible 5 that sniping in a theater is iconic,2024-03-02 07:46:07
oh no,2024-03-03 19:07:55
remember how the hooks pull up a segment of worm flesh  scale if i recall correctly the worms dont want sand to get into the wounds so they stick to the surface and they automatically orient themselves so the wound is pointing up as far away from the dunes as possible,2024-04-02 07:18:01
"as a nonreader this really struck me as an odd thing too but everything else is so good i can look past it

how do they steer these things i guess using a beaconlure for where they want to arrive but yea how do they not just dive underground",2024-04-01 12:23:32

dont worry it was just the screen turning on its shield,2024-03-10 15:06:08
its weird because its a mishmash of all abrahamaic religions on purpose have you read the books the religions have heavy islamic identity but its translated from the orange catholic bible lol,2024-03-02 00:14:05
maybe in the fact that he’s a warlord,2024-03-21 17:25:12
it’s paul thinking that the entire time in the books he does everything he can to avoid the jihad and then rejects the golden path,2024-03-01 03:55:03
i don’t exactly remember but in the book i don’t think chani is concerned at all by paul’s decision to marry the princess at the end i haven’t read messiah though so maybe it’s addressed in there,2024-03-01 03:52:26
"i loved the feeling of dread in the movie like on the book of the inevitable death and negativity that feels unstoppable 

really flet that feeling in the book and the movie imo really convays that",2024-03-01 05:50:43
" i love how denis made chani an actual voice of reason

i actually love the changes to chani in the movie in the book she was too complacent but being the part of paul that wants the prophecy to not come true was really well made

i feel like her leaving after him ascending might set up for a good way to end dune messiah adaptation",2024-03-02 18:50:16
yeah chanis opposition to the messiah prophecy improves her as a character makes their relationship much more interesting in the book shes barely more than a  for carrying pauls kids and improves the story as a whole,2024-03-02 19:43:52
i feel like the book has a bigger emphasis on fate where dune 2 is focused on the individuals making their own decisions it’s a dynamic that i’m sure figuring out if i like or not,2024-03-01 04:01:35
i agree i love the books but i really appreciate how denis made chani into a character and that tries to center paul,2024-03-01 12:03:49
same another reason i prefer denis take to herberts so so happy that chani remained loyal to her beliefs till the end even if it cost her the love of her life,2024-03-01 04:05:55
its paul in the book hes in a constant internal struggle about it but that doesnt really translate to screen well,2024-03-02 04:29:13
i agree film chani  book chani in my opinion,2024-03-01 04:10:14
paul is the voice of reason in the novel as is jessica and stilgar and gurney they are all wise people who can consider the pros and cons of action or inaction jessica is not an evil witch who leads him to jihad the movie really abandoned the character motivations and relationships from the book in the second movie,2024-03-01 16:20:32
chani’s entire face going “what could possibly go wrong” was hilarious,2024-03-02 02:21:43
radical athiest chani was awesome to watch,2024-03-01 08:00:05
that’s a genius decision tbh it was the emotional core of the movie imo,2024-03-02 20:09:07
im trying to remember if chani had any other role in the book than being pauls true love despite marrying the princess,2024-03-03 02:41:13
yeah pretty much every change around chani and there are a lot is an outstanding choice absolutely love everything they did with the character here,2024-03-04 00:38:04
"fully agree its a good change for the character

are we the baddies energy lol",2024-03-05 01:20:17
eh paul’s mother is pretty reluctant to have paul go down that path in the books she sees the necessity of his actions but knows the consequences ,2024-03-09 01:40:14
leto is also the only one who is content with paul choosing his own way and who doesnt need him to be anything other than his son ,2024-03-02 01:12:05
and no more silent worried handwringing for jessica she doesn’t hope she plans,2024-03-02 16:52:28
did she assume the knowledge of all previous rev mothers of the fremen what exactly has she plotted thats to advance the interests of the fremen,2024-03-05 14:07:18
another quick one i noticed the first shot of part 2 is of a harkonnen soldier using a flamethrower to burn a pile of atreides bodies near the end of the film after the fremen defeat the harkonnens and sarduakar there is a brief scene of them using a flamethrower to burn their enemies’ bodies,2024-03-06 09:19:26
as far as gurney is concerned atreides are all already destroyed they have nothing to lose it is a pure act of vengeance,2024-03-01 09:29:46
in the book the emperor says as much to paul but paul retorts that using weapons directly on humans is what is actually outlawed and that he instead used them on the mountain to “make a path through the storm” people definitely died in the blastrock fallout in the movie but the closeness of the explosion is intentionally meant to be up for debate in the book paul splits hairs on a technicality ,2024-03-05 07:19:18
except the only vioce of reason here is chani and she might not even know wouldnt makes sense for gurney to bring that up,2024-03-01 18:38:39
man you guys are going to love the third one when its eventually made lol,2024-03-01 05:50:42
i think it makes a lot of sense considering how she treats spoiler alia in the next book,2024-03-01 06:55:11
her  expressions throughout the final knife duel were amazing all of her reactions to what paul said or did displayed so many different emotions at once,2024-03-06 09:28:09
so that means theyre starting the war with the other houses like right now are those ships theyve got capable of outfighting everyone i know how it turns out in the books but it seems a bit much from just the short shots we saw,2024-03-02 14:46:37
i loved how psychotic they made him in this  was ready to  the emperor right then and there all for petty revenge galactic geopolitics be  damned everyone can stop trying now we have found nerddoms michael corleone,2024-03-01 03:50:59
"some book purist are upset about it i like it for a film adaption because it ties together to paul more personally in a very not personal book paul avenged his father it’s easier for the general audience to take that win 

i did the like the glimpse we had of alia i only wish it was longer i could see a scene for the actress talks to paul longer maybe takes his hand “i love you brother” was a good scene however brief but i wish we could have seen more",2024-03-01 03:53:38
"while alia not being born is a little weird that implies everything happens in less than 9 months which is weird as its several years in the book its probably a good choice the adult behaving babytoddler would be weird as  on screen

for that specific part paul killing him makes more sense to close the revenge arc for his father",2024-03-01 08:36:21
and gurney getting some harrkonan revenge,2024-03-01 07:23:33
yeah i love alia killing the baron bc of where her storyline goes in the novels but translating her to film like that would’ve been a disaster renesmee from twilight comes to mind when i try to picture it,2024-03-02 01:45:43
i think the best way to adapt it would have been to have jessica do it at the urgingencouragement of the unborn alia being the one to  the baron is an important moment in setting up alias story and while theyll be able to write around it it feels like a missed opportunity,2024-03-01 20:42:24
yeah it mightve been a step too far for some audiences having a creepy little toddler running around and then murdering her grandfather i think it worked well having jessica just communicate with her in the  instead,2024-03-02 01:50:04
the entire way they handled alia was the right decision having paul be the one to  baron was icing on the movieversion cake though one of the best adapted screenplays in a long time imo,2024-03-02 03:10:25
yeah it worked for me the only issue i take is that it compresses the narrative a bit the back half of the book takes place over several years which is a bit more plausible than the 7 months or so the second movie takes,2024-03-02 14:38:45
it’s way better imo,2024-03-02 06:25:16
the part where alia kills the baron might be my favorite in the entire book but i totally get why they changed it and it worked very well pauls line to him is so  cold,2024-03-02 15:40:39
they could’ve had jessica  him too at the will of alia imagine her stabbing him and jessica speaks with alia’s voice “for my duke”,2024-03-04 13:42:57
not me i thought it was an incredibly interesting death  my theater literally booed at the entire end confrontation and i have to agree with them,2024-03-01 04:18:22
someone pointed out that in the first movie the blow paul lands to  jamis is a bullfighting dodge,2024-03-01 12:12:16
lol same the coolness was lost on me,2024-03-01 04:20:05
i thought he said “for my father… you die like an animal” for that same reason music was loud af,2024-03-01 03:57:23
"i watched it twice and i didn’t get the line each time only now realizing what it was 

i think it’s the only line i found hard to hear in the movie",2024-03-01 08:20:44
i watched it in imax and it was loud as  but the music being louder is only half the problem the actors dont  enunciate,2024-03-01 04:28:46
agreed  i caught it barely  i was shocked they didn’t tuck the score back a hair for such an impactful line,2024-03-01 17:02:29
i will set it freeeee,2024-03-01 08:46:58
what’s he in for,2024-03-01 13:14:50
just left an imax showing 100 worth seeing in imax,2024-03-02 03:32:51
bro howd you go twice already haha nice,2024-03-01 07:08:42
agreed saw it again today and timothee and austin really shined on a second viewing ,2024-03-03 12:30:06
foley,2024-03-01 22:45:41
"the line of pauls about being horrified that he might gain control wasnt an idle one 

ive never seen a movie where the protagonist— and all the good guy characters— won everything and got everything they wanted 
and have such such an overwhelming feeling of dread",2024-03-01 20:51:17
i also agree with you zimmer overused certain motifs too much in both films to the point they were less impactful than they should have been by the time a true climax is reached,2024-03-06 14:55:42
 dev patel as paul would be so incredible,2024-03-01 06:58:28
nah simu liu wouldve been perfect ,2024-03-01 10:08:15
i honestly sont know if this or call me by your name blew me away more but they were both incredible,2024-03-01 17:46:28
his performance in the king is what sold me on him plus his war speech in that is like a medieval lisan alghaib,2024-03-04 02:54:21
hyperbole is a dangerous drug try not to overdose,2024-03-13 11:37:51
he was also frankly awesome in wonka which is a distinctly different role and shows just how good he is,2024-03-21 10:55:07
hes been like this since call me by your name in 2017,2024-03-03 01:22:35
what’s the next one bob dylan,2024-03-07 10:49:58
i agree about austin but timmy is just on a completely different planet right now,2024-03-02 22:47:20
he was good in wonka too tbh,2024-03-10 03:56:33
my favorite part in that is the subtle end where he gains his footing with the massive crescendo that was the moment i thought timothee would lead them to paradise ,2024-03-01 03:33:38
thats totally different ive done both and riding the sandworms was much harder ill never forget my spring break trip in arrakis,2024-03-02 04:09:26
trying to get up on a wakeboard with the boat pulling you water smashing in to your whole body and face  yet you hold onand stand up,2024-03-01 06:01:28
i had the same feeling except about snowboarding lol,2024-03-01 04:03:19
surfing is exactly what i thought of then i immediately remembered how tough wiping out is and imagined doing it on a  200ft dune,2024-03-02 00:05:38
i love the ‘80s movie but when paul rides the worm  it gives off major “teenager getting his drivers license in a coming of age movie” vibes stakes were much higher here even if you ultimately knew he would live,2024-03-01 06:05:47
i thought my first time standing up as well,2024-03-01 12:13:21
i actually had a similar feeling but around my memories of whitewater kayaking,2024-03-02 03:28:15
same in the theater like “gotta pop up dude”,2024-03-07 05:17:43
that scene made me think of surf movies to compare it the lynch version 60s surf scenes of guys wobbling in front of a rear projected wave are to actually filming a guy in the water as 85 dune is to 24 dune,2024-03-03 03:23:22
dude same thats nuts the sound changing as your head goes under and up from the water felt like paddling out or taking a set on the head and then he launches off that giant dune with the worm i had that rush you get when you pop up on a big wave,2024-03-14 06:28:25
agree i had flashbacks to wakeboarding,2024-03-07 09:01:51
for me its emerging from the water on a wakeboard for this first time  when you dont know what the downforce feels like,2024-03-25 17:16:03
every time they rode one i kept hoping they would show the deboarding process,2024-03-01 04:55:08
i’m kinda mad i didn’t see it in imax,2024-03-01 03:25:47
i assumed they just stepped off like a boss after the worms goes under the sand  easier that way i guess,2024-03-01 22:28:07
i’ve pretty much made my ticket purchases based on the sandworms and have yet to be let down more sandworms,2024-03-01 03:32:28
something as small as the worm going under and popping back up and paul changing his position accordingly was such a cool detail,2024-03-01 05:18:46
in the book riding the worm is 34 of the way into the book and paul has proven himself time and again so him calling a big worm just adds to his legend,2024-03-01 03:47:28
loved how the sandstorm just added to the dread of the worms approaching,2024-03-01 03:37:26
i saw this movie specifically in 4dx because i knew there would be sandworm riding and holy  i’ve been on theme park rides that are less intense,2024-03-11 15:04:08
i think the books couldnt do the war justice but i think well bare minimum get some shots of bombed out planets and piles of skulls  this movie did a great job showing the horror but the next one really needs to hammer home how awful paul has been for the universe,2024-03-01 03:55:57
there isnt much action in dune messiah so if dv wants to keep the interest of the general audience alive for his next film especially after delivering the war epic that is dune part 2 then  have to show some scenes of the actual holy war in it,2024-03-01 11:05:23
i think thats why denis villenueve ended the movie like that no alia and a cliffhanger messiah is a short book so my guess is that they will have the war while they jump or mix the plot of messiah in there it could happen since messiah goes by really fast,2024-03-02 21:22:45
"just a montage of paul faceroll everyone 

dude literally has path to victory and control of spice so it isn’t so much of a war and more like extermination",2024-03-02 12:36:14
whatever dune part three will be it will include more than just whats in messiah if only because there has to be sufficient time for paul to win back chani and thus make way for the children,2024-03-02 19:46:34
it’s because dune isn’t about the war really  the war is happening in the background all the time despite paul’s best attempts to stop it  we can have an offshoot movie or story about it if people find it important but messiah should stay as is,2024-03-03 08:34:21
with seeing how denis adapted the second half of dune and make it changes i think he’s going to make changes to messiah as well can’t wait for dune 3,2024-03-02 00:15:16
the books at least the first two skip most of the combat in general,2024-03-02 23:45:00
yeah but villeneuve doesnt put the money,2024-03-13 04:18:32
source please,2024-03-17 11:49:45
something out of a video game,2024-03-01 14:28:47
"its pretty sad because hes pretty goofy and optimistic paul is is the lisab al gaib hes like a very caring uncle that cheers you on



then the end of the movie happens he is willing to get killed by paul so he can have a voice in the fremen officially acts far gone to be a total zealot charging towards the ships offworld to seemingly go  some other imperials that oppose paul in order to go to green lands and ocean water they say but its to go  those who oppose paul",2024-03-01 03:16:55
he was my favorite wasnt expecting him to be as funny as he was,2024-03-01 03:08:23
i was surprised my whole theater kept laughing when he spoke but also i get it dude had a great role,2024-03-01 03:13:58
i love seeing his eyes change through the film he starts off as a kind of uncle figure and mentor then curious but pragmatic into a full blown fanatic reminds of the book so well the part where paul mourns the loss of his friend for the birth of this religious zealot fighting for him,2024-03-01 03:58:42
absolutely the best casting he is stilgar,2024-03-01 03:19:33
i am so glad he  destroyed this role he is a phenomenal actor but ill be damned if every time i see him i cant help but hear the voices in my head whisper jack parrow,2024-03-01 03:58:01
he was on conan obriens podcast a while ago and conan asked him about his roles in dune and the little mermaid remake he said the little mermaid was for my daughter dune was for my son and the paychecks were for me,2024-03-18 20:59:00
loved how goofy but dedicated he was even as a badass warrior,2024-03-01 03:56:37
as written,2024-03-02 14:03:17
really surprised by the humor audience ate it up,2024-03-03 06:13:11

midway into the movie everytime he said it my theater burst out in laughs,2024-03-01 03:39:31
ultimate hype man,2024-03-01 04:32:48
"that felt like the whole movie  


when they first said that paul was the space messiah i wondered if my friend next to me was paying attention because thats a big plot point  


never mind they repeat it every other scene for like 3 hours",2024-03-03 05:14:56

if you drink you will die if you drink you may see,2024-03-02 21:05:25
i like how when he opens his eyes he isnt looking at her even though she was the one to wake her up hes looking past her at jessica he doesnt even see her,2024-03-04 06:50:22
not entirely wrong,2024-03-02 14:58:30
" because in a way she is unsure if paul did came back or something else came back wearing paul’s skin

i mean theres nothing to be unsure of our memories make up who we are our traumas our worst and best moments and paul now has access to millions of timelines to memories and futures who could come back from that unchanged nobody",2024-03-16 03:34:54
stilgar is the only cheerleader paul needs i was laughing at basically every line from javier bardem in this movie every time another bit of the prophecy comes true hes like,2024-03-02 19:50:31
"ill have to wait to see messiah but i like the book version better still the changes resulted in taking away some internal conflict from paul and placing it onto chani nothing wrong with a character being there in part to support another



 also i dont understand how they are going to have paul and chani stay together like this


 if your reason for liking a change is because otherwise an actor doesnt get to show their chops then the actor should be changed not the story but it could end up still working out in messiah so im reserving judgement",2024-03-03 06:38:56
isnt her opposition more because paul is becoming less of the person she fell in love with she doesnt care about him fulfilling the prophecy  she just wants to be with him while everyone else grows more and more fanatic and he is pushed towards the prophecy and away from her,2024-03-03 23:50:21
drax 02,2024-03-01 14:04:52
wasnt much of a fight lol,2024-03-03 23:34:33

we also got thanos yanking mj down and telling her to shut the ,2024-03-05 04:36:23
maybe a few of the gun fight in the street scenes,2024-03-02 21:08:05
it did mess up the timeline a little bit though its a little harder to believe paul took over everything in less than 9 months,2024-03-01 15:50:53
"they mentioned how the child actor in arrival was the weakest part of the movie

sheesh that hardly seems fair considering the child actor was literally just playing a normal child she had what five lines",2024-03-02 06:42:49
i can’t think of cgi kids without thinking of renesmee in twilight,2024-03-02 20:27:38
that might be the one time where the uncanny valley actually fits the role a cgi child or like that face rendering disney does for deceased actors might perfectly fit for an adult mind in a childs body,2024-03-01 23:11:37
alia from the 1984 movie was good i think the main reason is that they didnt want to do a 7 year timeskip,2024-03-01 07:29:27
i wonder if they could have used a midget that had makeup to look like a child but yeah almost definitely wouldnt have worked,2024-03-12 09:15:55
"i don’t know how well a child actor could portray a child with the intellect of an adult

shes very ethereal and a little weird looking while still being very striking and beautifulperfect casting,2024-03-01 03:45:02
and it’ll be really interesting to see how she plays off of a particular returning actor in messiah,2024-03-01 05:22:39
to that point though it’s weird that the actress they cast for a grown up alia is the same age as timothée chalamet in the movies he should be like 20 years older than her at all times,2024-03-01 04:19:34
i agree but i also feel like atj would have been a good princess irulan or chaney i feel like those two are described as strikingly beautiful which i dont find zandaya to be,2024-03-01 06:11:15
you know what i want to see translate the entirety of  emperor of dune,2024-03-01 03:38:53
yeah but it is kinda interesting how it implies this whole rise has taken place over several months since jessica’s still pregnant instead of the 2 years in the book,2024-03-01 04:27:58
true but it would have been cool,2024-03-01 20:35:49
so anyway i started stabbin,2024-03-01 03:39:38

but still have anya play her when she grows up spice does weird things with puberty,2024-03-01 13:41:19
it also completely skipped paul and chans first born son who get killed in the attack on sietch tabr thats a huge moment that pushes paul towards the jihad,2024-03-03 02:57:36
all they would have had to do was have the child communicate telepathically i think and it would have worked,2024-03-13 12:11:53
i thought paul striding up to him out of the dust and knifing him in the throat was one of the most badass scenes in the movie ,2024-03-01 03:32:35
he walks up alone in front of a bunch of sardaukar feet from the emperor when he does it it rules,2024-03-01 04:23:04
fwiw i think jessica chatting away with her unborn fetus was creepy and weird af definitely weirder to me than a child murdering someone even,2024-03-11 05:36:26
"messiah still might be around 5 years out if villeneuve makes a different film in between as planned

letting paul visibly age before the next chapter works well for the story",2024-03-01 08:16:17
"i dont know how greenlit but denis said he is writing it at the moment 

he intends to do another movie in between at least though rendez vous with rama or cleopatra",2024-03-01 13:27:20
it was the sandstorm wearing down its shield,2024-03-04 00:51:50
it really doesn’t feel like one at all  it’s the straw that makes paul embrace being lisan algaib,2024-03-03 08:32:40
its most likely going to be at least 45 years before we get messiah i think  villeneuve is doing rendevous with rama next and since messiah takes place like 12ish years after the events in dune letting the actors age a little bit isnt a bad idea,2024-03-01 05:16:12
"two days in each weekend two great trilogies to marathon coincidence i think not


i apologise in advance to all the poor girls im going to annoy when i inevitably ask them to watch this with me while i sit there providing all the additional context which ive gained from reading the book",2024-03-01 07:25:10
i wasnt thinking of it as a partner trilogy but lotr came to mind when i was walking out of the theater just because these movies are the first to match the magic of those three movies,2024-03-01 22:47:49
i would say going from rise to dawn to war for the planet of the apes was that experience for me in noting just how many scenes from rise are called back to in war,2024-03-02 23:07:45
yeah same for me just on my way back from watching it was reminding me of the spectacle of lord of the rings and seeing return of the king in the cinema dune part 1 was great part 2 is an all timer imo,2024-03-02 16:51:14
doesn’t sniff lord of the rings that battle was so anti climactic saw some review compre it to helms deep it was a great film 910  but it didn’t feel like an epic to the proportions of lotr,2024-03-03 00:09:38
you might be right that this is the new lotr  weird i actually missed the entire trilogy on the big screen which compared to todays screens really werent that big,2024-03-03 02:46:02
so is there a part 3 coming,2024-03-02 05:44:42
they got to do children that’s the real ending of this arc,2024-03-06 08:28:12
dune doesn’t have a trilogy yet,2024-03-14 05:05:54
im right there with you this is a once in a generation kind of film absolutely in the same league as lotr and the original sw films personally i think it also blows avatar out of the water and i really really enjoyed twow,2024-03-01 09:18:47
villeneuve i believe intended to cover the paul atreides story line from the first 2 books in his movies so heres to hoping lights turn green for the third movie,2024-03-01 06:28:41
"2 movies for the first book and another one for the second book which is shorter than the first and serves as a very important epilogue for the story of paul atreides


its absolutely essential for understanding the true themes of the story and herberts intention for writing it",2024-03-01 07:27:58
hes in the process of writing the script but nothing greenlit yet and honestly i expect it to be a good 5 years or more before the next one ,2024-03-01 06:49:29
"so frank herbert wrote dune then he wrote 2 more books on paul completing the paul trilogy as it were then he wrote another 3 books in the universe then his son plus another writer wrote a bunch of prequels and sequels


dune and dune part 2 by denis villeneuve are an adaptation of only the first book


so assuming the same rate of progression it would take 6 movies in total just to get paul’s story finished",2024-03-05 20:24:24
you should read the book at least for the understanding of how dire water is the detail of its scarcity makes you conscious of every single drop you use,2024-03-25 23:48:05
"i think book 1 was about the betrayal of the baron harkonnen and then in subsequent books we started getting more into the machinations of the bg denis seems to be adapting it with the eye towards making the bg the true antagonists from the beginning

the good baron was just another one of the bene geserits pawns",2024-03-01 17:14:14
i think this version of the baron came off pretty good in terms of being imposing but i will admit i loved the baron in the mini series and think he was the best fit for him,2024-03-02 05:18:04
i do think they should have set up the spacing guild a bit more like the ability for paul to destroy the spice and the leverage that gives him should have been impressed slightly more imo,2024-03-01 09:29:25
yeah agreed on your ratings beautiful film i found the omissions… frustrating in that i think they could’ve been achieved without that much screen time it made all the antagonists fall a bit flat for me the baronthufirnabaronemperor are all far more capable than portrayed  the omission of the planet being akin to the training of the sardauker and the emperors perception of that threat the guilds control over the emperorhouses the intention of the baron to send rabban as a way to enable feydrautha etc  i think a bit more of all that would’ve made paul’s ascension feel more satisfying and that he overcame a true threat just my noise for the ether haha,2024-03-01 21:00:30
i highly recommend you read messiah in general i see dune and messiah as one very long book lol messiah really hammers home the lessons you were supposed to learn ,2024-03-02 06:32:50
there’s not a single change that is worse imo,2024-03-18 07:12:46
and the “you fought well atreides” callback to his first fight too,2024-03-01 03:40:01
i love that they made him go through the box of pain thing aswell thats not in the books i think made him really stand as an equal to paul,2024-03-01 09:54:06
it was also interesting how casually feyd acknowledged their cousin status in that moment with skipping a beat maybe that information drew some deeper sense of purpose and familiarity to the duel beyond what they already felt and hence the respect of the final outcome,2024-03-02 16:12:09
well it didnt hit as hard because that third atreidis had him killed if he wouldnt have use that shield device first this lessened a bit his quality as a fighter for me,2024-03-01 08:31:41
i think the way it was setup was paul was trying to get both of them killed he seemed legit disappointed when he gave the order for the jihad to go ahead,2024-03-01 05:27:21
in his first scene he was  the dude wasnt drugged he thought the baron tried to  him,2024-03-01 04:02:16
feyds black blade in the coliseum fight was poisoned in the book right,2024-03-02 17:06:45
i wish he mentioned killing the last of house atreides to make it more menacing and emotionally charged but otherwise no notes that was awesome,2024-03-01 04:04:16
not sure how much honor it added he slaughtered those women pretty unfairly in his first scene lol,2024-03-06 23:18:10
"its totally out of character for feyd tho because feyd is not an honorable character in the book  and his  in the book would not lend itself to honor either frankly the whole fight was weird because paul  the love child of the training of the best of the atreides the bene gesserit and the fremen  was hardly better than a random atreides soldier kept as a prisoner

the reason the final fight in the books works so well is that although paul is the superior fighter feyd is cunning and pauls reticence of his tricks and feints levels the playing field paul is so caught up in predicting feyds trickery that he even avoids a feint that feyd wasnt even making and puts himself in a compromised position",2024-03-03 16:05:52
butler did a great job portraying him imo,2024-03-01 04:19:16
much more interesting to have a complex villain,2024-03-02 14:52:39
i think that people often are more complex than we give them credit for,2024-03-01 18:52:09
" i appreciated that feyd rautha actually died and fought with honor too 

which is funny because in the books he tries to use poisoncheat",2024-03-16 03:37:54
i’m glad that they took the time to build the parallels between the 2,2024-03-01 22:55:46
butler was a big highlight in a movie full of highlights,2024-03-03 04:01:13
retrospectively explained the reverend mother testing paul herself she would have been a bad tester for feyd because feyd killed his own mother paul has always been close to jessica making the reverend mother an effective tester,2024-03-05 20:29:10
the silence is deafening in that fight after the entire moving of sound,2024-03-02 12:50:57
sometimes the best score is no score at all,2024-03-03 16:26:01
i was pleased to see that too in contrast with a couple scenes from 1 that would have been better unscored growth,2024-03-10 04:43:37
probably why i liked that moment the most zimmer’s score was just too over the top for me in both films it was more distracting that complimentary at times,2024-03-06 15:02:56
"so paul gets stabbed in his lower left side with the first blade and lets feyd approach  he lets feyd stab him in the upper right shoulder with the second blade but makes it a struggle so that feyd doesnt notice paul pulling the first blade out of his lower left side  paul uses the first blade to get a clean  shot to feyds lower chest and tanks the two nonfatal knife wounds  paul wins becomes emperor and the holy war begins

hopefully this helps",2024-03-02 03:58:15
i think he removed the blade and stabbed feyd with it,2024-03-01 06:56:42
came looking for an answer to this too lol i presume it entered his suit to the side so it looked like he was stabbed but actually wasnt idk i was too enthralled to comprehend it,2024-03-01 04:25:50
ugogetyourrope paul stabbed feyd with the knife he himself had been stabbed with earlier on in the fight,2024-03-02 23:21:20
one of the most recent scenes of my history of films,2024-03-01 04:01:28
lol thats  level plot subversion feyd as the  emperor ,2024-03-03 16:11:35
he only executed people in the first one lol,2024-03-01 19:15:17
"so i just came home from a double feature screening and before the movies started a movie podcaster told us about his run in with the stunt coordinator of part 2 

apparently villeneuve didnt want part 1 to be seen as an action movie so it was basically mellowed down while in part 2 he ramped up the action and the stunt coordinator who was a stuntman in the part one could go nuts with the fighting scenes",2024-03-02 18:32:30
yeah it had long sequences that went really fast it felt very real,2024-03-04 22:12:53
agreed rogue one zero dark thirty and now the new dunes all look incredible,2024-03-01 07:36:16
" greig fraser

everything this man touches just elevates the movie so much",2024-03-01 23:32:09
they should actually advertise movies with his name attached akin to actors directors etc he absolutely knocks it out of the park every time,2024-03-02 18:22:39
lol yeah what the  was with the voice guns not even lynch could pull off the absurdity of that film,2024-03-01 14:47:10
its muaddibbing time,2024-03-24 07:38:12
"the superior reference

the thing about street fights the street always wins",2024-03-03 13:31:49
the reluctant leader… just like the messiah foretold,2024-03-01 03:11:53
once paul got blue eyes i knew that  was on,2024-03-01 03:12:24
that wasn’t just any bene gesserit that was reverend mother most skilled of them all the fact the she stumbled and called him an abomination definitely got the “holy ” from me,2024-03-01 03:29:18
thar was a reverend mother too i believe which really shows how powerful it was,2024-03-01 03:25:08
that scene was great feeling the boom of that in imax has reverberated in me since last sunday,2024-03-01 03:20:30
i also love that one small scene with his mom and he yells thats not hope it sounded corny in the trailer but man was that so impactful in context i love how his yell echoes  and that no one says anything now given pauls messiah status,2024-03-01 10:09:10
"one of the bg

she was the equivalent of yoda to the jedi thats the main bg woman",2024-03-01 19:01:46
in the imax theater the entire stadium shook it was incredible,2024-03-01 06:52:32
that kyle maclachlan scene was amazing try looking into that place where you dare not look,2024-03-01 22:12:48
the silence scene would have been a lot more impactful if it wasnt in every single trailer before the release i go to the movie theater a lot and i got so tired of hearing that line,2024-03-01 04:48:48
"  watching that scene where paul uses the voice to say silence and one of the bene gesserit literally stumble you feel like youre being yelled at by an otherworldy person

that was what i remarked when i first heard it in part one it feels almost like being a kid  around then your parent yells at you to behave the suddeness the tone the command it just makes you immediately think obey",2024-03-09 23:36:32
every time jessica uses it i got super freaked out wonderfully done,2024-03-01 07:10:24
it is used so infrequently that when it does come out its still a little shocking with how powerful it feels,2024-03-02 09:20:38
" we watched a double bill

maaan i wouldve loved a double bill of dune and dune 2  which theater did that",2024-03-01 06:40:12
"rewatched pt1 at home before going to see pt 2

that thopter scene stood out as so disappointing on my laptop it was my favorite scene in imax sound design is mindblowing for these movies and deserve the theatre",2024-03-05 05:41:13
i had my criticisms of timothee from the first film  i thought paul was pretty bland in part one granted thats a bit by design but gosh dang does timothee portray him so well in this,2024-03-01 03:20:06
that speech was astounding after watching that i was prepared to follow him into battle,2024-03-01 03:27:07
zeroing in on that firemen guy and his grandmother who died nine months prior capping it off with the title drop…insane moment,2024-03-01 03:37:07
me judging the fremen for following these false prophets fully knowing i wouldve been shouting lisan al gaib if i was there,2024-03-01 04:01:33
that whole scene was fantastic i agree one of the most impactful,2024-03-01 12:50:33
i agree i think this film gets nods for best actor best film and best director i dont think itll sweep those categories but itll get one at least i also cant see anything else winning best costume design,2024-03-01 06:51:51
ive only seen that twice when independence day finished and when the titanic split in half and that dude hit the propellor,2024-03-01 03:49:36
few people have seen it but ill say its the king 2019,2024-03-01 04:18:42
"i gotta give some love to bones and all  

but completely agree with you that this is among his beat performances  i know some people didnt love his performance in part 1 as much because its understated and naturalistic and got a bit lost among the really big performances other actors were giving  but that choice so paid off in part 2 because it makes the turn so much more dramatic and effective",2024-03-01 12:05:17
he didn’t really do much in lady bird him playing a justifiably angsty ,2024-03-02 05:36:16
i mean when you come out of the gate with something like call me by your name people take notice  and this shows that hes got more range than i think anyone realized,2024-03-01 12:08:14
he’s definitely starting to give me “leo” vibes with his dynamic range if he’s attached to anything i also start becoming interested as well ,2024-03-01 03:12:37
thats still pattinson for me chalmet though might be close second at least for this generation of actors,2024-03-01 05:30:22
oh  no,2024-03-01 07:57:57
i miss behind the scenes info like this guess it is still in magazines and blue ray features,2024-03-10 12:07:47
true hes been a truly talented actor out of the gate but i was genuinely terrified of him in that moment didnt know he had that menace in him he did a terrific job,2024-03-04 05:25:19

some weird kind of integer overflow,2024-03-03 02:30:08
there will certainly be an extended version,2024-03-02 04:11:11
the main issue for me was not that something was obviously missing but that the transition felt both rushed and harsh it was not the elegant filmmaking of most of the movie,2024-03-02 00:28:50
agreed completely,2024-03-09 16:56:00
im thinking he left out the gravity of pauls actions so he could explore that in part 3 i think hes on record saying he wants to do part 3 for dune messiah dune messiah goes into the gravity of everything that happened,2024-03-23 22:14:24
oh thats interesting to hear i  just started my first read,2024-03-14 09:27:33
because the point of the last battle being so short is that paul and the fremen are no longer the underdogs like they were for most of the story it’s very obvious that the imperial forces can’t stand against them at all and if you make the battle longer or show the fremen struggle you lose that idea of how powerful they have become,2024-03-10 01:52:00
i understand they are cowards give me the  toddler or get lost,2024-03-02 13:27:17
for a movie literally called “dune part two” i would highly recommend the first one you can watch it without it but watching the first one will make this one exponentially better,2024-03-03 05:23:51
i disagree seeing part one made this a waaaay better movie,2024-03-02 10:49:31
"my wife doesnt care for most scifi she hates anything thats postapocalypticy she hadnt finished part 1 having fallen asleep somewhere around either the spitting scene or mapes giving the knife to jessica i know before the movie really gets started

she went with me to watch part 2 this weekend i gave her a quick rundown of part 1 and we also watched it at an alamo so the preshow was a part 1 recap

afterwards she told me that she understood what was happening she only had questions around jessicas pregnancy as for if she likes it it was very interesting too interesting to fall asleep to lol",2024-03-19 01:52:46
yeah thats definitely the biggest structural question,2024-03-03 12:57:28
the fremen love paul because they need a messiah chani is different because she fell in love with paul the individual and needs him to be himself,2024-03-04 05:01:52
you could always go to burning man if you wanted to see crazed desert sexgoblins,2024-03-01 06:21:31
i’m betting to do that sequence faithfully you’d need an r rating too,2024-03-01 16:15:20
i think it’ll be really cool if they include that in messiah in a sort of postpaul ascension the fremen become even more fanatic and we see these  develop as a result ,2024-03-03 08:37:00
"which is why i love his choices he makes in his movies  scenes today do very little in terms of moving things forward or helping the movie but take for example the “ scene” in bladerunner 2049 it served a purpose for the characters while at the same time giving us something we’ve never quite seen before in a movie 
and again here in part two imply paul and chanis intimacy with out of breath dialogue that moves things forward 
such good choices that just ultimately help the story",2024-03-02 08:31:34
" crazed desert sexgoblins

i was surprised when i saw this was pg13 this must have been as far as you can push depictions of cruelty and violence and not get slapped with an r,2024-03-01 07:36:48
has denis made a single film that isnt aesthetically pleasing,2024-03-01 03:39:48
just in terms of visuals the creator is definitely up there for me too in terms of modern sci fi on screen not a great movie all around but hot  is it ever nice to look at,2024-03-01 14:55:41
after all that talk about avoiding sunrise to end the original movie the fremen sure walked around a lot without face coverings in broad daylight this time around,2024-03-01 05:03:02
we’ll definitely be getting one in part three,2024-03-01 06:24:48
my exact experience dune 1 was amazing yet lacked that character hook to make me feel and empathize and i read the books in 2 it was way better seeing paul’s struggle chani’s fight against the tide jessica’s transformation stilgar’s blossoming fanaticism halleck’s push for vengeance so much more depth to the characters it really pulled me in i knew how it ended and i was still on the edge of my seat fully invested as i was in the characters,2024-03-02 23:35:33
in the book when jessica drinks the water of life she converts the water or purifies it so it is not poisonous to regular people who arent bene gesserit and then the fremen drink it and it makes them rave and  basically im probably butchering that but thats what i remember,2024-03-02 03:49:37
that’s all quite faithful to the book the final battle starts and ends about as abruptly they blow the wall then the sandstorm and worms wipe out the enemy right away they capture the emperor and his entourage have the duel paul says he’s going to marry the princess then the book ends,2024-03-02 21:23:34
"not interested in battles scenes tbh so i’m not bothered about that at all but they dropped a few atomics and the freemen are notoriously good fighters so makes sense that they made short work 

the one on one fight between paul and feyd is an iconic scene in the books and paul knew he was going to win it tbh there was never any danger it was more for show ",2024-03-01 10:45:05

just did dune in imax and wow",2024-03-01 08:52:33
yeah that was so cool rip zendayas bff,2024-03-03 01:26:02
it not only gives depth to the fremen it helps give more intentionality to jessica and paul’s exploitation of the prophecy which is a fantastic way to drive home how sinister things are becoming,2024-03-11 15:08:27
she exists she’s just barely a character,2024-03-01 16:21:06
she exists in the books but shes basically a pushover sidepiece that goes along with everything that paul does with very minor quibbles that she squashes down,2024-03-02 19:02:58
agree  i did think that was kind of funny  hey kids  the great houses dont like paul  well show them  that moment as well as the wellknown actors in minor roles ex anya taylor joy lea seydoux etc makes me think dune messiah is already in the works,2024-03-01 06:18:40
yeah watching it the second time poor stilgar looked sooo tired getting onto the starship crusader ,2024-03-01 08:30:30
this surprised me do the freman even know how to work ships,2024-03-04 00:45:36
sup with brolins hair then,2024-03-01 08:37:14
spice lengthens human longevity no could it also lengthen gestation,2024-03-01 23:56:57
possible given alias circumstances  in the book alia is like five years old and shes the one who kills the baron not paul  i think its a giant plot hole in the movie that people will be chuckling about once it become common knowledge ,2024-03-01 05:55:25
agree  ive already read some thought pieces and watched some youtube videos about how skipping over alia and her condition kept the movie from descending into a horror show  i always thought she was a creepy character and the producers decided to sidestep her introduction as a child in the current franchise  similar with pauls first born son being killed was probably  a story line they didnt want to explore for obvious reasons  i get the impression that a movie based on dune messiah will vary significantly from the book  ,2024-03-02 22:13:14
agree  i still think the producers should have let alia been born hid her away because of her condition and preserved the time jump in the book but they made their choices and well see how they play out if another movie gets made,2024-03-03 18:55:32
agree  i try not to be that book guy but i just think the movie crams a lot of events into less than a year ex defeating the atreides restoring the spice production paul being accepted into the clan jessica becoming rm guerrilla warfare on restored spice production etc into a very short time frame  still its a fun movie in a franchise ive loved for decades so im happy,2024-03-03 01:44:42
thanks  and i agree about the improbably timeline,2024-03-09 22:36:54
i immediately came out of the theater wanting to go back in to watch it again,2024-03-01 05:31:19
from what ive read on it dune is unique in that its prestar wars and thats important because you can tell rebel moon is trying too hard to be star wars along with most sci fi works poststar wars but dune calls back to an older era of sci fi where the core idea and concepts are the focus and the setting and even the characters and story are just there to explore those concepts and ideas,2024-03-03 14:36:22
i saw it on sunday and then again last night i liked it even more the second time and plan to go a third,2024-03-01 10:52:45
“oscar bait” put some respek on dv’s name — this man literally cannot miss,2024-03-03 06:07:35
saw it in imax sunday and again last night second time around was just as enjoyable recommend to see it twice,2024-03-01 13:40:32
this aint oscar bait though villanueve had dune storyboards made along with a friend when he was 1314 years old he was already fantasizing about what he would do with a scifi franchise like this when he was a preteen this is literally his dream project and he is the perfect director for this,2024-03-03 11:04:14
same we watched it in imax and now we’re thinking of 4d,2024-03-02 05:43:46
shot like oscar bait what a nothing statement,2024-03-02 10:39:36
or madame web which gives away that it was made in the early 2000s,2024-03-05 23:35:10
everything feels so tactile and real i wish more directors went for that it is so much more immersive,2024-03-11 01:12:24
what gives it away in rebel moon i havent seen it just curious,2024-03-04 07:05:06
people who haven’t read messiah are gonna have thoughts about that movie when it comes out and i am here for it,2024-03-01 05:24:32
i really dont think lotr is beatable in that regard,2024-03-01 06:38:25
lotr extended cut trilogy is going to be hard to beat but if denis nails an adaptation of messiah that satisfies the storyline and wraps it up neatly yeah this just might beat lotr,2024-03-04 00:34:27
i’m not of the mind a film should be torn down because it doesn’t feel timeless but i see you on the corny point for sure,2024-03-02 00:08:31
no hate from me star wars didnt age well and its subsequent trilogies got worse and worse,2024-03-04 00:35:38
agreed with you the acting is also pretty terrible and im always surprised how few people hold it against the movies ,2024-03-02 06:28:08
you mean helms deep right,2024-03-01 07:29:16
dude i believed he was the messiah i was so ready to follow usul on the golden path after that moment,2024-03-03 01:18:19
chalamet is amazing in this perfect casting and performance but you can definitely still skip wonka lol,2024-03-12 08:10:39
i recognized your footsteps old man,2024-03-05 07:34:07
i thought i was the only one that noticed this it was a cool callback,2024-03-02 05:54:45
im very glad at how good the fremen fighting looked in this one because in part one that particular shot of paul looked a little odd face greenscreened onto a cgi body maybe short moment though so it was a minor gripe and probably done for pragmatic reasons at the time,2024-03-06 23:18:46
oof  i saw it at lincoln at the fan first screening and they showed it in dual laser and i thought it looked phenomenal  hoping to see the film version there to compare but i can’t imagine it being better than the digital version for this particular film,2024-03-01 04:50:03
could it be dust or other loose particles lots of bugs during february in new york would surprise me,2024-03-01 05:10:04
i noticed that,2024-03-01 04:03:46
i might actually go there again i’ve got to travel a decent distance but it’s worth it,2024-03-01 13:43:06
paul doesnt have a choice they did left that part out but at some point he sees that there is no way to avoid the jihad even if he dies thatll only make it stronger and him going this path and becoming emperor is the way to actually try to control it,2024-03-01 08:49:01
zendaya is fantastic and charming here,2024-03-01 05:21:42
its a little sad because shes way more ride or die with paul in the book still some of this energy but not like the film overall it was excellent i just am a little concerned about how you make messiah happen after chani here lol,2024-03-01 05:34:11
i thought zendaya was terrible she felt inexperienced as an actor always pulling the same dialled up shock face she felt very american which was off putting,2024-03-03 18:09:15
"
i thought florencess performance was really onedimensional and boring",2024-03-03 08:05:13
atheist icon,2024-03-02 12:08:45
i feel like this is the first time i watched one of her performances and understood the star power people speak of i dont mean this in a bad way i feel like shes been so hidden in other rolesdoesnt take too many roles on in general im excited to see her in more stuff now,2024-03-01 05:32:18
i didnt like that much her role in part 1 but oooff i loved her here maybe it was because she just appeared in the end but yeah i loved her in part 2,2024-03-03 03:33:04
i dont get why her character spoke primarily english though even to her own people in many scenes and why didnt she have an accent,2024-03-28 00:43:10
nolan is very good as well it’s nice to have both they do event cinema and i’m glad we have two directors putting out such amazing films,2024-03-02 05:55:45
no reason to pit them against each other,2024-03-02 08:51:25
nolan earned his blank check status by being so consistently profitable hopefully villeneuve can reach that status too,2024-03-15 18:45:40
movies are different than books 5 hours and 20 minutes of runtime is more than i ever hoped for and i think it was done with about as much accuracy as possible given movie needs it stayed true to the message and it understood the books themes,2024-03-01 05:04:19
thats what i figured its pretty obvious that its a marriage of convenience but man it doesnt hurt any less when you thought you would spend your life with this person only to find out that nah youre going to be his consort,2024-03-01 08:07:17
"or if you want to look at it a little more darkly he can see the future where saying that is what helps her get over it and come back later to him

shell come around eventually",2024-03-01 08:03:28
"he needed to do what he needed to for his power

imo chani understands what is happening and doesnt doubt pauls love for her but sees him growing closer to gurney and acquiescing to the existing imperial marriage alliance expectations as evidence that she was wrong to believe he would always put the fremen cause first 

i feel like people are ignoring that she is clearly upset with him and disagreeing with his actions from the moment he takes the water of life and pinning it all on her being upset about irulan whereas i think that was just the straw the broke the camels back",2024-03-01 15:01:05
am i  for thinking that when the other houses do not recognize paul’s ascension it sorta negates the need to marry irulan,2024-03-02 06:50:14
they also cut a closing line of the novel where jessica explains that paul’s children his heirs will be hers and that history remember them both as the true wives jessica as leto’s and chani as paul’s really changes the framing of the ending without it,2024-03-02 23:26:38
at the start of the movie its so long as i breathe ill always be with you by the end its so long as i breathe i will always love you,2024-03-09 09:25:37
i do kinda miss the concubine line at the end but i get why they did it this way,2024-03-02 14:59:17
he actually says  and i will do what needs to be done just before they leave to go south,2024-03-06 04:32:42
i definitely had that same feeling he pleads and promises he isn’t like the others like his family he claims he’s a good man but in the end he chooses revenge and bloodshed,2024-03-01 21:38:33
"i mean euphoria is a lot but none of us were sleeping on zendaya after her performance as rue

that being said i adored her as chani and my heart broke for her",2024-03-01 06:22:18
" zendaya also killed it

i think the one thing that bothers me about zendaya in the movie is that shes the only fremen with a perfect american accent all the others have slight middleeastern tinges bardem uses his spanish accent with a small change

beyond that her character was amazing the changes they made to chani from the books were perfect i think makes her more of a real character and maybe sets up for a good ending in the next book",2024-03-02 18:59:30
arguably shes the weaker actor of the cast mostly since its all killers and i lowkey expected that to churn me but she honestly did fine and sometimes good,2024-03-03 01:07:57
"and worse hes using her people to do it hes not fighting for the liberation of arrakis anymore 
  
hes using the promise of a transformed dune to turn the people she loves into weapons against the universe
 paul brings a new and worse from of oppression",2024-03-01 13:53:26
can you elaborate on this how was she part of the prophecy lady jessica forced to put her tears on paul,2024-03-01 12:18:20
if any movie benefits from physical media like a 4k bluray it’s this one,2024-03-01 14:39:59
definitely some films just need to be experienced on the big screen the pure explosive power of the audio music and reverb shaking my seat are an experience unlike any other the dolby theaters at amc are phenomenal,2024-03-03 03:40:54
" also while i have not read the book the emperor seemed too feeble and bland of a character in my eyes and ive been told he was more interesting in the book

the emperor gets very little appearance time in the book if anything he had more scenes in this movie and i feel that any imposing nature doesnt come as much from him as it comes from his sardukar forces while i think walken was too old to play him the spice extends ones life so despite his actual age he shouldnt look it i think the movie covered him pretty well",2024-03-02 17:29:40
"  some of the dialogue was very on the nose overexplaining what the brilliant visual storytelling already conveyed

not to sound like a snob but some people just need it i also felt a lot was conveyed visually yet have seen lots of people not understand even things that were additionally spelled out in the dialogue",2024-03-05 08:38:21
no he is too humble,2024-03-06 15:29:09
not sure why youre downvoted theyre equally amazing in their own ways and its not a competition,2024-03-04 00:46:20
yes and when hes talking with herney in the canyons he even says that line friends had become worshippers,2024-03-13 01:32:58
late to this but the atreides theme in part 1 was a huge part of what made the theme so good to me was hoping to get some more of it in this movie,2024-03-09 06:32:32
the attention to detail is astonishing i noticed that the sand vibrator thing paul and jessica had in part one was shaped like a sandworm maw  form following function,2024-03-05 08:17:56
the sound design in this movie was  perfect,2024-03-03 08:17:30
i agree that the rushed timeline 9 months instead of 4 years had a couple of negative effects 1 pauls ascent was less plausibleimpactful 2 alias speech on meeting the baron was given to paul which is still pretty badass but less badass coming from an adult instead of a 4yearold,2024-03-18 22:06:24
,2024-03-03 08:20:26
"take them to paradise

coupled with his visions from part 1 and numerous mentions of jihad

yeah it really ramps up this sickening feeling and it doubles down at the end we feel like we want his revenge but then we want him to chill

its a seamless film with part 1 as it should be i cant wait to watch back to back to really join all those visions and recontextualise them",2024-03-02 10:50:02
was worse than that  they should have taken their water  i was appalled by this scene   fremen abandoning their core value,2024-03-04 11:28:15
and the fact that the fremen  who so covet water that they would normally start collecting it from freshly slain bodies  burned these bodies is a clear indicator of them abandoning their old values and expressing their rage fury and fervor towards those who oppressed them for so long,2024-03-06 10:02:25
i mean when hes discussing his lineage with lady jessica paul literally says so this is how we survive by being harkonnens,2024-03-04 05:52:15
"i remember thinking it felt slow the first time i watched it but on rewatch before seeing dune 2 i thought the pacing and world building was incredible 
dune is on its way to being an all time trilogy for me if the third can stick the landing",2024-03-01 04:35:42
yeah i rewatched the first today before seeing the second the first is definitely a lot of setup but top tier world building setup for this movie,2024-03-01 04:46:53
from the twisted mind of denis villeneuve,2024-03-01 03:34:44
yeah theres a good 150 pages in the first half of the book dedicated to geopolitics and a bunch of weird terms you have to flip to the glossary to understand like herbert was intentionally filtering out the lighthearted,2024-03-02 03:56:26
i totally agree and i knew that at the time i saw it but it was a long wait to get here,2024-03-01 06:50:22
“got to thinking maybe im the kwisatz haderach and i just dont know it yet”,2024-03-06 09:23:13
isayama has never mentioned dune as an inspiration he has mentioned plenty of other works though like himeanole muv luv paradise lost game of thrones and norse mythology however i also was watching dune 2 and thinking to myself that paul is remarkably similar to a live action eren yeager,2024-03-07 21:11:02
read that it was more an honor thing,2024-04-08 03:00:52
butler mentioned he imitated stellan skarsgårds voice for his performance of feyd as to reflect the influence that the baron has on feyd growing up in a way feyd trying to become like his uncle as he seeks to become the successor,2024-03-01 03:17:32
considering the source i actually like that the film shows his death he was a coward for the most part i liked getting to see josh brolin and dave have their stare off and final fight brief but it gets the point across and sent people in my theater cheering,2024-03-01 04:06:20
the book is very oddly paced  describe paul thinking about the first worm ride for 4 chapters yet the final battle is a few pages,2024-03-01 07:22:44
i always thought this was entirely intentional  hes a witless tool and his death is unimportant,2024-03-01 21:47:52
having just finished reading a few days ago it’s actually hilarious how insignificant it is like the battle is over and they’re just like “oh btw rabban died”,2024-03-02 01:48:06
in fairness he was already pretty neutered at that point retreated from the fremen battle gets cucked by his cousin,2024-03-02 02:14:32
i’m 99 positive they already green lit it but are just waiting a week to announce this movie is going to do numbers,2024-03-01 04:04:31
if you just went to a regular digital screening i buy that people are gravitating towards imax and premium screens for this the imax attendant at the show i went to said their first 25 or so shows are sold out and it looked like seats for various premium screens around seattle were nearly sold out yesterday regular digital screens were pretty empty at off peak times though,2024-03-01 22:10:43
his relieved lisan algaib after paul killed feyd had me howling,2024-03-12 18:38:18
like the sequel to twister twisters lol,2024-03-01 06:04:54
but then you lost the great typography of the title,2024-03-01 11:24:12
dune 2 the spicening,2024-03-03 07:19:43
the next one could be dun3,2024-03-11 09:47:28
because i saw it a week ago and i cant get it out of my head in how bad it is still,2024-03-01 11:56:55
the main characters have the same power,2024-03-06 08:25:01
“vladimir harkonnen he was in arrakis with my father harvesting spice right before he died”,2024-03-06 08:27:13
 hahahhahahahah,2024-03-06 04:12:43
the don’t let me get in my zone reference was hilarious,2024-04-10 16:08:09
yeah agree i would have preferred if she was more morally ambiguous like in the book,2024-03-27 15:10:19
stilgar’s relieved “lisanal geib when paul won had me dead perfectly timed,2024-03-18 13:15:36
i was briefly thinking like  is paul actually going to die what is this movie i have t feared for a protagonist like that in a very long time,2024-03-18 01:06:53
i think having her come around would be a huge betrayal to her now established identity pauls inner monologue and conflicting thoughts are represented in chani rather than having been depicted through narration she is the stand in for the opposition towards the coming crusade for that to be reduced to a trivial grudge thatll pass over time is a bit reductive and id really hate to see chani regress to pauls yeswoman in part 3,2024-03-04 03:26:06
im not asking bro,2024-03-03 06:08:40
it was so sick the sound when it was shooting was awesome haha ,2024-03-01 19:46:09
fremen hiding on top of the other rock outcrops i think lasguns are crazy precise in dune,2024-03-04 18:35:46
i liked the map guys who had to keep chanting to keep it running,2024-03-02 23:48:15
you want me on that wall you need me on that wall,2024-03-06 02:03:50
 didnt hesitate for a second,2024-03-02 13:23:09
yeah he said hed go south but then hed do what he has to do once there,2024-03-03 05:20:04
theyd be playing their hand too soon they needed the numbers of the southern fundamentalist fremen,2024-03-01 16:25:28
"they were heavily outnumbered paul was staging a guerilla war with 200 fighters when millions of soldiers show up and burn down their homes 200 guerilla fighter have no chance of winning as soon as their homes and innocents become possible targets the guerilla tactics no longer work and they have to escalate to fullscale battle

beast raban was chasing around a squad of elite fighters and was looking like an idiot for it while feyd rautha went full scorched earth and drove deep into the desert to find their homes",2024-03-02 05:11:19
this is one thing that bringing in a bit more from the books would help with in the books using atomic weapons on people results in the rest of the great houses being obligated by law to completely annihilate the planetoffending house in a mass annihilation paul does not want to have this happen so he actually never uses the atomic arsenal on people instead he uses it to blow up the shield wall which makes the rest of the battle possible,2024-03-04 05:55:06
"well fight like harkonnens

further driven home by the fremen burning the bodies instead of harvesting them for water",2024-03-01 17:17:54
"a bit about the lisan algaib prophecy it’s about a pair of mother and son


looking at the kwisatz haderach breeding programme eventually a bg would produce a son and that would be their human superweapon the fake prophecy wasn’t specifically about paul it would have applied to any kwisatz haderach they chose ensuring he’d have a personal army whenever he was born



it also links to what leto told paul about arrakis and how its harsh conditions are primed to produce warriors who could rival the sardaukar i don’t remember if this was in the movie and that’s another reason why the bg propaganda targeted the fremen the new emperor will need a new sardaukar",2024-03-06 09:43:09
"the water of life didnt affect jessica for the same reason paul was able to survive it  because of their bene gesserit training

the bene gesserit knew that a kwisatz haderach would be trained to survive the poison so they made sure to include it in their fremen prophecy",2024-03-01 16:22:10
yeah like that harkonnen spy who stayed behind to assasinate paul,2024-03-04 14:42:19
i was hoping we’d see the lasgun on shield trick here maybe the explosion would be big enough to severely wound drax,2024-03-06 07:15:04
given the nature of paul foresight there is basically no way for feyd to win right considering this you can say feyd did great,2024-03-04 22:46:00
oh i didnt realize it was a product of the baron forcing himself on someone,2024-03-01 22:31:53
i have to say i felt this was the most powerful part of dune 2 for me i was like wait what the bene gesseret are ice coldi think i may have to read the book or can someone please draw me a family tree at least,2024-03-04 00:11:50
it’s actually one of the brian herbertkevin anderson things that i think actually makes sense and possibly something frank herbert would’ve done himself,2024-03-01 22:38:11
yeah they are no longer pawns in the bene geserits schemes they become bene geserit schemers,2024-03-03 20:43:14
the way he gestures with his hand when describing “the narrowest path” he sold the character as someone who has fate at his fingertips,2024-03-06 12:28:56
yeah i was doing some timeline  in my head trying to figure out where we were not to say i went in to be like ‘i bet it’ll ’ ofc i’ve never waited for anything more in my life as a movie i truly loved it i just knew the insufferable part of me was going to be like ‘hmm…’ ,2024-03-01 03:15:21
you really have to remember going into an adaptation a different medium needs to have a different focus  to me as long as the core meaning is there and the changes are done in good faith i am cool with it they pulled it off here i think this is the best possible adaptation of dune that was possible and i am super glad i saw it,2024-03-01 04:07:49
jamis funeral is cut “he’s giving water to the dead” jamis’ wife and children are cut count fenring is cut leto ii is cut alia is cut man i really liked the movie but the cuts are killing my brain,2024-03-01 04:49:40
i also think the…’order of operation’ to the way they closed out the movie was very bizarre i have no clue what to expect from how they’ll open t in messiah but it’s just cool as  we’re even getting it irl,2024-03-01 03:56:19
"yea something about the audio just felt like there couldve been more to itthogh it got better towards the end at least so thats nice idk how to describe it would have to see it in imax as well to compare it properly as i usually prefer dolby over imax due to the audio

also the dolby feel every dimension before the movie also sounded a bit different than it used toless very low bass so maybe some new sound stuff on the theater i go to contributing to it or something idk but it was a thing a noticed",2024-03-01 12:19:47
it was pretty  loud i always feel kind of hungover the next morning after watching movies in imax from the loudness and dune was no exception,2024-03-01 14:26:21
its really loud too loud is a question of taste i personally loved it,2024-03-01 16:40:18
seeing with how he made changes to part 2 i have some ideas how  adapt messiah he might show some of the holy war instead of having it take place years after it’s ended he might retool it and have the story take place in the final days of it holy war that would satisfy some of the action that audiences would like or want but the really good stuff about dune is the political religious stuff although the action of dune 2 was good my favorite scenes of dune 2 were when jessica and paul were becoming religious figures to the fremen dune 3 is going to be a lot more about that especially with alia thrown into the mix this mixed with the conspiracy with the other factions and peppered with action scenes from the holy war i think could be a movie a lot of general audiences can get behind ,2024-03-02 00:08:47
"yeah the most significant changes were very logical for the sake of a film adaptation 

a two year old super intelligent killing machine would not have played well and chani serving as a representation of pauls inner monologue makes a ton of sense",2024-03-02 03:24:04
i wish paul’s personality changed as much as jessica’s he’s clearly different afterwards but they could have gone farther,2024-03-03 10:21:56
wont be an electrical grid to power the watching of it unfortunately if society collapses  the books should still work,2024-03-04 00:58:01
i get that fremen are superior combatants i just felt that the final battle lacked a bit of dramatic heft it was over so quickly that i didnt really feel the impact of seeing the culmination of 2 movies of buildup to this moment,2024-03-02 11:30:51
"theres a lot of exposition in part 2 as well i didnt find that to be a problem in either film tbh its funny you say feyd added a new dynamic to the harkonnens when he too was a one dimensional psychotic villain similar to the baron 

the romance angle didnt work as much for me somehow i felt zendayas friend the one who is killed by feyd stole every scene she was in completely overshadowing chani paul does grow into a better character in this film so agreed there 

i just felt leto atriedes and duncan idaho were better characters than anyone introduced in part 2 also pauls dynamic with jessica is way more interesting than the love story with chani id have liked more pauljessica interactions in part 2",2024-03-02 21:13:59
while im aware its probably an apocryphal reading i think that paul the bg and even leto are are all drinking their prescience koolaid,2024-03-04 18:14:16
for me it was the tone of it which felt like something sinister was going to happen maybe this is due to having knowledge of what happens afterwards but i didnt get that feeling reading the book which is why it felt more conclusive there as opposed to seeing on screen,2024-03-01 04:17:37
i agree in fact i expected his subplot to be cut as it felt kind of pointless but i still liked his character in the book,2024-03-01 03:57:45
didn’t he plant the thought in gurney’s head that jessica was the betrayer and then gurney nearly murdered her,2024-03-01 11:46:32
yes and that movie is hopefully rendezvous with rama,2024-03-04 09:05:59
100 and he’s so versatile as a filmmaker before messiah i’d love to see him go back to something smaller like enemy or prisoners,2024-03-01 15:23:20
crazy too because i legit thought sicario was gonna be like a steven segalesque action movie and denis is like some mcg type of director turns out dude is basically the modern king of scifi movies,2024-03-06 15:37:30
"i love the guy but even calling him the best canadian director of all time is a stretch considering the fact that james cameron is also canadian


but calling him the greatest director of all time thats just absolutely ridiculous",2024-03-01 07:37:05
comparison is the thief of joy,2024-03-01 15:04:34
cronenberg for me and all the film sickos out there,2024-03-01 08:16:11
i look at denis’ filmography and i think he’s up there with scorsese and tarantino cameron seems to be on the level of spielberg,2024-03-01 07:53:12
" no one is like that  
  
you may want to read up on historical cultures and rulers  
  
check out various  cultures for example along with the more vile roman emperors or the belgian congo or ivan the terrible who even killed his own son in a fit of rage",2024-03-06 13:46:02
pretty sure serial killers can be like that now put them all on a planet you should stop trying to self insert as the antagonist try the protagonist,2024-03-06 11:54:57
the whole point of the harkonnens is to represent the absolute worst in human decadence and depravity being extreme is the point,2024-03-06 22:08:24
"you are supposed to see a negative shadow of yourself in an antagonist ala i could become that person if i made some different choices

yeah i could totally be anton chigurh if i just went to a different school growing up",2024-03-06 11:40:02
just don’t make it the actual gap though translated to real life ,2024-03-01 23:20:30
hayt is my absolute favorite and i really really hope that dv and the actor does him justice ,2024-03-01 19:25:40
"feyd had a couple of ws the baron too in the first film

rabbani took just as many ls in the book as well lol",2024-03-02 14:56:32
" way different than their brutal intimidating portrayal in the first


i disagree except with the baron especially where in the book he was a cartoonishly mustache twirling villian yet in the first hes this cunning reserved and menacing foe who loves showcasing his power


other than that all of the other harkkonen are weak impulsive they were constantly losing to atraedies until sardukar came to help and the ones who kidnapped paul and jessica got played easily when paul is fighting with the freman in the very begining and during mining skirmishes it really seems like theyre fighting against a more technologically advanced army paul was very narrowly almost killed several times by them ",2024-03-02 17:27:16
"yeah but not everything is a political message about race ethnicity etc while those are critical conversations today paul is a political arsonist wouldn’t they rather have a white guy portray a genocidal maniac who is responsible for billions of deaths i believe that speaks more accurately for social progressives

i would love to see a critic apologize publicly for giving an outright unjustified review you can tell odie has not picked up enough books",2024-03-02 22:03:54
" and they did pick a poc to play duncan

first of all he isnt a poc second of all the concept of poc is very racist",2024-03-24 18:35:05
praising or criticizing,2024-03-02 21:45:05
"i think the stilgar character needs to be seen as a whole from beginning to end yes hes comic relief for a good half of the movie but that really plays into his shift by the end youre not laughing at him anymore from a certain point onwards you see his transformation hes ever growing fanaticism by the end of the movie what he has become is definitely not funny anymore a pure fundamentalist blinded by faith and belief in prophecy who lost his humanity and is ready to go on a jihad boarding the ships whilst being completely euphorical ready to commit violence 

its one of those cases where yes its all fun and giggles until  the fan i think his initial comedic role besides getting some laughs for us viewers actually served to show how blinded faith can transform someone so wholesome and human 

to me this was the point you laugh at him a the start possibly ridiculing his blinded faith but by the end youre not laughing at all seeing what he has become",2024-03-05 17:04:46
dont think theres any way you can call walken comic relief in the movie unless youre bringing in your past experiences with the actor,2024-03-05 10:11:15
well he’s wrong we need 4hour dune,2024-03-01 07:16:18
and the  lol,2024-03-01 05:45:31
"my understanding is that villeneuve knew he had 2 movies but not a guarantee for a 3rd so he didn’t want to risk ending on a full cliffhanger

the 3rd film still isn’t confirmed i think the box office by the end of march will determine if it gets the green light i’m going to see it again to do my part in making that happens",2024-03-01 05:15:09
yeah the most apparent moment of this to me on a second viewing was the timing of arrivals by paul and then chani at the southern camp they both left together on worms but then somehow paul arrives first he drinks the toilet bowl cleaner then chani arrives by ornithopter,2024-03-01 12:04:35
huh its original aspect ratio is 1431  1901,2024-03-02 14:07:16
the zendaya tennis movie is  as ,2024-03-02 15:36:20
would you mind elaborating on this im curious all i gathered was that the nukes were from atreides generations of old and were secretly stored but im not sure why they were on arrakis or what youre referring to with the loophole,2024-03-03 18:56:30
wdym how bad people are at nuance  i think it calls out islam fanaticism and jihad  very rightly so the it was all revealed to me in a dream while in a cave and now youve to carry out jihad against non believers part is and should be called out and as the movie went on it got more and more depressing how true it really is and has happened,2024-03-01 11:20:01
he that can destroy a thing has control over it,2024-03-04 03:09:22
thats kind of you to say thank you reading my comment back to myself im a little embarrassed so i appreciate the positivity what a dumb thing to have to deal with brains are goofs,2024-03-04 18:43:40
"my biggest problem with walken was the fact that he just cannot not be himself the line of  what would you domy dear daughter was spoken like every other walken movie ever the acting of tc and jb was just soooo much better 

actually i dont think those costumes are that bad but boy i am happy we didnt have a child alia in this movie",2024-03-05 01:26:09
why are the bene gesserits dressed like that  they look right out of a western cowboy movie,2024-03-05 02:21:24
frank herbert pronounced it jawhawd back in the day lmaoooo i  you not,2024-03-01 08:36:58
im all for book accuracy but what is gained beyond the word itself i dont recall if it has any implied significance beyond not of christian origin as juxtaposition against catholicism as an example of control vis relgion,2024-03-01 07:30:11
jihad was always a bad thing lol,2024-03-04 15:37:01
if fedayeen was ok for the movie they couldve still said jihad,2024-03-24 07:32:53
"frank herbert himself stated that he wrote dune messiah as a counter to all the people who read dune and thought paul was the hero and had won which kind of makes sense at the end of dune paul

 becomes emperor and ruler of arrakis

 marries a princess

 has chani love him

 has all the fremen as blind followers

 has all harkonnens dead

 his mother is a much more supporting figure

i think villeneuve decided to make the change to chanis character to head off any similar conclusions people would have walking out of part 2 and to really drive home the point that by winning paul has lost something that truly matters to him yes part 3 will be based on messiah but i think a lot will be different which honestly might be for the best",2024-03-01 17:28:52
"i think it makes things much more interesting then just having everyone in pauls camp be rooting for him  

she knows the prophecy is  and now its created this monster thats gonna be a galactic holy wrecking ball  

shes seen this guy shes fallen in love with become a figure of destruction due to the fanatics she hates messing with powers beyond their understanding  

she supported him because she does want whats been for her people but can also see things are getting out of control  

she doesnt care about thrones just prosperity for her people and now hes back to making deals with the foreigners",2024-03-01 08:13:51
hot take he’s going to take elements of books past messiah and tell a story to wrap it all up nicely 4 hours baby i can dream,2024-03-01 07:54:57
denis villeneuve pretty much indirectly confirmed it in interviews he said that while he wants to take a short break from dune as in doing another movie between part 2 and messiah they are already writing a sequel and wants to make another dune when he has a good script,2024-03-01 14:22:35
i loved messiah personally its my favorite of the first 4 for sure i cant wait for the adaptation,2024-03-01 19:24:03
i think it’s not even gonna be messiah the way he ended with chani feels that it’s gonna be more of her story going forward and there gonna grab pieces from the different dune sequels to make a “part 3” it makes perfect sense since the book sequels aren’t as well known and will allow them to really deviate away from the books  like they seemed to have wanted in this movie,2024-03-01 06:01:20
denis wants to do another movie before part 3 so part 3 is probably 56 years out which will help in aging up the younger actors,2024-03-01 15:47:45
i took a 50mg gummy about 15 minutes before the movie,2024-03-05 16:01:49
i saw this movie at alamo drafthouse and they had him edited in to arrakis doing this dance in a preshow video,2024-03-04 16:36:41
i think they were going for the emperor looking tired and outplayed but seemed like he was standing there awkwardly a lot plus you know paulthe housestheir ships are comin and all that,2024-03-04 02:59:47
iirc one of the later books described the city as a suffocating darwinian place covered in a thin film of oil and chemicals like kowloon city but in the future,2024-03-26 13:47:53
a failure with roots in the original novel i’d add,2024-03-27 16:22:49
agreed,2024-03-01 23:49:53
"can you speak more on why you feel oppenheimer was a better adapted screenplay 

to me as someone who has read both american prometheus was a lot easier to adapt to the screenplay for oppenheimer than dune was for dune 2 denis had to make choices that couldve been fairly polarizing for the audience inclusion of alia gurneys assassination etc i dislike the scenes in oppenheimer with einstein and how gene tatlocks suicide was portrayed however cannot really think of a single stylistic change i disagreed with here so in my view i would have given dune 2 the award for adapted screenplay 

i would have to do more reading on technical production to understand the work that went into both a lot of work went into making dune appear real whereas oppenheimer was shot as real as it could get theres a distinction here

i do agree about cm being a better lead in oppenheimer than tc for dune 2

best picture is a wholly subjective award and id have given it to multiple of the other movies nominated over oppenheimer and dune 2 even if dune 2 had come out last year",2024-03-02 06:53:59
yeah i think acting awards wise oppenheimer would have stole the show  in a weird world i think chalametzendaya get an oscar nod though,2024-03-01 23:19:18
he wasnt ridiculous and terrible but yeah there was a bit of a leslie nielsen effect going on there,2024-03-03 03:16:13
yeah i got the point that’s why i said what i said i know some people might not totally get that and are probably deceived by the blindfold faith the southern fremen show in the movie,2024-03-03 06:36:25
im not a big fan of sci fi reads but i got what the point of the story is obviously… does reading the books really impact you as much as the movies do,2024-03-03 06:35:06
my imax showing in oklahoma on a thursday was sold out bro,2024-03-01 05:03:07
you also have to remember that this is one of the most popular sci fi books ever written it has a massive fan base and then added on to it being a  amazing movie it will do fine,2024-03-01 05:37:35
denis will give us this beautiful epic trilogy beloved by all then well get dunes version of the hobbit trilogy  prequels brought to you by jj abrams ,2024-03-01 07:12:44
i saw an early screening last week at regal in lacey but i might have to see it again at cinerama i love that screen,2024-03-02 05:32:43
thats so sick,2024-03-02 04:21:41
i don’t think it’ll meet oppenheimer had oppenheimer not been gassed by barbenheimer and the cultural movement between those two i think it probably would have done closer to 650,2024-03-01 05:22:11
using a 100point scale is absurd lol,2024-03-02 06:33:46
ya i know in the book they start as teenagers the film they are obviously a bit older in my opinion but age is never mentioned also by the end of the book they are adults,2024-03-01 13:17:41
impressive that frank herbert like paul could see the future and know of this when he wrote the book in the 60s,2024-03-03 16:57:54
it’s honestly inescapable the worms scene wasn’t just in the trailers it was in the ancillary advertising partnership material as well every time i turned on a hockey game or checked threads it was there  just brutal,2024-03-05 13:27:07
charles dance,2024-03-16 13:22:08
i get that but oppenheimer and dark knight both switched aspect ratios maybe i don’t understand it but why didn’t dune change at all,2024-03-02 15:06:39
"gotcha guess i’m just confused on how much paul being the kwisatz haderach was a real thing vs a fake story used to convince the fremen he’s their messiah

i thought the whole point was that paul wasn’t necessarily special but just convincing the fremen through false propaganda but it turns out he is actually special",2024-03-02 20:45:07
it would have been a  of a thing to just show one 1 shot of someone launching off the worm with some sort of glider on their back,2024-03-04 03:08:34
in the books fremen children and old women were beating up the sardukar living your whole life in the harshest environment possible has made them stronger,2024-03-04 09:51:09
yes she can a big plot point in the books is that fremen are exceptional fighters from a very young age,2024-03-04 16:39:49
"thats the point  
  
the fremen kept stuggling and slogging through guerilla warfare which worked well against rabban but failed against feyd because paul would not embrace his potential  
  
once he embraced it you have a charismatic leader who can see the future and consult thousands of years worth of memory leading millions of the best soldiers in the universe sandworms remember that sandworm riding was unknown outside the fremen or at least considered a myth and willing to use nuclear weapons great cultural taboo  
  
of course the emperor in his hubris is getting steamrolled",2024-03-04 10:29:21
this is why you dont look up guides and cheat codes for video games,2024-03-04 08:13:20
my assumption as well,2024-03-09 07:28:56
you’re tripping no one else thinks that,2024-03-09 13:52:22
why would they use a stunt double for a nonstunt,2024-03-09 22:48:22
but i dont denis wanted the fremen to accept him immediately he wanted the schism between the believers and non believers i think it made the story stronger as you saw the process of conversion,2024-03-04 10:47:05
exactly,2024-03-03 16:58:08
baron harokennen does stellan skarsgaard refers to it as my dune in one of his scenes,2024-03-05 04:09:07
she loves him but has reservations about what  become she tells him shell love him as long as he stays who he is in the beginning of their relationship but he drastically changes by the end all but confirming her reservations,2024-03-01 17:13:25
i think it was but the second half wasnt really implied where paul and chani are still together,2024-03-03 21:06:10
" wasnt it heavily implied the marriage was a political one

that is quite literally the closing line of the book said explicitly by jessica not implied at all",2024-03-04 01:46:38
"he was forced to follow the path is pure invented drama and goes against the love story weve been told

i think the movie needed a character that while close to paul clearly sees through the messiah  and realises that this is a scary ending so as we dont have the inner monologues of the book you need someone to be the voice of reason and put very clearly for the audience that this is not really a story about a heroic chosen one",2024-03-03 22:37:01
" and for chani to leave paul alone and abandon him because he was forced to follow the path is pure invented drama and goes against the love story weve been told on top of that it seems unnecessary to me it is in the third part of the story where this character really will shines with her own light

yeah i wasnt really a huge fan of the way chani was completely changed i can get the complaints that her character wasnt that fleshed out in the books but i would have rather seen the base idea of her expanded on instead of just being a completely different person that fulfills a different role entirely 

i dont think chanis movie character is bad in a vacuum but it did feel off to me the whole time to see the person who in the books was always pauls biggest supporter and believer basically seem to just resent him",2024-03-03 22:39:51
bruh we get it you dont like dune and probably didnt read any of the books so just move on dont  on other peoples experience that genuinely loved the film it was a very good adaptation of one of the most beloved scifi books in history i mean the book dune has based and influenced so many stories from star wars to foundation and countless others,2024-03-06 03:25:07
that’s what great about the truth it’s true whether or not you believe it,2024-03-07 15:34:45
i kept wishing the film was longer,2024-03-02 03:55:38
i felt the exact same way,2024-03-02 00:37:30
nobody  says that to be taken seriously,2024-03-03 04:56:12
no problem thanks for the thoughtful response,2024-03-01 15:21:50
as a slight correction shields dont nullify lasers they trigger a large explosionsomewhere in the vicinity of a nuke the mutually assured destruction doctrine means that the great houses have all agreed not to use lasers basically wherever possible,2024-03-02 10:36:04
my memory is a bit fuzzy but was it kynes who disabled the shield and not doctor yueh,2024-03-02 09:15:12
"it would have truly been an abomination

some things just dont translate to the silver screen telepathic  toddler was already weird in the book which is saying something so thank shai hulud we avoided renesmee levels of  here imo even a well done faithful adaptation of young alia would have alienated most viewers ala aryakillsthenightking 

keeping alia a superfetus and making jessica extra creepy was one of the single best departures from the book so far right up there with not having the baron be a  on screen",2024-03-03 01:24:26
in the 1984 version they had a girl who was like 8 or 9 years old play alia and have someone else dub over her voice if they decided to go that route this was pretty much the only way they would have been able to make it happen,2024-03-03 02:47:46
i was hoping it was going to be anya taylor joy doing voice over for a child,2024-03-03 01:17:34
they should have got bootsy instead,2024-03-05 16:15:05
or you dont have time for ,2024-03-06 11:44:00
gotta throw top gun maverick in there especially in imax,2024-03-02 14:59:32
"i never watch movies again unless it’s been 10 years but this movie i will go see again in theater 

this is just such a rare gem we haven’t seen in a decade 

meanwhile marvel and disney have tried to destroy true cinema year in and year out",2024-03-04 05:26:21
first show is already on the way this year,2024-03-05 01:20:38
yeah the more ive thought about it the more i like that theres still someone who doubts paul makes it more impactful that its chani,2024-03-01 04:27:07
theyre part of the plot against paul in dune messiah so theyll definitely be there,2024-03-01 04:13:15
im not hot on just using atomics to threaten the spice and not the more interesting use of the worms,2024-03-01 03:33:52
which ones i didn’t notice any but i noticed some deliberate echoes such as feyd about to do gom jabbar,2024-03-01 21:58:19
"that doesnt really answer the question though

why do they care that his bloodline survives

because at first it seemed like they wanted him to be emperor because they could control him but then lea seydoux getting pregnant also was important to them",2024-03-01 16:05:22
"i asked this question before i learned there was going to be a third one so i didnt see the point in advancing that plot 

based on the ending i thought we were just saying the holy war is sure to succeed and paul will take the throne by force the end",2024-03-01 16:04:20
good choice,2024-03-02 01:39:32
smart i wish that i had thought of this im tempted to rewatch the film with earplugs in and seeing if i enjoy it more,2024-03-02 02:23:54
funnily enough it was the opposite with my theater the trailers were mixed normally but as soon as the movie started it was as though someone turned up the volume too much i am more used to commercials and trailers being louder to catch your attention,2024-03-02 01:51:46
im a pretty attentive person and i contemplated leaving the theatre during the 3rd spice rig take down luckily the end sort of made up for it but seemed too short by comparison,2024-03-02 21:33:14
tbf a black sun symbol is also a part of  iconography,2024-03-03 21:42:38
thanks for that explanation i was definitely conflating the two,2024-03-04 02:59:32
hes not the kwisatz haderach hes a very naughty boy,2024-03-04 03:06:55
no he is remember when he explained that guys grandmother to him and when he said he saw the narrow path to get to the least bad future those were both him consciously using his ability to see the future,2024-03-06 15:39:01
" has prophetic dreams

after he takes the water of life to become the kh he does literally see the future but only possible futures and even then not always in their entirety  nor does he know which possible future will come to be  so it can be useful or strangle you in uncertainty or if you rely on your precience too much cause you to fear risking any decision for which you cant see a clear result

in the specific case of the fight with feyd paul had no visions at all except that he was likely to die",2024-03-06 16:12:09
"yes it is common there are enough german speakers in the world to finance a high quality dubbing industry if youre used to watching dubbed you dont even notice the flaws it has its just minor stuff here and there that annoys me

another issue i had was some german voice actors did not speak convincing fremen they sounded like foreigners who recently learnt the language not natives especially stilgar

i wouldve watched in english if id been on my own and its becoming more and more common that theaters offer both versions

may i ask where are you from do you watch foreign movies subtitled in your language or does everyone speak english",2024-03-10 00:16:00
"yeah dune was also greatly inspired by lawrence of arabia star wars as well as it came out in 1962 and frank herbert wrote dune in 19631965

 frank herberts dune was partly inspired by the seven pillars of wisdom by te lawrence also known as lawrence of arabia herbert was influenced by the story of lawrences involvement in the arab revolt during world war i and the messianic overtones of his character in an early version of dune the hero was similar to lawrence of arabia but herbert decided to add more layers to the plot",2024-03-17 22:43:01
its dunin time,2024-03-18 00:05:06
"i actually enjoyed the over the top vibe
its like the most extreme case of unchecked power
where a tyrant has such a strong leech on his servants that he can act all out without fearing uprise


best case scenario we get an r rated dune series with alot of harkonen content


i mean like all in with the lore child sexslaves extreme cruelty and just horror level of evil


not becauce i enjoy that those things exist
but becauce similar things do exist in our world
and dune could be a great vesel to show people how bad life can get",2024-03-23 08:31:24
"the movie also doesnt fully contextualize what paul and jessica bring to the fremen  its briefly referenced in the first movie when paul fights against jamis that he fights like the witches iirc thats the phrase used

this is a reference to something thats more prominent in the books which is that the bene gesserit learn an incredibly lethal close combat martial art known as the weirding way in the book paul and jessica teach the fremen fighters this technique which makes them much more deadly than the sardaukar in addition to being vastly more numerous than expected",2024-03-28 15:56:28
thank you for the reply i didn’t read the books so i’m sure there’s a lot missing from the movies i think it’s a little dumb that the emperor didn’t know the fremen could ride worms you’d think after monitoring the planet for centuries that would have been picked up that’s my only real gripe about the movie,2024-03-28 01:18:35
i know but i was surprised at how easy it was to destroy his entire army and get to him,2024-03-27 22:30:04
even just the walken hair hes got such a distinctive hairline and they did not alter in any way meanwhile you cant even see pughs face most of the time there were a number of ways to have avoided a walkening™ and they didnt even try,2024-04-08 19:29:46
because downvoting just because you disagree is bad form,2024-03-01 19:07:47
well because star wars holds a special place in my life lol and i wanted the best for it but it’s so bad now and disney is so bad,2024-03-01 16:05:17
yeah one approach is to try and create great art the other is essentially a movie by committee aimed at making money as the primary goal ,2024-03-01 18:16:47
"well the movie portrays rabban as a complete buffoon and feyd is described by the bene gesserit as psychotic but intelligent 

 but he never felt like a threat because he needed his opponents drugged at the arena

but the last fighter wasnt drugged and feyd disabled his own shield to fight him thats the point",2024-03-03 01:58:09
they could have at least made her a baby that jessica carries around that would have extended the time span by up to about 1 year,2024-03-06 12:16:47
yeah theres like a 1 in a million chance you end up with kirsten dunst in interview with a vampire most likely it would be a really rough child performance or a twilight renesmee situation,2024-03-06 17:34:15
" though i suppose when one side is riding sandworms into battle they have a large advantage

when one sides leader can see all futures and has picked the one where he wins they may have an advantage as well",2024-03-01 04:57:48
this is kind of inherent in the book to be honest once paul rallies the fremen the bad guys all just kind of get rolled over herbert is way more interested in writing about pauls internal reckoning with his destiny etc than external adversaries,2024-03-01 04:05:37
true was expecting them to use more atomics but they had to save a few for the jihad holy war™ of the sequels but the final fight was  brilliant pure uncut action in the best possible way,2024-03-01 04:14:31
in all fairness herbert breezes right through most every battle in the series not saying this to suggest that they needed to take the same approach for the film it’s just funny that i had the same reaction reading the battle sequences throughout the books,2024-03-01 05:28:29
werent the sardaukar insanely good fighters too they were puppets here the battlefield fight was over so fast it didnt really have an emotional impact indeed what lotr often achieves since part two now is compared with,2024-03-01 08:43:39
yes that’s how i understood it the harkonens took their advanced machinery with them and left the archaicworn down assets for the atreides once they reclaimed arrakis they brought back the good stuff i agree that it’s a narrative weakness it should have been clearer,2024-03-01 04:40:12
i was wondering where is she going nobody is at home theyre all out of fighting,2024-03-01 12:42:08
have you never gone for a drive when you’re upset i think you’re reading into it too much if you think she was going off to be a hermit,2024-03-01 06:53:52
im watching it for the second time as well once is just not enough with films like dune,2024-03-02 08:23:01
saw for a second time as well but thought her acting was better the 2nd viewingi just think everyone else is a heavyweight so she gets a bit overshadowed the eye twitch in the final scene where he proposes to irulan was tough thoughwish they did another take,2024-03-04 05:17:56
extended the movie needs to be severely cut down,2024-04-05 04:38:51
why are you commenting here if you havent seen it,2024-03-05 19:50:11
maybe its been a while since ive read the book i can recognise some of the changes though like chani being given a much more adversarial role to paul when in the book she was almost entirely with him i think the emperor was equally minor in the book but im not sure and it feels like they couldshould have fixed some of that but it also feels like walken is very miscast i think it should have been someone else with more screen presence i havent read messiah so i dont know how the story ends,2024-03-01 12:05:58
i honestly dont think thats an excuse they should try to fix whatever problems the book had to make it the best movie possible and its pretty good dont get me wrong but the pacing was a major issue for me too stretched out in the first two acts and rushed in the last one,2024-03-02 00:46:45
agreed wrt to the worldbuilding they really should have elaborated at some point how the lasers interact with the shields because theres a wholeass scene dedicated to them carefully destroying the ornithopters and then wrecking the harvesters with lasers and i could feel everyone in the theatre going why didnt they take the thopters out with the lasers and the fremen have been living in the desert for thousands of years and are a very advanced civilisation forced to be resourceful conveyed through their development of the stillsuits and the wind harvesters but none of that comes across as well as it could have i assume most of it is cause of time and they had to cut some of it out,2024-03-01 12:32:59
"i honestly thought this would be the film where i’d finally get the chalamet hype given early impressions 

and yet i found that he continues going through films with his one forlorn expression and bad case of mumble acting that one scene where he delivers the speech to the fremen is not enough to save the performance which was meh from the first movie there’s just no dynamism or true embodiment of the character",2024-03-03 05:27:59
hate to break it to ya but villeneuve has spoken out against extended cuts before,2024-03-03 06:21:38

didn’t think i was unfairly criticizing the film i think it’s good but it’s weird that people can’t talk about it and just want to throw downvotes instead,2024-03-02 18:56:44
i thought i was going crazy after seeing it for not understanding the hype haha,2024-03-03 05:58:22
funny that the butler performance keeps getting praised as one of the standouts i wish there could be easier discussions about the film instead of just people labeling it a masterpiece immediately as an absolute without any possible dialogue to discuss the film,2024-03-02 11:01:21
"i left this film thinking it was really solid and having enjoyed it but being completely baffled by all of the praise i’d heard one of my coworkers has seen it four times already and said they’d give their first born to be able to experience it for the first time and i just don’t understand it didn’t seem all that special to me 

i think you nailed it in that we’ve been bombarded with garbage movies to the point that something like this movie has garnered such a reaction",2024-03-18 22:41:42
i agree that it is an overall improvement over the 1st film especially world building aspects,2024-03-03 06:00:40
"my post is completely acknowledging the different opinions on this film i like to add depth to a response about the film instead of saying “wasn’t good didn’t like it” 

i’m not sure what your comment really is about except expressing that you’re annoyed i explained why i didn’t like the film and was open to discussion about it you wanting me to “move on”and not discuss the film“dismantle praise” is ironic since that’s asking me to not say my thoughts at all cause you don’t like them no need to try and gatekeep how detailed comments and opinions can be",2024-03-04 16:10:33
as much as i enjoyed the movie it’s nearly incomprehensible for non book readers unless they have someone explain what is happening it’s actually a bit messy for non book readers it’s a good film for sure but not even in the zip code of genius,2024-03-02 18:27:26
" i completely disagree the film was genius and probably one of the best adaptations of all time

you need to read more books and see more movies even the end of this dune 2 changed a lot from the books and pauls entire personality is different way more villainous here towards the end the holy war isnt explained well at the end and too rushed",2024-03-03 00:34:55
it wasnt very faithful to the source material when it came to certain important characters  paul chani and especially jessica were all significantly different characters in the book  the visuals and sound were incredible but plot and dialogue had issues for me,2024-03-04 01:57:32
i think its strongly implied shes already pregnant in the scene where they ,2024-03-02 04:47:15

"the plastic surgery fauxbeauty look doesnt last it will be many years before they make another film

"but as the nephew of baron he was such a useless buffoon and a bit of a coward which is kind of surprising he should have been more like his brother ruthless and confident not necessarily smart

baron seemed really weakened in dune 2 vs dune 1",2024-03-10 06:26:38
 thank you that what i found off about his performance i just couldnt put my finger on it till now its wild to see him turn a 180 in acting from from his amazing performance in cmbynwhich i think will remain his best performance of his career to what ever this is i dunno what happened but its probably the direction i think zendaya and tim had no chemistry what so ever,2024-03-03 09:18:04

yeah i googled and that seems to be what happens in the books i forgot that part but in the movie they are always at full speed so it made me question it,2024-03-03 01:43:27

he did want to carry his body though and in the most difficult moment he asked jamis to talk to him and jamis encourages him to drink the water of life essentially ,2024-03-03 23:38:56
i think part of the point was that he couldnt live peaceably they only accepted him in the first place because of his skills as a warrior they would have killed him for his water otherwise same with jessica she didnt have the option of just fading into the background it was become our new reverend mother or you die,2024-03-13 16:39:32
i will add the outcome was also unexpected because jesica was ordered to have a daughter and not a son the benefit gesserit wanted to marry an atreides daughter to the feydrautha based their calculations this would produce the qwizat haderach paul and the exposure to the spice brought it a generation early,2024-03-17 18:57:59
"ahh okay that makes complete sense thank you  i love the story so much

so they really wouldnt have expected jessica to become so important amongst the fremen

i suppose not because it was stilgar that told her to take over because the reverand mother is really old",2024-03-17 03:53:07

"but denis cowrote the screenplay and pumped up jessicas character and made her more interesting she has more interaction and agency in this movie and isnt a sitting prop

if he could do that for jessica he should be able to write more interesting things for chani a main character i felt that last cliffhanger shot was unearned she was not interesting enough in the film version to have that final shot",2024-03-03 01:08:47

ah that would explain it,2024-03-02 04:53:27
"yep her scowling hard at the end was getting obnoxious to watch also can someone explain what does she want she doesnt believe pauls prophecies but she sure enjoys the help paul gave to the fremen of the north  south what exactly is she scowling about again does she want to destroy harkonnens or what

if anything paul should be scowling something hard he just found out his true bloodline and it grosses him out to no end",2024-03-03 01:10:44
the series continues but overall this story can be seen as a conclusion even if dune messiah is likely to be made this is the ending of the original novel,2024-03-01 03:24:26

"you’re probably right but dv obviously tweaks things adaptation to maximize his vision  the experience as a movie  

little sister not born time scale 3mo vs 3yrs no guild extra beast scenes calling muadib abomination etc etc etc  

i would’ve enjoyed the emperor having more development and better use of the actor i would’ve enjoyed a better buildup to the final battle to communicate the stakes i don’t know the audience really appreciated the “this is it” of it all a longer and perhaps more dramatic battleaction sequence the way the final knife fight was dramatic  

also felt cheesy and rushed that paul doesn’t explain his reasoning to chani privately and explain “you’re still my concubine for life” instead he tosses her a throw away line moments before asking to marry what’s her name a3 felt really rushed   

all my homies agree so obviously i’m right s",2024-03-01 07:26:42
"he also said he didnt push the emotional elements of dune 1 enough and vowed to improve that in dune 2

i see the improvement but i also dont think he pushed it far enough theres 23 critical scenes i remember in dune 2 where i felt it should get your heart pounding and feeling something paul drinking the worm poison and getting revived for instance

instead it seemed rushed and even disappointing denis seems to drop the ball on making certain moments really powerful",2024-03-03 00:28:41
yeah how dare a movie maker show not tell,2024-03-04 20:41:40
"my buddies think im doing a bit too i legit just dont like it strange to me that people cant have differing views on this

i saw it compared to lord of the rings return of the king i dont even see them in the same ballpark rotk is a masterpiece i wouldnt watch dune 2 again maybe if i get high and its on streaming or something",2024-03-01 14:59:18
yes thats the feeling i couldnt put into words lol looked like christopher walken was just edited in felt odd,2024-03-03 14:56:27
"man i  love this comment i felt like ive more or less understood the story pretty well seen the movies and a few hundred pages into the first book but you really nailed some things down for me that i was still struggling to place

one thing i struggle with though is when you say

 if he hadnt selfishly picked this path for personal revenge at the end of part one despite knowing the risks from his visions 

werent the visions that paul had for some time on caladan and also arrakis basically evidence that pauls path did indeed lead to the desert meaning isnt it in some way preestablished that he would assimilate with the fremen and learn their ways  meet chani

like if he had simply decided to flee the planet with jessica would his visions of the fremen just have stopped it always seemed more significant and set in stone than that",2024-03-21 21:50:04
"awesome comment and makes a lot more sense i particularly appreciate that you recognise how he clearly is shown to actually have good intentions when he takes off the ring 

i agree that he starts off seeking revenge and that this is a bad thing  but the film obviously shows an arc of a character and i think that arc is much better described as showing him becoming a true leader of a people despite starting from selfish motivations than the arc of a villlain fulfilling his villainhood 

the reason i dont think antihero is particularly clear either is because its not shown that he actually does anything wrong the scene where he drinks the blue worm juice shows that he has a premonition and realises that he must go to the south theres no reason to believe thats because he realises he wants to conduct a galactic genocide but that hes foreseen that its the only way for the fremen to survive against a clearly evil enemy its not remotely clear to me that he hasnt had actual premonitions when he drinks this magic blue juice he tells zendaya he will always love her just before marrying florence pugh as a sort of means to show that his heart is pure and that what hes doing is for the sake of the premonition not because he just fancies being emperor

none of this is because hes an actual hero of prophecy though  pauls abilities are the result of him being the endproduct of a millennia long eugenics program by the bene gesserit the kwisatz haderach paul  jessica are essentially posing his sciencegiven kh abilities in front of the fremen as fate given making the latter believe that its because hes the lisan al gaib of their fake prophecy so that he can seize religiopolitical power over the fremen primarily for his goals

do you only know this because of the books",2024-03-21 10:51:06
"yeah i think i missed some crucial bits and wasnt looking for others as i didnt remember the bit about the prophecy being totally made up but i still think the film puts him on a pretty clearly heroic arc and i think the key point is when he drinks the water of life and suddenly feels clear about what he needs to do this seems to me to be played as totally genuine and well intentioned to boot theres no indication that hes doing it selfishly or because he just wants tonnes of people to die 

not knowing about the broader themes of the book its perfectly possible from this film that hed go on to lead his people into an epic battle with the other houses defeating each of the similarly blatantly evil leaders of which and becoming a benevolent ruler of the galaxy that wouldnt be a remotely strange turn of events based on what we actually saw in this film and its a pretty normal heroic film arc yaknow like luke skywalker is clearly the hero even though destroying the death star presumably killed hundreds of thousands of regular people on it",2024-03-21 22:59:13
"that walk across the desert challenge was so weird though they presented it as some incredible challenge that he likely won’t be able to do at all then he just walks for a bit meets zendaya she shows him how to sand walk properly and…it’s over where was any challenge how long did it take what happened

felt incredibly jarring to me",2024-03-04 10:50:20
"chanis friend seems to have been a spy  when feyd rautha is there they said she is a spy  left behind  seems logical since we dont see  how the harkonen find the sitch in the first place   
i guess she wasnt into paul becoming leader  kind of weird though since we dont get a hint she would do something like this just because she doesnt like him",2024-03-04 09:38:37
the massive storm was their cover to hide the armys advance,2024-03-03 20:56:05
the last point definitely bothered me as well i dont think its a reasonable explanation that they didnt notice the thousands of fremen gathering around them because the emperor already knew war was coming and people were complacent its ridiculous the emperor felt the need to show up with his army and flagship and has clearly done some amount of scanning or whatever since he knows there are signs of life in the south which the harkonnens didnt realize the idea that his forces would be incapable of noticing thousands of people gathering over the next ridge or even just not bother to monitor anything out of eyesight is silly,2024-03-03 19:08:41
the random killing of subordinates was so dumb,2024-03-04 07:08:22
"also  how what about these sniperrayweapons that can take down a harvester  not a single mention what these are and why they are not used more often   
when i first saw the harkonen patrol i thought they look bad  and mean business but they were taken out very cheaply in my opinion",2024-03-04 09:48:44
"i have not read the books so i appreciate the insight what you said makes sense and im sure it is more fleshed out in the books but a lot this stuff isnt laid out very well in the movie imo 

the fremen weren’t confident in themselves until they had paul as their prophet

the fremen we see in the north are split on paul being a prophet and it seems that paul is just assimilated into the group rather than influencing them outright are there any scenes with him directing or advising them to do something i know he made that comment about moving north as you pointed out but there was certainly no enthusiasm for the idea  

the only thing stopping the fremen was resources

does paul providecontribute to them obtaining these resources initially from what i understand the northern fremen already had weapons and equipment and knew how to use them too resource wise it seems they were fine until the southern war when he provided the family nukes

pretty much when you take their shields away have superior warriors and now have a leader who understands how to beat these people

can you explain the shield thing are you talking about his information to chani about the aircrafts shields  besides that though im not sure what differing strategy or important pieces of information that paul gave to change the outlook of this war 

i think a scene or two showing pauls actual influence rather than him learning their culture would go along way in establishing his leadership abilities and how he sparked a civil war",2024-03-02 08:16:48
of course i understood what happened thats not the point the point is that the way the scene is stitched together is quite jarring,2024-03-05 03:13:41
yeah i got what happened just that in the moment it wasnt quite clear but it was apparent paul was going to win so it didnt matter much,2024-03-04 19:20:08
" isnt the reason obvious it was to make sure that audiences didnt leave the theatre thinking that they witnessed a heros great triumph

there’s about a hundred more interesting ways they could have got that across rather than just showing chani being upset for the 50th time it also sends mixed messaging since she seems more upset that she got dumped rather than the whole “galactic jihad” thing which only hurts chani’s characterization in my opinion",2024-03-20 15:09:45
"isnt the reason obvious it was to make sure that audiences didnt leave the theatre thinking that they witnessed a heros great triumph  but instead dwelling on how paul had in effect wronged betrayed  hurt chani though we know that after a certain point he had very little choice in the matter

but the film has also just shown us that hes had a very strong premonition that this is what he needs to do with no indication that he has decided he wants to just  everyone for the fun of it i think if you havent read the books and dont realise who paul actually is the film simply does not demonstrate that what has happened is bad i dont even know who the other houses are are they like the harkonnen ie the most blatant villains ever put to screen",2024-03-21 10:11:56
thanks,2024-03-01 12:23:03
agreed i definitely felt chalamet worked better as the film went on zendaya just fell flat for me throughout,2024-03-03 01:03:52
absolutely felt this one suffered from blockbusterization to appeal to more i get it but dissapointed,2024-03-03 03:02:23
"yes thank you i enjoyed the experience but somehow came out appreciating dune 1 more dune 2 had studio notes written all over it…especially the pacing and romance subplot

"the nuclear weapons weren’t really used to resolve anything 

the nuclear weapons were the key to getting to the emperor there was a huge storm coming to disable the shields and if the nukes werent used to break the mountain then the storm wouldnt have disabled the emperors shields",2024-03-02 02:18:32
finally someone who prefers the first one over this i felt that some portions were given too much time  the entire first act of paul becoming a fremen  and some were rather rushed  the entire third act this made the finale seem rather unearned and didnt let us reflect upon what pauls actions have resulted in,2024-03-01 21:09:37
"no time to breath

you do realise that many people were complaining that the first one was too slow right and if theres one thing denis would have learned from blade runner 2049  dune part one is that when making a big budget film these days if you give it more than the bare minimum time to breath the sizeable attentiondeficit section of the audience will say they fell asleep 10 minutes in lol 

at the end of the day its already 2hr 45 minutes long most people seem to like it even saying the pacing was much better and if they had made the pacing any slower the film would have been 3 hours your michael bay comparison comes off as baity btw

the emperor was also a let down  didn’t seem threatening or menacing at all

hes not meant to be more threatening or menacing than this  hes supposed to be primarily paranoid jealous  even kinda weak otherwise it wouldnt make sense how he was manipulated by the reverend mother",2024-03-01 12:14:40
yeah i got that bit but there wasn’t even a moment of him trying to resist everything else associated with going south,2024-03-03 13:11:16
"can you elaborate a little on what the writing on the wall was and the way in which his visions changed 

what i know at least what i think i know is that drinking the water of life granted him the powers of a reverend mother and fully opened his sight into the past now as well as the future and that this is how he learns the true about his lineage feels like it gave him the insight to say we have to be like harkonnens in order to succeed here but beyond that whats exactly the writing on the wall so to speak",2024-03-03 19:01:30
i dont think its too much to ask that the quality and scale of storytelling of a socalled film masterpiece add up to more than the sum of a bullet point list,2024-03-04 18:34:43
you’re not wrong in villeneuve’s preference on visual storytelling rather than dialogue he has personally said that he prefers to focus on his visuals and sounds rather than dialogue that being said all his movies still have solid dialogue that are at times just as good as his visuals,2024-03-02 11:21:25

"they said as much and i wasnt lost though like i said ive read basically everything i think my hangup is that they made a point to demonstrate that paul was still paul just going through dark motions  but they didnt do that for jessica rather they kinda made it seem even in private conversations with alia that jessica was about this life movie jessica from part one would not tolerate part 2 jessicas  towards her son 

kinda makes me think theyre gonna switcheroo jessica into the alia role if they keep going which could be fun its just eh ill watch a hundred more times",2024-03-02 02:17:24
"interesting because ive heard the opposite i heard that hes done well adapting the book because this portion is mostly people talking about the fighting thats happening and not showing any of it

theyve said that zendayas character has also been greatly improved upon i  havent read the book at all so this is just going on the things ive seen online",2024-03-02 21:31:50
"i dont think theres any need to fully adapt the book frankly it would have been impossible to execute alias involvement as a sentient 2 year old assassin 

while i can agree with your point in another comment about the death of his son i dont necessarily think his motivations are that strange considering he is basically forced to rise to the occasion after the destruction of sietch tabr

the liberties they took with what to edit or cut out of the movie seem mostly justified to create a more grounded story especially considering the source material is not the easiest to deal with 

also as a final note i might be wrong on some of these points it has been a while since i read the books but i cant recall any important addendums to the story in later books that would have made a significant impact",2024-03-03 00:06:20
i’ve read the book twice most recently 5 years ago i remember it being very anticlimactic i did like this movies ending a lot better i’m just wondering what sense does the general audience feel about the ending because it is very triumphant with the zimmer score and the smiles on the fremen but obviously as we know paul is heading down a dark path stained with blood so it has some mixed signals this could very well be intentional and i’m not criticizing it at all i’m just curious how others feel,2024-03-03 02:30:31
honestly hes made too many changes that he glasses over areas that should have been explained more the importance of spice the spacing guild the depths of the emperors plans etc,2024-03-03 02:36:53

that doesnt happen until the sequels,2024-03-03 15:04:35
"one of the key themes of dune is that leaders are as much pulled along by events as shape them more so in fact 

thats lost here its undermined by the way they changed jessica to a scheming evil manipulator and shoe horned in the bene gesserit being behind the whole bringing down leto thing which makes  all sense

the books make it clear that they focus on the idea of systems being greater than individual parts the stuff with keynes in the books is how this is explained to the reader the planetologist taking the wide overview unconcerned with the minutiae of the system but more with the overall flow of the processes within it

dont get me wrong its not a bad film and its the best dune adaptation so far but i feel the second one makes far too many changes that were not needed part 1 was much better and more true to the books i was hoping they could land it in part 2 but i feel they missed the mark  


but hey its subjective my gripes are mine not yours",2024-03-01 23:04:38
"i liked this film a lot and thought it was a spectacular experience i didn’t mind the changes and think some were needed 

that being said almost every character you named is better written as a villain protagonist or antihero though most of them are not antiheroes at all they are simply villains in the protagonist role than paul atreides and i don’t think they need to be rewritten to handhold certain parts of the audience who are incapable of seeing how morally corrupt they are some of the best discussions around tv and film i have ever had were about those characters 

i also have to admit that i have read dune and i am not a fan especially of the sequels i much prefer this film to the books themselves i will explain why

to put it simply hebert never truly subverts the “white savior” trope as it turns out that the galacial genocide is supposedly for the “greater good” and that paul’s superior bloodline will save the galaxy chani is complicit in his galacial genocide in the books and wholeheartedly supports him i’m sorry but i can’t roll my eyes harder at that as the message ends up being that the genocide of billions if not trillions is justified as paul and chani’s offspring is meant to save the world there’s a reason why the sequels to the first dune are rated less favorably and the overall message is actually revolting and cringeworthy 

the changes they made to chani in the film make it hard for me to see them faithfully adapting dune messiah without undoing the characterization they built for her in this film as her returning to a genocidal monster “out of love” somehow makes her an even worse person than the chani of the books who worships paul and is another one of his brainwashed cultists as she is aware of what is happening and what is being done in his name 

to be clear though i do like the changes they made to her character in this film i think they were needed the problem is that depending on how they move forward with this to perhaps stay faithful to dune messiah will undo that characterization for the sake of reuniting them we will see though i have faith in denis after creating this amazing film",2024-03-01 23:42:51
i thought he was great in the second half i didn’t care for him in the first film or the first half of this film but he really found his footing in the second half i thought,2024-03-01 23:45:59
so was she actually part of the prophecy or was she just paul’s  to get trust of the fremen or both,2024-03-01 07:30:48
i mean when pale man had stabbed him with his own knife and then came in to finish him off… the knife was in his gut then they fight over the other knife and pale man gets stabbed then we zoom out and the knife is in his shoulder instead of his gut,2024-03-01 13:47:56
like aggressive interstellar christianity,2024-03-01 23:16:16
so at some point why dont the other great houses just accept his rulership if hes going from world to world cleaning house lol,2024-03-02 04:01:40
yes but 70mm is 70mm this is a very tough decision,2024-03-02 04:16:26

ah  i disagree but i concede i lose the numbers war,2024-03-08 19:42:12
" 4 this is a big plot point that the movie omits completely there isnt satellite surveillance on southern arrakisthe spacing guild is preventing it in exchange for massive spice bribes from the fremen thats the reason why the harkonnens so vastly underestimated the strength of the fremen

yeah i think the lack of satellite coverage is the whole planet not just the south but also its a single throwaway line in part 1 i think doesnt even explain why just that it is that way",2024-03-17 01:45:40
"i remember they mention the lack of satellites in the first movie i think it was rabbon that says no one will be watching when they invade arrakeen

but they probably could have brought it up in this movie as well just for a reminder",2024-03-17 11:29:55
"i appreciate you answering me without condescendingly screaming at me to read the books lol its rarer than youd imagine haha

edit sorry for the triple reply my reddit bugged",2024-03-15 13:58:39
we dont really see any of that struggle in part 2 we just see the fremen blowing up spice rigs at will riding sand worms and mary sueing their opponents including elite sardaukar through the power of noble savagery and friendship,2024-03-02 16:32:29
"the book also has perfect line in the final chapter where paul laments that going down this path has turned stilgar from a friend and a great man into a fanatic religious follower he sees it as him turning his friend into a lesser version of what he was

 in that instant paul saw how stilgar had been transformed from the fremen
naib to a creature of the lisan algaib a receptacle for awe and obedience it
was a lessening of the man and paul felt the ghostwind of the jihad in it
i have seen a friend become a worshiper he thought

 will i lose gurney too paul wondered the way i lost stilgar  losing a
friend to gain a creature",2024-03-05 11:09:47
"yeah the emperor in the novel is in his mid70s but looks much younger due to spice prolonging life  
  
hes also supposed to look quite similar to leto atreides since the atreides are somewhat related to the imperial family which is another reason the baron harkonnen hates leto so much jealousy  
  
all three adaptations show him as an old man though",2024-03-05 09:54:17
"walkens shaddam was not how shaddam was portrayed in the book at all

also while the emperor was supposed to be in his 70s spice consumption made him look like he was in his 30s40s so casting a frail old man really makes no sense",2024-03-06 00:30:56
they literally have a  scene and even then its just awkward with zero chemistry,2024-03-01 03:20:02
" feyd is shown to be a really good fighter not just fighting for sport that was the entire point of him fighting a non drugged atreides fighter

feyd complained about it though and while lanville was a good fighter he did not fight on optimum terms maybe feyd from the book would have complained that the atreides fighters were too weak for him and he was ready for more

 also plot wise he’s really important to motivating paul to go south which is what kickstarts he messiah ascension feyd starts bombing the sietches

from pauls point of view the harkonnen are destroying his fremen home and it doesnt matter whos in charge

when feyd finally meets paul paul only sees him as an obstacle rather than a true nemesis feyd wasnt in pauls visions and paul never thinks about feyd in significant terms as he did with jamis even though feyd is a carefully designed bene gesseritt product

there is no tension in the movie that paul was supposed to be the daughter that feyd would have the kwizatz haderach child with

i still feel overall across both movies that rabban and feyd could have been the same character ie a henchman for the baron",2024-03-01 15:27:12

"i feel like people dont quite understand what dune is this movie is very true to the books but that also means the stuff that doesnt work so great in the book 

well except for chani im happy they did something with her",2024-03-02 11:58:11
yeah i wouldnt blame the romance on only her either… it was both of them the chemistry wasnt there they tried so hard with all the cuts to the stares in the first half but it didnt land for me,2024-03-06 11:17:00

thankfully the audience for this one was mostly civil in the rescreening of the first movie a couple of weeks ago there was one  who was literally playing some fps game on his phone i was about to yell at him when his friend pulled the phone out of his hands and sat on it which was hilarious,2024-03-01 10:50:46
you really have nothing useful to add and went out of your way to not bother understanding anything,2024-03-06 22:19:23

they literally showed how they harvest water from the air chani was showing paul how to fix wind traps they don’t shower part 1 had the education videos explaining these things to paul like how they farm roots underground for food,2024-03-06 22:00:35

"chani the role might be the heart and soul of the movie and it is a great role but zendaya doesnt quite have the chops to pilot her she kept falling back on this exaggerated pinched pout for all the different ways chani was displeased by paul in the third act anger shock grief heartbreak one pout to rule them all

"  the usage of atomic arsenal is prohibited so never in a million years did the emperor or any of them expect

the fremen have thousands of sietchs the one that got bombed was just one of them only a fraction of the northern forces were killed there it’s clear denis cared more about giving zendaya a meaty role than he did about whether it made sense in the context of the film chani frankly seemed more like a 21st century american than she did a fremen,2024-03-03 20:28:23
"fair when i say it worked i meant moreso in the fact that herbert managed to make the fight believably back and forth despite the fact that paul is essentially the strongest fighter in the universe

but yeah the bigger problem is that they made feyd a pretty one dimensional character and removed the things that make him such an effective foil to paul the harkonnens are underhanded and conniving  its their whole thing its why the baron defeats leto and its why they are wealthy beyond compare but not respected like the atreides having feyd fight with honor is not just boring but also completely off kilter with the essence of the harkonnens  pretty much 90 of what the baron feyd and rabban do in the second half of the book is plot against each other theyre not even honorable within their house let alone when fighting their enemies",2024-03-04 01:45:38

if he plans to make messiah why bother devoting time to it here  a lot of those themes dont necessarily make sense because pauls jihad hasnt taken place yet  especially when its going to lead to more needed changes in messiah the conclusion of the movie already felt rushed and the first half of messiah is so slow it would have given him plenty of time to do that there  if he wanted to give the fremen more depth he could have had more of the ancillary characters show up instead of trying to show that through one character by drastically changing her personality,2024-03-02 19:19:54

2 in the books theres an uneasy peace between the emperor and the great houses the houses have their armies the emperor has his sardaukar where the sardaukar are coming from why they are so fanatically dedicated to the emperor and how they become such fearsome fighters all that is a mystery at the beginning of the book if the houses joined together they could defeat the emperor but the sardaukar are still powerful enough that some of the houses would be completely annihilated in the process now house atreides has secretly been training troops specifically to fight against sardaukar and be able to match them in combat emperor shaddam was threatened by this and wanted to get rid of atreides before they get to a point where they can realistically stan up to his sardaukar to keep the peace he however cant move openly against them so instead he brings atreides into position lends his sardaukar to harkonnen in secret and lets them annihilate the atreides the blood feud between atreides and harkonnen is well known no one would be surprised if harkonnen attacks atreides after they lost arrakis to them this is something that is explained in the first book so it shouldve been shown in these two movies

this is by the way why the bene gesserit use the gom jabbar to test future rulers the rational machinelike response is to avoid needless pain and suffering human beings can override their rational response for a higher purpose

in this movie paul says that with his future sight he can see a narrow path through possible futures of horror and bloodshed he is trying to guide humanity forward in a path that doesnt lead to countless generations of darkness but though it evades the worst of it it is not a gentle pathleaving countless billions deadand it delves into some seriously weird territory

like the 3500year imperial reign of a humanturnedsandworm kind of weird the kind of weird that has countless clones of duncan idaho resurrected over and over again to foster a rebellious culture against endless imperial rule

in the books his sister is only four years old when she kills the baron she has the mind of an adult but shes nowhere near a fullgrown woman,2024-03-02 08:22:16
nah this adaptation was an improvement re chani i think  in the book she loses basically all character right after paul locks it down with her,2024-03-02 10:33:04
glad they took this approach with his sister seeing her do the stuff she did in the books at 4 years old just sounds weird to watch,2024-03-02 11:17:30

in that way chani mirrors jessica in how shes treated in the world of political marriages paul takes after his dad,2024-03-01 10:59:12
in the books this is true but chani is clearly slighted in the film the movie ended without her acceptance of this situation kind of an odd loose end,2024-03-01 22:46:05
whilst i can empathise with the difficulties of translating it for the big screen the fact that paul himself is barely given any substance and really elemental aspects of the dune story are barely given any weight time prescience for example i can’t help but feel a bit cheated also book arc aside the characters in the film and the love story dynamic was just quite poorly written in my opinion,2024-03-04 21:24:21
i mean that kind of happened here toojust didnt seem to ever matter  like give him a redemption or make him a big bad that gets out done by an even bigger bad when feyd comes into the picture  felt like they wanted the latter but they never established him as anything so feyd coming in and taking over from him didnt mean anything,2024-03-05 15:54:27

so it kinda seems like the bg have this prophecy and turned it into a religion that they feed to different populations but the religion and the prophecy are pretty much the same thing do i have that right,2024-03-02 18:51:21
"eh i wouldnt say theyre bad people though 

how do you define a good person",2024-03-03 01:11:31
also in dune 2 jessica i believe says paul should reserve his hand for a more strategic partner,2024-03-04 12:16:05
makes sense thank you,2024-03-04 15:30:36
i saw plenty of people shooting each other in both movies its part of the reason the world doesnt make any sense to me sometimes lasers work sometimes not sometimes shields work sometimes not then suddenly they have nukes but no mushroom cloud,2024-03-06 02:04:54
the water gave him access to the genetic memories of all his ancestors  bene gesserit normally just have access to female memories  hes basically a powerful human computer with full knowledge of history and human behavior,2024-03-09 09:54:41
yes why was she scheming with jessica to get paul to the south to become the leader of the fremen even though it meant killing millions of people  evil baby,2024-03-10 10:28:22
but also with you being right about stilgar he did not become a worshipper it seems until the very end of dune in the movie he fed into it from the beginning,2024-03-27 15:05:50
it just didnt make sense based on who she was in the books she defied the bg enough to produce a male instead of a femaleliterally her entire job so it doesnt make sense that she would sort of turn her back on her son for the bg plans idk i just feel like they made her one dimensional instead of having more complexity in the fact that she was a mother and a reverend mother and the conflict of seeing who her son was becomingbeing the mother of that,2024-03-26 13:46:41
did he have to drink the blue worm poison though it seemed like he took very little if any convincing and he knew chani wouldnt want him to do it she had just told him she would love him as long as he never changed and he went and changed immediately,2024-03-02 05:43:01
he was still skeptical and the start thinking its all bene gesserit trick then slowly he starts to think maybe my mom is right the prophecy is true then at the council he fully embraced it,2024-03-02 07:43:41
i suspect theyll have alia age more rapidly than normal due to being pre born not sure though that seems like the biggest hurdle,2024-03-05 14:32:39
i mean they introduced a very interesting and difficult sounding trial and then just skipped over it imagine if after introducing the worm riding they just skipped over the actual part where he rides the worm and then they flash forward to him doing something else completely from a movie sense why waste the screen time and exposition to introduce it and then just skip it,2024-03-05 02:50:27
"i guess i was in the army and studied military history a lot that commanders are never ever charging in the front even being in the vanguard unit is crazy but literally the first person leading the charge lol no just takes me out of the movie even the most daring military commanders who fought alongside men were never the first person you would see gurley leading the suicide charge or paul charging into sardaukar lines as the first guy its so unrealistic to the point that it takes me out of it a little

sardaukar felt weak i understand logically what youre saying but when watching it this time they honestly felt weak to me i wish we would see some scenes where they would take 45 fremen and then got overpowered or something we only see them lose again gripes i felt this couldve been so easily fixed with one scene of sardaukar dominating and then the stuff youve said were a lot more impactful also the nuke usage being forbidden thing wasnt really established in the movie from what i understand i could be wrong

we havent seen millions of fremen outpowering sardaukar weve seen fremen easily take them on 11 what youre saying would makes sense but we really havent seen much fight from the sardaukar at all correct me if im wrong

again to me the movie is a 910 and i bought an imax ticket to go see again this saturday",2024-03-14 17:01:47
"seeing it from the point of view that paul was mostly just using the fremen as a way to get revenge changes my perspective in a big way

even still once siech tabr was attacked the choice wasn’t so easy he could give up and flee the planet and then all the fremen would die at feyd rautha’s hand or he could intervene intervening would save the fremen and grant him revenge though it might lead to the galaxyspanning genocide i don’t know whether revenge or love motivated his choice at that point but maybe he thought in any case he could escape starting the jihad",2024-03-19 22:58:20
"did you actually see it in cinema 


cos the web rip that came out yesterday completely sucks in comparison ",2024-04-07 14:49:10
"i don’t think we need to wholly know his motives right now that’s part of what gets us more interested and invested in his character and the story 

what we do know is that he wants power and an army he doesn’t want to have the same fate as his father i just started the book and you also get a deeper sense in the book that he really loves his mother even despite the things she gets him into so protecting his mother is also a motive he wants revenge against the killer of his father and the atreides he probably also wants to protect chani though we’re left with a bit of a cliffhanger there we don’t know whether he is really all that interested in the princess irulan florence pughs character or if they’ll fall in love as far as we know right now it seems he just plans to make use of her to further his agenda we dont know if  try to get chani back after disappointing her so much or if paul and chani will reconcile

we also don’t know if  start to get a significant  complex and go power mad it seems thats were its going so far but it could all be an act or he might just be caught up in all the emotions he went through in the beginning of the books we get a possible sense from the bene jeserit spelling lol that he might be some special once in a lifetime kind of person who will be able to be a leader amongst leaders the bene jeserit aren’t sure but they kind of hint in the book that the jeserit are wondering if they can use paul as a tool to further their agendas 

so in short we have much to find out haha ",2024-03-06 14:03:41
so did i i would go as far as saying i really disliked it as a whole,2024-03-10 22:33:10
ditto its not a terrible movie but anythng beyond rating it a 5 is really pushing it the reviews are a joke the most upvoted posts in this thread even more so,2024-03-17 08:26:15
im sorry to hear that,2024-03-06 11:49:29
you disagree,2024-03-01 08:11:11
i agree less boring than the first movie but still boring the action scenes were good for the most part but felt like they were only 2 minutes long and the rest of the movie was talking and whispering,2024-03-14 21:19:44
" to the extent that stilgar says the boy is toying with jamis

part of the reason for this is that paul is trained in fighting against shielded opponents so every opportunity where the fremen see that paul should be cutting or killing jamis his reflexes instead have him slowing down at the last moment to pass the nonexistent shield and jamis dodges this makes it look like hes making fun of jamis going could have killed you there could have killed you there could have killed you again

in the book it comes up in the final fight where feyd fakes having this issue to trick paul",2024-03-06 18:12:20
"it helps in the book that paul or perhaps it was jessica been a few years since i read it immediately tells chani that irulan is solely a political marriage and he will never love or have children with her the very end of the book is jessica telling chani that history will view them the concubines as the actual wives

none of this was included in the film",2024-03-03 02:44:55
i don’t think he’s the hero either,2024-03-03 14:45:41
"paul has the fate of the human race on his shoulders pedestrian ideas of right and wrong dont apply to such an extreme case

he did the things he did because his visions of the future showed him its the only way for our species to survive",2024-03-04 17:16:36
most “villains” don’t think they’re evil they’re guided by their own morals and beliefs,2024-03-03 21:56:00
they do actually mention the landsraad and the navigators of the spacing guild in the first film as well as the importance of the spice and the fact that arrakis is its only source,2024-03-02 13:09:06
also too scared to say jihad,2024-03-02 08:28:29
okay i must have forgot that,2024-03-02 08:11:58
you right i’m dumb and forgot,2024-03-02 08:17:12
i feel like if he wanted that to be the message he shouldn’t have given paul the ability to see the future and inarguably say which eventschoices lead to the best version of it,2024-03-04 09:32:12
in no way or place was this conveyed in the movie…,2024-03-06 04:50:15
it was a kanly duel a method of solving conflict between the great houses ,2024-03-06 02:17:57
yea,2024-03-17 22:30:40
i bet ,2024-03-04 18:00:32
what i mean is from these comments it seems the intended reaction to paul by the end is supposed to be horror whereas my reaction was more like  yeah go get em paul,2024-03-10 02:31:02
i was just thrown when it was casually brought up through one line of exposition one of my very few flaws with this movie,2024-03-01 07:13:44
i remember the argument that using the atomics is okay you just cant use them on people being a big plot point in the end of the book,2024-03-04 14:29:06
we were robbed,2024-03-05 16:16:23
the fremen also have massive spice stockpiles and no one else really has much,2024-03-05 23:19:55
i forgot about gurney so the dead have been giving their moisture all this time for the sole purpose of eventually terraforming arrakis and it’s sacred because of this divine purpose,2024-03-05 21:44:11
this was a good response thanks for taking the time mate ,2024-03-06 02:00:25
i thought the same thing prior to last battle the freman who dont have air cover are just out in the open 12km away from the main enemy base,2024-03-06 02:01:47
if you could answer one more why did the other houses reject paul even though he was a duke and had the emperors forced cooperation,2024-03-06 02:02:41
also what war is there to be fought  hark leaders are dead and the emperor captured  are the other houses just  about the whole thing  i feel like in the next movie im not buying this being the last movie for a second they have a lot of lore to flesh out about whos the next threat,2024-03-06 02:04:51
iirc in the books he forced himself on mohiam  her and thus jessica was born ,2024-03-06 09:34:00
even swordknife fighting is very different since the finishing blow has to be delivered slowly to get through the shield  in the book paul has to be retrained to fight at full speed since personal shields arent used in worm territory,2024-03-11 23:41:33
thank you this makes sense now,2024-03-12 05:07:21
you dont know because you dont know  this was another persons experience,2024-03-02 21:01:45
got it thanks for that info i can get on board with that,2024-03-02 19:48:26
it’s not very clear because they don’t tell us that at all,2024-03-02 19:59:26

oh yeah no shade meant to austin at all and hed probably outplay bill but its just funny that feyd is right up bills alley and hes related to the guy playing the baron,2024-03-06 19:59:43
"yeah i figured it was the inevitability and the narrow path forward paul mentioned but was wondering if i was missing something else especially because at first its just like i wanna free the people of dune and nows its im going to be the emperor and take over the galaxy but i suppose that must be the only way that he saw in the future i dont really get why the people of dune are so eager to conquer other planets suddenly when it only seemed they wanted to live on their own being free

but i also had a feeling the poison might be poisoning their minds considering how much of an effect it had on his mother as well but maybe not reminded me of lovecrafts establishment that the more you know about the universe the madder you become",2024-03-07 21:48:12

" 8000 years into the future  
  
over 20k years even  
  
dune is set in 10191 ag after guild and the spacing guild was founded around a century after the end of the butlerian jihad  
  
the butlerian jihad itself lasted for a century and there were roughly 11000 years between the start of deep space exploration and the jihad  
  
if we use the pioneer 5 first interplanetary space probe thats 1960  11000  201  10191  23352 years in the future  
  
of course theres also the problem that the standard year in dune is roughly 20 hours shorter than our primitive year and we have no idea when it switched so youll have to remove a few hundred years and cant know the exact number",2024-03-06 13:26:31

" shields block bullets

they wouldnt stop arrows youd figure theyd use like automatic crossbows or something that uses bolts",2024-03-02 23:36:11
ok but why werent harkonnens also using rifles in most fights for example the big final fight they went full medieval charge in an open field and no shields in that fight despite not being in the deep desert,2024-03-02 22:07:35
fremen dont seem to ever use shields and are amazing hand to hand using guns against them makes the most sense,2024-03-02 22:38:58
ok that’s what i thought they said why did they leave her that’s why i was confused,2024-03-08 03:37:59

ho li  sand worms are the original anakin   i hate sand its course and it gets everywhere,2024-03-11 19:28:37
yeah its more of a political thriller not much action in it,2024-03-10 23:15:29
yeah i remember most of that and i can more or less understand why denis would cut it or change it but chani is diff imo i prefer how the book left you w more or less a relatively hopeful ending that despite the coming jihad paul still has chani as his tie to humanity making the status quo at the beginning of messiah and the events thereafter more of a shock  tragedy while also hammering home much more powerfully herbert’s central theme of beware powerful charismatic leaders prophecies and religious fanaticism etc etc as opposed to how the film tries to dash that flavor on right at the end making chani’s departure bold  immediate esp considering he didn’t include them having a child to strengthen their bond even more again i’m curious to see how he adapts messiah now will the film open just assuming they stayed together but chani just isn’t as ride or die as in the book lessening it’s impact or will messiah also be 2 parts with the first focusing much more on expanding and strengthening their subsequent relationship before the conspiracy initiates here’s hoping part 3 and maybe 4 end up retrospectively enriching the experience of part 2 the same way part 2 does for the first film,2024-03-15 07:38:33
"i saw the video and i disagree

when it comes to the movies part 12 i don’t think the antihero theme comes through for me 

he spent as much time as he can justify avoiding taking power the point is that paul is an instrument of fate and has no agency his choices are take power or die and let fremen die out too you can argue power over death is selfish but i see it as pragmatic

once he survives the water of life he can see every possible future and specifically chooses the path with the least amount of harm it’s the only choice he can make morally because he has no agency he’s a leader completely chosen by fate",2024-03-07 00:45:30
after his ascendancy to the throne was rejected by the great houses couldnt he basically have said oh nevermind actually to irulan then lol,2024-03-21 22:25:34
"im not saying its just about muslim i know it apply to all religion ive been there with christianity  the allegory with paul coming back to life truly hits you in the face in a cave as well surrounded by his mother and ‘mary magdalene’

im just saying since the muslim imagery is strong here… especially with the words as well upcoming jihad and even usul can means beginning  the real one  ideas in my language while lisan means it is written and gaib means out of this world  which is fitting for paul and the way they pray as well  it is just interesting to see considering the theme of the message and i did feel awkward because i know how strong faith can be in the country im from",2024-03-01 17:13:06
"well even if he was a tool he was still seen winning achieving his revenge and becoming the king and bringing the freemen what they wanted

the bloodshed is not yet seen and so in one way the prophecy did bring hope to the freemen and to paul as well despite it all being bene geseret’s will",2024-03-01 15:39:15
its obviously meant as an analogy of islam specifically the war is even referred to as a jihad in the books,2024-03-02 02:20:41
"the great houses would recognize his claim because the emperor himself has abdicated and seemingly named paul his successor im not sure how succession usually works in the dune universe but that seems fairly legitimate even more importantly they would accept his claim in order to avoid war plus paul is holding the emperor and his daughter hostage at this point great houses should know that refusing to accept his claim would result in their death

which brings me to my next point if the great houses refuse pauls claim it would suggest they view the emperor at the legitimate ruler in that case paul should immediately execute the emperor and his daughter as they would represent the greatest threats to his claim start a new dynasty with zendaya instead

but did leto move the entirety of his family and military forces from caladan to arrakis i imagine they would govern both similar to how the harkonnens were clearly still inhabiting giedi prime despite controlling arrakis for 80 years by this logic are all the harkonnen atomics also on arrakis rather than giedi prime",2024-03-07 20:32:38
"to be clear i loved the movie i just feel like dv accidentally used the alternate ending

the only part i really struggle to accept is the great houses not recognizing paul as emperor but my understanding is that in the book they do",2024-03-07 21:39:02
ooooh this is a great take ,2024-03-09 08:13:39
she says earlier that her secret name is desert spring a reference to a prophecy she is uncomfortable with  as she cries over paul we learn the prophecy is he will be resurrected by the tears of the desert spring,2024-03-08 19:10:38

um actually jessica discovered earlier when she drank the water of life,2024-03-17 01:36:59
but the harkonnens knew the fremen dont have shields so why wouldnt they use guns to obliterate them in the movie one guy with a machine gun could have taken out 100s of fremen,2024-03-21 19:17:03
in the movie we see feyd bring reinforcements because they start struggling against the the fremen they didnt think to bring any guns with them to fight the people with no access to shields,2024-03-21 19:19:06
i’ve read the trilogy 3 times so i don’t know if that’s it the critique of religion and fanaticism is definitely in there but there is so much in the first book about the nature of prescience and the power of destiny that wasn’t present in the film i don’t think paul can really be seen as a tragic figure after having channi be a foil for every moment of fate he falls into,2024-03-01 04:44:56
"i kind of agree with the guy a perfect 10 loses its meaning if youre handing it out left and right a film like this is like the perfect example of a 9 just about perfect in every way but theres just a little room for improvement

the charactersjust lacked character  i found few of them interesting enough to even remember their names  i didnt care about them or what happened to them they all acted with a similar devil may care holier than thou attitude which is fine for one or two characters but when all of them are the same it just becomes boring

also nearly 3 hours long with maybe 1 being legitimately entertaining i wasnt tired but i nearly fell asleep

whatever  like i said im happy people are enjoying themselves and i wouldnt say it was bad but seeing everyone gushing 1010s is making me wonder if im missing something  710 at best for me",2024-03-05 20:41:32

i think this is a satire post because a lot of the themes are present not directly expounded on at great length which is like ok maybe you are aware of the themes that are supposed to be here but you did no inference of them while watching the movie maybe the expectation for them was to like just have an audiobook play in a theater,2024-03-03 04:24:40

i wish we had seen more interesting species apart from the classic worm which they cant eat and the muaddib which they probably dont eat either there were talks of centipedes but they probably dont eat that either that odd black spider looking creature from the first movie was cool we needed to see more fauna and flora for sure because the movie felt really empty to me like a videogame that didnt populate its areas well enough to feel like a real world beautiful but empty,2024-03-08 20:05:41
"oh man youre soooo right how could i be so dumb

there were several reviews i read noting there was going to be or do you need me to retype what i already typed i know reddit loves their dune circlejerk though so dont let me get in the way of it the first film was significantly better",2024-03-02 21:12:13
"the point is that he’s holding it hostage

except that for some bizarre reason the great houses dont accept him and so the fremen immediately load themselves into transports for the holy war

thats not keeping the same idea  thats changing everything  paul gains control of the spice and thus gains control of the universe  except in this movie where it seemingly forces the emperor to surrender but no one else",2024-03-06 18:49:23
yeah he’s on some kind of mission to convince everyone to hate the movie,2024-03-06 22:13:26
"i definitely can feel the intention of some deep backstory with the many dialogue i just honestly got so bored by most of the movie 

 they kept harping on paul being the chosen one as it is written needing to drink the water i was desperate for him to drink the water so the movie can just move on",2024-03-10 00:00:16
"i think i probably should have noted that i didnt watch the first movie haha 

i was trying to pick up the pieces and piece them together even if its a manufactured religion they still have traits that are  beyond humanly capable that would make them like a  to be able to resist the poison have all the thoughts and voices of the ancestors to silence ppl into doing what they want and of course see the future
it became predictable the power clearly shown in the favour of the reverend mother and paul the only thing i was questioning most in the end is if paul would use this power to continue to save the ppl he formed an alliance with or his bloodline 

it felt like the last season of game of thrones where it was obvious that power was in favour of daenerys cos of her dragons and her rightful heir to the throne  i enjoyed the first few seasons with character build up showing each kingdom culture and customs conflicts with twists that shake the power dynamic i also found it can get old and over repetitive but definitely not as bad as this movie",2024-03-09 23:36:34
okay a simple “wrong” would’ve done just fine,2024-03-04 06:31:51
i would expect the fans of this to have no original thoughts because the film doesn’t either,2024-03-04 11:52:15
almost every scene in the desert was poorly edited either too quickly or blatantly violating the 180 degree rule any sense of creativity is only in the austin butler scenes both visually and with set design  production design the framing and blocking was completely nonexistent or misplaced it didn’t look like a film it looked like a commercial i was waiting for timothee chalamet to pull out some lip balm in the middle of those desert scenes major problem with all of these big budget films is that the visual effects either look unfinished or not in focus almost they look low res and it is distracting from the rest of the film also this shallow focus trend in digital filmmaking is getting to be excruciating using focus used to mean something in filmmaking,2024-03-04 17:25:39
vp of usa christian bale character,2024-03-02 03:01:05
all the books if you read them you would know chani was a very minimal character,2024-03-04 04:35:38
i mean actually he is but its like a deconstructed version,2024-03-04 04:58:54
"definition of a heroes journey like lawrence of arabia and empire strikes back are heroes journeys… they got those movies right i mean denis did get this movie right until the very ending to have a closing shot of chani for whatever reason

and yes i’ve read all the dune books",2024-03-04 04:34:27
i dont readwatch reviews i prefer to judge for myself i really wanted to know what all the fuss was about but it seems like one of those reddit circle jerks to be honest,2024-03-05 16:30:46
yep  like straight on the closeup  thats not chalamet  everything about it is just off  face itself is larger eyes are further apart nose is different  thats not him,2024-03-09 07:42:06
not even comparable to how many times i saw oppenheimer,2024-03-09 23:52:49
did i stutter,2024-03-01 16:16:35
as in they are encyclopedia more than novels,2024-03-09 05:54:21
that’s what i’m best at ,2024-04-02 14:11:38
interesting about the pores thank you i still think the act just looks kinda dumb and takes me out of the movie lol,2024-03-03 15:19:15
laughable just laughable,2024-03-04 04:53:05
that’s what my friends theory is part of the holy war jessica mentioned,2024-03-01 15:08:03
thanks i forgot about the shield attracting worms still a weird decision considering they were getting picked off like nothing p beside they were on a cliff relatively safe from worms,2024-03-02 00:46:15
what was his part,2024-03-02 17:28:36
when was that said during the box scene,2024-03-02 20:10:46
"im kind of biased because i read the books but 

star wars kind of feels like its a bigger universe with missing stories but thats just very concise worldbuilding you actually get everything you need to understand the plot everything that was later filled in didnt need to be for the existing story to work

dune does feel like it suffers from how concise it has to be",2024-03-02 22:03:03
considering what goes on later  i cant say theyre wrong to be worried,2024-03-02 21:58:35
"oh right i remember it now
but the voice wasn’t in the sardukar language right",2024-03-02 22:40:47
ahhh that would make more sense he was saying duke leto was too idealistic  and would match up with what paul said about fighting like harkonnens by being brutal and not caring about honor thanks,2024-03-03 15:48:08
that is not what he said,2024-03-14 01:30:47
"i think he went a separate way when they were on the worms you can see him turning left with chani looking at him a bit confusedworried 
so my guess would be that chani went with the others to a safe place while paul went straight to the temple

as for where they got the helicopter i didnt think too much about it they probably got it after killing harkonnens or they stole it",2024-03-02 23:55:53
the ornithopter is possibly one they captured from one of their victories,2024-03-03 06:29:27
im dumb so take it that way but i was phasing in and out of knowing who was what in the large scale scenes in the last 5th of the film quite a bit,2024-03-04 05:39:00
might be one of the best i’ve ever heard,2024-03-04 05:49:30
i was surprised that houses didnt acknowledge him as the new emperor,2024-03-03 14:04:01
is he true evil i got the impression that he wanted to stay far away from this path as possible but realized it was the only way to get them free it feels almost tragic because he knows this will cause many deaths,2024-03-11 01:56:05
oh yea how did you personally relate to him are you anakin,2024-03-17 22:10:15
its exactly the first thing that popped to mind when i saw that scene ,2024-03-18 00:07:03
so uncivilized why dont they initiate an actual duel,2024-03-21 07:38:11
it is not a lie when it ended up playing out exactly as foretold a self fulfilling prophecy is still a prophecy ,2024-03-03 03:13:37
the first movie made it pretty clear what they did im pretty sure they even explicitly say theyre the string pullers and have been sowing the seeds of this prophecy for centuries on arrakis,2024-03-04 23:32:49
it does a very good job asking whether its a lie if manipulation means the prophecy is wrong,2024-03-11 22:44:30
like every single religion in existence,2024-03-20 20:44:02
its not a lie its more nefarious than that the reason she becomes even more cold and calculating and the reason paul becomes more cold and calculating after drinking the water of life is because it allows them to see past and future clearly they are fully aware of what has happened and what will happen sort of they can see a possibilities of the future and therefor can try to do things in a way to get the future they want it seems to be not exact the prophesy is real because the bene ges of the past saw the possible futures and implanted plans to create the prophesy and foretell things they knew would happen then they spent the years carefully making those things happen and setting up multiple messiah possbilities because they didnt know for sure who the messiah would be that would make their prophesies that they created come true paul and jessica know this after drinking they know how nefarious it is and they know its all a calculation to get a specific future they see it as a necessary evil because the other futures are worse so paul plays into his role as does jessica the thing is there are multiple paths that could have come out of the prophesy and the other bene ges wanted one of the ones where they had more control over the messiah figure so they had all the power jessica had a son and prepared him and the fremen for making paul the messiah so she and paul would hold the power,2024-03-28 21:35:06
the prophecy wasn’t a lie just their plan all along nothing divine about it but the unforseen consequences cant wait to see it play out on the big screen,2024-03-31 16:38:13
can you explain this a bit further might have lost it in the movie,2024-03-24 21:50:13
i read the books and still had no  idea whats going on plans within plans,2024-04-08 12:10:25
as someone who didnt read the books or much of the lore it kinda helped confirm this prophecy may not all be positive as they try to make it seem like most prophecies in movies end up being the hero saves the world etc but it made me rethink the intentions for sure as intended which allowed me to better understand the actions of the main players,2024-03-20 09:54:27
i can fix her,2024-03-03 05:54:45
does using the voice count as spittin’ hot fyre,2024-03-07 02:25:15
,2024-03-28 04:18:51
they are not the bad guys either it is the tides of power and what effect those have situation was a loaded gun that would eventually go off  paul just chose to do it his way at that moment,2024-03-07 23:15:30
"somewhat hard to not understand that but maybe it was even slightly too heavy handed 

it’s a bit less clear in the book and it sort of slowly arises out of the context and then in messiah it sort of makes you reevaluate what you read before and to me it was part of what i loved about reading it probably more than the first book 

i think when you expressly end the 2nd film saying ‘these guys are bad’ and then everyone on social media goes ‘all you guys celebrating paul are missing the point’ are lowkey ruining part of what makes messiah great and the retroactive effect it has on dune  also maybe that they’re not necessarily bad just morally complex or bad but not for why we think etc etc

idk maybe for me but that might just be because i was quite young when i read the first dune so maybe didn’t pick up on the nuance as i would have had i read it later on so messiah was more interesting therefore",2024-03-04 18:14:17
she went off the rails much more in the movie in the book she was a little less central in the movie she was more propulsive almost like a lady macbeth figure,2024-03-09 00:16:06
for sure,2024-03-25 04:00:10
i literally thought this was bill skarsgard  its austen butler,2024-03-06 01:05:10
he was perfect too bad he died and won’t be in dune messiah ,2024-03-10 12:23:59
butler was amazing but he didnt really bring the comedy like sting did,2024-03-14 15:37:22
i could not believe it was the same actor from masters of the air  that guy has range  i initially thought it was bill skaarsgard,2024-04-07 20:31:36
its in line with his portrayal in the book probably toned down a bit if anything some of the lines in the book regarding this aged poorly lol,2024-03-09 14:21:32
i dont think it looked nearly that over the top,2024-03-04 21:43:37
dont kink shame,2024-03-05 12:47:06
thats rr martin for ya dont look up how many aegons there are,2024-03-03 17:22:21
ive never heard of someone lmaoing at anagrams ,2024-03-03 23:23:41
he must have studied the masters,2024-03-14 16:02:55
stilgar ahh he fainted thats exactly what the prophet would do,2024-03-17 05:52:55
drum sand was a thing in the book very dangerous on a planet with giant worms that are attracted to noise,2024-03-09 07:41:10
deck chani,2024-03-21 07:41:16
abomination their use of the voice was great,2024-03-09 09:43:22
using the voice in that moment would have defeated the weight of the emperors decision he wanted the emperor to kneel on his own accord not by his voice,2024-03-11 15:53:10
i really like imax sound but i hate it when they imo exaggerate it the chani slap was also really  loud,2024-03-10 01:20:02
it was a bit tooo noisy in imax sometimes almost painful ,2024-03-10 12:46:24
i saw it first in imax then regular amc theater then imax again,2024-03-10 19:38:57
you thought he would use the voice as well to make the emperor kiss but it was a demand not forced fantastic,2024-03-09 10:49:25
this is what i used to do with my bike for some reason when i first learned how to ride it…i would stand on one side of it and then jump off when i was done hit somebody’s car in the apartment complex one time all that to say i could probably ride a worm,2024-03-03 03:56:49
lady jessica im going to untie the basket now,2024-03-20 07:07:35
imagining lady jessica just rolling in the sand in her worm cart,2024-03-20 15:46:48
wasted,2024-03-21 07:44:48
"this is the correct answer in the book fremen will describe the distance of a trip like “it is a 20 worm journey”

meaning you have to ride a worm until it’s so exhausted it quits and then do the same with 19 more worms",2024-03-07 11:48:38
yeah for sure but i kept thinking about it when jessica was in the carriage thing how did they get on there too,2024-03-03 16:04:26
well put  what are your thoughts on these supersonic worms in this movie this is not how i pictured worm travel when i was a kid reading these books over and over,2024-03-14 16:07:54
i wouldnt mind a longer directors cut i would enjoy an extra half hour,2024-04-08 12:59:04
yeah specially when they had jessica and that whole crew of people on it,2024-03-03 16:03:41
"its actually something i noticed in house of the dragon that also applies to dune 2 they never showed anybody dismounting from a dragon probably because it might look awkward and cost more for the cgi 

easier to just suddenly show them off of it",2024-03-06 02:30:41
i watched this movie in imax… i should have been fully engaged in the experience… this kept gnawing at me lol,2024-03-11 23:51:33
yeah you shouldnt think too much about that lol,2024-04-07 15:47:18
agreed she needed more screen time and so did anya blink and you missed her,2024-03-06 03:49:30
check her out in blue is the warmest color’  ya wanna talk seduction,2024-03-16 02:15:47
looked like a curtain made from the parts bin at the chainsaw factory,2024-03-04 06:32:10
wait how did you miss the more obvious pun of everything she seyoudoux,2024-03-05 15:35:34
rangryupvote,2024-03-04 20:24:21
this got me really good i love it,2024-03-04 15:12:12
have i got some news for you about the french dispatch,2024-03-05 14:17:27
shes fragile but not that fragile,2024-03-09 17:53:17
same but i also saw her recently in the lobster playing basically the same character it was a relief to see her do something different in this one,2024-03-17 12:33:44
that was my most watched movie on netflix i think why’d they remove it,2024-03-15 15:17:26
go to arakis have a nice cold pint and wait for this whole jihad to blow over,2024-03-02 06:18:50
 right she made amy march likeable,2024-03-05 02:54:00
 meryl streep died,2024-03-04 15:10:01
i haven’t seen enough to determine that from her what else can you recommend of hers midsommar was amazing,2024-03-04 10:39:30
"i mean it wasnt a demanding role ill give you that

she does bring a certain presence to it though

i absolutely love her performances shes super versatile",2024-03-04 10:24:02
the ornithopter scenes were on another level soundwise,2024-03-03 23:16:42
as i get older i appreciate the sound experience i can get from a theater more than the visual experience  even the 30ft screen i saw this on really didnt take up any more of my vision or look sharper than if i was sitting at the proper distance from a 80 4k tv but the soundscape felt like something that would take 10k to even remotely approximate at home,2024-03-10 22:02:12
there were like a dozen or so times where the sound just overwhelmingly pulled you in,2024-03-16 04:13:44
just got out of a dolby showing myself and came here to say exactly this i can see this being a heavy contender for best visual effects and sound design at next years oscars,2024-03-04 00:23:09
"black and chrome

haha sorry for being pedantic but i like the distinction george miller made the whites are a little shinier and such but i dont remember the exact details",2024-03-09 17:55:11
just got back from an imax showing it definitely ranks up there the sound shook my bones it was  awesome,2024-03-04 01:03:38
furiosa probably gonna clear,2024-03-05 07:22:36
the sandworm was real,2024-03-04 20:23:42
i hope so since shes carrying the only harkonnen child now,2024-03-09 18:00:58
i mean have you seen that one time her onscreen boyfriend ended up drugged and sewn within a bear or her married life to harry styles in another movie weird relationships are kind of her brand now,2024-03-07 08:04:00
i didnt watch dune part 2 to see florence pugh in chainmail but like the sound design it greatly enhanced the viewing experience,2024-03-05 22:54:07
ironically it really reminded me of the joan of arc costume zendaya wore to the met gala,2024-03-10 05:35:43
is it duty free,2024-03-05 03:46:42
feyd was just calmly observing everything transpiring around him as if he was contemplating what side he wants to take,2024-03-03 18:21:29
"  austin butler was perfect in every scene


he certainly nailed the accent whivh i presume was an immitation of how stellan skarsgard talks",2024-03-03 07:42:21
austins face when paul kills the baron is epic impressedpleased and possibly a little aroused he looked like he was gaging for it i thought he played psychotic  perfectly i wish there was a bit more screen time with him he was the most memorable in every scene he was in and well if we were to get a house harkonnen mini series in the future i wouldnt be mad at it,2024-03-03 18:53:04
"baron harkonnen gasping crawling up to a thrown his  will never sit on

feyd  casuals",2024-03-03 04:38:48
austin butler was perfect as feyd the final fight was literally exactly how i pictured it reading the books,2024-03-04 11:28:11
also love that the sardaukar walk into the dust and just immediately disappear without so much as a fuss,2024-03-11 00:20:25
"that was austin butler


i thought it was one of the skarsgaards 


ok that was an impressive performance after underwhelming in masters of the air ",2024-03-08 11:49:08
agree  i would not have minded more austin butler screen time,2024-03-07 00:14:13
i really liked everything about feyds portrayal except the voice tbh lol,2024-03-03 01:45:39
" austin butler

holy  thats him i just watched masters of air and i didnt recognize him at all i was 100 sure it was bill skarsgård",2024-04-08 13:05:57
although im a little sad we didnt get to see the mini abomination i agree that this was the right way to do it onscreen,2024-03-03 05:50:50
he barely rates in the books to be fair,2024-03-03 07:38:08
"never watch trailers they only ever make your movie experience worse

usually directors writers etc have little to no input in trailers trailer authors can   up",2024-03-04 09:30:43
yeah he was really underwhelming ,2024-03-05 00:51:26
"but by the end the fervor is totally our of control

lead them to paradise",2024-03-05 11:03:13
as is written ,2024-03-16 06:09:15
"i was legitimately saddened by the ending because paul initially appears as this curious yet lost boy who tries to find his purpose and way in life while desperately avoiding bloodshed and by the end of this hes commanding his army of religious warriors to fight against the other houses and nuke them if necessary its such a  downer ending to see him so consumed by vengeance and his acceptance of his role as messiah to the point that he wont accept anyone challenging his new title as emperor

its a great ending and showcases the horrifying consequences of religious extremism blind faith and hero worship but man i was just kind of silent and depressed after finishing it",2024-03-18 01:56:24
im surprised to see so many people taking stilgars devotion as comedic i thought it was pretty serious and showed how much power the prophesy has over them stilgar was badass nononsense warrior in movie 1 and by the end of 2 he was bowing and praying to paul,2024-04-08 13:18:57
as someone who is 13rd of the way through the third book it kinda seems like it sets up for later to have alia do it,2024-03-05 02:56:07
why would paul show mercy to the emperor but none to the baron,2024-03-07 06:02:44
im glad the battle in the film was over quickly it was that quick in the books too because it isnt really a battle when you have giant sandworms on your side and your leader is literally someone who can see the future and already knows the outcome of it so it was more like a slaughter,2024-03-10 01:06:05
he did he didn’t slit his throat,2024-03-15 03:13:38
oh yeah those elite commandoes idk  them or something,2024-03-03 07:41:44
you killed my father  prepare to die,2024-03-07 03:59:13
" remember me

it was their first time meeting though",2024-03-04 08:15:28
"her not being included made sense with the side effect of pauls entire rise being reduced to 9 months as opposed to a few years in the book 

i also liked chenais role as seeing through the religious manipulation of her people in the book she just goes along with it iirc   


also no spice  boo",2024-03-04 01:56:27
yeah i was super worried about how they were gonna handle it and they did it perfect which is just leave all that crazy  for the third movie,2024-03-03 04:33:56
anya taylorjoy threw me for a loop when she appeared in the dream sequence id forgotten she appeared on the press junkett and im glad for it,2024-03-04 03:42:45
i liked that he didnt have baby leto with chani either and chani splits from him in the end instead of being a side piece in name only,2024-03-04 01:53:25
this is dune weird is good,2024-03-04 00:23:04
maybe windex ,2024-03-02 14:22:24
i actually had bought a gatorade for myself at the theater before the movie started  i got the blue without realizing lol  i ended up taking a swig everytime they showed the water of life lol  powerade blue would be closer in hue tho,2024-03-03 09:52:12
pauls twoyear old sister alia the fetus in the film kills him,2024-03-02 17:33:21
feyd rautha wasnt even three seconds dead when stilgar pulled up with that chant truly the most devoted hype man,2024-03-04 03:45:15
someone needs to make a cut of the movie with a lot more lisan al ghaibs thrown in after every other scene,2024-03-04 21:25:13
yeah the brothers agamemnon and menelaus were called atreides because of their father,2024-03-22 21:24:51
i didnt see a smile i saw a groveling despot in utter shock at his death pauls survival and the revelation that hes his blood,2024-03-04 17:54:51
“and people told me sleeping around was a bad idea”,2024-03-05 14:43:26
speaking of he pulled the “pound your own chest to vibe” move that jamis did during their duel it reinforces how jamis and him are best friends in another timeline and the impact of that on paul,2024-03-05 14:40:00
very cool i also liked the shot of the baron laying in the sand covered in ants paul had very little respect for his grandpa lol,2024-03-06 04:09:12

"fr javier is actually so funny in this film lmaoo

hes so humble as written",2024-03-02 08:23:16

last movie was a totally different context since we saw him only interacting with outsiders he is like the rest of the fremen very suspicious of outsiders but very devoted once he accepts you,2024-03-06 06:39:36
so you dont understand the power of faith changing how people act,2024-03-07 07:52:03
it felt exactly like that scene in life of brian where hes trying to get everyone to leave him alone and its fantastic,2024-03-03 21:17:14
bilal kaifa,2024-03-05 22:20:16
its not just comic relief though its also a good example of the kind of fanaticism paul fears for most of the movie which ties in well with the overall plot,2024-03-14 18:44:44
you say that like it’s a bad thing lol you need some levity in a movie to make the dramatic stuff hit harder it’s why people are connecting with this movie more than the first one,2024-03-07 04:02:34
ga,2024-03-18 12:56:18
you have to reread the books ,2024-03-03 03:20:07
nah he was in messiah and seemed a lot less comfortable about paul there,2024-03-03 02:54:46
what are the biggest things that have been changed and did they affectalter the overall story,2024-03-04 17:58:20
yeah i was very surprised tbh im still in the middle of book 2 so i dont know the implications of these changes but maaan so many differences,2024-03-11 04:11:10
not to mention they literally brainwashed an entire planet several hundred years in advance in preparation for this exact moment so they would see him as a messiah,2024-03-05 16:00:20
no stilgar should be a wise fremen who acts in the best interest of his people teaching paul to do the same making stilgar a onedimensional zealot from the beginning completely removes his character arc in the books it is a large moment when paul realizes that he’s changed stilgar irrevocably weakening him this comes after a decade long jihad a gradual loosening of the old ways to accept the new and thats not who stilgar was stilgar acts as a representation of the planet as a whole,2024-03-01 19:03:52
yeah feyds characterization was great in this movie he genuinely had a sense of honor to him despite being a complete nutcase paul was offering an honorable duel and feyd wanted to match him and play by pauls rules ,2024-03-03 06:51:43
totally agree it was a respectful copy,2024-03-03 14:42:13
yes his little smile when he delivers it is  perfect,2024-03-04 14:07:48
that’s how i took it too he was actually impressed and said it out of respect,2024-03-08 20:03:25
he emphasised thy very clearly though,2024-03-19 06:23:42
"this as someone who fences you’d be surprised how quickly you tire out i spar for 2 hours regularly but it’s about 5 minutes of a bout then 5 minutes off the  i’m in great shape but if i tried to spar for 30 minutes non stop i’d be completely spent

thats why anytime i see a battle scene like in braveheart or the battle of the bastards in game of thrones where it’s at least 23 hours of unrelenting sword fighting i’m like ‘that’s great and all for a movie but there’s no  way that works in real life without at least a 5 minute water break and a bite of a power bar",2024-03-13 20:06:55
"a few days late here but if you haven’t seen the king on netflix also with chalamet in a leading role they do the whole realistic fatigue from melee combat really well

couple minutes fighting in full plate armor and these guys are straight up huffing for oxygen",2024-03-17 03:03:51
and paul got tired first because he just fought through an army to get there,2024-03-23 01:44:07
that triple horizontal twirl was  awesome,2024-03-03 05:21:10
you right the 1 second thing totally ruined the entire fight,2024-03-03 05:35:00
thank you for pointing this out so dumb,2024-03-21 13:44:39
that’s the significant of the feydpaul fight  who ever wins gets the throne  the difference is that paul has become the kh by the time of the fight,2024-04-01 03:25:09
dune is pretty clunky all the way through,2024-03-04 11:36:44
joe abercrombie pulls it off nicely give his stuff a go if you havent,2024-03-06 13:54:24
id rather buy a big oled tv better contrast and brightness more expensive tho,2024-03-14 23:34:24
wish they would do that but the previous one didn’t say what you want about zack snyder’s justice league but i thought the aspect and framing was one of the more enjoyable aspects pun intended,2024-03-05 21:23:28
isnt it exactly what the old lady told her would have to happen a few scenes before,2024-03-03 16:34:15
"“be honest is he good in bed”


“i ain’t telling you  girl”",2024-03-05 18:41:57
not having read the books this was something i was already thinking about chani is  at him the emperor wails at him the nuns call him an abomination his mother hesitates for a moment when he goes up to the fremen and screams at them and none seem to understand that he can now literally see everything it has to be both a blessing and a curse he can probably even see his own death and his line to chani that hed love her untill the day he dies is less a platitude and more a simple fact the moment he drank the poison he became an outcast surrounded only by zealots enemies and the need to secure the safety of his loved ones no one to confide in or understand what he sees or thinks if there was anyone that did understand his position it was his unborn sister,2024-03-02 15:53:05
this movie brought home to me how much of pauls conundrum is sort of a giant trolley problem because he probably could also have chosen simply not to be the mahdi to settle down as a fremen with chani maybe even keep fighting the harkonnen but not set himself up as a leader and that might have been worse for the galaxy in a way but the death wouldnt be directly on his hands and definitely not in his name but he makes the choice to go south and pursue revenge and power,2024-03-04 00:44:41
i was confused by the ending to be honest because it sure felt like the marriage plan and just about everything else was pointless because all of the other houses refused to acknowledge him and began attacking anyway did i miss something ,2024-03-05 05:19:28
the way i understood it is that it was a slim path but also a thorny path,2024-03-03 17:20:55
"i dont know the books but both movies told me that paul kinda has something going like a bootleg version of the timestone

he sees visions of the future that are probably most realistically happening but it changes with each decision he makes finally when he did drink the blue water he was able to use those visions properly he is now in the endgame it will still be cruel same for dr strange people will lose their life a lot of other people will be hurt and damaged even if the best case happens",2024-03-04 09:59:54
then he gives it all up in the end anyway and abandons the path,2024-03-05 11:04:47
all i can think about here is when morty had the crystal that told him the path to jessica ,2024-04-05 05:59:35
it reminded me of game of thrones a bit  ,2024-03-04 04:55:25
i havent read the books but chani gets pregnant a couple of times right how are they supposed to continue on with that next movie seeing as she seems like doesnt want to be around him currently you think shell go back to paul just like that,2024-03-28 04:19:43
ive read a few comments like this and i do think shes upset by it  but i think shes much more upset and horrified by the holy war path he is choosing to go on using her people to fight it  its more of a betrayal than wedding another woman,2024-03-03 14:25:43
chani being a person with her own thoughts and feelings about paul and the prophecies and the jihad is a good thing i look forward to seeing how they reconcile,2024-03-03 04:05:18
youre a joke lol,2024-03-18 11:39:55
dune messiah opens with chani eating a family sized bag of starbursts and watching the bbcs pride and prejudice for the seventh time until she falls asleep,2024-03-02 19:46:56
"i didnt think it was funny i thought it was very sad chani is shown from the beginning to be proud of her people and her culture she was one of the people that said the one to free the fremen should be the fremen


her people and her culture are being used as tools by an outsider who she trusted and loved paul went from wanting to be like the fremen to basically becoming a coloniser who stepped in and took over everything and made it his


theyre not even just fremen anymore theyre fremenatreidis look at the flags they carry


her tears are for more than just paul",2024-03-07 11:47:06
she shouldnt waste her water on him,2024-03-03 08:40:38
"not going to lie the last scene in the film being that was a little disappointing i already understood that she left and for a film and story that was clearly so paul centric i would have preferred they ended it with a shot of him and his family

just a small nitpick though  fantastic movie",2024-03-03 08:55:05
it’s sad as well cause like who is she going back to where is she even going,2024-03-07 11:11:08
me too i just thought she got mad she got cheated on and now shes waiting on her uber to get home xd,2024-03-22 00:40:10
paul does foresee her chilling out over it,2024-03-03 15:11:30
i didnt interpret it as chani being mostly upset about paul wanting to marry irulan but that chani didnt like the general way events were unfolding chani was already skeptical of paul being the messiah but now he was also claiming lordship over the entire galaxy,2024-03-06 01:00:39
i think she can understand why but still be upset over it thats just human we are not purely logical creatures at least besides mentats,2024-03-15 18:11:59
i wasnt saying anything about the fremen generally just chanis love for paul as portrayed in the book vs the movie,2024-03-02 18:51:31
i feel like any sense of betrayal she has stems from paul actually choosing to become the messiah and leading her people into war not the marriage stuff with the emperors daughter,2024-03-10 09:20:21
thats correct  i dont think its even implied if i recall its basically outright stated in irulans internal monologue that paul never touches her  its basically an open secret to the court too that chanis his real wife,2024-03-03 15:06:27
and also that paul never had  with her and promised that he would never and he also 100 dedicated himself to chani  such a ridiculous plotline to make her go against him when in reality she was probably the only person truly who wanted the best for him the whole time and didnt see him as a messiah or as a  but as a loving partner,2024-03-09 03:44:23
yeah he didnt lie to chani but he recognized the politics of the situation,2024-03-03 02:17:41
i feel like it was quite clear that this was exactly what paul was doing  he was reassuring her that regardless of what was about to happen that she was the one he loved,2024-03-06 01:04:21
considering that paul can see into everything everywhere all at once it feels less of an apology and more of a statement of fact that he does love her till his last breath,2024-03-03 06:06:20
until i saw in the comments that feyd was one of those people who could obscureconfuse future visions i didn’t know why paul who’s basically nicolas cage from next now was losing to him and legit thought he made sure to get stabbed twice right next to chani so she has to feel sorry for him to compensate for the  he just pulled,2024-03-05 18:55:46
"ehhh i personally feel like that would be too heavy handed and starts to get into rules explaining dialogue you sometimes need it for books but it can be way more subtle in a visual medium

like just watching the movie i wasnt confused on what paul really wants he clearly still loves chani but he has to marry irulan for political reasons and to survive",2024-03-03 07:48:26
this is my only problem with the movie i want so desperately to hold the book up to zendaya and be like no its ok see,2024-03-04 18:07:30
for sure still appalled though,2024-03-16 06:40:14
agreed i was a bit confused by how the holy war is going so intensely by the start of messiah in the book,2024-03-03 13:20:37
hardly chani and paul have children  what a surprise,2024-03-03 13:28:33
dang i kinda feel spoiled now nearest 70mm screen is 15 minutes away the picture takes up your whole field of view if you sit in the 4th5th rows and you can feel the bass in your chest can almost smell spice in the air,2024-03-02 03:26:51
it’s because there are only a handful of guys able to operate those imax film projectors i know one of them and at the moment he is basically nonstop at the local amc running dune,2024-03-03 19:25:31
" 70mm screens 

 thats like 7cm are you watching it on your apple watch or something

easy joke to make i am not an absolute imbecile forgive me",2024-03-03 03:55:02
"i mean it was shot digitally unlike oppenheimer so 70mm projection would be a bit of a waste vs laser projection 

but if the only option was traditional 2k digital imax screens then yeah that’s rough",2024-03-03 14:40:43
hello from langley,2024-03-05 07:55:46
"what country

i hope you get to see it on the biggest screen some day",2024-03-04 14:58:27
saw it on 70mm imax 1010 would recommend,2024-03-11 04:50:24
hello fellow perthian,2024-04-09 13:43:37
the thumpers holy ,2024-03-02 18:33:21
for real this movie really made me realize just how good imax is especially after rewatching the first dune on my tv lol i couldnt believe how pathetic it was compared to my memory of seeing it in imax and i have a pretty nice tv its mostly the audio that you cant quite match or in my case even get close to because no surround and neighbours,2024-03-05 08:54:06
can feel the voice in your soul,2024-03-28 17:54:52
100 i used to always pick imax but dolby is def the way to go holy  what an experience my gf and i cant wait to see it again,2024-03-04 00:09:23
dolby atmos over liemax any day of the week screen size is not the big with liemax anyways,2024-03-04 01:48:25
just saw it in dolby and it was incredible there were several moments where i had to catch my breath,2024-03-04 03:02:06
yeah alamo wasn’t the move but the way i saw it as well seeing it again in imaxdolby this week,2024-03-04 06:43:11
saw mine in atmos and the worm riding scene alone was more than worth the price of admission i knew i had chosen wisely,2024-03-03 00:01:48
i cant rave enough about dolby atmos and i hope it becomes more widely available as time passes because i hardly see people mention it and it seems like the definitive way to see blockbusters the picture and sound systems are just unbelievable,2024-03-03 07:41:30
this is absolutely true dolby laser projected with atmos sound is way better than imax imo crystal clear still immersive as  and the sound rocks you to the core,2024-03-03 23:15:11
the sound and the vibrating seats ive never been so immersed in a movie,2024-03-03 06:19:41
yup the “liemax” sound system is atrocious not like real imax saw this in atmos and  loved it,2024-03-04 01:45:29
as long as its good sound quality and loud i dont think i understand what dolby atmos offers more than a theater without it i mean if you didnt tell me if it was dolby atmos or not and i had to guess afterwards i wouldnt know what it was i honestly may go watch the movie again without dolby atmos this time and try to notice the difference i guess its the only way i wil find out does anyone else feel the same or is it just me,2024-03-07 03:15:06
did you see intersteallar in imax if so would you say it tops that im excited to see it tomorrow and its been a minute since ive seen a movie in imax that rocked my socks off,2024-03-06 22:44:40
san francisco because i agree,2024-03-03 00:40:28
you can always see it again,2024-03-03 06:12:47
the one where i live only has stadium seats imax with the recliners would be perfect,2024-03-20 20:18:58
i hope they do a rescreening before dune messiah like they did with the first movie before this rewatching dune a couple of weeks ago made me love it even more,2024-03-01 14:46:37
"br 2049 is my favorite movie i saw it twice in theaters and havent seen it since i know it wont feel the same at home recently i went from  to a 75 tv and im planning on getting a better sound system i think ill rewatch it after that

on another note i saw the first dune on hbo at home and felt very meh about it i watched it in parts over two days and that might have been part of the problem id give the first a 710 and part two a 910 or 1010 it felt amazing to see part two in theater very close to how i felt watching blade runner",2024-03-03 02:43:00
yeah sadly home releases very rarely use the imax ratio which is dumb because it would fill up the tv more making it immersive,2024-03-03 07:35:42
respect  ,2024-03-03 00:41:04
i walked out and went and saw it again straight away was absolutely mind blowingly good,2024-03-07 05:25:54
barbie lol,2024-03-09 17:35:47
perspective,2024-03-19 05:17:28
i’m the same dune 2 blows the first out of the water we get deeper looks into everything the first only hinted at dune 1 really feels like a set up or a “prophecy” wink wink i’m just glad dune 2 fulfilled it so well,2024-03-27 07:36:07
it gets extremely ridiculous after messiah which is probably why denis is ending it with that,2024-03-05 00:54:20
you’re bugging bro 14 are amazing,2024-03-05 04:57:43
sorry no  emperor 4 is the best book and changes everything about the first three ahaha,2024-03-07 14:20:26
i personally enjoyed children of dune way more than messiah,2024-03-14 02:14:59
ive heard similar things from those who actually read the books a lot of them say that messiah onwards is just off probably because everyone iswas so invested in pauls success and then to read and learn that it was all for nothing in messiah  onwards,2024-03-21 03:59:10
book 4 was legitimately incredible imo it’s just much more a slow burn and in a somewhat different direction,2024-03-29 22:03:20
so tired of seeing this warning everywhere just let people discover it for themselves for all you know they would have loved it now they may never even read it because their perception has been coloured before they could even start,2024-04-07 19:31:12
"without spoiling too much of the book the biggest was a rework to the timeline

the movie takes place over the course of about half a year going by jessicas pregnancy where the book takes 2 years including a time jump in that time jump alia is born and paul and chani have a child because of the time rework many of the story beats in the movie happen in a different sequence to the book but i think it works

pauls child provides a motivation for some of the things he does later in the book alia being a reverend mothers  mind in a childs body plays a prominent role in the last battle 

there are several other key characters and even entire factions from the book missing in the movie the largest faction being the spacing guild that uses spice to navigate interplanetary travel in the empirethe guild controls all commerce and movement and even the emperor cant move troops unless the guild allows it spice is basically galactic oil when paul threatens to destroy the spice hes threatening to destroy any and all galactic trade and travel i imagine well be introduced to the guild in messiah where theyre more integral to the story

other than that many of the cut characters were involved in more of the game of thrones political side of dune with a lot of the plots within plots within plots being streamlined or removed",2024-03-07 05:07:28
"personally the first movie had bigger changes like the whole traitor plot being reduced in this movie a lot of feydrautha got cut or reduced like you meet him very early in the book but he isnt in the first movie at all and get more scenes with him in both halves of the book thufir got reduced in the first movie and cut from the second entirely  things were a bit out of order too 

that being said this adaptation was really good because it was concise you see everything you need to see to get the story",2024-03-09 14:46:27
"chani   

in the book she little more than a cardboard cut out of a perfect wife  indeed the final show down in the book is after the emperor’s sardaukar have killed chani and paul ‘s son  

in the movie they move a lot of paul’s internal ethical debates concerning the fanatics at his disposable over to the out loud debates with chani   it allows the debate to be voiced but still with the characters motivations",2024-04-01 04:05:27
"yeah the book really eloquently lays out the thought process its entirely a read on his opponents character 

im only thru book 3 but thats a pretty common theme one of the reasons why they are timeless",2024-03-01 18:59:41
which is exactly how paul and zendaya take out the attack helicopter shoot it when it’s attacking,2024-03-03 07:35:33
well i think theres multiple angles for that he also keeps looking at chani he knows if he gets closer to death  bring more emotions out of her he still does love her and needs her to really cherish his existence not going to spoil but she still has a part to play as he kept saying its a very finite path he has to walk to make everything plays out the way for the ultimate goal,2024-03-01 22:57:01
"in the book paul notes that feydrautha is too confident and proud about small victories or somethingl like this so it fits pretty well

on another note is there a continuation error i saw paul getting stabbed on his left side abdomen but when he pulls it out later its higher close to shoulder on his right side i saw it twice and noticed the same thing",2024-03-01 18:59:06
i will bend like a reed in the wind,2024-03-02 23:27:42
just like when they rocket launcher’d the helicopter the only way to hit it is when it’s shooting ,2024-03-06 07:50:04
well its less understanding and more foreseeing paul at this point has nearly completely sight into the past and the future so he foresees all the ways the battle can turn out and picks the best option we actually literally see the dagger in his side in a brief vision after he drinks the water of life to illustrate this,2024-03-04 05:15:10
 that’s so clever and the movie doesn’t make that clear at all,2024-03-08 21:07:23
after paul wakes from the water of life it would have been amazing if he caught chanis hand from slapping him,2024-03-02 07:08:21
does the wound  paul,2024-03-04 06:10:26
mortal you sure about that,2024-03-06 10:26:09
"i saw it as he’s a guy with perfect future vision now he should have been able to  any guy without taking any damage however he’s just majorly  off chani and that’s how he saw he could get her to feel sorry for him so he took them stabs



getting stabbed twice for zendaya is…very understandable",2024-03-05 14:48:20
im so happy they didnt do that in the film it wouldve ruined the pacing and emotions of that scene one of the things i love about villeneuve is that he generally lets the audience figure out or interpret what happens on screen that fight is no exception,2024-03-10 11:00:29
something would have been better than nothing i had no idea until now that it was a chess move on his part to get stabbed point of view angles the use of the kuleshov effect slow motion and  expressions are all visual tools they could have used and these are just broad suggestions i came up with in two seconds an experienced and gifted director like denis could have come up with something better if he had given it some thought it is about embracing the challenge to make creative decisions but they didnt even try and opted for the most predictable duel beats skillfully executed i have to admit but not particularly unique you always expect the bad guy to win some leverage initially but you dont expect the main character to be so superior he feigns losing,2024-03-02 02:10:56
yeah that was my main disappointment with that scene no glimpse of pauls prescience,2024-03-03 09:10:21
"also chapter 4

“he didn’t shoot”",2024-03-01 19:49:08
"that atreides who wasn’t drugged wasn’t just an ordinary soldier though he was one of their highest ranking fighters it’s never explicitly stated but in part 1 you can often see him near letogurneyduncan and he even has some dialogue with them i remember reading this in an interview a few years back after part 1 came out 

and the guy who plays him is roger yuan who was responsible for all the fight choreography in both movies so i thought it was cool how they gave him a badass role in universe that justifies his prowess in the giedi prime arena against feyd ",2024-03-03 17:17:42
"this says more about the atreides soldiers than anything he beats a single random undrugged atreides and everyone thinks hes a hero

part of the emperors reason for wanting to destroy the atreides is that their soldiers were becoming even better and more loyal than the sardaukar",2024-03-03 15:17:22
the soldier who wasnt drugged was the 2nd in command of the atreides army under gurney,2024-03-04 08:12:55
the combatants were drugged up to weaken their capabilities that is why those 2 are slain so easily whereas the non drugged combatant puts up a fight its why they tell the baron to cancel the fight upon realizing one is not drugged and cld pose a legitimate threat like the bene gesserit said it is all for show they are drugged to be easily killed for the spectacle feyd then calls out baron after the fight that he had tried to  him bcuz he knew the 1 fighter wasnt drugged,2024-03-04 07:21:17
"what about feyds last opponent made him come off as some ordinary tech guy other than the fact that he was asian and not as hilariously buff as the other two

the guy was shredded moved with confidence and purpose and even had a badass line when the harkonnens entered his cell before the fight",2024-03-07 09:57:32
"interestingly enough thats actually not true for the book the movie makes it far more ambiguous so im not totally sure 

in the book that is the main issue actually  paul knows that he gets into this fight but he cannot see the actual fight clearly most probably because feydrautha is also a candidate for kwisatz haderach

this forces paul to stay reserved because he doesnt know what rautha has hidden in the book he has hidden poisons and needles and such thats how rautha is able to really give paul a challenge

ultimately though in both the book and movie the fight plays out in a way where paul is making an assessment of his opponents charactermotivations and then exploits it",2024-03-04 02:18:43
"hes not omniscient he can see possibilities and sometimes even see the ways to make them happen exactly but its not 100 

itd be like climbing a mountain you see the peak and can see ways to get there but you cant be entirely sure of which path is the correct one one may be slicker than it appears a rock that looked solid may crumble as you tried to hold on the only sure way is to climb",2024-03-10 02:53:43
one of the fun parts of reading dune is that you start to go  theyre doing dune arent they all over the place,2024-03-03 04:15:51
also when he tells zendaya that the ships only lower their shields when theyre about to fire,2024-03-02 05:33:44
i noticed that parallel too i was like… this looks a ton like his fight with gurney i was happy to see that callback,2024-03-01 18:52:08
unexpected rparahumans,2024-03-03 11:35:51
in the book at least he doesnt know how the fight is going to go  he can see many branches of the future and most of them involve him dying to feyd but the actual fight itself is chaos and obscured for him,2024-03-01 13:37:55
no he doesn’t he knows every possible future he doesn’t know what happens in this fight even during the fight in the book at first his visions are near perfect but throughout the book there are more and more instances of his visions being wrong or imperfect,2024-03-01 16:10:24
rather gurney used on him,2024-03-03 15:02:07
i think it was the knife zendaya gave to him previously that had hidden somewhere in his suit,2024-03-05 22:33:15
yeah i need to rewatch to understand how 2 blades became 3 during the duel,2024-03-05 14:51:51
i think the editing is just wonky it pays like a one motion thing but in actuality it wouldve been a two motion action i thought the end to the feyd gladiator fight had a wonky kind of ending to the edit as well,2024-03-05 07:12:32
"it was not there the blade in his side was his own that feyd managed to turn on him paul then pulls this out to stab feyd while also directing feyds blade into his shoulder as bait

after the battle he only pulls out feyds blade in his shoulder while still holding his own blade that struck the killing blow the blade is no longer in his side",2024-03-11 18:13:54
oh okay this makes sense feel like two knives in you is too much,2024-03-03 16:04:39
"i think there’s a third knife paul stood up with two knives still stuck in him while a 3rd one was stuck in rautha i guess he always had a side knife which he never had a chance to pull until he occupied rautha’s hands with the shoulder stab


i have a feeling the 3rd knife belonged to jamis which paul just had on him but i will have to rewatch the movie to be sure",2024-03-05 15:00:28
he did not no the actor shot scenes for the sequel but said scenes were cut,2024-03-05 22:04:35
the scene after shows him removing the one from his shoulder and his side there was a 3rd dagger,2024-03-01 05:05:19
"that’s whats happening not sure what you were seeing the make points that feyd is a guy that can be manipulated with honor that he cares about and paul knows that honor and this fighting is the way of the houses paul is more powerful than anyone now after he drank the water of life he can see the possible futures he already knows what happens and how to win and he makes sure not to “use” his powers in front of the audience cause then the fight wouldn’t be honorable if he cheated 

but he took that path to do what he did because he already knew he won the fight otherwise he would have taken a different path",2024-03-01 05:31:45
right but that aspect of feyd was completely left out of the movies there’s no reason to think paul was poisoned in his final fight in the movie just that he can somehow survive short swords to his torso without much damage and is able to pull it out and stab his opponent who is face to face with him without being noticed,2024-03-01 19:24:18
"i dunno from the adverts i saw it just looked like a typical divergent or hunger games thing all sparse shot wide looked a bit flat a bit cold you know how ncis stargate universe and loads of other tv dramas are all shot the same same camera angles same lighting same office based scenes they all look the same 

i’m probably wrong as i love anything dune and will be singing it’s praises soon 

obviously i need to see this film downvotes say i’m wrong ",2024-03-02 23:29:51

in one interview iirc he mentioned making arrival in part as practice and a preparation of things he had in his mind for dune seems to have worked out quite well,2024-03-05 22:31:20

when i was watching this movie i thought of mass effect i’m so glad someone else thought that too lol,2024-03-09 22:15:28
im the air they have shields they turn them off when they get to the ground because they want to harvest without attracting the worms,2024-03-03 05:19:52
hi mate i am new to the series so apologies if this is explained but what was the entire arsenal of nukes doing on that planet and not to be found on the home planet of atreides,2024-03-02 00:56:33
ohhhh that wasnt clear i was wondering what kind of nukes just knock everybody down and not destroy any enemy ships,2024-03-04 02:04:47
baron harkonen also wanted the emperor vulnerable just too prideful to see his defeat in the plan,2024-03-02 22:29:23

i think it was to show the shield around the ship,2024-03-04 01:54:45

every atomic bomb in any movie is better than that lame  explosion in oppenheimer,2024-04-07 15:53:12
i worked on that sequence i promise you that a ship that reflective was not easy to rendermatch lighting to at all  when its that reflective you cant hide things in the scene cause things need to be visible in the reflection so it was tough to optimize,2024-03-04 14:42:48
"modern more efficient higher powered nukes produce less radioactive fallout because they burn a higher percentage of their radioactive fuel  also newer  bigger bombs  more fusion and less fission which reduces radioactive fallout as well

so that fits with reality even",2024-03-04 03:04:54
the helmets did have an open face though from what i remember the stillsuit mask and the cloth wrapped around probably would give better protection against radiation dunno,2024-03-05 04:30:46
then jessica giving the best  eating grin was awesome,2024-03-06 22:08:11
that abomination had my theater crowd laughing,2024-03-10 07:36:39
" abomination

sorry for the digging this up but i was looking for discussion about this scene and could not really find it elsewhere

when i saw the movie i was thinking to myself how they misused the word abomination to be an abomination to my understanding one has to be preborn which is when a pregnant woman drinks the water of life to become a bene gesserit and gains access to other memory ancestral memory the unborn children experience this too because they do not yet have fully formed personalities this poses a potential problem as the the voices of their ancestors can begin to take over

paul is not preborn but did drink the water of life paul was bene gesserit trained by jessica and has developed a personality so should be fine from abomination

maybe im nitpicking but i was a bit annoyed by this abomination is kind of a huge theme in dune especially children of dune ",2024-03-11 16:03:49
"didn’t know this until today…

“abomination” refers to a person who has been prenatally exposed to the spice melange and as a result gains access to other memory—the collective consciousness and memories of their ancestors—while still in the  this condition is considered extremely dangerous because the individual especially a child is at risk of being psychologically dominated or possessed by the personalities of their ancestors contained within their genetic memory",2024-03-11 06:37:10
just dont ask her opinion on gérard depardieu,2024-03-01 05:18:55

that was charlotte rampling i just watched the verdict last week,2024-03-02 01:59:17
agreed they seemed to obscure her face even more than in part i for some reason though,2024-03-02 06:33:57
she should have won over brie larson for her performance in 45 years,2024-03-02 11:05:03

crazy how i remember her from orca",2024-03-02 01:27:44

"and i like how it’s an overpowered for this point in the timeline younger character but written well it’s terrifying the book was written decades ago but i feel like it’s an example of an overpowered protagonist and young one at that that is believable i wish anime would take notes

side note a dune anime or animated series would interesting",2024-03-01 22:42:33
"abomination refers to jessica becoming a reverend mother while pregnant exposing the baby to spice and it becoming prescient

spoilers below


 abomination refers to how the baby will have generations of memories from every other reverend mother in its head the reason for this being an abomination and paul not being one is because paul wasn’t prescient before having his own sense of self this means he can use the memories and experiences in his head without them taking over him and him basically becoming a vessel for haunting in a sense the baby will not have its own sense of self and personhood to be able to fight against this and is susceptible to being taken over by some of the people in their memories ",2024-03-01 14:29:51
yup lol didn’t know her name,2024-03-01 15:34:30
i was worried about how silly super magic baby genius would look glad they downgraded her to super magic fetus genius,2024-03-01 05:03:37
im sooo glad they didnt have a talking toddler in the movie jessica talking to her in the  and the vision paul had of her grown up worked much better,2024-03-01 09:46:18
i imagine adding all of her weirdness and doing her justice would have added another 30 minutes to the run time and she was the easiest thing to simplify,2024-03-01 05:01:07
"i dont know why they made alia not yet born in the film i wonder if villenueve thought having a smartass 2 year old with space magic powers would lessen the impact of the climax

i think its as simple as its pretty easy to cut its pretty weird to have a fully adult hyperwisdom child and its easy to include her in the next movie if denis villeneuve gets to make dune messiah with the time jump that would be inevitable",2024-03-01 22:05:19
"she definitely said it to paul it was in response to his using the voice 

probably just took liberties obviously the abomination is alia in the books 

as for not having a 2yr old adult they probably couldn’t work out how to do it in a way that doesn’t look distractingly ridiculous like a little cgi toddler or something",2024-03-02 14:45:26
the use of the term abomination there was such a good inclusion i cannot wait for the messiah adaption,2024-03-01 07:17:52
that will be somewhat trippy and camp tbh to let alia just be born in the movie against its overall very grounded tune denis handled it perfectly,2024-03-01 05:55:53
i think when she says “abomination” it’s a general statement to everything happening before her eyes a male using the voice on her jessica’s decision to betray her order with paul’s ascendancy and her new born child who has omniscient vision from birth,2024-03-03 10:32:42
"she was a big character in the second part of the book  it would have been interesting to see her used as another indication of the time gap that took place

i also think having another main character this late in the whole thing would have been hard for a general audience to understand 

although i was slightly disappointed we book spoiler didnt get to see her  the baron  that would have been to me a much more satisfying end to him",2024-03-01 05:58:52
she called him an abomination as paul shouldn’t have been trained by his mother and should have been a girl,2024-03-03 20:58:51
no i believe the reverend mother called paul and abomination might be wrong tho ,2024-03-01 05:26:47
hard to cast too,2024-03-01 12:23:35
i think its so they wouldnt have to cast her years before the third film,2024-03-02 06:57:27
you are also missing it she detected alia’s presence the same way jessica could that’s the abomination,2024-03-01 16:00:23
thats specifically what i recall from the book so makes me think they changed it  alia being an awakened reverend mother in the  was the abomination,2024-03-03 03:59:46
i think you’re right the following shot from her saying “abomination” was of jessica,2024-03-03 20:55:48
maybe it has been said already but i think she is referring to alia when she says abomination since that is what they call her in later books what they call all of the preborn,2024-03-01 20:48:11
ive never read dune but my husband is a big dune fan so for part one i surprised him by buying tickets for opening day for the very center seats in the best  biggest imax theater in our state did it for part two too and holy  the voice is incredible smaller screens or home viewing wont do it justice you feel it in your body like firework explosions,2024-03-02 23:22:07
yeah anyone watching this in the theater needs to watch it in imax that and any scene involving the sandworms were just epic when the whole room shook han zimmer nailed it out of the park once again,2024-03-04 02:48:38
"if you have an amc dolby cinema anywhere near you that’s a great viewing also

the sheer number of speakers on every wall and the ceiling provides for an awesome dolby atmos setup they also use dual 4k laser dolby vision projectors that look insane",2024-03-04 17:59:53
"it definetly does not come out that way in this specific scene  she said it immediately after paul successfully used the voice on her and there was no indication she even knew of alia in that moment

and it absolutely makes sense that she would view paul as an abomination considering the context",2024-03-01 16:00:21
not in the movie,2024-03-03 15:35:28
the  what  now lol,2024-03-03 15:38:05
it was such a strange cut showing paul about to go into the desert alone and the next shot is chani helping him  they must have cut out a few shots establishing him in the desert alone,2024-03-05 19:21:43
okay i didn’t know a spice  existed in the book and now i feel robbed,2024-03-05 16:56:57
yeah the film presented their romance pretty poorly but the book wasn’t much better so i knew they’d have to cram it in as best as they could,2024-03-03 07:56:28
i did think it was completely inappropriate behavior for a movie audience but it was a primetime showing for a packed house and since i almost never go out to see movies in theaters anymore i figured that was typical audience behavior,2024-03-12 12:23:22

i’m late to this discussion but i just saw it today and 100 agree with you i can’t see walken as anything other than a funny older guy and he felt very out of place in this,2024-04-08 02:33:32
honestly the crazy religious lady talking to a fetus the whole way through was an excellent vibe,2024-03-01 20:51:04
it also revealed to both jessica and paul their harkonnen heritage  which they seemed to start embracing in part via their increased ruthlessness,2024-03-01 15:20:05
its pretty sick that she took on this aura leading into the reveal that she  paul have harkonnen blood,2024-03-01 20:40:37
i think it’s because before they drink the water of life they’re just one person but after they drink the water of life they’re millions of people basically as they have the full memories of millions of people paul even more so because he has the memories of the men and women i think that’s why they are much colder afterwards,2024-03-01 21:43:50

yeah from where reverend mother mohiam is standing jessicas like haha i win meanwhile paul literally just agreed to marry mohiams top student of bene gesseritology lol obviously paul is a lot wiser to their tricks and unlikely to be manipulated as easily as feyd but even so the witches are bound to have contingencies within contingencies as jessica well knows,2024-03-02 17:43:33
"she says you should know
i think its on specific reference to jessica being a harkonnen married to an atreides",2024-03-03 07:55:57

the plan was that she would have a daughter and the daughter would pair with a harkonnen presumably feyd but perhaps there could be others with their child being the kwisatz haderach that would unify those powerful but warring houses and also through similar events presumably put feyd on the throne as is being plotted by the harkonnen anyway so the chosen one would also inherit the empire",2024-03-01 09:37:10
"paul went rogue and now rules over arrakis with a formidable fighting force that can take over every planet in their system he’s not making the bene gesseritt irrelevant but he’s diminishing their influence and power considerably

there is never gonna be any extended edition and even released scenes denis villeneuve doesn’t believe in extended editions,2024-03-01 06:33:41
do we know the character tim blake nelson portrayed my guess was count fenring and i was bummed they didnt show the whistling secret language i had full faith that denis could have pulled it off,2024-03-01 19:49:08
i thought that was a huge miss to cut thufir from the story i thought that part of the books really added to the sense of betrayal but i get it because they also cut the whole part of jessica and thufir almost killing each other in the first movie,2024-03-02 01:59:32
yeah one scene i think may have been due to scenes being cut was that fremen woman friend of jonni who was caught and killed by flamethrower not sure how that came to be,2024-03-03 07:44:01

not doing directors cuts i understand but not even letting audiences watch deleted scenes as a form of education in terms of why a scene might be cut is something im not fond of,2024-03-03 22:33:15
wow i couldn’t disagree more she was absolutely not just eye candy,2024-03-04 00:29:23
i was wondering how they transported all of her outfits across the desert and if they belonged to the previous reverend mother etc the logistics of it are fun to think about ,2024-03-07 01:29:54
yeah agreed i didnt read the book and i didnt quite get that but it makes sense now when i left the movie i was kinda like why didnt he just not make a holy war but this makes total sense couldve been a little more overt in the movie,2024-03-04 05:11:25
"yeah also the thing is in the conversation with jessica all he says about this “narrowest path” is that it ensures they prevail against their enemies nothing about the cost in human lives being minimised it showed paul to be more selfserving than intended i think


i mean i know what’s coming i know paul is seeing beyond  way beyond  just the holy war and his own ascension but that’s not really conveyed",2024-03-05 17:19:25
i think the movie indicated that in reality a war is unavoidable already at that point if not under his name an inevitable war will still happen and power will fall in someone elses hand his fate and bene gesserits planning made him the person who did it but there would have been someone something else anyway and he also truly does want revenge,2024-03-06 16:20:24
im pretty sure herbert played into the villain white savior in the book its been ages since i read it but i was reminded of it by a reviewer they talked about how dv leaned into the white saviorvillain paul in this film as opposed to lynchs blue eyed hero i love that take on it much more depth to it than the standard hollywood story chani certainly wasnt thrilled with his speech about being the chosen one,2024-03-04 15:12:15
its intelligent i dont think you need to force feed the audience its echod by the final confrontation if paul does not take up the mantle it goes to faydi think thats all anyone needs to realize and its kind of clear as day setup by the final encounter also if he does not make a play for the throne then they lose control to another house i think its all properly conveyed by the movie if you think about the other possible paths,2024-03-13 07:01:56
"this im not sure how were to infer all of the above out of nothing if we havent read the books 

i kept thinking the individual scenes were masterfully shot but the overall movie was edited by a 3rd grader playing collage",2024-03-05 12:56:56
" always read the book as he was a reluctanttragic hero

are you including messiah in your retrospect in some regards messiah was written because readers took the wrong perspective of paul messiah serves to complete the tragic hero arc  whereas dune p2 does do a better job of showing pauls reluctance in dvs film chani serves as that perspective 

its a nice tweak i think",2024-03-15 14:39:52
"well chani in the books is basically a door mat so shes not really super antianything  shes pretty much propaul from the moment he meets her

but in the books thats basically pauls position  thats just now running face first into the new hasherownopinionsandagency chani of the movie",2024-03-06 00:42:23
its not actually explicitly stated but aspects of the alternatives are discussed and hinted at in the sequels  galactic war was basically inevitable as the current status quo with choam the landsraad the guild the emperor etc was untenable long term  if it wasnt the jihad it was something else  if it was the jihad but it wasnt paul it would have been fayd rautha or a freman and they would not have been as restrained,2024-03-31 19:09:37
i may be misremembering but i couldve sworn he seemed pretty adamant about making another movie before he returns to working on dune,2024-03-03 07:53:13
"part 1 had a total box office of 435m during the pandemic on a 165m budget  
  
part 2 seems to be on the way to at least double the debut week take of the first movie on a 190m budget",2024-03-02 22:39:24
i think they might wait longer so the actors can age up a bit otherwise youd have to condense down the time skip a lot theres 12 years between dune and dune messiah,2024-03-02 11:48:32
not officially confirmed as far as i find with google,2024-03-02 08:22:18
dont forget the prequel my dinner with andre that sets up everything thats to come,2024-03-03 15:45:17
great film btw,2024-03-04 15:13:00
"also why weren’t shields used more in this movie when you’re out on the sands it will attract worms but so do spice miners no so why wouldn’t the harkonen guarding them use them why were more used in the final battle in the north when shields weren’t being used why didn’t people use more lasers in case someone switched them on and caused the double nuke

in one of the first scenes there’s the harkonen patrol that glides up the spire to escape a thumper insanely beautiful shot with the score ripping and they start getting sniped by projectiles one of them suggests shields and their leader says no why i thought worms can’t get you on rocks it seems like the perfect time to use shields",2024-03-06 10:47:15
but in a galaxy of what i have to imagine is trillions is that really significant,2024-03-04 01:12:33
and that helps with orbital ship to ship combat how,2024-03-04 03:18:37
"the fremen are directly inspired by the arab conquests in which a bunch of “backwater” tribes united by a charismatic warrior prophet burst out of the desert and shattered the roman and sasanian persian empires the two great superpowers of the age 

there’s a very clear historical precedent for them

eta the arabs took very quickly to the sea too and within 20 years of their initial victories were winning naval battles over the romans",2024-03-04 03:22:43
well supposedly they are far and away better fighters than the sardekar who are the empires best fighters and for strategy they have a guy who can see the future leading them,2024-03-04 04:25:59
"paul also has the advantage of perfect future sight they can never out maneuver him and he has a iron grip with the guild who will now do his bidding to shuttle his troops around he also lied his atomics can literally burn the planet ultra high yield future tech this is how he controls the guild and sways some houses to his side

his soldiers can take the imperial troops one to one or better because theyre hardened fanatics who evolved from a hellworld he has the prescient path forward to perfectly manipulate the other houses as well as troops having troops as good as the sardaukar

they have the atreidies remnant on caladan they could sway other house that were friendly if they leverage ix then they have a weapons base controlling the spice gives them a lot of leverage as most rulers of the great houses are addicted to give them long life as are many of the heirs the spacing guild will all die without out it because they depend on mega doses the bene gesserit can be brough on side if they believe they have some control over paul or paul is advancing the ultimate goal which is human survival

in the book or movie hes going to have to resort to genocide either through armies or just starving nonself relaiant planets the hunger he fears he controlls all shipping by having massive leverage on the spacing guild",2024-03-04 08:02:35
yeah im sure their desert fu is formidable but im not sure how thats applicable in ship to ship orbital combat,2024-03-04 03:17:32
"it just has to be though to properly give even a brief birdseye view of the guild and mentats wouldve added another 40 minutes and created all sorts of pacing issues and for what most people would just be weirded out by the navigators in particular

its all the endless odd details like that and all the inner monologue and visions  that has made people declare dune an unmakeable movie for decades

i think hes just absolutely nailing it including more or making 4hr films would be great for us fans but i doubt itd do well enough with the normies to secure funding to finish the project

its still only peter jackson whos managed that by somehow convincing them to approve the whole series at once basically by lying and saying they could film them at the same time  george lucas has famously joked about this and you can tell hes in awe

they didnt cover feyds poisoned blade either again  for good reason it wouldve been so hard to do well and its just more detail than is needed for the majority of the audience

same with the whole lasguns vs shields thing us nerds care and explain to our friends why the combat is so meleeheavy covering it well in the movies would require adding a whole bunch more scenes

i think hes walking the line really well with what hes choosing to exclude",2024-03-02 01:30:44
yeah and from memory thufir has a big role to play in the final conflict where he stands with the baron emperor and feyd but is plotting to help paul in a double agent way without telling paul and the internal mental struggle of needing to be strategic for the baron or the emperor but then never forgetting his loyalties and there is additional emotional frustration for the reader knowing that the baron is utilising thufir to strategise against his own former master anyway the film was 1010 for me,2024-03-02 16:44:10
seems like hes setting them up to be a big presence next movie though,2024-03-01 13:36:01
"i was thinking this too after watching the new movie today there are so many important themes throughout the book that either dont make it to the movies or arent as highlighted as others

it seems like the recent adaptations are primarily focusing on the themes of religion  messianism environmentalism and colonialismimperialism religionfanaticism is heavily observed in the latest film and seems to be headed towards stronger themes of power  politics 

i think theyve done a wonderful job though dune is notoriously difficult to adapt because it is driven so much by internal dialogue and a vast array of themes its clear the movies have made careful decisions with their focus and how they want to tell the story

the mentats and guild in the book comment on the dangers of human reliance on technology something thats definitely ontopicrelevant today and resource scarcitys role in economics and politics its a shame we havent gotten more of those themes in the latest movies but with how good the latest movies are it just goes to show how important it is to make informed cuts  decisions when making a film theyve done an incredible job

i appreciate the direction given to the latest adaptations and how well everything has been done up to this point i genuinely believe the story of the book is too difficult to ever fullyencapsulate in another medium kudos to the film team for knowing what they wanted to achieve  portray and executing it extremely well",2024-03-04 02:45:25
the guild doesnt matter at all or even show up in person until messiah people get fixated on the spice mutants but they dont matter in the story for a good while,2024-03-01 23:06:30
"along with the actual role of you know the spice

im not complaining the movie was incredible im hoping they get contextualized in the third movie though",2024-03-03 07:23:57
" the guild

only sort of disappointing thing about the movie was no cameo by these rascals",2024-03-03 03:44:48
my only hope for denis’ messiah is that they really go in hard with the weirdness of mentats and guild navigators since they play much more of an active role ,2024-03-03 08:30:56
where was my sappho juice dennis,2024-03-01 13:38:02
also choam,2024-03-03 02:41:58
i suspect the guild will play a more vital role in part 3,2024-03-03 23:38:46
also there really wasnt anything about paul teaching the fremen the weirding way,2024-03-03 08:15:22
"yeah i was exactly talking about that with a friend villeneuve gave the bene gesserit a much more important role on this film showing how they were the ones playing on the background etc but ledt the guild totally out of the story

i hope that on the third movie he gaves both mentats and the guild a more important role would make sense with the travel through space etc",2024-03-15 08:56:45
not seeing a guild navigator is a travesty to me,2024-03-03 04:15:12
"i absolutely loved how villaneuve captured the essense of that with the scene focussing on just pauls hand with the four fingers displayed at 45 degrees representing the multitude of possible outcomes and then turning the hand vertical to represent the single and only possible path forward 

villaneuve is a master when it comes to representing scale of enormity but this one scene showed me hes also genius when working on a small scale too",2024-03-02 15:52:19
i recall that faces scene from the book for some reason seemed on point in him gaining a multitude of perspectives all at once,2024-03-03 04:15:59
having watched dune on a big imax screen with the room literally shaking as the worms arrive i just don’t think it would have had the same effect watching it on my tv,2024-03-01 23:33:00
what do you mean there already is a dune tv series,2024-03-02 15:55:44
thats why even though i also love these movies the best adaptation for me is still the miniseries the children of dune miniseries isnt too bad either,2024-03-02 00:19:16
i love that actor though he was awesome in devs,2024-03-02 22:59:06
i would hate this so hawat is alive somewhere but the baron doesn’t bring him to arrakis,2024-03-01 16:17:17
that would be extremely odd considering he dies at the end of dune,2024-03-04 01:40:43
"

around 125 to the far right",2024-03-01 21:43:35
"or a nonextended lotr trilogy

good thing others dont believe that",2024-03-01 08:07:42
using blade runner as an example is completely asinine since ridley didnt have final cut for its theatrical release villeneuve does,2024-03-02 04:35:38
honestly i can respect that but at the same time i will lead a jihad for this extended cut,2024-03-04 16:20:35
i get it to some degree what you make is what you make going back and making a bunch of variants can be creatively frustrating and confusing for people,2024-03-10 03:45:46
jesus what an absurd take from a great director,2024-03-01 08:08:15
the movie is only as good as it is because of his strong creative vision if that leads to a mentality of no deleted scenes then so be it,2024-03-12 06:41:46
i took it as him  talking to paul,2024-03-03 17:19:14
"weirdly that was one of my favorite parts of the movie “may your knife chip and shatter” is already a cold  line and the gestures they make for it 

 i need to see this again",2024-03-09 14:52:40
exactly what it reminded me of,2024-03-02 05:26:46
" were they creatures or men

yes 

but really the harkonnen blur that line pretty well",2024-03-03 04:06:29
he mimicked the barons voice really well,2024-03-01 05:15:43
him absolutely relishing the death of the baron was masterful to me  he could  taste the barons agony and holy  did it tickle him,2024-03-03 04:03:35
that guy was scary too bad we didnt see any more of his cannibal groupies they were nuts,2024-03-04 03:51:13
is it weird that i hadn’t realized how attracted i was to austin butler until this movie,2024-03-07 08:51:29
slam dunk best supporting actor at the academy awards if this came out when intended magnetic presence in this film,2024-03-02 23:14:10
his eyebrow work was incredible,2024-03-06 06:51:16
i liked how he didnt give a  his uncle died,2024-03-10 04:16:24
weird i didn’t like him at all ,2024-03-03 04:43:39
if he throws his voice around any harder the bene geserit are going to take him to court,2024-03-01 04:25:37
holy  that was not bill skarsgård,2024-03-01 12:56:08
"  he is such a vocal chameleon it weirded me out  i remembered the was a scene where i could of sworn it was the baron talking but it made no sense plot wise for him to be there like in the attack where they seize the abandoned sietch in the north and capture the fremen fighter then the camera switched to feyd talking and i thought holy  this guy is good

  i remember when he was cast thinking oh i know that guy because he was in the the shannara chronicles back in the day  i did not know the guy i saw on the screen but he was fantastic in the role",2024-03-02 04:41:30
doom,2024-03-01 05:11:42
 i thought he was taylor kitsch in elvis,2024-03-02 04:10:02
"copying my own reply to very similar comment above

in fact it was so shockingly good that i wonder if their voices his and the barons were mixed in post

same with hard left turn here melissa mccarthy in the new little mermaid

either she and austin are simultaneously godtier voice actors or there was some digital wizardry going on behind the curtain

ive worked a bit in studios and filters that make you sound like elvis or yoda etc have been around for over a decade

im sure that a hollywood audio engineer working with ai tools and an huge budget could do basically anything with a voice track",2024-03-01 13:49:49
bro tried to pretend he couldnt shake the elvis voice because he was so all in with his voice coach for that movie like bro you just want to sound cool thats ok but dont lie and act like you dont remember nonelvis speak you made it work for this movie,2024-03-01 08:28:32
didn’t like austin butler’s performance no conviction behind it i didn’t buy it his villain act cringe,2024-03-01 07:10:47
just wanted to add that ledger came off brokeback mountain which added fuel to the flames to his casting,2024-03-05 11:29:36
"the throughline of feyd’s plot is that he’s a potential replacement for paul he’s one of the bene gesserit’s backup plans for the continuation of their genetic breeding program

in fact the bg are backing feyd because he is a known quantity and is way more controllable than paul or jessica

he’s basically the replacement for paul and this potential role is kept right up to the end of the film the absolute peak is when paul gets stabbed in the duel and the audience thinks “oh  was all this grassroots religious movement actually wrong”

so yeah it culminates in a knife fight but that fight was where paul put down the harkonnens and cemented himself as the kwisatz haderach",2024-03-02 05:11:56
oh man the overhead shot of paul walking through the crowd of fremen,2024-03-01 03:46:34
"i was thinking by the time it got to the third act

this is probably the best looking movie ive ever seen",2024-03-01 04:38:20
my favorite was after chani fire that rocket and they are running and you can hear her laughing a little while the ships explode  something about that gave me such a feel of “this what a fun epic movie looks like “,2024-03-01 08:06:33
yeah i cant wait to pick this up in 4k bluray,2024-03-01 04:29:58
the sand physics with the worms and all the explosions were incredible i dont know if there is any film that looks and sounds this good mad max fury road was great but this film is just straight up artistic and high falutin,2024-03-02 03:29:45
amongst nearly every other aspect denis cinematography is always incredible,2024-03-03 07:32:22
lots of closeups too many pores,2024-03-04 15:09:33
he is definitely an early favourite for best cinematography for next years oscars,2024-03-03 00:16:51
probably due to pollution or something of the sort stilgar mentions how the harkonnen water is bad for drinking but works for cooling geidi prime is a hellhole,2024-03-01 10:01:51
"could also be a style thing in imperial china after the manchus won in the qing dynasty they made everyone get the queue hairstyle

or french court with the powdered wigs because of lice etc maybe some high ranking people went bald and others emulated it as a style thing",2024-03-01 11:59:15
the book mentions harkonnen genetic markers so i think it’s just a result of generations spent on geidi prime,2024-03-03 06:26:45
yeah a friend of mine mentioned this the original gieger alien visuals originated from dune concept art they did not even try getting dune made into a film in the mid 70s but started working on the alien film instead,2024-03-04 06:55:32
i believe every scene at geidi prime which is in natural light is bw because of the sun that’s why colour flipping happened,2024-03-01 03:49:43
they did the same transition with the baron also,2024-03-01 03:41:10
water of life is sandworm venom so it is pretty hard to get once it is adult,2024-03-01 13:26:22
sorry it’s a quote from the office,2024-03-01 20:12:04
it wont make you an nba champion but it will make you so smart and so jacked you render all of nasas guidance navigation and control centers obsolete,2024-03-04 10:31:40
she was basically the voice of the reluctant part of him in his internal monologue from the book,2024-03-01 23:24:20
the syfy series was very faithful to the book despite its low budget same with the sequel series that covered both messiah and children,2024-03-06 19:35:00
i couldnt find a decent copy of that anywhere when i tried,2024-03-07 22:39:23
liat kynes actor absolutely crushed in the miniseries i think his version of that character wouldve really fit in villenueves version,2024-03-16 15:51:17
agree it makes no sense but i can also see why they didnt want a five minute exposition on chain reactions in between all the killing,2024-03-04 07:07:33
gurney mentioned that they had enough nukes to blow up the entire planet,2024-03-07 09:31:41
"they use it to see the future like paul does that way they know exactly where theyll end up when they travel between planets


so they dont end up too far away or folding into the planet itself",2024-03-10 03:28:49
it’s not like the explanation would confuse the audience if anything going into the details would help explain other elements of the story better the powers the spice unlocks in paul etc,2024-03-06 11:55:47
i really enjoyed how much more they leaned into jessica being a super powerful bene gesserit in this and how cold and calculating they can be,2024-03-01 15:05:51
did the kids really hear that though i thought they were out of hearing range and jessica was essentially talking to herself ,2024-03-08 20:10:59
yeah i liked that change as well maybe i was too dense to understand the subtext of the book but i also did not get as sinister of vibes from her,2024-03-03 11:10:44
there was way more resistance to paul being the mahdi in the movie,2024-03-06 16:19:18
thats not the message the movie is trying to send at all its a revenge story its more personal to the atreides than its about colonizing a planet for the resources,2024-03-03 12:01:41
hes great in masters of the air on apple tv,2024-03-01 15:29:44
he was actually cast before elvis came out according to an interview i watched so it sounded like denis just liked him not riding the coat tails of elvis success,2024-03-03 07:57:01
this is such a tired thing to say but i honestly think he could do the joker if what he channeled in this role was any indication,2024-03-07 04:23:26
he reminds me so much of brad pitt  they have a similar voice and demeanor  pitt has done a lot of cool and or tough guy roles but then  do something wild like in burn after reading and just completely go for it and pull it off,2024-03-08 01:25:33
he was a certified freak in every scene and i loved it guys got chops we need more actors willing to the extra mile to be that  up yet still believable,2024-03-10 03:38:43
hes been very good in masters of the air too,2024-03-03 06:57:22
honestly im so glad harry styles didnt get cast in the role considering how he was in dont worry darling i dont think he wouldve been even as half good as austin was,2024-03-04 03:01:29
same  hollywood has been pushing him pretty hard and i was starting to wonder if he was actually any good but i remember seeing him the first time in once upon a time in hollywood and despite the relatively small role he was memorable and i remember going to look him up so he actually is a seriously capable actor so chill out hollywood  he’s gonna happen he’s happening he doesn’t need your help  i want to see him in more weird roles he seems quite willing,2024-03-16 23:10:27
for anyone not old enough to remember this is exactly how we felt when heath ledger was cast as the joker and then when we actually saw him,2024-03-18 02:02:59
would be dope,2024-03-14 06:46:29
thats amazing ,2024-03-03 07:16:45
i thought the exact same thing hahaha,2024-03-03 08:47:23
i got major it vibes in a few moments haha,2024-03-07 14:17:30
liked how he commended paul after he lost the fight wasn’t any complaining,2024-03-01 03:38:49
which is kinda funny because theres about 15 skarsgård sons in hollywood and they didnt cast one of them ,2024-03-01 04:36:10
i thought it was bill multiple times during the movie i had to remind myself it was austin butler,2024-03-01 07:38:48
honorary skarsgard son,2024-03-02 22:57:55
at first i really thought it could have been bill under that make up same weird eyes and everything im starting to question if austin is stellas illegitimate son lol,2024-03-03 05:35:11
there was a moment in the movie where it went from stellan to austin and they had the exact same scowl  they did a good job mimicking each other,2024-03-02 16:37:06
man now im thinking how good alexander skaarsgard would have been in this role probably good they didnt go for him though because he is about twice the size of chalamet and them battling it out would have looked weird,2024-03-03 09:38:10
during the scene when the 3 main harkonnens were in front of the emperor and he looked up and spoke to the emperor he had very strong bill skaarsgard pennywise vibes i almost forgot it wasn’t bill in that role for that brief second,2024-03-03 00:27:23
i legit thought it was bill skarsgård until my gf corrected me,2024-03-03 00:54:50
i actually thought it was bill the whole time,2024-03-01 18:58:42
i didnt know austin butler was cast in this and i thought it was alex skarsgaard for a second,2024-03-11 10:51:41
agreed at times he reminded me of bill,2024-03-05 08:46:20
genuinely thought it was his kid who played pennywise until i jumped on this thread,2024-03-06 04:55:48
i spent the entire movie thinking it was bill skarsgard before my girlfriend pulled up the imdb,2024-03-10 16:59:49
not knowing it was austin butler i genuinely thought he mightve been one of the other skarsgards,2024-03-24 14:13:49
seriously i thought it was alexander the whole time,2024-03-02 03:29:39
like we need any more skarsgards lol,2024-03-02 03:58:39
he gave me evil justin bieber  bill skarsgard vibes,2024-03-03 00:36:31
no charisma i feel insane dude was nominated for an oscar people wereare obsessed with his performance he was a virtual unknown and carried a 3 hr elvis movie on his back,2024-03-01 16:28:32
that does help explain why i found him so compelling as tex watson in once upon a time in hollywood but find him otherwise unwatchable,2024-03-01 03:47:49
what sold me on him being a likeable guy was his appearance on hot ones,2024-03-01 21:56:34
im having my doubts that those instances were his fault and not just poor direction dudes clearly got range,2024-03-01 15:16:17
where did you watch bikeriders i can’t find it anywhere and really want to watch it,2024-03-01 06:55:13
didn’t like austin butler’s performance no conviction behind it i didn’t buy it his villain act cringe  ,2024-03-01 07:12:37
or just more,2024-03-01 07:05:07
he also turned himself into handsome squidward looks grotesque now,2024-03-01 23:13:17
keoghan was my desire based on having read the book his tinyness is actually an asset as he is intended to be a twisted mirror image of paul and chalamet does not exactly have a hulking physique having now seen the direction the movies went with adapting the character i think butler is the better fit still maintain keoghan would have brought some demented energy to feyd but i have nothing to complain about with butler,2024-03-10 20:07:35
pretty sure that would be deemed exclusive content,2024-03-01 06:29:14
he kept his hand in the box while she got her dna sample,2024-03-01 11:28:08
its exclusive to his onlyfans page,2024-03-01 11:06:40
"fenring i hold at your neck the gom jabbar the poisoned needle the highhanded enemy remove your hand from the box and you die

feyd whats in the box

fenring pain

feyd  i fail to see whats challenging about this test",2024-03-02 18:09:38
" i wonder if they shot his response to the pain test

it wouldnt surprise me tim blake nelson was completely cut from the movie even though he filmed scenes which means he was probably count fenring the entire giedi prime sequence had to have been much larger in that case with a lot of shots for potential material 

that whole sequence rocked but there are some hallmarks of a rework late in the process leá seydoux walking down the corridor when she seduces feyd using the voice its zoomed in on her eyes and you cant see her mouth both of their lines are done in voice over which makes me think it was a cheap way of changing something",2024-03-02 08:18:52

doesnt remove hand from box",2024-03-03 01:43:52

he probably came,2024-03-06 16:23:42
oh wait if he’s into pain and she was seducing him it made sense that she used a gom  jabar and a “box full of pain” ,2024-03-10 14:06:57
the whole thing is different and fenring is a man in the book  they basically rewrote that segment to take a shorter and more direct path to get to the same general place,2024-03-04 05:35:12
i thought so at first too but im pretty sure they were both in the next scene,2024-03-03 05:56:48
lol the second lea seydoux showed up i wondered if people would have this issue they have incredibly similar features,2024-03-16 12:01:52
i loved his reaction to the baron getting stabbed honestly my reaction too just “haha wooooah he  got him”,2024-03-01 07:35:41
would they commit feyds body to the desert afaik paul only asked for vladimirs body to be put out there as a sign of disrespect,2024-03-01 08:58:33
he would indeed my friend,2024-03-01 05:03:07
 yeah thats metal as ,2024-03-03 12:25:32
hes the good guy in the film,2024-03-01 06:27:56
the obvious reason why he didnt seem upset was the fact that he was now baron of house harkonnen with vladimir gone didnt take him too far as he lost to paul but he would have gone for the throne had he not,2024-03-01 13:14:26

but why would you want to do that,2024-03-10 01:58:57

it didnt make sense that a trained athlete and psychopath was able to  a normal dude whos been imprisoned for presumably weeks no,2024-03-01 13:31:10
its not confirmed yet but theyd be crazy not to,2024-03-02 09:10:12
the director said he wants too but its not official yet,2024-03-02 16:16:25
yeah the books paul is much less reluctant to lead i was heartbroken they didnt have the line while we chani we who carry the name of concubine  history will call us wives,2024-03-01 16:08:32
i dont get it,2024-03-03 04:27:03
"the fremen value water as a sacred offering to the tribe upon death hence the great pool of water stilgar shows jessica which they pour jamis water into he also tells her not to cry for the dead as its seen as a waste as the dead have no use for her water paul correctly deduces that a fremens greatest source of shame would be giving up their water to those who cant use it and turns it against the fremen as a fear tactic to make them believe he can see their deepest anxieties

one of many examples of paul and jessica using the fremens own religious cultural beliefs to control them",2024-03-03 05:03:50
as a non reader yet i would also like to know,2024-03-03 04:12:19
"umywaycarservice and uhulkulesenstein you wanted to know as well

in the books “giving water to the dead” means shedding tears for them this is very taboo in fremen society because of conservation of water the movie mentions this when jessica cries after seeing the fremen water reservoir stilgar catches her tear and says never to do that

paul is telling the old man that even though crying for the dead is forbidden for fremen he knows the old man enjoys doing it in his dreams",2024-03-03 05:07:58
powerful delivery but its a word salad,2024-03-05 13:48:43
and lo the pale worm for its riders name was lisan algaib,2024-03-04 22:30:06
they paired it really well with his realization of who his grandfather is and how he may have to try on a new leadership style,2024-03-11 13:33:26
the transition seemed a little abrupt for me one of the few times i couldnt suspend disbelief even if it was all due to the spice agony he was super against doing that and then he just did did i possibly miss jessica commanding him to with the voice,2024-03-06 10:37:07
well you see he only said that because he was so modest at first,2024-03-14 06:52:42
"the entire sequence of paul arising after drinking the water  arriving with the worm in the back  that speech was phenomenal 

full on sith lord aura",2024-03-08 05:50:10
because paul fought it too he himself said hes not the mahdi hes not after power and he only wants to fight for the fremen at the end he announced himself not only as the mahdi but also the duke of arrakis and then claimed to be the emperor and started a war with the other great houses using fremen as his soldiers he has turned 180 from the man she fell in love with and are using her people as his tools for power of course shes ,2024-03-01 04:33:20
"was she different in the book havent read but would like to  

within what was shown in the movie i thought her outlook was pretty understandable to be honest she fell in love with the stranger who completely agreed with her outlook that he wasnt interested in being special then he turns around and becomes spicy jesus and pretty offhandedly threatens to nuke her planet",2024-03-01 23:42:42
she fell in love with the offworlder that rejected his heritage and prophecy and then once she was in too deep he turned around embraced it and made a play for the throne of the imperium,2024-03-02 09:13:57
"in the books paul fights that battle in his mind between the two roads he sees a life of peace and insignificance with chani or revenge and the throne if he embraces the prophecy they didnt want to go excessive with the dreams and thoughts so they made each path personified by characters chani was the anti prophecy love path and jessica was the embrace the prophecy part if you recall from the book jessica really wasnt that into the fremen prophecy it being a bastardisation of the benne gesserit one

it also made sense to build pauls embrace of the horrible path he chose around chani with the marriage proposal to irulan being the climax of it giving chani a prophecy is how they have power over us belief ties this together and tells the audience some of whats really going on its pretty much a genius way of dealing with the complex themes on screen",2024-03-03 00:14:51
"it was a creative decision to reduce exposition in the movie

in the book all the turmoil is within paul’s head in the movie they had chani be that second voice for paul to speak again his destiny",2024-03-03 18:04:50

“so anyway i just started blasting visions”,2024-03-04 05:03:45
lol i gotta say this is one of the better comments ive ever received well done,2024-03-05 21:20:53
"spoilers obviously

when he drank the blue gatorade his visions became clear and he could see the future see all possible outcomes and there was only a narrow path to a future where his house won and the imperium didnt rule with a iron first similar to dr strange in endgame that narrow path required him to take up the mantle of the messiah

its a theme in the books of if you need to make one of two decisions one kills 1 million and the other 20 million what decision do you make paul was presented with this decision and it was either the fremen and house atreides dies or he starts a holy war that will end in their survival 

the movie didnt really do a great job at showing how both decisions heading south and becoming the messiah or staying north lead to unsurmountable death but heading south was less death",2024-03-05 19:50:06
season 3 of show cant come soon enough,2024-03-03 18:18:32
is that all it is i didn’t read the books but my takeaway from both movies was that the bene gesserit plan of centuries of gene selection breeding to create a special powered character was pretty legit,2024-03-04 13:48:38
definitely  paul is only 15 at the start of the book,2024-03-04 07:36:41
twinkish is wild lolol,2024-03-03 06:51:52
i saw this movie years ago and it’s why i was super down with him as paul,2024-03-06 05:22:23
i’m hoping paul mescal throws his hat in the ring after gladiator,2024-03-10 08:17:37
i felt the exact same this  was too good and as each scene went by i was thinking how great the whole thing was each character is just perfect the cinematography creative expansive and awesome and action scenes quick but ruthless i was so hyped every time the fremen emerged from the sand on their ambushes just a great film that had me sort of cautious about the long run time prior to viewing it but it just flew by,2024-03-13 00:07:37
that and it skipped so many key nuances and story lines yet it was so good like core plot elements remain the same and the same logical fallacies the book had at times carry through here too,2024-03-10 07:41:21
why do we talk about people like this,2024-03-10 19:53:40
i adore dune and dune 2 but all i can think of someone making the lotr comparison is you must not have been there world apart,2024-03-04 23:43:32
honestly if this isnt even nominated for best picture and chalamet isnt nominated for best actor im gonna flip,2024-03-20 23:33:21

it’s an adaptation of a classic scififantasy series rather than an original ip,2024-03-10 19:34:54
this thread is full of “stilgar was too much of a comedic relief”,2024-03-01 15:12:55
basically every sound is added in post and actors rarely actually get hit the odd time they request it for authenticity but its not the norm,2024-03-06 20:11:06
he has absolutely zero choice any other decision basically kills everyone they glossed over this in the movie but it’s pretty clear that if he doesn’t do exactly what he did the alternatives are just unimaginably horrific even if he dies it would be worse,2024-03-06 02:49:34
this was actually a bit confusing to me doesnt paul tell chani multiple times that he cant go south that this is exactly what will happen,2024-03-06 12:23:03
" he lied to chani and was manipulated by his mom to make paul what he said he wouldn’t become he’s a 

lying is nothing compared to letting all your loved ones die paul has no choice",2024-03-16 00:16:03
he didn’t lie he’s doing what needs to be done to save everyone and still be with her she just doesn’t know it,2024-03-15 03:57:51
very true there was more of that in this film than i would have liked,2024-03-04 00:43:20
lucky you guess what the studio  spoiled to the press at the premiere ,2024-03-01 04:04:37
"bro ive avoided spoilers and all sorts of leaks up to yesterday when my wife just nonchalantly brings it up in a passing conversation hey i didnt know know anya taylorjoy is in dune 2  did you

"she and florence pugh are having two of the greatest 12 punches ever

florence went oppenheimer  dune part two

and now anya is going dune part two  furiosa",2024-03-02 09:34:09
someone spoiled this for me online a few weeks back saying she was only in it for like two scenes and yup it was just about that much,2024-03-02 02:13:23
to be fair shes in pretty much every movie lately i think its in her contract or something,2024-03-04 01:48:27
imagine her face staring back at you those big eyes jesus christ,2024-03-02 19:58:21
you know what that completely makes sense for the face of a weirdly wise talking fetus my thought process,2024-03-16 12:09:34
love to know what she got paid for that single scene,2024-03-03 22:50:17
this is the year of anya taylor joy in desert movies,2024-03-10 23:17:57
you wont believe how that scene was with the edibles hitting me full power,2024-03-12 12:56:11
i was like of course she is this movie the guy to my right scoffed and laughed,2024-03-03 11:12:58
i knew she was in this i completely forgot though and even if i didn’t forget i definitely couldn’t have guessed how or who,2024-03-05 19:15:07
i knew but still had the same reaction lol,2024-03-15 03:46:28
when she popped on screen i immediately got annoyed,2024-03-31 04:03:53
when i see her on my facebook feed its a bit of a jump scare not sure why she got work done,2024-03-01 15:20:50
i knew but i forgot about it by the moment she appeared,2024-03-03 12:54:31
considering messiahs reintroduction of duncan idaho and his uhinteractions with alia theyre likely just going to jump her straight to adulthood,2024-03-06 21:01:58
it reminded me of gollum hallucinatory and sinister,2024-03-02 05:50:23
that doesnt happen in rosemarys baby,2024-03-13 18:07:11
no the prescient unborn baby was unfortunately not part of the prophecy she’s a bit of an unknown variable,2024-03-01 06:52:21
from villeneuve’s perspective i totally get why he wants to stop after messiah but selfishly i really think he could pull off a children adaptation and i desperately want it after watching part 2,2024-03-01 15:31:28
"yes

i prefer the first two books to children but i love alias role in children specifically taylorjoy will do just fine with the material in messiah but i really want to see her tackle where alia goes in the next one",2024-03-01 14:49:02
alia the vvitch child,2024-03-01 16:11:01
the witch version of anya would be perfect for alia,2024-03-01 16:18:53
does that mean timothy will be replaced by an older paul and this was his last movie i haven’t read any dune books,2024-03-02 06:43:17
"based on these synopsis i read of the sequels id only read dune this series goes off the rails paul becomes a sand worm 

i dunno man this is why i can never get into sci fi so much it turns into throw every idea at the wall and they all stick",2024-03-12 00:20:32
pretty much just this and doctor sleep lol but i patiently await more entries into this canon,2024-03-01 16:24:50
"i think the being born was that he would reach his full potential after drinking the life water so he was reborn as the kwisatz once that happened and gained its powers  jessica never lost faith in her son the life water basically super radicalized her immediately and turned her into fanatic to put her son in a place of as much power as possible instead of just trying to survive

alia wasnt ever viewed as being the kwisatz she just happened to get wrapped up in all this accidently after jessica stupidly drank worm poison while pregnant and completely changed her from being a normal human girl into an abomination",2024-03-04 16:03:26
so the baby will be born like a completely sentient adult,2024-03-01 08:32:08
yes but who isn’t a descendent of genghis khan,2024-03-02 05:15:39
spoilers she also loses control at one point to where she allows an ancestor to pretty much possess her  unfortunately she picks her grandfather vlad not leto  she also killed vlad as a toddler instead of paul in the books,2024-03-04 00:35:38
ya i mean even from across the two movies the performance is great hes this super rational personal in the first but as the arc goes on in the movie he becomes a fanatical child i like how at first hes just like i see some signs and then even the vaguest of signs has him quoting some other part of the prophecy that noone else seems to really recall,2024-03-01 22:55:06
"the scene that followed was so epic paul just barging in yelling  you i make the rules around here now 

this movie deserves several oscar nominations timothee chalamet will sooner or later win one he is such a talented onceinageneration actor im so glad he has someone like leonardo dicaprio on his side advising him",2024-03-02 21:09:02
relevant text from the book that i provided earlier,2024-03-01 15:18:09
i dunno man if some guy claiming to be the son of the flying spaghetti monster drank liquid mercury survived then told me what my 6th grade wet dream was i’d pledge my life to him too,2024-03-02 06:48:30
timothee killed in that scene though,2024-03-02 04:04:33
he was so intimidating when he first appears in part one i would never have guessed that he would go on to become the comic relief character,2024-03-02 01:16:35
i thought it was an excellent showing of how someone can turn fanatic it starts with curiosity and some doubt and it grows from there,2024-03-03 16:22:11
like it’s not a momentary thing either he planned on dying to paul when they were still in the north just so paul may speak literally “shut up and take my life”,2024-03-05 19:06:53
yes those scenes arent meant for comedy but tragedy and to highlight the downfall of the freman dream,2024-03-01 06:32:03
and that is stilgars essence in the novel he goes from a teacher and a friend to paul to his greatest fanatical worshiper,2024-03-01 14:14:41

not a criticism though the i am paul muadib atreides duke of arrakis sells the concept of it they have their ways and he has learned them but in following him they have to accept his as well",2024-03-01 09:46:44

he asked for guidance from the dead jamis had a vision and was then cool with going south,2024-03-04 03:11:10
adding to another persons comment paul was also reality checked by gurney pauls act of severely disrupting spice production would have force the emperorharkonnen down a path of war regardless whether he went south to get an army or not,2024-03-04 07:46:54
"1 paul is disturbed he didnt foresee the eradication of their northern sietches a failure that causes many fremen civilian deaths he is told by vision of jamis and bene gesserit spirits that he needs to go south to achieve the vision needed to protect himself and those he cares about this is why paul wants to go south

2 practically speaking the destruction of the northern sietches means all the fremen have no home in the north and are heading south to meet if paul stays north hes doing it alone to die in a heroic sacrifice this is why chani wants him to go south

in the end paul chooses the preservation of himself and those he holds dear over the lives of billions who will die in the war he unleashes and chani inadvertently gives him permission because she also values his life and this is the only way he sees to preserve it",2024-03-09 00:39:06
and to add to the other two comments feyd’s arrival with his more aggressive tactics successfully levelled all fremen bases of operation in the north so paul’s options were suddenly and severely limited feyd forced paul’s hands,2024-03-05 19:27:34
paul used his prescient sight to get advice from jamis in the alternate future where jamis became his mentor instead of having to fight him to the death jamis tells him he needs to see the past to see the future ie he needs to drink the water of life to unlock his genetic memory like his mother in order to be able to fully use his prescience and get the answers he seeks ie how to save himself and his loved ones while avoiding the holy war after drinking the water of life he says he sees a narrow path but in the end he realises he failed to avoid the holy war when the great houses refuse to recognize his ascendency either they will declare war on him or he does which is why when he hears back from the great houses he tells the fremen to go show them paradise in a resigned tone he realises the holy war is inevitable and therefore stops trying to avoid it,2024-03-04 19:18:56
arrakis isnt yours to conquer,2024-03-01 16:04:30
"the emperor and harkens were always beyond  lol

i love how in the movie only hard time paul had was fighting feyd but arguably even that is a ploy to gain chani’s sympathy 

as soon as he got the water it was over faceroll it is",2024-03-02 02:20:07
id honestly say that pauls story reminds me most of hamlet or macbeth a tragic character that is pushed by the world into orchestrating their own demise paul is a good guy but the universe doesnt need a good guy thats why leto was killed,2024-03-02 14:14:37
eren yeager  yeah we’re genocide bros,2024-03-03 02:05:49
"dune always make me the end of game of thrones
bran is basically  emperor right",2024-03-02 19:58:13
i mean if it wasn’t for paul and his son humanity would have gone extinct within the next several thousand years so i’d say he’s a least somewhat of a hero,2024-03-02 07:30:45
oh hes clearly  by this point,2024-03-09 16:16:34
i havent read the books i probably should but thats the thought i had the whole time i think they pulled that effect off pretty well,2024-03-10 19:55:09
yep the trope is omniscience morality license,2024-03-05 19:30:35
well he is a hero this story is just a reminder that isnt always a good thing,2024-03-04 04:11:37
george already took the story to make the first star wars movie how much more could you want,2024-03-02 06:17:00
we need denis to direct a star wars film,2024-03-01 19:31:30
dont you mean prequels cuz thats what this made me think of prequels but good,2024-03-03 04:18:41

what are we some kind of dune part two 2024,2024-03-01 15:35:04
hi its me im the madhi its me,2024-03-01 08:20:28
what are we some kind of duneee,2024-03-01 14:03:11
that flashback when he fought jamis and paul said i dune want to dune this my dune the stilgar asked what are they dune chills literally chills,2024-03-03 02:26:02
ill have my revengeand dune too,2024-03-02 02:18:33
turns out the real dune part two were the friends we made along the way,2024-03-03 04:57:36
its dune time,2024-03-16 22:59:06
its me  im the warhammer 10000 aka dune  and these are my brothers warhammer 25000 aka strife warhammer 30000 aka heresy and warhammer 40000 aka imperium  oh and thats warhammer 60000000 over there in the corner by himself  dont mind him he doesnt have any friends,2024-03-03 03:40:13
 i’d hate that,2024-03-05 08:16:40
this movie is on track to gross ten dunillion dollars,2024-03-01 08:10:59
because it wasn’t just the fremen name for it it was the colloquial name used even by offworlders,2024-03-01 16:12:00
"“my dune”


can we talk a bit about that scene he’s floating high above the throne with a long robe looking almost like a sandworm



which i consider foreshadowing for what his desescdent would become…",2024-03-05 19:36:44
the people next to me definitely  in their breath and visibly reacted at that moment,2024-03-03 01:38:55
yeah scandinavians are weirdly quiet in movie theaters every time i’ve been there it’s nothing like that anywhere else you would hate movie theaters in india they throw  at the screen sometimes lol,2024-03-18 07:01:09
the planet they are in is called arrakis but it was called dune by the fremen before,2024-03-01 08:34:07
felt like he was talking to me during it like ok you know my deepest darkest secrets i yield,2024-03-01 09:46:00
i didnt love him in the first one but it really feels like he came alive this time,2024-03-01 14:39:22
same here dude found an intensity i didn’t think he could bring,2024-03-03 01:32:42
i was there it was me barry wait wrong series,2024-03-01 09:47:38
kneel before i start going through your browser history,2024-03-02 02:58:00
yeah i have to admit it was kinda silly how that played out but you gotta suspend disbelief for silly things like that sometimes ,2024-03-01 10:03:28
i wonder if dune had stuck to its original date would timmys wonka done its magic like going from an intimidating tim to a quirky and fun tim,2024-03-01 22:46:14
he went to dune to get spices for his chocolate factory,2024-03-02 02:42:25
yea im totally cool with the length of that if anything id want a tad more harkonnen shenanigans and maybe some paul learning the desert stuff centipede encounter,2024-03-03 03:55:31
kinda hard not to with unexpected worms and atomics,2024-03-06 05:07:17
i was a bit disappointed that they did show the sadukar getting defeated there was that main sadukar that talked in the first movie i wouldve loved to see him getting his comeuppance,2024-03-06 05:35:11
it’s like lotr gotta wait for the extended editions,2024-03-03 05:08:50
oh,2024-03-03 19:57:47
battles tend to end quickly with nukes involved,2024-03-10 14:11:38
denis admitted he filmed a dinner scene but has been big on talking how he doesnt like the idea of directors cuts and how a director should focus their efforts to provide a singular movie experience instead of splitting their time making multiple different versions of a film,2024-03-01 19:44:03
same man reading it in the current casts voices was so  good,2024-03-01 15:17:32
he’s said it’s a thing and was filmed i respect him not liking director’s cuts and that sort of thing but it’s absolutely crazy that we might never see that scene like one of the top scenes in the first book by far,2024-03-03 08:11:45
dinner scene in 1 and raban not earning the beast title in 2 are my only complaints about the movies just impossibly great movies and genius adaptions,2024-03-04 22:01:42
what dinner scene,2024-03-03 19:58:15
theres only like 25 seconds of build up,2024-03-03 21:16:11
the director seems to be against extended editions which is an absolute shame theres definitely a market for a longer dune version could easily push it as a rerelease,2024-03-01 15:18:03
like what i’m genuinely curious cause i want to watch them lol,2024-03-03 23:10:01
how was it in dolby vs imax id love to see it in 70mm at a real imax again but its an hour drive my  hurt after almost 3 hours of movie and 2 of driving i have a dolby locally,2024-03-03 22:06:14
me and the boys each chugged a beer in the parking lot before going in but i didnt get any drinks in the theater so we made it,2024-03-08 15:58:34
care to elaborate on pauls powers for someone who hasnt read the books,2024-04-05 06:47:03
i released my water after the movie ends stilgar didnt know,2024-03-15 05:03:23
yeah it works in the books because we know everyone’s internal monologue it’s like a form of inception when jessica uses it she makes them think they had the idea on their own it’s not a jedi mind trick i am happy about how the movie changed it for the medium though,2024-03-01 16:49:18
"i read the books too and what you say is true but how would you explain when people use the voice to force others to  themselves i doubt just saying the right words with the right pitch etc does the trick so they can use the voice to do nearly undetectable manipulations as you say but they also can flat out coerce people to do whatever even  themselves the bg even say in the books why they dont do such things they dont want to be conspicuous and raise any attention to themselves having this abilities even hawat had no idea and he could barely comprehend the power

appreciate your thoughts on this",2024-03-01 20:51:33
that’s actually one of the things i love about dune in general  for how trippy and weird it gets a lot of it is surprisingly grounded i like how the first book explains bene gesserit abilities that they’re not superpowers just natural human abilities taken to their extreme by discipline and selfawareness they’re not good fighters because they’re mutants with superhuman strength or speed but because they have an almost perfect understanding of body language and the selfcontrol to override panic and act deliberately and logically paul’s ascension into the kwisatz haderach is incredible precisely because his abilities are the first to transcend what a normal human could achieve,2024-03-02 16:36:11
such subtlety was on screen when lady fenring was with feyd,2024-03-07 21:51:38
its a little deeper than that  the complete understanding of ones body and mind down to the molecular level and the complete understanding of those you observe has something to do with it its more than mere suggestion but almost akin to you telling yourself what to do ,2024-03-02 18:54:02
the voice is basically nlp neurolinguisticprogramming,2024-03-23 01:47:13
"mrooooooooooooooow

a tip ya brought be to the wrong sietch 

mroooooooooooooooooow

yeah yeah save it for the maker",2024-03-01 03:54:16
 i thought you were joking but this is the actual answer  ,2024-03-01 06:53:36
no need to justify yourself so much because you’re right they ride them to exhaustion,2024-03-01 04:47:22
if i recall correctly the 1984 film did actually show this to a certain extent with multiple fremen running alongside the worm to get a ride but in that film the worms on the surface weren’t the high speed express trains they are in these films either,2024-03-09 23:12:17
there just wasnt time in this 3 hour film to add such a scene explaining this,2024-03-03 18:47:49
they ran with the basket like how paul did i guess i hope jessica got worm insurance,2024-03-03 03:03:22
id rather travel by siltstrider,2024-03-03 03:58:29
and none of them are holding any rope whatsoever they just chilling and enjoying the ride ,2024-03-01 06:25:01
i assume the first guy gets the worm under control and then drives it parallel to everyone else waiting at the top of a sand dune and everyone runs and jumps on,2024-03-02 08:51:05
"also do kids and old people just not travel at all

it’s a big enough pain to get my kids in the car to take a normal trip out somewhere i cant imagine if instead we had to climb sand dunes in blazing heat and jump onto a monstrous creature blasting around",2024-03-05 03:38:46
youre pretty much on point if tolkien wrote lord of the rings as an exercise in fantasy of linguistics frank herbert wrote dune as an exercise in ecology the books mention how the hooks act to irritate the scales of a sandworm the sandworm would rotate to keep the irritated scales at the top to keep them from being exposed to sand until the irritation was gone by manipulating those hooks the fremen steer the worms,2024-03-04 01:20:30
"there is a very very very similar line in monty pythons life of brian i wouldnt be surprised if villeneuve added it as a small reference to how hilariously dangerous religious fanaticism can be

",2024-03-03 13:46:32
because its funny,2024-03-04 22:07:40
for me it was due to him going from all business in dune part 1 to fanatical hypeman in dune part 2  it was comically jarring for me and my daughter to see this change in him,2024-03-11 17:24:10
did not know this oops i misunderstood,2024-03-01 05:56:56
she is intoxicating as rose the hat her aura is incredible in that one,2024-03-03 09:09:39
i would gladly let rebecca ferguson eat my fear until i pass away ,2024-03-03 17:14:27
she carries that show,2024-03-02 11:06:31
oooh ooowooooo,2024-03-03 23:36:50
i mean there is xenia onatopp hela and catherine tramell,2024-03-01 08:35:30
thanks that actually completely explained my question,2024-03-03 04:46:41
it’s a setting you can turn on to warn you if you’re in a loud environment,2024-03-04 01:02:13
phone calls,2024-03-04 08:27:06
hmm username does not check out ,2024-03-24 00:24:37
ha,2024-03-10 16:50:58
yes ive read them the fremen religion is very much influenced by islam but yeah of course theres a mix it talks about it in the appendices,2024-03-02 00:59:17
since dune takes place so far into the future theres been a lot of intermixing between different religions not just the abrahamic ones most fremen follow a religion called zensunni which is mostly sunni islam but heavily influenced by zen buddhism its mentioned a lot more in messiah and children,2024-03-03 09:02:26
i guess it tracks with the religion or at least the prophecy being manufactured religion by committee if you will,2024-03-05 20:36:54
yeah was strange to see if kind of switched to chani questioning it all instead of paul also i thought it was a little strange how jessica came off when saying his holy war like she was so down for all that genocide,2024-03-01 05:37:15
its why im so fascinated he rejected it but his son embraces it,2024-03-01 22:26:09
he thought he could avoid it that’s what’s so heartbreaking,2024-03-02 22:57:14
i mean not everything right he doesnt you know not start it,2024-03-01 07:29:31
which forces his son to become a worm,2024-03-06 05:08:10
wait he rejects the golden path what do you mean,2024-03-03 03:32:38
iirc chani is a bit upset but understands why it happens and she is comforted by lady jessica right at the end,2024-03-01 03:54:14
do you know so little of my son jessica whispered see that princess standing there so haughty and confident they say she has pretensions of a literary nature let us hope she finds solace in such things shell have little else a bitter laugh escaped jessica think on it chani that princess will have the name yet shell live as less than a concubine — never to know a moment of tenderness from the man to whom shes bound while we chani we who carry the name of concubine — history will call us wives”,2024-03-03 01:26:28
he makes it a lot clearer in the book that its a purely political thing iirc she will have nothing but my name or something like that,2024-03-01 07:44:34
in the miniseries chani is far more confident  then again she has known paul for much longer than in this movie,2024-03-01 05:00:17
chani is pretty much all in on him from the moment he kills jamis this version of chani was way better imo no one else was willing to call him out on his  at the end,2024-03-01 07:16:50
"others confirmed it with you but i always felt it was pretty heavily implied that its because chani loves paul and believes in him so much that she doesnt question anything he does

to me it was what dune was all about on a meta level how these powerful threads motivate people so much and how it can be used to direct massive groups in the same direction

i think the movie loses that because of chani being against paul and the belief in him but that doesnt hurt the movie that much",2024-03-01 10:40:13
paul basically tells her flatout that irulan aint getting any consummation its just a political marriage,2024-03-02 06:49:43
yea the way they adapted these characters had a very natural feel the books often have all the characters thinking on a 4d chess level but it loses that human element,2024-03-01 07:09:23
"it seemed to me like they were basically having chani give voice to paul’s inner monologues and express the discontent with what he’s doing after he goes all in on being the madhi

the way they ended it here compared to where they start in the book version of messiah is very interesting makes me wonder what denis has in mind for messiah he clearly wants to do it",2024-03-03 06:04:51
no shes fully aware that its a marriage of politics they already had a kid together and paul said straight up that he would never sire children with irulan,2024-03-03 02:45:41
chani at the end of the book was also dealing with the  of her and pauls infant child not too long ago and thus had more committment from and to him already had also been together for about 2 years by then too,2024-03-03 01:08:46
herbert’s take what take it’s not some event they’re both commenting on herbert created the story ,2024-03-02 05:37:59
yeah it’s perhaps the best change that the film made imo,2024-03-01 06:10:26
"she teaches him to be a fremen leads his forces is his companion and only true confidant ultimately chani is a supporting role but shes by no means unimportant  she doesnt have a super loud role but shes integral to the story 

i dont mind that they gave her more to do gotta justify grabbing zendaya if nothing else but im not a huge fan of the amount of time devoted to their romantic drama at the expense of exploring more of the political aspects of the universe",2024-03-04 03:04:12
"part 2 completes a lot of part 1 naturally and this is a prime example 

herbert has said the main villain is the system that forces you to be someone you dont want to be duke leto said you only need to be my son everything else secondary",2024-03-03 19:55:40
i misspoke as its been ages since i read the books  she doesnt receive the past reverend mothers but all the bene gesserit that were involved in breeding her effectively her whole ancestral line  the books go a lot deeper into it especially when alia gets more focus later on,2024-03-05 15:36:48
also pauls vision from the first movie where he is wearing the gold armor is reflected by chani in part two she ends a fight in the same heavy breathing pose,2024-03-10 05:16:35
its incredible when you consider fremen practice is to drain bodies of their water,2024-03-10 07:49:34
at this point paul is still reluctant to go full on prophet and   up they might have mentioned it its not a super important point though i guess,2024-03-01 18:44:11
i mean if your leader is able to literally see all the futures available as well as the past that would give your side a neigh insurmountable advantage paul could literally start calling up each guild and start listing off their dirty laundry and have them crippled internally before even firing a shot,2024-03-03 04:32:16
i was wondering if they make another one would it basically start right after this a new story between dune and children of dune,2024-03-03 00:57:25
"what about when he said to the emperor something like im sure the houses would be interested to know how you killed my family    
  
now hes just  it war is the only way",2024-03-03 21:33:55
"rock innate cooperative plants expansion pet safe file deliver rustic

 this post was mass deleted and anonymized with redact",2024-03-03 22:02:38
paul  it well do it live,2024-04-06 22:55:26
"some would argue that paul is vito corleone

",2024-03-01 04:31:01
"i also like how the sardaukar became almost a negligible afterthought after they were shown as a mighty force in the first movie  

the captain and the sardaukar guards venturing into the dust fog during the throne room attack just to disappear and for paul and his big fremen group to just walk through decisively along with paul just nonchalantly ordering his forces to  the sardaukar guarding the emperor before taking the prisoners",2024-03-01 06:12:03
petty revenge on the man who killed your father and entire family is petty,2024-03-01 06:28:21
yeah theyve pretty much created a monster as a result of all their schemes and implanted prophecies,2024-03-01 07:25:28
i didnt get as much a sense of that in the book so i dig that change makes more sense for what happens between books ,2024-03-01 05:55:26
hes gonna probably break the  great house system in the name of family daenerysstyle,2024-03-02 00:51:51
that was good  although the book only has the emperor for the ending i would have liked some more walken in this one,2024-03-02 14:42:00
petty,2024-03-02 12:19:25
what are the negative geopolitical consequences of killing the emperor doesn’ remove the threat of him usurping it back and secure his position more,2024-03-04 14:49:23
surprise anya taylor joy who i didnt know was going to be in this,2024-03-01 04:32:42
i think trying to implement the details in the book would have made the 3rd act too thick for the plot to come out cleaner at the end paul killing the barron felt extremely satisfying especially with how that room felt sardaukar are brought down a few notches and the barron before the emperor really showed power,2024-03-01 05:16:14
was cool just to see anya taylor joy if only for a minute,2024-03-01 04:19:50
i loved the change the fact that he killed the baron with a crysknife also meant revenge for the fremen  they had their messiah  their oppressor with their most holy weapon arrakis itself dealt the killing blow,2024-03-01 09:09:56
"reading about the role that alia plays in this scene from the book version it would be difficult to adapt that directly to the screen

this feels like a good change to me",2024-03-01 04:57:57
it compressed the timeline too much its a lot more reasonable that he took over as leader of the fremen in 3 years instead of less than 9 months,2024-03-01 05:02:06
alia is set up for dune messiah lots of stuff is actually just there for the continuation fenrig being pregnant and of course the holy war started on the great houses,2024-03-01 13:17:15
book purists are a pain in the  and dont grasp how film is a completely different medium so what works well in the book wont work on screen dune is my favourite book and im glad they didnt stick faithfully to how things played out in the book the only change ive decided i didnt like was the threat of atomics v the prespice mass to destroy the spice as the latter is a method only paul would have known out of the great houses but whatever maybe it was just not going to translate well on screen,2024-03-01 09:50:59
i loved how they handled alia in this you really feel like she is an abomination like the bene gesserit fear  it was always creepy when she communicates with jessica,2024-03-01 12:32:56
one thing from the book i do wish they kept was feyd trying to cheat in that final fight which i guess they kind of alluded to in the coliseum scene,2024-03-02 01:46:20
"my only thing about the alia stuff is i don’t think a blind audience would understand what’s going on with her at all lol

talking fetus ftw",2024-03-02 17:08:20
i’m one of those purists only because st alia of the knife is relevant in the later books but i agree for this film that change is better,2024-03-01 06:52:41
yeah hard to make a two yearold not look goofy on screen doing what alia did but having alia never be born really compressed the timeline a lot,2024-03-01 09:25:37
"some things will never seem realistic on film and start to lose credibility agreed for film
adaptation it had to be this way it’s the reason ender’s game can never be shown as it really was would not be believable on screen for those ages and circumstances",2024-03-02 06:42:55
i really hope an extended edition will come in the future knowing the books i felt they could have had an extra thirty minutes or more at the end,2024-03-01 06:45:15
"sometimes you have to make changes from the source material for it to work on screen see the baby in twlight

x200b

but also i cant even imagine how silly the mass battle would have looked with everyone fighting in slomo to deal with the saudukar shields",2024-03-02 09:16:24
"i figured the death of the baron being changed was a given with the prospect in the book just being awkward at best

what i didnt like was that the timeline around the change just makes everything feel too rushed paul spent a few years resisting the harkonnens before usurping the empire in the book and a lot of that sense of scale is lost when you try to fit it all in the period of jessicas pregnancy if they had infant alia running around but still have paul do the deed youd get the better of both worlds",2024-03-02 18:45:06
alia in the first book really didnt feel like a connected part of the story idk if herbert had planned out the sequels and put her in to set them up but i think it makes sense to remove the parts of the first book where alia was out the  still plenty of room to develop her if they make another movie and go for book 2,2024-03-01 21:57:43
i do think that was better for a movie adaptation but i can’t honestly say i didn’t wanna see a little genius alia running around causing a ruckus,2024-03-01 23:11:12
adding in alia wouldve added an extra hour or so to the movie also it wouldve looked goofy as ,2024-03-03 16:01:56
"i agree i think it was a good choice by denis  it was certainly one of the stranger parts of the book  though i think he could have done a better job displaying how the water of life transformed paul  in the book paul starts to have trouble distinguishing what is a vision of the future and what’s present

also i think denis did a better job developing the relationship between paul and chani",2024-03-05 05:02:48
"the film fixes so many loose ends of the book the fenring couple show up at the gladiator fight and then again at the end just to deny the emperors call for help until today i could never know lady fenring was actually doing something meaningful

and why the emperor shows up on arrakis i never figured why from the books and upon googling no one has this question",2024-03-01 16:48:25
"where where are these book purists who are mad about it 

nice straw there man but this entire thread is literally at most just people saying it’s an understandable change",2024-03-03 08:13:15
i have to lump myself in as one of those book purists the first student movie was practically shot for shot with the book and i went in expecting that for the second half,2024-03-01 15:35:15
well said  and in this half of the book every chapter seems to jump ahead in time so i was curious how they would handle that,2024-03-05 05:08:18
and they didnt even toy with the idea that rabban could put up a fight against him swift justice,2024-03-02 16:08:02
i think short of alia herself killing the baron having paul do it is the most powerful the narrative reason for the title alia of the blade will have to be written around either way might as well let paul avenge his father and establish his dominance more,2024-03-03 05:43:17
somehow i don’t think that actually happened,2024-03-01 05:01:30
no they didn’t,2024-03-01 04:54:35
this is the most cringe head canon i’ve read in awhile,2024-03-01 05:00:20
lol whats the point of getting on the internet and lying about something   90 of the people in your theater have never read the book,2024-03-01 05:07:11
100 no doubt in my mind this did not happen,2024-03-01 18:48:30
there’s a comment thread further up that i commented this under but this is a theme with paul that he wins by counterattack killing jamis baiting the ornithopter to fire at him so that chani can shoot it down letting feyd stab him so that he could use the knife for a killing blow there are probably more examples too and overall just attacking the baron  the emperor after being ambushed and cast out into the desert could arguably count,2024-03-06 09:25:28
im glad most of the movie is subtitled fremen or harkonnen language,2024-03-01 11:21:53
yes they do this is why i didnt watch it in imax the bass is overkill and not worth the extra screen,2024-03-01 05:50:00
yeah imax was way too loud i wish i had a dolby cinema near me or that i could just buy a 4k bluray day one,2024-03-01 21:38:32

not all sfx are foley but  whoever edited this film did an incredible job,2024-03-03 12:30:52
right  he was so great in lion playing a torn at warwithhimself character that i think he couldve pulled the paul role off,2024-03-01 07:06:35
maybe he can play leto ii,2024-03-01 20:52:41
i mean i’m not being hyperbolic i’ve been so so about his performances until now and i genuinely think this is best in his career so far,2024-03-13 11:53:39
i still need to see wonka waiting for it to hit steaming,2024-03-21 10:57:42
yeah,2024-03-19 09:49:04
the fade away cut to the same scene prophesied etched in stone in the reverend mothers chamber gave me chills,2024-03-01 15:34:10
according to villenue thats his favorite shot of the movie,2024-03-08 01:34:11
lol fair enough but after enough spice everyone forgets their spring break on arrakis,2024-03-02 04:47:53
funny you mention wakeboarding  when i was watching that scene i thought i bet they made timothy shalamar learn how to waterski to practice for this,2024-03-07 05:46:39
when paul was being carried by the sand it was heavily reminiscent of being flipped over in rapids and desperately trying to flip rightsideup before having to bail out,2024-03-05 19:16:47
totally  and i want to see how they get so many people and items on one of them at a time too like when jessica was on her voyage in the little tent its one thing for a dude to hop on and stick his hooks in real quick but its not like the worms pull up and stop like a train for boarding multiple peoplethings,2024-03-02 21:34:04
planning a rewatch with my dad in imax for this very reason trust me it deserves it,2024-03-01 03:38:47
no one makes grand scenes for imax like villeneuve  nolan it’s worth a repeat viewing,2024-03-01 05:01:21
just an excuse to see it again,2024-03-01 03:45:40
its worth rewatching in imax that worm ride scene was so intense my jeans were literally flapping from the bass,2024-03-01 16:29:48
if you can find a premium large format showing it is also worth it i honestly dont know that i wouldve wanted a bigger screen than that,2024-03-02 14:11:30
if you have a dolby cinema near you thats where its at,2024-03-03 14:43:01
beetlejuice 2 comes out this year too,2024-03-01 03:33:36
"the nuke explosion too was intense

i was less enthralled by being shook about during hand to hand combat i see what they are trying to achieve though",2024-03-11 15:48:20
i mean the book didn’t even do the final battle on dune justice i remember it being they attacked and all of a sudden paul one then for the holy war it just time skips and it’s like ya this is how many people died,2024-03-01 07:08:00
yeah frank wasnt exactly an action writer the final battle was like 1 chapter then it was over lol,2024-03-01 08:27:04
remindme 2 years,2024-03-08 01:02:29
"messiah is a great book of political scheming and intrigue could be done more as a thriller in some ways

also there is action but more in the way of putting down insurrections and dealing with some particular nukes not going to spoil it here",2024-03-01 12:07:44
yeah i just read messiah so im really wondering how its going to translate to the big screen esp after the first two blockbusters its more like early game of thrones,2024-03-03 09:57:58
thats exactly how it will go each house will have a visually distinct look and feel splice the action with ever more wheels within wheels and bring back box office favourite jason momoa as a ghola,2024-03-03 18:05:06
,2024-03-17 14:25:06
all harkonnen scenes had me like wait stuff can look like this ive been consuming scifi media for 20 years now but this was something completely new yes people made comparisions to ridley scott but ive never seen the giger influence look so monumental,2024-03-01 15:24:46
"in that instant paul saw how stilgar had been transformed from the fremen naib to a creature of the lisan algaib a receptacle for awe and obedience it was a lessening of the man and paul felt the ghostwind of the jihad in it i have seen a friend become a worshipper he thought    
    
final chapter of dune",2024-03-01 03:24:01
this is different paul is undoubtedly a  among man at that point his prescience is supernatural so stilgar’s fanaticism is kind of justified since this must be the wildest months in his life,2024-03-02 02:27:29
in order for arrakis to have water it needs to stop spice production water is toxic to the worms that create spice and if you’re gonna stop producing the single most crucial resource in the galaxy you’re gonna a need to smash some great houses heads,2024-03-02 18:12:20
i mean i guess it would make sense that the fremen can inherit the old atreides homeworld if all of that house is dead anyway which doesnt make sense unless literally everyone from that house abandoned the planet to go to arakis but we,2024-03-03 05:29:15
man thought he was a  mafia goon early on lol definitely got the most laughs from me,2024-03-01 03:43:42
"lol that dude submitted his entire tribe immediately to make sure paul doesnt speak another second more on those dreams 

you just know any of his political rivals were going  was that later on",2024-03-02 22:29:25

harkonnen ite domum,2024-03-13 04:09:00

"paul successfully ties his shoelaces

stilgar as was written",2024-03-05 20:59:08
none of that played funny to me  im surprised people find religious fervor as anything but horrifying,2024-03-03 13:38:55
"paul says that she will come back  presumably she comes around 

x200b

i think the change does a good job of externalizing pauls internal conflict which obviously doesnt come across as well in a movie vs a book and also helps to reinforce that paul isnt a good guy which lets be honest is needed in a mass market movie he isnt saving or helping the fremen he is leading them on a path to their own destruction",2024-03-04 07:19:12
yes if this change fundamentally changes messiah which i’m struggling to see how it can manage not to it’s not acceptable imo even if it’s good for zendaya and good for part 2 specifically,2024-03-03 08:27:14
exactly i think people saying they like movie chani havent read it or at least not past the first book i loved the movie 910 but the one issue i had was chanis character was way too different felt like villeneuve took it upon himself to make her this fierce warrior because its zendaya but left out most of the romance and the fact she always supported paul like the other commenter says fundamentally changes the story too much,2024-03-03 21:26:14
"yeah i think chani is the only one who rejects him in the end because she is the one who knows him the best and she doesnt like what hes becoming as a person 

she also very strongly believes that tying the fremen to a messiah is only going to be bad for her people and she repeatedly tells paul that worst of all he agrees with her and then essentially betrays her by going off and becoming that very messiah she thinks he wanted what was best for her people and he  on that completely",2024-03-04 01:44:27
"thats a fair interpretation and the moments where that comes out are her strongest scenes such as when she confronts jessica upon seeing paul in the coma but imo i felt on the whole that could have been emphasized more i also didnt really connect with their romance that much tbh  theyre together for a whole six months and half the time shes actively unhappy with what hes becoming so i wonder why theyre even together other than that the script demands it

as i was watching the movie chani came off more like a blatant 21st century audience surrogate to make sure everyone got the point of the movie",2024-03-04 00:06:39
literally one shotted,2024-03-02 02:31:23
i loved the buildup aswell throughout the film they just build up gurneys  for vengance they set up this epic clash only for him to just completely one shot rabban lol,2024-03-20 23:51:13
yes and what about him not experiencing the loss of his child that died during the harkonnen raid isnt that a major part of his character development in the books,2024-03-01 20:53:26
it’s possible they can explain it away by saying jessica delayed the birth herself especially because they were in the middle of war it would safer to keep baby inside the bene gesserit have total control of their bodies,2024-03-01 18:54:45
yeah i was really confused by that comment who said the child actor was the weakest part why,2024-03-03 23:30:34
this i mean she was just a kid maybe one of the last lines when she says daddy to ian it was like uh ok but i have known people whose child react with that little emotion sometimes so yeah it wasnt unbelievable lol,2024-03-03 02:52:05
i feel like the only way you could even think of something like that is if you’re specifically looking for some type of flaw in that movie,2024-03-14 05:17:56
personally i do not think alia from the 1984 movie worked very well and they were leary about that  i think you also bring up a good point,2024-03-01 15:31:45
"it was a 2 year timeskip and alia looked ridiculous in that movie

",2024-03-01 20:57:03
lyanna wasn’t a child with the intellect of an adult she was merely a child who had adult responsibilities she was also like 12 alia would need to be around 45 with the mind of an adult i just don’t see it translating well,2024-03-03 16:02:14
if you want to portray a character wise beyond their years casting someone who looks like a real life elf is a good choice,2024-03-01 13:40:21
the farther she goes with her plastic surgery the more it works for the character somehow it’s perfect,2024-03-01 07:15:11
plus she can lean into acting crazy as well shes going to nail that role in the next movie,2024-03-01 23:07:08
i mean in a weird way she still looks like she could be 12 so they went with an actress who could still pass off as somewhat young,2024-03-02 02:09:48
so the second coming of tilda swinton,2024-03-01 09:31:27
how are they going to make her ,2024-03-04 06:46:56
i mean in a family with oscar isaac timothee chalamet and rebecca ferguson thats pretty on brand,2024-03-04 07:07:49
did she also have some weird vfx hiccup on her left eye or like a clump of makeup or something was driving me crazy,2024-03-01 16:08:21
im honestly just stoked this looks like itll clear enough to get messiah greenlit there are some folks in for a lot of whiplash,2024-03-01 05:29:06
i figure that subplot is gonna be the first thing cut from messiah it was pretty shameless fanservice from herbert back then and its not really villeneuves style plus i dont think modern movie audiences like that trope all that much even superhero movies seem reluctant to use it,2024-03-01 07:05:35
yeah but they cant wait 20 years for the sequel villeneuve wants to do rendevouz with rama or another project before messiah to let chalamet age a bit but at the end of the day its got to be chalamet as paul and it has to be done within a few years that means you either get adult alia using some plot device or you do the events of messiah with alia as a child you have to change something,2024-03-01 04:56:27
atj is too white to play a fremen,2024-03-01 16:03:17
yeah i don’t even think denis could pull that off,2024-03-01 03:48:00
panos cosmatos is the answer,2024-03-01 04:03:06
i would love to see him try but sadly we know there is no way any studio would risk that,2024-03-01 03:59:50
youre in luck its happening first leaked image from villeneuves story board just dropped,2024-03-01 04:19:13
that would never translate into film but i still want it  it,2024-03-01 08:24:57
i think that film would absolutely bomb but itd be so funny to see how they tried to pull it off,2024-03-01 04:37:43
 all i wanted was a short sped up montage of paul going through the terrible futures and seeing that at the end of his journey him realizing that the pend of the golden path was becoming a  monster is what really shattered his soul and if were not going to get a full dune cinematic universe up through  emperor then i just want a single look at the worm,2024-03-03 02:49:47
 wouldnt that be a blast to watch,2024-03-01 05:08:27
ill cry if that ever gets a film adaptation absolutely one of my favorite books of all time,2024-03-01 18:36:00
 didnt think of that but youre right,2024-03-01 04:37:38
yeah thats a weird change it massively sped up the timeline where the book had time skips that helped pace the story it skipped all of pauls first kid and the whole alia storyline which in turn really made pauls rushing in to chug the waters of life feel like less of a fight,2024-03-03 02:53:41

which is going to be insane now ive seen this  i never trusted anybody to do rama that big 40km cylinder from the inside  its sounds unfilmable right  i cant wait",2024-03-01 18:28:10
fine by me let them take their time i expect good things,2024-03-01 11:54:12
"alia needs to grow up if they want anya taylorjoy to play her in messiah so the characters need to be pretty significantly aged up for it

they could just say that spice slows your aging but it would be a little weird if everyone else looked identical but alia is now an adult",2024-03-01 16:38:06
" letting paul visibly age before the next chapter works well for the story

paul is dosing spice which staves aging doesnt it",2024-03-03 04:06:22
if he does indeed do another movie in between i hope it is cleopatrahe would do an amazing job telling that story  i can only imagine,2024-03-01 18:20:21
i get that but his existence in the books spans like all of 1 page it’s basically “i had a kid now he’s dead”,2024-03-03 15:51:39

i haven’t read the books but i’ve seen people say messiah has a much thinner plot that could be covered in a single movie,2024-03-14 05:10:41
he may have been manipulated but was still a evil evil  with his own plans as well i think the pacing just didnt allow that sort of internal dialogue and exposition we get in the book that allows us to see the bigger picture and long term planning of the baron ,2024-03-01 20:32:57
he was imposing but lacked that other side to him that made him bore than just a movie bad guy,2024-03-02 08:05:42

yes thats my biggest pet peeve also the guildsmen telling shaddam that its nonnegotiable showing us that the emperors power has limits,2024-03-01 09:41:38
the guild missing is an oversight non readers may not understand whats the big deal with the spice i think it was referenced in part 1 but i feel that fact wasnt highlighted enough i liked the touch that they hinted at the  between the baron and feyd,2024-03-02 22:17:57
this is my biggest complaint when comparing it to the books im assuming they will have to do some more world building regarding the guild next movie though so it might be fine in the long run,2024-03-03 01:06:35
i think they are just saving it as exposé for now and are are going to pick it up as they extend out the duniverse in the next one it’s too potentially weird and visual for denis to just pass up,2024-03-06 07:27:47
"it definitely lost a bit of complexity from the book 

i did like though that there was utterly no illusion what so ever that as soon as paul has the water of life he is going to absolutely roll everyone to pieces

even his “struggle” against bold feyd was a ploy to make chani sympathetic",2024-03-02 02:35:35
"i liked a lot of the changes especially to chani and irulan not so much to jessica and stilgar but i get it but i envy my friends who havent read the book yet

its turning me into the dune equivalent of one of those weirdos who feels the need to tell everyone about tom bombadil lol",2024-03-01 08:26:24
"this is me i finished the book for the first time a few days ago and while the movie was visually breathtaking and i did appreciate some of the deviations i felt like there was a lot missing 

the exchanges between thufir and the baron were some of my favorite parts of the second half of the book so i was bummed that they cut those scenes 

i plan on seeing it again in a few weeks with hopefully a fresher perspective because i wanted to like it more than i actually did",2024-03-01 16:19:44
i want to say paul used the same move gurney pulled on him in part 1 paul had him at the throat feyd in the final fight and gurney had him in the gut paul’s final stab,2024-03-01 03:56:04
i thought it was a great way to illustrate he was also a “prospect” for being the kisawtz haderach the movie didn’t have much time to dedicate to showing us his parallels to paul so that little change did some heavy lifting,2024-03-03 05:00:35
you can say he only let himself be struck because he know he had a shield he likes to do a little trolling,2024-03-02 00:55:54
"i felt exactly the same i couldnt fully enjoy the end fight with him and paul because there was nothing to suggest to the viewer that he was as good a fighter and more so with the third atreides almost killing him like you said although you could argue that feydrautha was perhaps not taking it as seriously up until that point due to thinking theyre all drugged

whereas pauls had training from duncan and gurney with duncan being one of the best as well as killing jamis whos considered a really good fremen warrior

im disregarding anything in the actual book just taking it solely from the movies",2024-03-01 23:35:37
he never really wanted to send the galaxy into a decade long war that would destroy entire planets he was hoping that his ascendancy would be legitimized by the great houses and that bloodshed wouldn’t be necessary,2024-03-02 04:38:58
he loved it in the moment because it fueled his adrenaline after cooling off he was  at his uncle but that’s because he wasn’t prepared for it and i think anger is just the harkonnen form of fear,2024-03-01 04:43:34
"yeah it was supposed to be a hawat scheme but im guessing that got cut pretty late and obviously the arena is a huge set piece so you cant really work around that

i like their fix being baron you set me up you

"yes i believe it was harkonnen gladiatorial tradition to fight with two blades a pure black blade and a poisoned white blade however feyd added poison to the black blade to give him an edge there was a lot behind the scenes of that fight in the books that is lost due to the lack of hawat  


anyways unlike the movie honor is not very important to feyd in the book",2024-03-14 23:39:17
gurney wouldve been like am i a joke to you,2024-03-01 07:45:40
im glad feyd didnt have a poisoned barb on him,2024-03-02 07:28:50

one of the most scenes of history of films recent,2024-03-01 04:26:16
i did notice the second time i watched the first film that the harkonnen and raban really weren’t great warriors they have characteristics of a warrior class and maybe gurney’s warning of them being “brutal” may have been misunderstood as being vicious warriors when in reality he was probably describing their underlying lifestyle and maybe lack the resolve to be a truly elite fighting group such as the atreides were none of them except feyd actually showed much fighting prowess as i think back,2024-03-02 06:58:57
dont forget the batman,2024-03-01 11:42:01
in the book there’s a line that’s essentially “my name is a weapon” and for whatever reason lynch decided that meant a gun that fired whenever he said his name,2024-03-01 15:43:24
"because it would have been too expensive to showcase the fremen as superior handtohand fighters back in those days so the atreides weirding way turned into weirding modules its dumb but on the other hand i loved paul saying my name has become a killing word which for me really jives with the whole uncontrollable jihad thing

the current movies pretty much threw away the whole weirding way thing which is a bit of a disappointment to me theres a reason the atreides and fremen were courting each other and looking for an alliance the fremen were already a super people in terms of fighting ability and the weirding way would have boosted them to being overwhelmingly powerful theres a reason millions of fremen could result in the destruction and dominance of billions",2024-03-01 22:33:30
"he says hes not the mahdi which is exactly what the mahdi would say

javier bardem has played some amazing roles but to watch his curiosity turn to excitement and then fanaticism as the prophecy came true was truly something definitely my favorite performance of his",2024-03-01 03:34:00

the shock that he did it and the fear of what that means",2024-03-01 03:54:58
oh  that makes it more satisfying to see reverend mother tremble after everything she did lady jessica gets the last laugh,2024-03-01 03:35:46
"well thats interesting to know i had to watch the movie with german dub wanted to see it on the biggest screen possible and the reverent mother in that scene basically whispers ungeheuerlich which translates to outrageous or maybe monstrous ungeheuerlich is such an old rarely used and dramatic word though that her reaction basically got the biggest laughs of the whole movie

seems like that scene wasnt intended to be funny",2024-03-01 08:35:05
and feyds reaction chefs kiss what a scene was waiting for that one pauls battle naming and the worm invasion,2024-03-03 03:52:32
is that what she said i couldnt make it out,2024-03-01 03:43:21
this confused me because jessica was a reverend mother as well right there are multiple for each housetribe,2024-03-17 19:01:39

i know ive still never seen the original outside the cinema i feel it just wouldnt have the impact,2024-03-05 07:45:23
"i feel like hes going to absolutely dominate the screen for messiah when the time comes

messiah spoilers particularly the scene where blind paul walks into a council meeting and starts telling everyone what theyre wearing and doing proving he can still see them using prescience then accusing people of being traitors chalamet has done a great job of portraying the angry and powerful side of paul",2024-03-01 03:47:55
agreed a charmer before he takes the water an absolute nightmare afterwards  i hope we get to see him go full villain in messiah  start with the holy war  it,2024-03-01 03:41:39
you should check him out in netflix’s film “the king” it’s not historically accurate at all but timothee plays his role so well and it’s the movie that made me root for him as paul,2024-03-01 03:56:32
" granted thats a bit by design

literally thats called a character arc lol",2024-03-01 08:32:01
lets play casting whatifs which young actor do we have today that villanueve couldve cast in the paul role that can theoretically achieve the same magnetism and presence he was able to achieve in the third part of the movie  i thought dev patel maybe couldve worked but other than him who else is out there,2024-03-01 06:39:11
i wasnt impressed with him in wonka but he went all in here and it was awesome he definitely has the acting chops contrary to popular opinion,2024-03-01 04:52:08
same feelings but  did he pull it off here,2024-03-03 02:38:38
but hes not a false prophet is he he has supernatural abilities and a he leads them to victory over the emperor himself whats false,2024-03-01 08:13:04
"i agree i can see austin butler and rebecca ferguson both running strong campaigns for supporting nominations as well although i think the only above the line award it has a chance of winning is best picture

like the first i also think it’ll be nominated in most technical categories and i reckon it’ll win a fair few of these as well",2024-03-01 07:25:06
oh yes he was stellar in the king,2024-03-01 10:23:24
the fact that this had walken pugh and chalamet was huge any one of them would get me to see anything let alone all three,2024-03-01 03:37:22
pattinson is like 10 years older than chalamet i think of them as different generations  though this could just be because pattinson is older than me and i had a crush on him when i was a teenager and chalamet is younger than me haha,2024-03-01 12:12:32
i think i saw it in his most recent interview on youtube if i’m remembering correctly  i also have a book on the way about how the movie was made i think it’s from the legendary shop i want the bookends so bad too lol,2024-03-10 14:15:35
thankfully youtube is a great resource for this kind of stuff i dont have any links on me at the moment but there are a few good behind the scenes videos for dune 2 out there,2024-04-01 04:27:15
 no way that holds a candle to dune 2 come on,2024-03-03 04:50:20
from what i heard villeneuve doesnt like doing that or released deleted scenes but we can hope,2024-03-02 21:29:07
nope dv doesnt do that,2024-03-03 19:07:05
denis sadly doesnt do these,2024-03-03 21:23:04
they probably were forced to cut half an hour of material film studios are petrified of their main films being longer than 3 hours for some reason so many epic blockbusters are around 2hr 40min for that reason,2024-03-07 03:25:02
i wasnt talking about the battle at all after he drank the water of life it moved in time so quickly no setup for the fight barely anything to get the army together suddenly they are back in the north and planning a massive battle the entire 3rd act was rushed not the battle,2024-03-10 18:56:53
making it a better movie doesnt make it a required need,2024-03-02 12:37:24
how would you know if it hadn’t,2024-03-03 00:49:42
"plus it goes to what she says about the prophecy being used to enslave them they liberated their planet  but not themselves instead believing paul to be their messiah they are all turned into fanatics who willingly follow his mandate yet with the harkonnens they at least could see how they were being exploited

it’s poignant that the last we see of the fremen is them rushing to ships to spread a holy war against the galaxy literally immediately after they’re finally liberated their own home 

only chani walks back to the desert so many died to free",2024-03-04 22:11:31

neo revives her in 2 she revives neo in 1 but yeah the first matrix is very similar to dune,2024-03-05 23:31:57
a lot of strategic cuts like showing the start of slashing attacks  the outcome but mostly cutting away from the point of impact unless it was critical for the scene,2024-03-01 16:28:47
same that or wb have gotten really good at bribing the censors lol,2024-03-01 15:25:15
really wish it was rated r but this felt like it was filmed as if it was rated r but some sneaky camera cuts to not show too much gore let them keep it pg13 obviously i get why he had to make it pg13 but i wouldve just liked a raw viewing that didnt hold back,2024-03-03 05:54:46
i don’t know about that i feel like this movie was so bloodless to the point it was kinda distracting,2024-03-15 15:52:51
no the answer is no i’d also argue he’s never made a bad movie,2024-03-01 16:01:35
does enemy count for purposefully being aesthetically displeasing and distressing to look at,2024-03-02 23:57:27
unfortunate consequence of filming a 2hr flick lighting would probably be a massive nightmare ,2024-03-02 22:22:46
paul having absolutely life changing vision brain melting experience,2024-03-02 10:23:57
yea honestly it was more refreshing to me to see a realistic final battle if the fremen are seriously better fighters no need for the bs dramatic nonstop fighting for the sake of making it exciting for the viewer it went swift because the harkonen were simply outmatched at all levels and when that happens in the real world it goes quick,2024-03-03 05:56:36
oh i never read the book so i felt like the movie didn’t do a good job connecting a lot of the scenes together characters felt like they were teleporting from 1 location to another this is prob one of those movies which would benefit to be 3 hours long rather than 2 and a half hours,2024-03-01 14:59:26
indifference to the art of story telling lol,2024-03-13 12:38:09
when the first one came out i wasn’t regularly going to the movies like i am now and i didn’t feel like looking for a way to watch it,2024-03-10 17:48:41
abomination,2024-03-06 04:13:41
i see what you did there,2024-03-01 14:28:29
is it too slow or is it too fast,2024-03-03 06:10:49
arent all movies a little worse without jk simmons playing jjj,2024-03-01 03:53:18
turning red is pretty good,2024-03-01 03:50:52
i liked argylle too  i got exactly what i wanted out of that movie  and drive away dolls was funny and like you said a good time  madame web was bafflingly bad  dune part 2 is a masterpiece and will probably be one of the best major releases if not the best we get this year,2024-03-01 04:53:16
argyle was great people just apparently cant have mindless fun anymore lol,2024-03-01 04:21:22
it doesn’t utilize the format in any special way  there are barely any action sequences and the ones we get are boring  there are no interesting locations  no expanded ratio scenes  just blah,2024-03-01 17:57:42
definately they are highly technically proficient and they have been smugglers of spice for hundreds of years,2024-03-06 04:28:26
spice is apparently a hair product,2024-03-01 09:01:00
yeah with everything going on i kinda zoned out on the timeline aspect and then we got close to the end and i had a moment of like wait wheres the creepy babyhow long has it beenit just doesnt make sense for it to happen in 9 months but it doesnt take anything away from it for me especially since they incorporated alia as a character through jessica so shes still a presence,2024-03-01 06:01:08
it made me want to rewatch lawrence of arabia which is incredibly high praise,2024-03-01 16:47:04
honestly want to go again but it really needs to be seen on imax and i cant afford to watch it twice on imax in the span of two days lol,2024-03-01 11:02:40
i didnt mean it negatively i honestly thought this movie was unlike any normal movie ive seen hence why i said its like oscar bait like i said i loved the movie and i cant wait to see denis part 3,2024-03-03 12:05:20
i see i misspoke from the amount of people busting my balls about my word choice i said oscar bait with much reverence i assure you im not saying it sucks im trying to say that its shot unlike any normal movie like its an elevated form of cinema and that i loved that denis poured so much of his heart and soul into this movie i hope this clears it up,2024-03-03 12:03:54
luckily villenueve clearly understands the source material with these adaptations i think hes done a phenomenal job of sewing the seeds for messiah,2024-03-01 05:54:54
i just remember it cuz it was in the trailer for both movies haha and the cgi was a bit lacking in the part 1 rendition,2024-03-04 07:06:50
same,2024-03-03 07:11:25
one of my screenings of oppenheimer had a bug crawling on the lens or something was very odd lol,2024-03-01 23:59:26
"it wasnt really left out imo in his conversation with lady jessica after he drank the worm juice paul said that the only future where he and the fremen would win was one where he became a harkonnen it could be interpreted that paul had to abandon his compassion embrace his messianic destiny and fullon conquer the empire using the fremen as his tools in order to save them


 up that the fremens fate is ultimately to be religious pawns but i guess for the moment before the holy war that its better than if feyd had come to power and wiped them off arrakis entirely",2024-03-02 09:03:09
they didnt really leave that out he actually says he can see one path he just doesnt explicitly state thats what it is,2024-03-03 08:03:56
"most of the doubts in the book come from pauls internal monologue and that doesnt really work in a movie unless you do the voice overs lynch used

it makes sense to give that to chani and make her the voice of reason in order to tell the story of this movie but yes itll be weird to set things in place for messiah",2024-03-01 06:52:51
yeah i wonder where they go with her now i love what they did with her easily one of the biggest upgrades from the books — but you think back to that future vision in part 1 where she’s alongside jihad paul in that ship above caladan looking highly complicit — and you wonder how she gets there from here,2024-03-01 07:38:52
explain something to me please no spoilers bc i didn’t read the books did part 2 end in the same place as the first book,2024-03-02 05:19:01
honestly we thought zendaya was kinda meh too seems like she only has two  expressions bored and angry,2024-03-06 15:21:17
they didnt give her much,2024-03-19 21:39:06
and a hot one too,2024-03-02 16:41:12
if you watch euphoria youd see what all the hype is about,2024-03-02 02:03:16
"have you seen euphoria particularly the episodes where she does most acting because ive seen lots of people saying she cant act or be surprised that she can act and i wonder if they saw those episodes i dont know her in much else but i didnt doubt her as an actor for dune at all 

i think the same thing about chalamet and the king people were so surprised he could pull off paul of part two but he played a very convincing henry v and that was years ago i think many people only know him from call me by your name or summer nights etc",2024-03-01 23:42:40
indeed same here but i hope she still plays chani long into the future,2024-03-01 05:43:10
villeneuves talent seems to be his ability to do adaptations really well amongst other things obviously but he somehow pays incredible respect to the source all the while putting his own spins  tweaks on it to make it a better movie going experience books are not films and he seems to understand that better than any director working today he’s only getting better too,2024-03-02 06:26:50
stand or name your champion,2024-03-02 10:36:35
the movie was visually spectacular and was like reading cliff notes,2024-03-01 05:04:52
in the book its meant to mirror the relationship of duke leto to lady jessica concubine in name but for all intents and purposes lady jessica was letos wife paul tells chani explicitly that irulan will have his name in a political marriage and nothing else chani is the one who will have his love his desire and his children,2024-03-01 12:59:49
im just glad they actually let her be more upset in the book its like shes just kinda put off by it until jessica cheers her up i kinda feel like thats because it was written in the 60s and its probably a leftover thing of that time but i really prefer the movie take,2024-03-01 08:19:13
" nah youre going to be his consort

consort implies wifequeen i think your looking for mistressconcubine",2024-03-04 15:43:29
jessica was letos consort it is not that big of a deal in this realitykinda like france lol,2024-03-06 04:33:46
also like isn’t this the first time he’s met the poor girl and he’s like yo i’m gonna marry you now,2024-03-07 10:55:54
ummmm is future dune plot points allowed here,2024-03-01 08:26:52
i believe he says she will understand eventually not come around,2024-03-06 04:36:31
definitely this sure chani being upset about paul entering a political marriage with irulan is part of it but she moreso seems upset that she feels like paul lied to her he kept saying over and over that he didn’t consider himself their messiah and that he believed that the fremen should be liberated and led by one of their own then as soon as they head south he starts proclaiming himself to be space jesus and using her people as pawns in his wider goal of revenge it honestly feels more realistic and human for chani to feel betrayed than her just going along with paul with seemingly no reservations except for internal ones,2024-03-01 23:08:40
"it also haunts her that she doesn’t know what came back from the dead if it still is paul or some eldritch horror 

because it kind of is",2024-03-02 02:42:15
i dont entirely disagree but counter point if he is truly seeking the best path could that not also include the fremen even if they suffer losses in a war would they have been better off not rising up against the harkkonnens,2024-03-05 05:03:10
this was my question as well…,2024-03-02 16:50:22
yeah that was the only detail of the movie that really had me scratching my head so is he going up into space with the marriage agreed to orrr,2024-03-11 18:42:06
"i saw it less as pursuing revenge and more as leading the fremen to their goal of liberation from foreign powers

the revenge was just a bonus since it involved killing the harkonens",2024-03-02 02:26:51
“chani my mother’s way of doing things is over it’s finished even she knows that i mean in five years the fremen fundamentalists are going to be completely secular trust me”,2024-03-06 07:33:28
when the trailers came out it was incredibly common for people to dunk on how they thought her performance would be so happy how great she ended up being,2024-03-01 16:50:23
yep i agree i didnt really notice it the first time i watched the first part but i watched it with a mate last night and he said why do they all talk with an accent and then she just sounds straight up american hes not even a movie buff or someone whos critical of movies and it even pulled him out of it,2024-03-03 02:44:37
completely agree shes great at  expressions but her voice acting needs work she sounds the same in every role imho,2024-03-04 04:50:04
"	she’s the weaker actor of the cast

man hard disagree lol",2024-03-03 22:48:00
i havent read the books and im just a little confused at this point what is pauls actual motivation at this point he killed baron harkonnen and dethroned the emperor so hes gotten his revenge for what happens to his father but if he doesnt actually care about terraforming arrakis then what is his motivation for launching a jihad to conquer the universe i thought he wasnt power hungry and didnt want to rule so whats the deal now,2024-03-02 08:17:19
not sure who to root for when it was tyrant vs tyrant in the final fight perhaps paul wanted to  them both so this whole charade ends but then his muadilb side took over ,2024-03-02 02:44:04
"i havent read the book but chani mentions her fremen name to be desert spring after the prophecy which she hates and the prophecy states that the messiah will be reborn after drinking tears from the dessert spring

meaning she was both named after the prophecy and then made to play her part in the prophecy which she explicitly does not believe in",2024-03-01 14:00:26
wasn’t her desert name something like “girl with prophetreviving tears” i’m exaggerating a little,2024-03-01 13:13:04
yeah but my home tv cant vibrate my bones like the sound system in a theatre,2024-03-01 23:16:50
i agree a lot was conveyed visually its not a dealbreaker or anything and i get it must appeal to a broad audience but it did stick out a few times its however a common issue you often see in movies so maybe its a tad unfair to single out this specific movie,2024-03-05 08:48:22
even more reason he is the lisan  al gaib,2024-03-06 16:12:48
yup,2024-03-04 02:46:26
nah man love me some oppenheimer but band for band denis and dune 2 takes the cake this time,2024-03-06 15:30:24
"we feel like we want his revenge but then we want him to chill

you described my feelings to a t at first i was like yeah  them up but that transitioned more to alright hes becoming space  now maybe pump the brakes a bit even though i know thats how its supposed to go",2024-03-08 11:27:06
dune is one of those classics you dont need to read to be influenced by much like lord of the rings he may never have heard of paul but that doesnt necessarily means eren isnt based on characters that are clones of him,2024-03-31 01:48:05
austin butler  voice impressions,2024-03-01 03:21:34
havent seen anyone talking about him but i thought dave bautista did a really good job as rabban he would flip from vapid looks of stupidity to fits of rage and then intense fear  i really enjoyed his portrayal,2024-03-01 13:46:48
thats every book let me describe this soup and then oh the entire ending is three lines,2024-03-01 13:56:16
odd pace sure but its very deliberate the book is written in a way where the pace goes very slow  slow  getting there  fast  very fast  lightspeed,2024-03-02 07:17:42
"and then a 5 year time skip 

dune is bizarre cant describe as an enjoyable read but its different ill give it that",2024-03-02 10:42:54
"i think its just more that herbert was not really all that interested in battle scenes that were there just for the sake of it he basically has all the big action happen off screen we dont actually see the sardaukar rip apart the atreidas forces we just see leto getting wasted and pauls escape we dont see most of the big fremen war with house harkonnen we get like one big moment and get told about another 

the only real fights are paul training with gurney paul vs jamis and paul vs feyd all are one on one single blade duels that are more about getting in the head of the protagonist",2024-03-01 21:53:39
or like aliens,2024-03-01 11:39:23
"should have been 2ne and twosters

these are the real missed opportunities here",2024-03-02 10:54:49
fair,2024-03-01 14:10:45
you paid to see it ,2024-03-04 00:51:00
thinking on it just feelsi dont know its easy to see the bene gesserit as being villains but i always felt like that oversimplified them,2024-03-27 16:06:37
blame 10000 year old legacy code,2024-03-14 07:28:00
yeah feyd’s importance is there but the movie maybe moved through it too quickly if he hadn’t smoked out the fremen from all their northern bases paul could have taken his time and utilised the atomic bombs using just his northern resources but feyd threw his plan into chaos he needed the southern fundamentalists then and more importantly he needed a way to see through the chaos rather than just diving in head first on plans that other people came up with feyd really forced paul onto the path of lisan al gaib,2024-03-06 09:31:46
thanks for answering me that makes sense,2024-03-01 20:11:55
a great explanation thank you,2024-03-04 07:11:57
i wondered at that,2024-03-01 18:29:37
yeah paul wouldnt have fought him if he was gonna lose its funny that gurney says why is he taking risks cuz like hes literally not,2024-03-05 03:19:03
"the baron is wellestablished in the books as a prolific pansexual  with a preference for boys in particular but   anything that has a hole for it

hes really quite an abysmally vile character the movies did well in establishing that in a visual sense at least though it would be hard to justify much less film an exposition about how hes a   on top of everything else",2024-03-03 05:01:58
you think that slug would find a willing mate,2024-03-02 03:57:13
who said it was the baron doing the ,2024-03-02 04:54:47
its a little too close to the kind of make the universe small thinking that led to c3po being built by darth vader for my liking,2024-03-01 22:39:02
"thats one way to look at it but paul is more than that which is why theyre afraid of him 

paul can literally see the future and influence it in real time he has godlike powers that ultimately trap him his family and all of humanty into following the golden path",2024-03-03 20:44:24
i agreed with most of the changes he made from the book a couple i didnt care for as much but he absolutely got the spirit and main  of the story across as well as more subplots than i wouldve expected,2024-03-01 03:16:51
"audio was really nice the seat subwoofers were vibrating so strongly for the sandworm scenes 

felt a lot less immersive than 143 imax though",2024-03-01 08:49:17
i’m fine they cut the stuff with jamis’ family in the grand scheme of things i didn’t think it was very important for the limitations of the film the “i was a friend of jamis” moment i thought was crucial to paul’s character especially because of how jamis is utilized in the first film,2024-03-01 05:18:05
"yeah but the movie is already almost 3 hours long and its not like theres much in it that is useless im not sure they could add all that was cut alia isnt cut either shes just changed to just be in foetus form which may work better visually than the weird adult psycopath baby

the mentats and the guild are also completely forgotten in this second part",2024-03-01 08:54:15
there’s definitely aspects you could play to for action with the face dancer stone burner alia and eventual weird  child vision if i recall jessica is non existent in messiah i’m also curious to see how chani plays out with how part 2 ended and how messiah she’s on board with paul and is being poisoned within his knowledge also robot eyes ghola jason momoa and finally some guild navigators either way i’m psyched as ,2024-03-02 00:15:59
the scene where he walks into the circle and takes the reigns of the fremen is a personality change to me,2024-03-03 12:10:05
the final fight is supposed to be over quickly he had one moment to swiftly overpower the emperors forces while he was on arrakis before he could escape into orbit up until this point only the emperor and some of his forces even understand that the fremen are a threat but even they are nowhere near prepared for the sheer power on display and are shockingly overwhelmed in like 3 pages the entire build up and pay off is supposed to be about his rise to a religious messiah and the jihad in his name a path he willingly took in order to get revenge,2024-03-03 06:05:27
"i hardly noticed it in part 2 only in the very beginning which was the shakiest part of the film feyd did add a new dynamic yes he was still a murderous psycho but at least he had a certain sinister more calculating effect to him not like rabban who is just a screaming angry idiot 

i actually agree with chani’s friend stealing those scenes  she was great but i still found that chani grew into a much more interesting character being the only one that sees what’s actually going on her acting when paul wakes up from the dead and in the final scene after the duel was absolutely perfect

i don’t agree on the characters at all leto atreides is up there sure but duncan he was just jason momoa in the dune universe irulan feyd margot and even jessica’s unborn child anya taylorjoy were all wayy more interesting new characters to me",2024-03-02 21:24:08
wellllllll lets just say when paul mentioned enemies earlier i would stress the s in enemies when it comes to keeping humanity alive regardless of whether you think the prequel novels are canon or not maybe paul gets a pass but leto knows whats up,2024-03-12 15:37:07
ah fair enough,2024-03-01 04:32:09
"yes but there was also the bit where leto suspected there was a spy thufir suspected jessica and leto went along with it even though he trusted her to try and root out the real spy 

he only told paul that he knew she was innocent so it contributed to gurney thinking it was jessica who betrayed leto and jessica thought leto had died thinking she had betrayed him it wasnt until paul reunited with gurney that gurney found out she was innocent and thufir finds out at the very end",2024-03-01 23:05:59
james cameron was the best canadian director of the 20th century  everything hes done since the turn of the millennium has been way too masturbatory in nature  villeneuve is the greatest canadian director of the 21st centuryso far,2024-03-03 03:02:34
there are also plenty of real world cultures which have been similar to that or just had similar levels of respect for human life,2024-03-06 13:34:55
i couldnt connect to either the pro or the antagonist even serial killers have some motives not just random stabbing two people around them,2024-03-06 13:38:39
anton had a clear goal and was willing to  anyone to get it  what was the goal of this antagonist and how did randomly stabbing two people around him help him achieve it ,2024-03-06 13:41:16
i wonder if theyll get him or a younger actor,2024-03-01 20:04:14
well i agree that the beginning scene was great and i was pleased with that portrayal of the harkonnens aside from the coliseum scene i felt everything else of them was not up to par yelling and countless killing their underlings at every obstacle maybe thats appropriate harkonnen behavior  but i felt part one did a much better job of conveying their brutality,2024-03-02 17:48:37
but paul is a play on the white savior hes directly influenced by lawrence of arabia the pivotal white savior dune is about how harmful such am idea can be and how dangerous it is to expect the world out of one person that was always in the books,2024-03-02 22:25:32
thats a fair point but why blinded by faith the prophecy proved true he is the one its not faith at that point its reality and so definitely not blinded if anything chani is the one choosing to remain blind i havent read the books but in the world of dune after the second movie the fanatics are those who dont believe,2024-03-05 17:21:06
no i meant walken is one of the gripes only stilgar is the comic relief unclear phrasing from me ,2024-03-05 10:17:03
i can definitely see that i never found their pushing of the pace to be very jarring but i definitely noticed it i’ll be doing my part as well they better make that  movie,2024-03-01 05:18:18
the third film is messiah the first book is over we aren’t getting directors cuts ever he is on record saying the theatrical cut is the directors cut,2024-03-01 05:45:17
the one i remember was paul getting prepped by stilgar to go off into the desert on his own we see paul walk off by himself and then the next cut is chani talking to him so it seems like she wanted to pass on a few words to him before he goes off on his own then the next scene is him back at the camp having finished the outpost,2024-03-01 12:31:30
she had a bunch of people on her uber worm so im assuming she dropped them off somewhere else and when paul goes into drink the poison and falls ill someone i cant remember who tells someone else to find her,2024-03-01 14:04:38
"they were moved to arrakis when house atreides moved from caladan the harkonens searched for them when they took over but couldn’t find where they were hidden 

in the books there’s “the great convention” which was a historic treaty brokered between the great houses the spacing guild and the imperium shortly after the destruction of the thinking machines in a great war over  10000 years ago called the butlerian jihad it specifically prohibited the use of atomics against human targets the great war is also why there are now no computers or robots in dune all great houses keep a nuclear arsenal for self defense i think in the books somewhere it specifically mentions defense in case there is ever an invasion from an advanced hostile alien species so atomics can be used against machines and aliens there has never been any contact with alien life in dune it’s just a precaution 

paul states in the book “the language of the great convention is clear enough use of atomics against humans shall be cause for planetary obliteration” 

paul only uses the atomics to destroy the shield wall to allow the storm into the city and send the worms into a frenzy he doesn’t directly use them against the people this is extremely controversial with the other houses but it comes down to politics and the fact that paul has so much power at the moment that no other houses can do anything to stop him and since atomics haven’t been used in thousands of years it helps paul’s threat to destroy the spice if the great houses attack at the end hold more weight that he would actually do something crazy like destroying the spice",2024-03-03 20:27:57
"not to mention the whole religion spread by the sword and we must convert the non believers starting with the fearful could be applied to any religious dogma but it takes root best in uneducated populations

everyone keeps saying paul is space jesus when its more accurate that hes space muhammed at least his love interest is above 9 years of age",2024-03-01 11:58:27

"brains really are a nuisance yeah i wouldnt dare imagine what my mind on spice would do itd be horrible
i think theres no reason to be embarrassed quite the opposite but i totally get it",2024-03-04 21:13:36
yeah cutting her makes the movie work a  of alot better on the serious side even if crunching the timeline is tough,2024-03-05 01:27:33
noit isn’t and wasn’t don’t be loud and wrong,2024-03-10 20:05:41
eh…,2024-03-24 13:16:46
something for everyone i guess ,2024-03-01 22:46:10
he’s literally said he wants to make messiah no idea what to tell you lol,2024-03-01 06:01:55
thanks i didn’t know that,2024-03-01 20:13:08
great idea what was in the gummy thc would have made the experience so much better,2024-03-05 20:06:27
awesome,2024-03-04 23:27:42
read that in his voice,2024-03-04 03:05:41
yes exactly thats what makes this movie so interesting a lot of the problems are found directly in the novels this is one area where i actually think the movie has done pretty well the harkonmen soldiers and normal people feel like well people we see one guy throw up we see them stammer and be afraid it works wonderfully to remind you that these are ultimately normal people,2024-03-27 16:42:32
"its the best scifi there is homie 

pauls story is just one of many the whole story spans tens of thousands of years",2024-03-03 07:14:08
how about the audio books,2024-03-03 08:08:31
i want to as well i saw it at pacific science center imax which is for sure the superior video but cinerama has a more advanced dolby system as far as i know,2024-03-02 06:26:24
i mean i agree oppenheimer wouldn’t have done as well without “barbenheimer” but dune 2 is an actionscifi blockbuster  it’s not a period drama  it’s already selling as well if not better than oppenheimer in the premium format screens and reviews and word of mouth are extremely strong  and we haven’t had a great action blockbuster like this in so long since almost every superhero film we got last year and this year have been mid to awful  as i said i can’t imagine it doesn’t make at least what oppenheimer did,2024-03-01 05:26:17

"the way i understand it is that paul being the kwisatz haderach is a real thing

the kwisatz haderach being a messiah who will lead the fremen to paradise is bene geserit propaganda",2024-03-02 22:26:04
yea i wish they would’ve spent more time with it and walked people through it once he takes the water he can see the way forward clearly that’s why he has such a dramatic change of tone and confidence,2024-03-02 20:47:37
and paul has been training them using prana bindu bene gesserit techniques ,2024-03-04 10:46:40
i know i was trying not to spoil it for them,2024-03-05 04:24:12
somewhere in the editing the love part got lost like the scene where hes seeing into the future and seeing peoples thoughts and past and peaces out  is that like how is that not amazing and right after he came back from the dead and then he says hes going to take the emperors daughter as a wife which is obviously a political move to protect the whole planet and shes all miffed about it,2024-03-01 18:08:21
"always pauls biggest supporter and believer basically seem to just resent him

i dont remember the books very well but im not sure that a completely devoted supportive unquestioning love interest would have added much to these movies at least not at this point jessica and stilgar kind of fill that role already

seems like in the genre of epic reluctant heroes there needs to be somebody to keep the hero true to themselves i didnt get resentment from chani just fear disappointment sadness and maybe a little resignation im sure shell become his biggest supporter eventually",2024-03-04 00:43:34
"fair but its common for fanboys to ignore a films flaws because they love the franchise too much

dune fanboys act like denis vulleneuve can do no wrong

dune is slow and boring despite being based on an interesting book",2024-03-03 23:05:59
my mistake there it was dr yueh,2024-03-02 09:16:01
"that couldve worked or looked terrible 

i wonder if they tested that early on or if they always planned on just changing things there",2024-03-03 01:20:08
ya waiting to see it in 70mm imax for my second viewin but the theatres been packed all week,2024-03-04 05:41:05
and people died as a result of the atomics which kind of violates the convention,2024-03-01 04:08:49
"i think the atomics is a good change for 2 reasons

1 it works better for the visual medium the worms wouldve taken some extra explanation and the film is already densely packed

2 the atomics being pauls weapon gives more complexity to paul and his position given that he is the only one who can access the atomics it adds to his power

i do think they can still bring in the spice production threat in dune messiah considering pauls power is still constantly threatened in that",2024-03-01 04:14:14

because they work really hard to get their bloodlines just right this is centuries of planning and waiting,2024-03-01 17:02:47
i mean thats kinda how the first book ends the movie is pretty clearly laying the groundwork for messiah though throughout even more than dune the book does,2024-03-01 18:40:20
yeah i think that’s the same as what i’m saying he can see possible outcomes but not the minutiae of what leads to that it’s broad strokes ,2024-03-06 15:41:51
i do feel this is what i’m trying to convey he can see visions of the future but not every step in between,2024-03-06 16:14:41
i obviously cant speak for everyone but i personally like watching movies in their original language with english subtitles i like to hear the original actors intonation and delivery i dont know anyone that watches movies dubbed over subtitled,2024-03-10 00:44:14
seems strange considering how many people know english in germany,2024-03-10 05:48:46
yea i made star wars what it was as i used to hang out a lot with lucas back in the day me him and lawrance used to be best of pals,2024-03-17 22:45:47
"ive never fully understood why this advanced society goes into this war for hand to hand combat given the technology how could they not ever do a sweep of the entire planet with an airforce even if you get shot down at least you have an idea of where this is happening  and do the fremen really have enough resources to outlast the emperor that doesnt seem right surely given the spice is used as a way to see what path is safe for interstellar travel they could use the spice to help fully understand whats happening on this planet

on the point of resources how on earth are the fremen manufacturing stillsuits and thumpers and water extractors for dead people the whole time reading the book and watching the movies i had that thought it never made much sense to me",2024-04-05 16:13:29
"yeah its one you kinda just have to chalk up to the hubris of the imperial powers always dismissing the fremen no one really tried to understand them or learn more about them the only reason anyone would want to be on arrakis was the spice  


although in the book its revealed that the fremen give a lot of spice to the spacing guild in return for keeping satellites from observing the desert spreading the belief that nothing lives in the deep desert so there is that atleast ",2024-03-28 01:23:33
he didnt bring his whole army but yeah this part was always weak,2024-03-27 22:41:39
"the moment i knew he was in the film i was sure he was going to have a bizarre headpiece or something to counter exactly what you say nope just walken as walken

just baffles me why they cut both characters from the first film too would have given them much more impact in this one",2024-04-08 21:47:28
agreed it just creates an echo chamber on this sub but that’s sort of expected because of how much of a circlejerk this sub already is “dae think le moon is underrated gem” there’s no space here for critical discussion  instead any sort of criticism is met with insults and accusations of being a simpleton troll that doesn’t understand “fine cinema”,2024-03-01 19:33:38

"there wasn’t anything more intelligent about feyd or at least we weren’t shown it 

what we where shown was him fighting drugged and crippled men and then immediately afterwards he went to uncle fatso to whine about how one of them wasn’t drugged and crippled enough 

feyd’s victims throughout the film were primarily unarmed women i did not find him threatening at all because the film deliberately went out of its way to never actually establish him as a particular threat or at least not as one that was any different than rabban

he was supposed to be a foil to paul but he was kind of just a captain phasma",2024-03-03 02:50:26

in the book they had a full equipment compliment but everything was on the edge of breaking down so it seemed more like the harkonens sabotaged it,2024-03-01 04:48:31

i had one major issue with the last 30 minutes of the movie i kept getting kicked out of the experience because to me it just looked like a kid on a temper tantrum i was just trying to put myself in the situation and i believe i wouldn’t have kneeled

just needed a little more command of the script since the words being spoken are quite effective",2024-03-03 05:30:56

"the holy war didnt even really get explained that much in dune the book 


i think its a great adaptation  accuracy is not an all encompassing requirement for adaptations  i think the changes made improve the films and the story


in the book it can be pretty easy to go along with paul and his decision making his insistence that he can only see the golden path and more peaceful outcomes are impossible  im sorry but he is villainous on film without the benefit of being inside his head it makes sense for us to see him through chanis eyes with her doubt and betrayal


to put it another way superman would not make the changes paul made ",2024-03-04 01:48:16
"a common complaint about the books is that the chars feel kinda samey and all have similar internal monologue  the movie making them more distinct was great to me  in the books chani stops being a char after she falls in love with paul  


i liked what they did w jessica her self motivated behavior is a great example of how people act in accordance to their own self realized logic  jessicas position within their society was not secure  as paul said even if he called off the genocide at this point it would continue even if he died stilgar and jessica are examples of this",2024-03-04 02:38:51

i’ve literally never been to a movie where someone audibly interrupts it and i’ve seen a lot of avengers movies opening weekend in a big us city,2024-03-02 04:57:40
 im so happy i dont live in the us here in the uk the most activity youll get is a small laugh at a funny part of maybe an audible gasp if its a shocking moment,2024-03-04 12:29:10
hes not though every movie you get the same person no range,2024-03-04 18:54:03
it will get political and fun real fast,2024-03-01 17:26:21
oh yeah i guess that’s right  he made a deal to get off the planet for him and his men but opted to stay for an opportunity to  rabban,2024-03-02 02:22:57
honestly i never quite liked how fine chani was with the marriage in the book i would be sort of passed,2024-03-02 23:45:26
chani is right though there is no chosen one the prophecies are all bene geserit propoganda,2024-03-02 22:17:33
"to me thats really the biggest unresolved question  ill admit i only read the first book but at the end of the first book she is unreservedly by pauls side albeit not as his wife in title the book literally ends on jessica soothing chani on this point

it seems like chani is set up to be a foil or one of the last people who question pauls ascendance as a messiah  for one it seems likely he will get millions of fremen killed",2024-03-02 21:33:08
" dont think too hard about it lol

i guess the fremen just kinda have a feeling of how hard to work the worms for their desired distance ¯ ¯",2024-03-03 21:57:52
and i liked that part but in the book he sheds tears for jamis and the fremen say with reverence he gives water to the dead it’s the beginning of him converting them,2024-03-03 23:49:21
well in the movie it seems paul is the one to push the fremen farther north in attack after attack,2024-03-13 18:32:13
stilgar even says as much and she confirms it when paul says she should fell honored for most of the fremen the prophecy is the be allend all so when two likely candidates appear they go all in on seeing if they are the promised ones peaceful life was never on the table for them,2024-03-13 23:42:05
"no jesssica taking over for ramallo wasnt something they really considered even if they did no one expected the fremen to be as numerous or strong as they actually were it was something the movie didnt really harp on but the sardaukar were considered the hands down strongest force in the empire the great houses would have had to band together to defeat the sardaukar if a civil war broke out the fremen with arrakis being the most brutal environment to live in by far in the empire outclassed the sardaukar


so their natural strength plus the religious fervor paul infused them with unleashed a tidal wave that completely destroyed any semblance of the imperial balance of power the emperor came to arrakis because the idea that any force could actually defeat him there was just laughable until it happened ",2024-03-17 04:35:58
ye,2024-03-19 02:51:01
i agree but i think on some level zendaya was just a bad casting,2024-03-03 01:51:04
i mean chani is really really boring way more than jessica so this still works,2024-03-03 02:26:15
yeah it was a huge reason i was skeptical of zendayas casting i just wasnt sure how someone as passionate and strong as her could play meek subservient chani im happy they changed her story a bit,2024-03-02 11:36:47
"thats fine but as a movie it ends as to be continued the fremin are going to war with the rest of the houses we dont really know what happens with the emperor whats zendayas next move does chalomet fulfill his vision

and as a non book reader the war just started,2024-03-01 03:41:29
i dont disagree with your assessment either i do wish it was longer and had bigger fight scenes that werent in the book i like some changes they made hated others i very much like the movie but its not perfect nor is the book ,2024-03-01 07:46:32
the scene with jessica drinking it was much more powerful rebecca killed it with her physical body acting and setting the fetus being affected by the poison too plus the dying reverend mother realizing she made the worst mistake that being said chani slapping paul face after he wakes up was funny,2024-03-03 09:04:48
to be fair chalamet isnt that good an actor,2024-03-03 13:23:18
well theres showing to advance the plot and showing to just show off sound and visuals which is fine but its def not the same thing at all there were times when the kings daughter narrated stuff that could have been shown,2024-03-08 08:01:46

when denis himself admits he didnt push the emotional parts enough in dune 1 i do admire that honesty i still dont think he pushes it enough in part 2 i find myself lacking the empathy needed to really love these characters or back the fremen i lightly root for them only because thats what the plot told me to do 

some reviewer said the protagonists are more chess pieces on a board rather than vitally interesting figures and denis said he hates dialogue and i think thats a mistake many scenes are too underwritten for my tastes it doesnt have to be rapidfire tarantino dialogue but lawrence of arabia is still the untouched desert epic and had oscarwinning robert bolts legendary script a few lines of poetry say so much dune part 2 didnt even have that in the dialogue department",2024-03-03 00:22:31

this i saw them compre it to helms deep battle not even close,2024-03-03 00:37:35
"the film was incredible soundtrack characters costume design special effects acting cinematography storytelling it had it all you could tell from the carefull construct of the very first scene that it was going to be a masterpiece 

you are not understanding why people are saying its as good as the lotr trilogy for example tlotr adaption of the books was perfect with some book fans saying it was better dune is getting the same reception fans of the books are saying it really captures the books well and some say its better 

the gladiator sequence with butlers character was one of the best sci fi shots ive ever seen i was shook also the charge with the worms in the final battle the action scenes with the spice harvesters pauls character arc and change towards the end of the film was epic 

every scene was masterfull i was speechless by the end there was so much to praise villeneuve is one of the best around glimpses in sicario arrival and bladerunner was just an incredible movie that captured the universe perfectly

i havent seen it again either because i know ill get depressionally hooked emotional and obsessed it was that good for me",2024-03-06 22:43:20
"he sees visions of jamis as his friend in the second act of part one when this was still a possible future  but in reality he kills jamis by the end of part one so that particular future became no longer possible 

isnt it in some way preestablished that he would assimilate with the fremen and learn their ways 

it just meant that it was a possible future that he would meet her the fremen etc he had also seen chani stab   him as well as himself doing cartwheels on the battlefield in golden armour chani getting radiation burns in part 2 etc  none of these came to pass but were all possible futures at certain earlier points essentially before he drank the water of life his prescience was very limited seeing only visions of random parts of random possible futures afterwards he was seeing every step of all possible futures what actions in the present lead to which future etc 

also think of it this way  after his water of life coma paul says that in most possible futures from that point on they get killed by their enemies but by taking the narrow path through of seizing power over the fremen etc they could survive so if he could avoid the majority futures in which he  his loved ones got annihilated by choosing a particular course of action then by that same logic he shouldve also been able to avoid all the events of part two by choosing to forgo revenge taking the l for the greater good of avoiding galactic war sparing the fremen further religious brainwashing etc and just leaving the planet when his mother suggested it 

its kinda like at each point in time there are n number of possible futures but with each choice being made there are only n minus m possible futures remaining where m is a measure of how many futures that particular choice renders no longer possible",2024-03-21 23:02:50
"i think that arc is much better described as showing him becoming a true leader of a people despite starting from selfish motivations than the arc of a villlain fulfilling his villainhood 

yup ive already said that i agree with you that people are being reductive in calling paul a villain just wanted to point out that both films also explicitly portrayed him as an initially selfish sometimes very manipulative antihero albeit an eventually tragic one  so calling him a hero isnt accurate either

its not shown that he actually does anything wrong

bruh ive literally quoted the scenes where hes saying out loud that wants to lie to  manipulate a native people using a prophecy he knows is fake for the sake of his revenge which he also knows could lead to a horrible galactic war killing billions 

reason to believe thats because he realises he wants to conduct a galactic genocide

i didnt say he wants to conduct a galactic genocide i said that he was prioritising his personal revenge against the harkonnens  the emperor in spite of the risk of galactic genocide

hes foreseen that its the only way for the fremen to survive against a clearly evil enemy

ive already explained how he indeed didnt have a choice at that point which is why its tragic that he has to go back to manipulating the fremen into becoming his fanatical followers despite knowing that it would result in the galactic war but ive also said that this is still a horrible end result for even the fremen as per what paul has seen in his visions regarding the coming war and not some great triumph  and that things wouldnt have reached this point where he had no other option if he hadnt chosen to go down this path at the end of part one despite knowing the risk for the sake of his revenge alone too back then

do you only know this because of the books

has it been a long time since you watched part one after the reverend mother had tested paul in that film she speaks to jessica paul overhears and then jessica explains what the kwisatz haderach is she talks about how the bg have been mixing bloodlines for hundreds of years trying to produce a mind that could bridge space  time past  future etc and that some believe this being is already here and then in part two jessica after becoming a reverend mother herself tells paul that he would unlock his full potential as the kh by drinking the water of life opening his mind etc both films say multiple times that the fremens lisn al gaib prophecy was a fakepropaganda planted by the bg to control them  and yet paul has abilities he can see the future etc the explanation for this given in both films was him being the kwisatz haderach a person specifically bred over centuries to have these abilities

am i quoting anything that wasnt in the movies here",2024-03-21 11:12:23
yeah after the movie my bf literally asked me oh what happened there did they set up a scene and then skipped it what was it about bc he thought that there was a little time jump there and they were showing him hanging out with chani not that that was the walk through the desert,2024-03-04 18:53:55
i thought they were saying she was a fremen spying on the harkonnens because she seemed to be a prisoner,2024-03-04 10:52:24

"i think i may have mistook your original comment with just the battle of arakeen at the end of the movie which is my fault but i still believe some of your questions were presented in the films i’ll also try my best to stay away from the book and just denis adaptation which changes a lot in a good creative way 

“are there any scenes with him directing or advising them to do something”

i saw the screening today so i can’t remember every detail however i’m very confident it was met with enthusiasm the new fremen character introduced said “he should be fredaykin” while everyone around did the fremen chest pounding which i would say answers your question

i think what you’re asking though is there any scenes in the movie where paul clearly shows them new ways to overcome the harkonnens which i would say no

however i don’t believe this was denis intention denis does a very particular job of visually showing the levels of warriors going back to the first movie we know the harkonnens are not good fighters they need the sardaukar warriors to overthrow the atreides even see them cower when facing duncan since duncan is the only great warrior we see in part 1 we can assume his judgment is good when saying “they sent a warrior out to  me… and i’ve never been so close to dying there’s no greater fighter in the imperium” 
pretty much what i’m trying to say denis set out the warriors from highest to lowest like this 1 fremen 2 sardaukar 3 atreides 4 harkonnen

so yes there’s no scenes with paul explicitly telling the fremen of how to beat the harkonnen which he shouldn’t need to we know they’re great fighters we can assume that he’s providing leadership and confidence to a group of people who are great fighters that don’t understand how to politically and physically overthrow their oppressors 

“does paul providecontribute to them obtaining these resources initially”

no this is where i’m getting kind of confused with your questions as the atomics are the biggest turning factor in the movie i can’t tell if your criticism is of paul’s insertion into the fremen culture or “the fremen could’ve rebelled much earlier” because the atomics show why the fremen couldn’t rebel earlier we see the destruction the atomics do to the shield wall we also see how politically they can be used as no one wants spice to be destroyed 

“can you explain the shield thing”

i was speaking more towards the war as i thought this is what you were critiquing the atomics and the storm destroyed everyone’s shields so it pretty much evened the battlefield 

your last section is very valid which is what some book readers have been having criticisms about in the book paul and jessica have the weirding way which is just like a great fighting skill they teach this to the fremen which was mentioned in the 1st but taken out of the 2nd movie 
imo denis goal was to have paul as just a messianic figure then as something the fremen learn from which is a pretty modern take which i completely respect i can understand why you would possibly want more time for it though",2024-03-02 09:43:15
"so we see paul riding the worm the next scene he is suddenly inside the chamber looking at the baby worm hes then given the juice which he drinks we then see the juice lady inform lady jessica what paul has done and they are shown walking into the cave in the next scene we see chani arrive via an ornithopter  and jessica is waiting for her outside the cave 

this whole description reads like you were confused on what was happening it seems you probably would have wanted the movie to be way longer to convey the same information which i guess but if you understood what was happening and it made sense what else would you want out of it a long drawn out sequence that showed the same information but way longer and to no additional benefit",2024-03-05 05:01:21
"that he has decided he wants to just  everyone for the fun of it


i think if you havent read the books and dont realise who paul actually is

ive just explained in detail under another comment of yours using scenes only from the films as evidence exactly how  why what paul does is wrong 

the film simply does not demonstrate that what has happened is bad

also both films had shown multiple times that if the holy war happened its a very bad thing  spanning the galaxy killing billions etc part two showed that even the fremen themselves would eventually get hit by a famine or something because of it also the whole friends being turned into followers willing to gleefully   die for the sake of a lying manipulative foreigner who went down this path initially only for his own revenge despite knowing the risk of such a war etc",2024-03-21 10:47:12
it wasn’t communicated very clearly in part one it shows thufir talking about the shield wall and then it cuts to the actual wall of the city but it was always a natural rock formation in the books,2024-03-01 17:01:02
" hes not meant to be more threatening or menacing than this  hes supposed to be primarily paranoid jealous  even kinda weak otherwise it wouldnt make sense how he was manipulated by the reverend mother

i think the problem is that part 1 didnt really give us a good picture at all of what the emperor was  we only have two peeks into the emperor and both gave an inaccurate picture  the first was his brutal betrayal of house atreides and the second was the nature of his soldiers  both give the perception of a menacing cutthroat and brutal character  i was expecting more of a harkonnen type just without the torture and complete disregard for life

additionally his characterization as an impotent and weak ruler doesnt fit at all with the great houses not recognizing paul as the leader which i understand is a departure from the books  unless its going to devolve into an xway struggle for power which wasnt set up as no one threw in behind paul and they were presented as a unified front it just doesnt make a lot of sense that they arent seeing paul as the true leader when the emperor was already a lame duck type",2024-03-01 16:22:10
why should he make the movie for the tiktok audience he is not a hack but an artist wouldnt you say the first part had glorious pacing he deserves all the credit in the world for that,2024-03-02 01:10:43
"the first movie didnt need time to breathe its slow because nothing that happens is the cause or consequence of anything else the plot doesnt move along at all dennis stripped out the entire story to fit silly slowmo shots of paul all over the place 


people dont fall asleep because there arent enough explosions they fall asleep because the explosions are meaningless

i think once chani was telling him to go south for the sake of their people he finally gave in,2024-03-03 13:44:20
"i mean he had been resisting taking advantage of the fremens fake prophecy for the entire film until that point even fought with his mother over it just before she had left for south

heck even after sietch tabr got destroyed he does try to stay behind thats your reluctance right there but when chani tells him that the others wont leave without him he looked really pained but says that he would go south  do what he must why would he resist everything else associated with going south after this moment when hes clearly accepting that he doesnt have a choice anymore cant risk not being able to predict future attacks the fremen war council was about to meet etc

he would resist even less after surviving the water of life because he actually saw how in most futures they were destroyed by their enemies and so he was going to follow the narrow path through plus him realising that he has harkonnen blood in him which changed the way he thought of himself  so he says so we win by being harkonnens or so  not sure why you were expecting reluctance from him in the last hour of the film as well especially after all of the aforementioned",2024-03-03 13:20:12
"i meant his decision initially to stay in the north and keep disrupting spice production with feyd as the leader now it was only a matter of time before he lost i think they needed to drive that point home a little better

also drinking the water of life makes his future visions more clear that’s why he was so sure of himself and what he has to do many people that watched the movie were unclear why he changed his demeanor so dramatically",2024-03-03 19:15:20
spoiler examplethe reason paul goes full dark side in the book vs how its portrayed in the movie is less believable since the reason for such a dramatic change or at least a huge part of it was the death of his son the emperor christopher watkins get little to nothing in the film along with irena florence plough,2024-03-02 21:40:04
oh okay i understand what you mean then i feel like denis held the audiences hand pretty firmly maybe if they don’t see a lot of movies other than blockbusters with pretty obvious hero’s then maybe they won’t recognize the horror i think having chani  about paul’s decision as the last shot of the movie should leave the correct impression on 99 of viewers,2024-03-03 02:36:05
even if something ends on a cliffhanger the stakes still need to be clear for it to land basically from the moment paul goes south everything just avalanches to the end and the characterization and motivations are lost i assume part of my problem with this movie comes from the source material because i dont find pauls journey very compelling i dont really understand the point of having two separate harkonnen nephews when basically they just switch positions of power and the second one just magically finds the fremon stronghold without any indication of what he did differently if anything ending both films with knife fights to the death is anticlimatic and redundant etc the movie looks great but the story is really really shallow and a little ,2024-03-03 03:34:44

"this is either a troll comment or your username is checking out lol

1 the film outright says from the beginning itself that the fremens lisn al gaib prophecy is fake propaganda planted by the bene gesserit to manipulate them that the fremen should only be led by one of their own etc

2 lady jessica is clearly portrayed as malicious in how she fans religious fundamentalism amongst the vulnerable ones among the fremen 

3paul himself had said it was cruel what the bgs fake prophecy had done to the fremen and that if he were to seize religiopolitical power over them as their messiah for his own agenda revenge against the harkonnens  the emperor or even partly for the fremens own good his visions showed that in the long run it would make things worse for the entire galaxy because of the holy war it would eventually trigger across the galaxy  the fremen themselves have no reason  nothing to gain from fighting such a war they would be doing so only out of fanaticism towards paul 

4 from the point when paul embraces his fake messiah status chani is clearly shown to feel betrayed by him 

5 the movie even ends with the holy war  which weve been told repeatedly is going to end horrifically for the entire galaxy  actually starting all of these were a very unsubtle allegory for western imperialist powers fanning  empowering religious fundamentalists for the sake of their own agendas with them stated purpose liberating them with the gift of democracy   actual purpose the new rulers who weve put in power will give us all their oil lol  though pauls agenda is a little more grey  revenge plus the fremens immediate survival no idea how you thought the movie was fellating the white savior trope  imperialism after all of that

as for how it deconstructs the chosen one trope  the lisn al gaib prophecy itself has been stated to be fake  planted by the bg for 2 movies now jessica  later paul himself are posing his science given kwisatz haderach powers to actually be a result of him being the chosen one of prophecy note that the kwisatz haderach isnt a chosen one of fate but rather the planned eventual product of a centurieslong eugenics program by the bene gesserit",2024-03-04 04:08:42
yep agree his dune monologue was great,2024-03-02 07:41:29
"the prophecy isnt real as mentioned many times  it was planted by the bene gesserit as a means to manipulate the fremen 

pauls abilities arent because hes the lisn al gaib chosen by fate but because hes seemingly the kwisatz haderach the result of a centurieslong carefully planned eugenics program by the bene gesserit to create specifically such a being

in part one at the ecological observatory paul says that he would become the fremens messiah even though he clearly knew that the prophecy itself was just very old propaganda that had been passed on  amplified over generations for the sake of gaining them as a powerful army to get revenge over the harkonnens  the emperor  possibly even the throne jessica starts to support this in part two even more aggressively after she drank the water of life  her fetus starts seeing possible futures  communicating the same to her whereas paul himself after initially wanting to manipulate the fremen soon comes to genuinely care for chani stilgar and all the other people of sietch tabr 

which is why after seeing visions that he would cause a terrible galaxyspanning holy war if he were to go south  follow his mother paul was so reluctant to ever go there but feyds brutal destruction  massacre of sietch tabr and the resultant pressure from everyone including chani noone will leave for south until you go with them leaves him no choice but to go there  do what he must which is yes to actually seize religiopolitical power over all the fremen as their messiah which is why chani feels betrayed  even more angry at him from the war council scene onwards  although she was already mad at him for almost dying from drinking the water of life  then his mother forcing chani herself to confirm the prophecy she hated

 its also very possible that paul intentionally laid there unconscious until chani had done so  because we know from earlier in the film that those with bene gesserit training can neutralise poisons in their body either way the prophecy isnt real mainly because it had been confirmed multiple times across both films to just have been propaganda planted by the bg",2024-03-01 07:47:18

i suppose we did skip all the training sequences before battle

but that was one of the most critized things in the original film

without the context of the book they do kinda just become a whole new level of elite without context

and when we do see them die its almost missable as the movie gives it no focus except the closest anyone got was the one that got shot off the ornithcopter but in battle theres many of them getting slain if you look for it",2024-03-02 16:42:11

i don’t think i put it together that that was even a  scene,2024-03-02 02:11:49
"feyd was lied to but never shown to be upset by this decision the baron literally tells him it was a gift he knows feyd loves fighting but for his safety they were drugged up so it ruined the enjoyment it wasn’t until he fought a real fighter that he enjoyed himself

keep in mind i had not read the book yet i text this with the book to my side as i am just not beginning to read it after watching the movie however i believe you just misunderstood that scene he is not complaining he says that the baron was telling to  him but they both knew that this would not happen he doesn’t want to fight drugged soldiers he wants a real fight 

feyds character shows respect towards good fighters in the two instances where he does fight

i think this comes down to an expectations getting into the way from you reading the book first you expect certain things to happen or you compare what happened in the movie vs the book this is why i didn’t want to read the book before finishing the first books content in part 1 and 2

i do agree that rabban was done dirty he ran and the one time he had to fight he didn’t stand a chance i was expecting more

i can’t say the same for feyd tho the final fight was beautiful and showcased both of their abilities i don’t really have gripes with how they dealt with him but i would if i read the book and his character is more then he is in the movie",2024-03-01 18:47:10
somebody can correct me if im wrong but that scene wasnt in the book what i think they were saying is shes a spy that stayed and was in hiding and when they found her she killed 9 of their men in the book its talked about how great the freman fighters are that even against the emperor sardaukar even old women and children can take them 35x on it so i think scene was trying to show how capable freman fighter is ,2024-03-01 08:05:05

for what it’s worth the movie followed the book as far as the short battle scene at the end in fact the movie actually went into a lot more detail than the book for the battle in many ways the book was about people’s reactions to big events without going into great detail of the events themselves,2024-03-02 06:12:42

" it only raises the question of why arent the harks using nukes or anyone else


when it comes to the baron etc i guess the most obvious answer would be that it could deeply affect the harvesting of spice when you consider that the harvesting of spice is instrumental in keeping things as they are in the universe of dune and without it humankind would likely go extinct it would make all the sense in the world for using such a weapon anywhere on the planet to be straight up unthinkable but thats just how i see it havent read the books but have listened to a number of videos which go further indepth about the events in all the books


you also have to consider that the baron and everyone else were grossly mistaken regarding the actual number of fremen on the planet not to mention how they also firmly believed that the entire south was uninhabitable so seeing as their estimates were that there were only 50k fremen or so alive he just assumed that even rabban would be enough to find them and wipe them out without needing to break out the heavy artillery


one more thing that wasnt really mentioned in both films which i found out shortly after part 1 came out and thought was a really cool piece of worldbuilding is that when the harkonnen showed up out of nowhere on arrakis and decimated the atreides army and whatnot that unprecedented move was only made possible because the baron paid an exorbitant amount to the spacing guild


 you could squeeze arrakis for everything its worth for 60 years and youd just barely pay back what it cost to bring such a force to bear on the atreides


with that in mind you can imagineunderstand why he wanted to so quickly go back to business and to me at least its as i said wouldve been unthinkable for someone in his position to even think about using anything that could affect the amount of spice being harvested",2024-03-09 16:07:43
"did you read the book

using nukes on people are like one of the biggest sins ever in the dune universe in the beginning of the book when the harks are planning their attack baron hark says that the other houses might be upset about his attack but they prob wouldn’t do anything 

feyd asks something like “even if we used atomics”

and baron hark says that that would be the one thing that would provoke severe punishment from the other houses 

we’re not 100 sure why nukes on ppl are banned but we can presume that this was an agreed upon standard between the houses in power a line not to be crossed if you think about it that’s kind of how it is now if any country nuked another country there would likely be untold destruction in retaliation ",2024-03-09 23:43:25

"more like the prophecy of the fremen regarding a voice from the outer stars lisn al gaib with a bene gesserit mother was fake  planted by the bg

but the kwisatz haderach isnt born of any prophecy or a chosen one of fate but rather the eventually expected  carefully planned end result of centuries worth of eugenics by the bene gesserit paul is essentially posing his science given abilities of prescience etc as fate given instead to gain religiopolitical power over the fremen 

things like him being able to ride the grandfather worm on his first try were coincidences  chani being forced by jessica through the voice to wake paul from his coma through her desert spring tears as per prophecy could well have been him waiting for the right moment to finish transmuting the poison via his bene gesserit training which he himself had mentioned was what jessica had done during her water of life ceremony

tldr  the fremens prophecy was just fake propaganda planted by the bg paul having abilities had nothing to do with that but rather because he was the product of the bgs eugenics program to create the kwisatz haderach superbeing fate vs science",2024-03-02 19:09:38
"yes its kind of the same thing the bg have been working for centuries to bring about an even more powerful kwisatz and also planted this prophecy among the locals on many planets they planted the seeds of a religion amongst the locals on many planets

with the lasers it’s explained in the book that if you shoot lasers at people when they have their shields active it creates a catastrophic reaction that destroys everyone involved hence the reliance on hand to hand combat when you use shields on arrakis the shield attracts the sandworms and sends them into a frenzy so the fremen and harkonnens don’t use it when they’re out in the sand,2024-03-06 04:27:40
the other reply has great answers but also worth a thought that the movie only refers to the bombs as atomics but we shouldnt necessarily compare them to the nuclear bombs we know of in our world today  i think it should be seen as disastrously heavy bombs but still room for interpretation plus the book probably has more detail on it and the movie really is trying to adapt the book as much as possible ,2024-03-07 05:43:56
"see that’s what my wife said that he was able to pass the test because he enjoyed pain

this is literally what the movie says too

but i always thought the test was pretty binary either you have the necessary quality being assessed or you die 

you yourself said in your previous comment that it was testing whether the subject is capable of acting rationally under immense pain unlike some instinctive animal paul can do so because hes able to withstand it courtesy his mental strength training from jessica etc feyd can also do so at least as per whats rational to him or to the same extent he usually is but because he enjoys the pain

the  still binary in its result  can they act rationally under pain or not the answer is yes for both  its only in how theyre able to do so that they differ

the other inferences are just a bonus",2024-03-06 19:33:47

" i guess i was in the army and studied military history a lot that commanders are never ever charging in the front even being in the vanguard unit is crazy but literally the first person leading the charge lol no just takes me out of the movie even the most daring military commanders who fought alongside men were never the first person you would see gurley leading the suicide charge or paul charging into sardaukar lines as the first guy its so unrealistic to the point that it takes me out of it a little


i cannot speak in regards to military experience as i have none but what we do know based on the films is that the fremen are extremely honorable as seen with the whole amtal thing where theyre ready to die on the spot if that ends up being the outcome and they also know how their death will only lead to their water being returned to the well


the fremen seem to simply be that kind of tribe not only have they always lived in such an extreme harsh environment theyve also been oppressed and hunted for decades and it seems theyre a type of tribe where you absolutely must pull your own weight otherwise youre just quite literally water


so with that in mind i see no issue whatsoever with everyone taking to battle because theyre ready to die for their cause and beliefs at every turn and this goes for stilgar and pretty much countless others


paul leading the charge especially the last one is not an issue at all when you take into account that he can and has seen the future so he knows he wont die then and there and hes free to do whatever he wants


i think we see him leading the charge for cinematic purposes i dont imagine him taking to the actual frontlines because that seems like the role chani took on instead mirroring his holy war vision late into the first film where he was the one fighting instead


so i imagine that the fremen cleared the path all the way to the emperor so that paul could make his way there effortlessly as that was the primary goal


gurley is also an extremely experienced fighter iirc might even be the best in the whole of calladan but dont quote me on that what we see at the end with him and rabban that mightve arguably been the very last stretch of the assault on the harkonnen he might not have been on the frontlines the entire time


but even if he was we already know why that is he stated earlier in the film how he stayed behind on arrakis because he wanted the blood he wanted the fight he was not gonna let anyone else have rabbans head if he could help it and if he died in the process he would absolutely not give a single  for sure


with pauls case in particular its an instance where he has to be the one leading everyone into battle not only does he want to he also has to especially as this newly arrived messianic figure theres just no way around that plot point from the moment he joins the fremen


you also gotta bear in mind that when he first joins the fremen paul isnt just a regular human hes been trained in a multitude of arts including that of mentat which is what gives him such a powerful analytical mind that is instrumental to his leadershipwarfare capabilities and all this without even taking into account the prescience that he obtains afterwards


 the usage forbidden thing wasnt really established in the movie from what i understand i could be wrong


it wasnt but ill copy paste this from another comment i left before


 atomics harbored a pronounced psychological and social stigma and were rarely used due to traumatic historical events their prohibition was enforced by the great convention which dictated that the offensive use of atomics is grounds for planetary annihilation


 the destruction of part of the shield wall by paul atreides just prior to the battle of arrakeen which led to the defeat of the forces of house harkonnen and the sardaukar and the the ascension of house atreides by using them on the shield wall and not directly on the opposition forces paul was able to circumvent the great convention paving the way for his ascension




 what youre saying would makes sense but we really havent seen much fight from the sardaukar at all correct me if im wrong


iirc the other thing to take into account is that the sardaukar are wholly unprepared to fight against the fremen in the first film we saw the sardaukar easily overpowering the atreides towards the end of the film theyre easily owned by the fremen because theyre fighting on their homeworld where they take advantage of the sand and all of their environment


they might appear weak but they arent its just that the most formidable force in the universe happens to be the fremen and the sardaukar never had a chance to properly engage with them in battle especially when faced with that unthinkable display of desert power at the end of part 2 theyre just powerless in the face of all of that as they were completely blindsided


the other thing also which wasnt in the film is that i believe that paul passed on some of his exclusive training weirding way you can read about it on the wikia to the fremen which made them all the more deadlier a technique that also contributed immensely to them overpowering the sardaukar and whatever else that stood in their way during the holy war


any actual book readers out there correct me if im wrong on anything please",2024-03-14 17:35:15
"even still once siech tabr was attacked the choice wasn’t so easy

things wouldnt have reached this loselose or lesser of 2 horrible outcomes scenario in the first place if he hadnt decided to manipulate the fremen for his revenge in the first place though 

ive already mentioned myself that after this point the story is more of an antiheros tragedy him beginning to genuinely care for chani  the fremen in the preceding months leading him to change his mind about the initial more selfish plan makes it even sadder than paul being a total villain

or he could intervene intervening would save the fremen and grant him revenge though it might lead to the galaxyspanning genocide

save the fremen  if it wasnt for his jessicas  the bene gesserits religious manipulation the fremen arent at all the sort of people who would choose a life as lesser beings friends reduced to followers blindly fanatical fundamentalists gleefully killing billions  dying in the millions for a lying foreigner over nearcertain honorable death so hes only saving them from the more imminent physical dangers after dooming them himself to either this or a galactic holy war much earlier

i don’t know whether revenge or love motivated his choice at that point

at that point it was more just him choosing the seemingly more bearable of 2 horrible outcomes and perhaps minimising casualties with superprescient kwisatz haderach paul as the emperor himself revenge had put him on this path to begin with at the end of part one and the first act of part two love had taken him off of it and made him fear it during the second act of part two postwater of life immediate survival seems to have been the main motivation he says he loves chani even at the end but he immediately follows this up with what is most necessary to maximise the chances  numbers for survival  asking irulans hand in marriage

maybe he thought in any case he could escape starting the jihad

why would he need to think that he could escape the jihad when he can see all possible futures now and know that he wont be able to do so not if he chose this path anyway

in any case i trust that your main original confusions regarding why chani was upset how right or good pauls choices  true motivations were etc have been addressed at least",2024-03-19 23:27:06

"thank you 

why did the other house reject him post fight  did they not care for the duel ",2024-03-06 02:23:12
"yeah the main point of dune is that its a cautionary tale against charismatic leaders and messianic figures as well as a subversion of the heros journey the movie makes this even more obvious than the book did 

think about what actually happened in the movie the prophecy about the lisan algaib was literally propaganda made up by the bene gesserit that allows them to take advantage of the fremen the entire movie jessica is basically just fanning the flames of fanaticism and propping up paul as a prophet even though hes actually a false prophet paul and jessica are the ultimate manipulators they are taking advantage of the fremen for their own political gain and leading them into a holy war and using them to establish paul as the new emperor 

on a surface level its easy to root for paul because he is fighting against the fascist harkonnens but on closer inspection paul is a tyrannical false prophet he has good intentions at the start but once he drinks the water of life he loses his identity and humanity undergoes the spice change and becomes a completely different person he is no longer paul after he drinks the water of life he is the kwisatz haderach at that point thats the point where he goes all in on playing into the messiah role even though he knows he actually isnt a messiah",2024-03-10 02:50:43

"as he said

the other houses reject paul presumably because he basically usurped the throne from the emperor a man presumably thought to be dead shows up at the head of a terrorist army and hostages the most valuable material in the known universe spice in order to leverage himself into power its not a surprise that the great houses refuse to accept this

the power balance between the shipping guild the bg the great houses atreadis harkonnen et all and the emperor isnt something thats discussed a lot in the movie but its a real thing and the entire reason the emperor tries to  off the atreadis in the first place he fears house atreadis is getting too powerful and could at some point in the future threaten him by getting a group of houses together  ape strong together

so the idea is reasonable that the houses would think to stand together against paul when hes litteraly threatening a permanent end to the galactic order with the threat of accept me or ill nuke the spice fields  now in the context of the movie you might think theyd at least negotiate a little or maybe paul would slow down and say something like listen you dont really have a choice here

and that gets to nkyaxs second point about the cause of the jihad in the book none is ever given  thus in the movie denis chooses to use the rejection of paul by the houses as the spark that starts the holocaust paul has fearedtriggered",2024-03-06 16:34:14
" if you could answer one more why did the other houses reject paul even though he was a duke and had the emperors forced cooperation



 also what war is there to be fought  hark leaders are dead and the emperor captured  are the other houses just  about the whole thing  i feel like in the next movie im not buying this being the last movie for a second they have a lot of lore to flesh out about whos the next threat


this requires a bit of inference because the movie deviates slightly from the books so i cant quite assure that this is correct 

the other houses reject paul presumably because he basically usurped the throne from the emperor a man presumably thought to be dead shows up at the head of a terrorist army and hostages the most valuable material in the known universe spice in order to leverage himself into power its not a surprise that the great houses refuse to accept this

interestingly the great houses themselves arrived in belief that the emperor had overstepped his authority and was seizing power from the harkonnens they werent acting in the interest of the emperor but in insurance of their own power and survival against the emperor or the position of paul could also reveal that the emperor had taken part in the destruction of house atreides and used that in justification for his revenge of the emperor as that is the same issue that the other great houses have with the emperor in this scenario at least it seems like that wouldnt be enough to solidify his claim to the throne as the war still goes on

in the movie the great war jihad that paul envisions is almost explicitly laid out as the war between the great housesrival planets and the freman because of this issue pauls ascension to the throne however this is not exactly the case in the book rather the jihad is never actually shown and only referred to in the books as it takes place between books 1 and 2 honestly theres always been discussion on what the exact underlying reason for it but for the most part many people agree that a large reason was the consolidation of pauls power as emperor villeneuve simply highlighted and pinned that reason as the primary cause of the war personally i appreciate the change and think this choice made the most sense narratively given the slight changes that between the book and movie",2024-03-06 03:19:40

well in one short line if you extrapolate it does

but i mean it takes all the suspense out of the big final fight if the protagonist has clearly seen all possible futures and is just following the script for the one possibility that leads to his end goals

"specifically chooses the path with the least amount of harm it’s the only choice he can make morally because he has no agency he’s a leader completely chosen by fate

heres the thing though a holy war spanning the galaxy that kills billions is still a helluva lot of harm its probably even more harm than all fremen population of millions being wiped out and the bg being in control of emperor feyd

but even more importantly paul only sees every possible future from the point after he drank the water of life he  jessica had already by then made a significant number of fremen into his fanatical followers the video  the movies had shown us that in the ecological observatory scene in part one that paul had initially decided to become the fremens fake messiah primarily for his own agenda alone revenge against the harkonnens  the emperor despite being aware of the possibility of the holy war down that path no mention of it being whats better for the fremen at all in that scene

its only after he had spent time with chani  his friends at sietch tabr that he started to genuinely care for them but jessica was still converting many into his followers at the time note that it was only the dumb rabban who was put in charge of arrakis initially too  the fremen were more than capable of evading attacks from him  surviving it was only because of the sheer extent of spice production being disrupted under muaddib that rabban gets replaced by feyd in part two sietch tabr gets massacred paul is forced to go south  drink the water of life  seeing that at this point it was either him  the fremen getting wiped out or him seizing religiopolitical power over the fremen becoming emperor  triggering the holy war which were the only options etc

the point is in part one if paul had merely left the planet as jessica even suggests in the end  asking stilgar to get them in touch with smugglers instead of joining the fremen with the intention of weaponising their faith for his revenge none of the events of part two would have happened fremen would continue to be oppressed but the majority would definitely have survived in the south at least feyd  especially the emperor wouldnt have arrived at arrakis but most of all billions of deaths across the galaxy could have been avoided paul is considered an antihero because it was primarily his initial desire for revenge that led to it being impossible to save the fremen  himself without triggering the holy war",2024-03-07 06:10:15

dont the sardaukar have projectile weapons at the beginning when their sqaud is taken out by ranged fremen but that brings up the point again why do you think guns would be useful when you cant even see who youre fighting by the time you see the fremen theyre already right next to you with a knife the best they can really do is have air cover to watch the harvesters but we see in the movie that those can be taken out too,2024-03-21 19:26:43
maybe i sort of prefer the movies concept of fate being ambiguous as to whether it’s bene gesserit propaganda or genuine divine destiny it does sort of render the later books challenging though,2024-03-01 04:48:14
i almost never give a movie a ten but this one deserved it it doesnt mean it is perfect it means it achieved all my performence criteria,2024-03-01 23:22:40
"who said anything about handing 10s out left and right

“if part 3 is better than part 2 it would deserve a higher score no”

and what if there’s a movie that’s even better than part 3 if you keep a “perfect” rating solely for perfect films it’ll never be logically used and the whole notion of a scoring system disintegrates it’s the same if you look at it the other way — if a movie is bad and you give it a 110 then if another movie comes along that’s even worse how would you solve that since you can’t rate something even lower you’d have to leave that first movie at a 210 to leave room for a worse movie but then you’d have to leave 210 open for a worse movie too so it’d actually have to be a 310 etc etc 

every movie has to be on its own scale reviewerscritics use numbers as a baseline for recommendation not as a baseline of “perfection” there’s no such thing a 10 shouldn’t necessarily mean a movie is perfect or can’t be improved",2024-03-01 20:56:40
oh if its the same shot im thinking of its right after he drinks the water of life and when hes on his way to the fremen it cuts to that scene of him walking toward the camera with a sand worm just behind him  immediately after is that awesome scene where hes walking through that ocean of fremen all seeing him as their profit  a few of my favorite scenes right there at least,2024-03-06 17:32:33
" why did paul have to drink worm poison to futile the prophecy

oh boy oh boy the movie barely scratches the surface of this

so bg have a ritual where they drink it then while it is inside their body alter their body chemistry in a way that very very slightly alters the poison in a way that transforms it from a 100 lethal poison to a very powerful psychoactive drug that unlocks a genetic memory and sort of shared awareness

the fremen religion has the same ritual because the bg taught it to them because the bg basically created their religion as mostly a copy of bg practices so that if a stray bg needed to assimilate into their culture and religious heirarchy they could do it easily

in the sort of awareness space the water of life unlocks there are some areas that no bgrm has ever been able to explore successfully

big gender time the bg are a female only order and rarely teach their skills to boys but paul of course has been taught all their skills from birth because hes our special boy for whatever reason the bg theorize that if a boy could do the wol trick he would be able to see parts of the awareness space that they never could however because boys are inherently not as good at manipulating their body chemistry as girls every time one tries he  up and the poison just kills him so the bg initiate a centuries long eugenics project to create a boy smart enough that he can actually do the trick

thats what the kwisatz haderach means a boy who can drink water of life without dying

paul knows all of this from the beginning of the movie but dun want it then when sietch tabr gets blown up hes like welp either i accept all this power or deal with me and my family getting blown up because i could have gotten the power to stop that and chose not to 

ps the most jarring no they would not  do that  moment for me in the movie was when jessica throws up against her will a bg would not do that

 could he command people with his voice or could he see visions

paul could do voice back in the first movie its something pretty much all bg can do and his mom teaches it to him

after he drinks the water of life he becomes literally omniscient

this does have the side effect of making him better at the voice because that ability is based on understanding other people so well you know a perfect tone that will control them but he could do back in part 1 already and this is pretty secondary next to the whole omniscience thing",2024-03-04 01:54:49
"1 he’s morbidly obese so he can’t even carry his own body weight his “life support” allows him to float

2 yeah

3 the voice allows them to control people once he drinks the water of life he has the ability to see into the future basically which is what the bene geseret can also do",2024-03-04 01:23:35
1 and 3 are explained in big scenes during part 1,2024-03-04 01:17:37
"yeah unfortunately slimming things down for the movies means alot of things are lost in adaption the interaction of the spice and the sandworms with the ecology of arrakis is a running theme in the series as fremen society changes due to arrakis growing greener


the spacing guild is a big part of the novels since they have a monopoly on space travel and their ships only operate thanks to the spice but the movies pretty much removed the guild altogether the books can be daunting but id definitely recommend reading them to get more of the story and how things play out over time",2024-03-24 01:05:33
baby sandworm ,2024-03-24 22:50:23
that was in the first one,2024-03-24 17:45:52

i was disappointed by it and thats ok",2024-03-04 12:05:08
didnt get angry at all just dont see how they stack up at all,2024-03-01 18:40:59
also in dune 1 jessica asks the fremen after first meeting them with paul for safe passage on a transport ship  they know the fremen have secret ships,2024-03-10 06:19:53
"the blue stuff gave him the memories of all his male and female ancestors for the bene gesserit they receive the memories of their female ancestors

after he drank the “worm ” he does,2024-03-04 01:29:05
i get what youre saying but maybe that all falls in line with cutting some stuff out to keep it more grounded and digestible i know its not on the same level of deciding to exclude guild navigators for instance but yeah,2024-03-08 20:13:28
what action didnt do it for you the small battles the large battles the hand to hand battles the all out war,2024-03-02 21:52:06
"i have not read the books but i am aware of some of the events that happened in the first 2 novels

the holy war does happen billions of people die due to the jihad are you saying that all of these people died because the great houses peacefully accepted paul as the new emperor

i think this is just another instance of the director going directly to the point the holy war is inevitable because the great houses need control of the spice  the spice must flow and paul and by extension the fremen who have sabotaged spice production for years is now in control of the spice

the emperor surrendered because he entered into a trap  his whole sardaukar army was wiped out thats why he surrendered had he been in orbit he would have joined the great houses into defying paul as the selfproclaimed new emperor

i see no contradictions here",2024-03-06 19:11:32
"that doesnt change everything because it doesnt change the main theme of the story which is what actually matters not mechanical plot details

thats not to say everything works perfectly well there are many things which can be criticized logically but the point of a story isnt to assemble the most logical series of events",2024-03-06 19:13:00
lol then i hope you dont write an actual review anywhere online until you watched them both in order of course you missed all the nuances that make the movies stand out this is not an action flick and you have some clear misunderstandings if you now think that paul and his mother are in a favourable position,2024-03-09 23:52:05
"well you dont know jack about dune if you didnt watch the first one

the first dune is literally world building where a lot of things are explained and shown

dune 2 is where they can actually start unleashing everything now that people know a bit about the universe

you  yourself by watching 2 before 1",2024-03-10 05:52:27
paul is turning into a ruthless manipulative messiah who will sacrifice billions of people for his own thirst for revengepower how is that the journey of a hero,2024-03-04 08:10:19
"it seems like one of those reddit circle jerks to be honest

except its far from reddit alone where part two is getting nearuniversal high praise from lol

cinemascore thats based on audience polls straight out of theatres of a  rotten tomatoes audience score of 95 critics 93  9 on imdb letterboxd rating of 465 and had an opening weekend bigger than oppenheimers

its still totally fine for you to hate this or any other movie ofc  but pretentious af to dismiss real quantifiable success both critical  commercial as merely one of those reddit circlejerks just because you personally disliked it",2024-03-05 20:04:58
i dont see how hes not chalamet looks just like him maybe ill find a pic of that scene later and we can fight about it,2024-03-09 08:27:40
maybe it’s a future version of paul and they chose an older actor ,2024-03-09 22:44:10
kind of yeah,2024-03-01 19:51:51
i think its more that youre not really making sense do you mean the lynch one was garbage so that any adaptation of dune will also be garbage,2024-03-01 18:20:46
riding the worms was a major element of the books you might as well pull the ride of the rohirim out of lotr,2024-03-03 20:52:10
she was acting as his truthsayer telling the emperor if they were lying or not,2024-03-01 13:56:36
well also i think those lazer weapons cause shields to go nucleur in lore idk if that was mentioned in the movies tho,2024-03-02 00:59:24
he was going to play count fenring husband of margot fenring which was played by léa seydoux,2024-03-02 17:52:13
i don’t know that it was ever announced ,2024-03-02 17:42:11
right after paul passes the test if you couldnt control your impulses like an animal we could not let you live is the exact quote,2024-03-02 20:13:20
the point of the gom jabbar  to determine whether someone is an animal or a human failing the test means you get stabbed in the neck with a gom jabbar needle in the books the baron is killed by pauls sister alia with the atreides gom jabbar so its a multilayered reference,2024-03-02 20:12:51
it was,2024-03-02 22:41:41
it’s what he should’ve said,2024-03-14 02:20:46
" i think he went a separate way when they were on the worms you can see him turning left with chani looking at him a bit confusedworried
so my guess would be that chani went with the others to a safe place while paul went straight to the temple

that makes sense i didn’t notice it will check on next rewatch 

 as for where they got the helicopter i didnt think too much about it they probably got it after killing harkonnens or they stole it

my point about it is related to first i thought that temple was close to the town they were going no helicopter needed on the other hand why would she not use a worm to get there but yeah i could be just overthinking it",2024-03-03 03:34:52
my reaction was that she probably used the ornithopter because she heard paul was dying and it was an emergency situation,2024-03-04 14:26:00
i can’t blame you i did the same in my first watch,2024-03-04 06:34:53
i heard echoes of his gladiator score at the end credits still very powerful overall i enjoyed it,2024-03-06 08:14:09
"yeah me too or at least that it was so quick they said no so he’s going to war like can’t they have a nice chin wag first did they tell the great houses that the emperor set them up that detail felt rushed and kinda lazy perhaps it expands in part 3

i have not read the books",2024-03-03 17:12:50
well if you think about it they pretty much had a hostage situation threatening to bomb the spice that forced the emperor to react that way its like if putin threatened to nuke everyone unless they accept him as world emperor,2024-03-03 22:23:30
"freedom for arrakis requires setting in motion events that condemn billions to die  if not through violence then through hunger and disease

spice is that important to intergalactic society",2024-04-07 20:41:11
you relate to the character more when you understand their full intentions behind their decision making rather them being a means to an end,2024-03-17 22:20:02
reverent mother hes not the messaih hes just a naughty boy,2024-04-09 13:13:42
"yeah that’s a point that people keep glossing over i could be reading it wrong but i also got the impression that that was a major point of the book and the movies we spend lots of time spent debating over if something is prophecy or coincidence if someone is a prophet or a charlatan faith vs calculation but at the end of the day who cares what really is the difference between a “true” prophecy and a centuries long plot to make something come to pass

what is the difference between a messianic superhuman figure and just a boy who “happens” to liberate a people through his ability to calculate the future and command others what matters is the impact on humans as individuals and societies and ultimately the “religion” and one’s beliefdisbelief is a thin veneer over it",2024-03-03 14:15:37
ya its a planted prophecy that was made into reality through long time planning,2024-03-03 18:35:56
“this whole thing is a reverse pincer operation”,2024-03-04 20:16:29
na it doesn’t profohecy unfolds to a tee for his son that’s who the prophecy is really about and who does what paul doesn’t do,2024-03-10 23:53:58
"a there are no self fulfilling prophesies in this story this is book based and i am still trying to map how much of was actuallly transmitted in the movie so please bear with me

1 the kwisatz haderach is a goal that causes the  bene geserit’s to treat humanity as cattle for millenniums  their immense plan is literally wrecked at the last minute by jessica’s having a boy paul  their literally plan failed because they needed a girl

what with the massive breeding project there are lots of potential khs paul is the first to get across the finish line  shades of the  and the egg really  honestly one of herbert’s best subtle metaphors in my opinion 

2  the messianic prophesy  in the books it is very much more explicit  the prophesy is there because the bene geserite bg have intentionally made sure all the poor people have a messianic story to call upon every planet and every culture not matter where in an entire galaxy the poor people have a messianic story at the ready 

it’s a tool carefully and specifically seeded as soon as possible  the bg literally call the bgs whose job it to seed the messianic story “missionaria protectiva”  really  near pig latin that name

any bg who finds herself in these seeded cultures has a range of techniques specifically taught that allow her to take over the messianic story to her advantage…aka protection  


to call the messianic prophesy a self fulfilling prophesy would be saying the cold reading was prophesy   


 the messianic prophesy is left so nebulous that any bg can use the story at anytime and in any way they need if you the bg need a moses a merlin a christ a buddha a muhammad a john smith a hubbard a jim jones a tammy fae etc etc… you can manipulate the story to include what you need

to give a different version of what a successful self fulfilling prophesy might looks like  i recommend scalzi’s “the android dream”  

 tldr

the quote unquote messianic prophesy is literally horse  there is no connection to paul jessica or the kwisatz haderach  is just literally a tool built  to allow any bg to seize control of a population 

the  kwisatz haderach is the breeding program  there are a bunch of people who could have been the kh paul is the first over the line 

paul being first across the line wasn’t the bg plan but in doing so gave humanity its greatest chance of permanent survival but wow does it go evil",2024-04-01 02:17:25
"us you are a self fulfilling prophecy

jessica ooooooh so im a witch

us close you are a ",2024-03-26 10:58:22
"i really wanna disagree with you and yet i can’t think why i wanna disagree with you    


it is like some how you triggered my indignation reaction while actually saying something i kinda agree with",2024-04-01 00:41:58
might be late and dont want to be spoiled with all the knowledge we have now past the fanaticism and holy wars it just gives me a bad feeling in my stomach how much of society is just being misled and taken advantage of especially people like the fremen as a person that lives in a country colonized by greed and religion driven conquests from the west just makes my blood boil a bit hahaha,2024-04-07 09:12:26
i think they meant it as a lie but i think something about the planet or the people of the planet itself implanted the idea in the order,2024-04-08 03:42:56
they say it in passing in the first movie but i think it was important to get some manipulation onscreen to make it  completely unambiguous to the audience that paul isnt an actual mystical chosen one,2024-03-04 23:42:45
i think they brought it more to the forefront because a lot of people somehow missed that the whole savior thing wasnt meant to be good jessica being more evil and chani explicitly stating that the religion is there to control them make it harder for people to miss the message,2024-03-06 16:13:46
"i dont think i agree the prophecy is pretty explicitly a lie  the entire religion is manufactured to give the bene gessert a lever over the fremen and paul seizes the lever and uses it to gain power

jessicas role in this movie is to encourage the religion and help it grow something that wouldnt be needed if this was a true mystical prophecy being fulfilled  paul fulfills the prophecy because the prophecy was twisted by jessica to make sure it happened  that doesnt mean paul is an actual chosen one",2024-03-12 13:43:26
good that is a major part of the books  every thing about the messianic prophesy is  in the book  everything about the bloodline breeding manipulation is horrifically true,2024-04-01 03:14:44

"i think the evolution of stilgar across the two movies captures that emotion youre describing

hes a gruff nononsense leader in part 1 and then his religious side leads him to being the comic relief in the first half of part 2 but while his delivery never changes the laughter in my theater got more awkward and forced and by the end of the movie it had died out completely  its supposed to be troubling to see such a capable human fall completely into blind fanaticism and the movie doesnt pull any punches on it",2024-03-04 18:29:49
the first book literally has an excerpt inuniverse about how paul would end up killing families women and children for his rise to the throne among other excerpts detailing other messed up stuff he does it was very clear in the first book its just that a lot of people lack reading comprehension or glossed over it he made messiah almost exclusively because people didnt understand the message unless paul directly said im like genghis khan and that other mustache dictator but way worse,2024-03-05 01:36:35

should have just done the elvis voice ,2024-03-04 12:36:58
it didnt quite seem to fit but i think it still worked,2024-03-03 14:43:23
poor things in reverse ,2024-03-08 11:50:09
true but i was hoping the film would improve on that aspect of the book from a pure screentime perspective it’s pretty close to the book but the emperor comes off as a complete clown the whole time if you haven’t read the book,2024-03-03 07:57:47
im soooo glad i watched the movie before any trailer i watched them afterwards and they spoil several of the greatest scenes in the movie,2024-03-05 04:54:34
agreed with this finally just saw the movie this weekend and i was actually super glad no one spoiled for me that christopher  walken was in this,2024-04-01 11:50:58
so how do you avoid trailers you show up at the exact time to the theater when the movie starts,2024-03-07 06:01:21
im sure the other houses had nukes too paul wasnt talking about nuking the houses he threatened to nuke the spice fields no spice no interstellar travel no power,2024-03-19 05:41:44
the tragedy of paul atreides is that he was a good man who consumed by vengeance became a monster one of the things that i loved about the book was how he wanted to avoid the holy war but as time came to pass he was unable to stop it so he chose the lesser evil to become the monster,2024-03-20 02:19:16
because the emperor still has uses to him ie marrying his daughter to him and abdicating in order to secure a peaceful transfer of power instead of a galactic war the barons life had no usefulness,2024-03-07 15:26:27
it also worked well as a parallel of the first film the harkonnens brutally murdered the atreides in part one and here paul and the fremen strike back with an equal streak of mercilessness he even says that we will be harkonnens then its not the heroic battle of triumph against all odds its a complete curbstomp that makes you think paul is going too far,2024-03-18 02:02:03
"that makes it so much colder

grandfather

you die like an animal",2024-03-04 22:40:36
na at thisnpoint he would’ve been talking to the genetic memory of the baron since his spice agony he knows the man better than harkonnen knows himself,2024-03-11 00:28:47
chani was really changed for the better i think her being the one fremen that sees him just as a man i think is an interesting story beat and will be interesting to see what they do with her in pt3,2024-03-04 01:58:46
pauls rise happening over years makes more sense i kept thinking this was all happening a little too quickly,2024-03-10 07:16:38
will have to see what they do to remedy that in the pt3 they are working on i dont know how you dont bring back chani for messiah,2024-03-04 01:59:08
nah some weird is just dumb,2024-03-04 00:25:40
same effects that lady jessica suffered too,2024-04-08 13:29:35
yes i wanted some powerade blue it looks the same shade lol also every time they showed someone drinking it i would take a sip of my soda which is brown not blue but a man can dream i guess,2024-03-03 09:55:53
oh wow that sounds weird very good change then,2024-03-02 23:03:40
please explain how please,2024-03-02 23:33:18
i need an alternative cut where every time paul opens his mouth to say something stilgar shouts lisan alghaib and paul keeps getting increasingly frustrated,2024-03-10 01:13:12
yeah i think we just saw a moment of recognition,2024-03-06 10:44:42
didn’t this film reframe those visions as him communing with his vision of his ‘spirit’ through the spice,2024-03-05 22:01:12
i was cracking up whenever he was on screen tje rest of the cinema wasnt though such a good role for him and a very necessary comic relief,2024-03-02 23:29:37
hes obviously done comedy before but hes underappreciated as a comic actor,2024-03-03 12:22:29
"we saw it yesterday and weve already made gaspas written a regular saying in our housefamily

predict the endingnext scene of a show  gasp as written

idiot cutting you off on the freeway  gasp as written",2024-03-04 03:31:22
he was phenomenal a fantastic comedic bit that was also totally believable in the context of the film and didn’t take you out of the immersion at all masterfully done,2024-03-04 20:39:04
my theater had a good chuckle when he said that such a good way to introduce the right amount of comic relief in an otherwise serious movie,2024-03-03 20:28:56
and right before saying the line you can see him squinting his eyes when he realizes,2024-03-04 13:09:03
that scene reminded me so much of life of brian,2024-03-08 20:18:12
“it is known”,2024-03-03 13:33:11
i almost choked on a reese’s pieces when he said that  javier absolutely killed the delivery of his lines dude went full spectrum in this movie ,2024-03-11 02:56:01
“that is exactly why he is the one” or something along those lines had me dead lol,2024-03-12 02:53:12
it has me wondering if this intentional for denis pointing out evangelical insanity,2024-03-15 03:04:09
he got all the laughs in the theater tonight loved what he added to the movie,2024-03-10 07:30:10
he’s basically morpheus to paul’s neo and i’m so here for it,2024-03-15 23:35:53
i love how hes being so serious but everything he said was hilarious my theater wasnt very talkative thankfully but his lines got some giggles,2024-03-12 22:32:30
honestly if javier hammed it up in little mermaid as he did in this it wouldve been amazing,2024-03-17 01:11:03
straight up life of brian style too,2024-03-21 02:19:42
"that was an amazing scene  

stilgars relentless cheerleading never got old in bardems capable hands",2024-04-08 18:52:33
this was the first thing it came to my mind when i saw that scene and for the remainder of the movie every time he hyped paul i would laugh,2024-03-03 23:17:20
wouldn’t bet against this not having been what inspired villneuve for this scene,2024-03-10 23:17:52
it didnt even occur to me to find it funny while watching i just found it sad how utterly brain washed he was by the bene gesserit and thinking how guilty it must make paul feel every time i do see the humour now people mention it but youre right its not just that,2024-03-24 16:26:31
yeah im glad they portrayed both the disturbing cult side and the innate absurdity of the fanaticism,2024-03-18 08:15:38
"it can be a bad thing and no not every movie needs levity to make the dramatic stuff hit harder  what kind of marvel idiotic  statement is that


and it can also be a bad thing if its the wrong character to bring the levity 


this movie is more popular because  goes down and it has more closure not because of the levity ",2024-03-07 07:20:13
general audiences,2024-03-18 15:37:34
good point my question still stands as to how they are gonna develop his character from here on ,2024-03-03 10:03:56
"anya taylor joys character is born during the events of dune and is basically a genius space witch toddler she gets kidnapped which is why the fremen attack the emperor also shes the one that kills the baron with the space witch needle

chani follows paul the whole way instead of being opposed to him last scene implies shes gonna rise up against paul which is way off track to the plot of messiah",2024-03-10 23:48:27
i mean also the fact that we dont know for sure that he is not the messiah why are there so many nonbelievers in here,2024-03-07 07:57:48
that’s a better argument start with that my comment is specifically on the first part of your first comment,2024-03-01 19:59:32
this version of stilgar is largely present in messiah so im sure this would be a large part of the 3rd movie,2024-03-01 21:32:05
"i am bothered by some of the comments ive seen around here seeming sometimes to celebrate fayd as somehow the least evil harkonnen lol but with that said

the one very interesting thing about him was that he uses a concept of honor to maintain selfcontrol and prevent himself from falling into psychotic chaos thats my read on him but because he is in fact a psychopath he also sees honor as a game a bizarre funny falsehood

him repeating may your knife chip and shatter gave me chills because he was at once both entering into pauls and the fremens system of honor fullheartedly giving respect for what he recognized as a system for maintaining control and mocking it as a joke all at the same time

and butler did a really good job letting all that show in his manner and  expressions",2024-03-03 23:22:22
and that ending is actually a major aspect of historically combat   the side that collapses first gets slaughtered,2024-04-01 03:22:40
during the spice harvester raid i kept thinking how exhausted they must be from full sprinting and fighting through all that deep sand that  is no joke and they were going,2024-04-03 14:58:10
yeah i’m pretty sure i came a little when i watched it today,2024-03-05 23:22:21
that doesnt contradict what they said,2024-03-24 03:43:47
triple twirl was the dumbest part of the entire movie,2024-03-21 13:44:15
i don’t think the point is that it ruined the fight it’s that it’s not technical and grimy and i agree i don’t know what you are talking about it was pretty flashy stuff,2024-03-03 14:21:52
why are you acting like what he said was wrong you said it wasnt overly choreographed and he told that indeed it was then act like child when he pointed it out,2024-03-03 19:01:27
his fights are amazing,2024-03-18 13:38:32
she didnt expect paul to be the one to suggest it and be so upfront about it she probably figured she would have to manipulate the situation but the fact that paul is the one dictating the terms takes away her own initiative,2024-03-04 03:46:54
yes but not which guy took her a moment to recover from thinking she was shacking up with feyd after he stabbed paul twice a few seconds ago,2024-03-14 06:32:14
"not only can he see his own death he sees countless variations of his own death in different ways his vision isnt completely perfect however some of the characters from the book cut from the movie highlight his blind spots and the limitations of his foresight which he becomes more aware of and tries to work around it as a result   
for example an important aspect of his threat to destroy the spice that is made explicit in the book is that without spice everyone addicted to it will die of withdrawal and all the prescience will be blinded the consequences of his threats are far more devastating and far reaching than in the movie version even if they would lead to the death of him and everyone around him",2024-03-02 16:29:15
the way it builds up over the movie was incredible he started it falling in love with chani saying that what he wanted was simply to be her equal resisting the prophecy and his mothers words about needing to save himself for a political marriage then he ended it by fully committing to everything he had originally wanted to avoid and becoming a full blown religious leader,2024-03-03 16:38:15
"the best  about his ability in the movies i don’t know if it’s in the books i’ve only read a little of the first one is his relationship with jamis who’s apparently his best friend who taught him a lot of the fremen ways he still thinks of jamis’s advice when making important decisions



you know jamis the guy he killed when they first met



after the water of life his abilities are amplified a million fold how many friends like jamis does he have in there with him now",2024-03-05 18:06:20
"the book does include one person who can understand paul in that scene lady fenrings husband

here is a quote from the book right after feyd rauthas death  
slowly fenring moved his head a prolonged turning until he faced paul  

do it the emperor hissed  

the count focused on paul seeing with eyes his lady margot had trained in the bene gesserit ways aware of the mystery and hidden grandeur about this atreides youth  

i could  him fenring thought  and he knew this for the truth  

something in his own secretive depths stayed the count then and he glimpsed briefly inadequately the advantage he held over paul  a way of hiding from the youth a furtiveness of person and motives that no eye could   

paul aware of some of this from the way the time nexus boiled understood at last why he had never seen fenring along the webs of prescience fenring was one of the mighthavebeens an almost kwisatz haderach crippled by a flaw in the genetic patterns  a eunach his talent concentrated into furtiveness and inner seclusion a deep compassion for the count flowed through paul the first sense of brotherhood hed ever experienced  

fenring reading pauls emotion said majesty i must refuse

i would also clarify that paul doesnt quite see everything  

the book includes epigraphs before each chapter that are written as in universe historical texts written by princess irulan this one comes while paul and jessica are fleeing into the desert  
muaddib could indeed see the future but you must understand the limits of
this power think of sight you have eyes yet cannot see without light if you
are on the floor of a valley you cannot see beyond your valley just so
muaddib could not always choose to look across the mysterious terrain he tells
us that a single obscure decision of prophecy perhaps the choice of one word
over another could change the entire aspect of the future he tells us the
vision of time is broad but when you pass through it time becomes a narrow
door and always he fought the temptation to choose a clear safe course
warning that path leads ever down into stagnation  
from arrakis awakening by the princess irulan",2024-03-03 00:26:03
the bg aren’t calling him an abomination he’s their messiah they’re just  they can’t control him they’re calling his unborn sister abomination because her mind was opened to all past lives before she was born she’ll never have her own mind she’s an amalgamation of every one of them at war in her head at all times what mind she does have will have to chart this corse she’s the abomination  ,2024-03-08 17:44:55
bingo you nailed it that practically is what the second book entails and why i’m so excited for the third movie,2024-03-02 16:28:09
“abomination” is important for later on too especially in the third book,2024-03-03 22:30:51
im thinking eren yeager would understand his situation pretty pretty well considering there are a  ton of parallels between the two of them,2024-03-03 16:20:43
he did seen variations of his own death even before drinking the water of life even worse his death didnt end the galactic holy war that was made in his name what he couldnt see is a way to avoid holy war and all the destruction he only saw the narrow path after he drank,2024-03-10 10:49:38
is this just a case of manifest destiny  selffulfilling prophecy what if he didnt drink the poison and didnt see does one of the alternates happen instead  supposedly the paths with more deaths so since he can see all the paths and the paths are written how difficult can it be to execute the one he decides is the least awful since its predestined this wasnt done well in the film at all,2024-03-05 13:32:03
this is some attack on titan ,2024-03-10 11:42:47
jessica even warns him of becoming too attached to chani early in the film she tell him to save his marriage for a political purpose,2024-03-19 13:19:24
it feels like even less of choice because he would still have to keep fighting harkonnens and as we saw eventually they will stop underestimating the fremen and really come to wipe them out at some point he would have to stand up and be the guy,2024-03-04 05:10:21
huh that’s a good view it seemed odd to me because i was thinking “why didn’t he just fight the harkonen let the great houses know about the betrayal but not try and seize the throne directly” but if the holy war was the best path then well makes a lot of sense why he did it,2024-03-05 01:10:43
"he doesn’t sterilise every planet in his jihad some come to his side more readily than others and a part of that is the legitimacy that irulan provides 

he’s always trying to do damage control on what he sees in his visions even where it might only be limited in effect 

but idk entirely iirc that argument is never expressly analysed",2024-03-05 13:33:58
you should give the books a go,2024-03-06 18:14:22
well considering how pretty much everything scifi and fantasy takes a little from dune you would be correct,2024-03-23 02:35:29
"im coming around to her character being used as the personification of pauls inner monologue but that just makes me wish they showed the horrible future that paul explained to her over the course of the years of their life they spent together

ill say this if they can pull it all back around for messiah ill eat crow on complaining about these changes",2024-03-03 16:47:55
i agree i’ve only watched the movies but chani and paul’s conversation about fremen culture and equality really resonated in the scene where chani refuses to bow to paul she loved him as her equal not as a ruler,2024-03-10 21:42:30
"i wish they would have done it without just making it romance drama though 

it took up a lot of time that mught have been spent talking about why all of this stuff is going on 

the time compression also hurts a lot imo compressing literally years worth of progress into the span of like 4 months is pretty insane",2024-03-04 02:53:16
im coming around on chani being the characterization of pauls inner monologues from the books but the whole marriage vs love thing is still handled poorly its a recurring thing in the story duke leto loved jessica but didnt marry her to keep his political options available  paul inherits jamis wife and family and its a big deal that he takes harah as a servant and not a wife,2024-03-03 14:03:43
"well yes the strong empowered woman plays well with the audience but that isnt the book chani

kind of like arwen going toetotoe with the nazgul in the book arwen is a simpering maiden who likes embroidering and crossstitch 

yes times have changed since both books were written but do we honestly need revisionist characters or can they stay true to the original source material",2024-03-03 09:52:44
the comment said “under the covers” fremen sleep tents recycle water internally how else were they going to get laid,2024-03-05 18:36:50
the first movie opens with chani too so i wonder if they’re doing this to frame it as her being the central emotional core for the audience as paul becomes less and less human moving forward,2024-03-03 13:17:55
i get you but in a way it also honors the last line in the first dune book history will call us wives at least in spirit i suspect theyll find a way to include that line in messiah maybe with jessica and chani reconciling somehow,2024-03-03 19:12:02
chani will go on to create something that changes the fate of dune far more that paul ever could,2024-03-03 22:37:10
the stone cold casualness with which he drops “she’ll come around” as well dude is unbothered,2024-03-07 11:12:20
"yeah a lot of people in here seem to be reducing her reactions down to her just being sad because she loves paul


paul turned her entire world upside down hes basically doing the equivalent of stomping into her house and saying he owns the place",2024-03-07 11:55:03
i think thats more a reflection on modern social mores depicted in media modern audiences just wouldnt be comfortable with a submissive female character in a big budget film,2024-03-02 21:01:33
"paul states himself that he will never touch her its on the last page of the first book

i think it was weird and kind of lame that they left that important part out of the movie seems like they just wanted to invoke a feeling of drama",2024-03-04 05:29:21
havent read the book but i feel like it was pretty clear in this movie that she really is the only one that doesnt seem him as a messiah or ,2024-03-10 09:17:15
she isnt  at him taking a wife for political reasons she is  because she watched him take advantage of her peoples religious zealotry to use them as pawns to secure his own revenge and power,2024-03-18 17:10:41
"yes i too am appalled that the child raised by a concubine being told he will be the  emperor of the universe when he grows up does not have a healthy understanding of relationship boundaries

easily the most disgusting thing in a film featuring genocide eugenics slavery and sexism",2024-03-18 17:15:35
… they struggle greatly in messiah with that big plot point actually,2024-03-04 02:33:46
"really wish wb had gone all out and made it immersive by adding the smell of spices to the theatre


as it happened in my local imax all i had the delight of smelling was someones cabbagebrocolli farts for 3 hours ",2024-03-04 11:03:23
i saw the bts video of a guy loading an imax projector looks like you need a four year college degree to do it it was a 20 or 40 minute video,2024-03-04 14:59:39
"they got it in imax from 7am  11pm starts here

almost endgame levels when they were literally running 247 showings",2024-03-04 06:16:33
what is this a theatre for ants,2024-03-03 05:39:17
just got out of a 70mm imax showing that was  near a religious experience,2024-03-22 20:22:03
i have a surround home theatre set up with a beefy sub i could definitely feel the worms in the first film im looking forward to it coming out on bluray,2024-03-16 01:49:32
i was sick when i saw it and that thumper almost made me lose my lunch,2024-03-04 15:00:50
yeah i was kinda disappointed i couldnt get imax seats but all of the sand worm scenes felt like a legitimate roller coaster in dolby so i couldnt be happier,2024-03-03 07:02:08
i wish i could see that scene again on a loop,2024-03-04 15:01:31
"ive read a couple comments here saying dolby atmos sound is better can i ask your opinion if the sound was loud enough to hurt my ears in imax do you think it will be the same in dolby 

i want to see the film again and i dont mind loudness exactly but i just felt ear pain during a lot of the imax showing and it took away from my experience 

i think this isnt a widespread problem since i scanned around the theater and nobody else seemed bothered",2024-03-15 23:00:03
"was the sound loud enough to cause pain in your ears this was my experience in imax and i wanted to see the film again so im wondering about dolby atmos now 

the ear pain was the biggest detector for me and im not sure how common that is 

thanks in advance",2024-03-15 23:01:36
wait does atmos have vibrating seats or do you mean the audio just made the seats vibrate,2024-03-04 15:02:23
“liemax” is such a lame nickname considering overwhelming majority aren’t 143 in reality it just depends on the theater because they’re all built different i enjoyed my viewing in my local laser imax which has a better sound system than the 143 one an hour away much more than my dolby viewing,2024-03-13 03:55:28
definitely not the same dolby has an insane sub system some of the scenes straight up felt like an earthquake as it should for some scenes no normal theater or even liemax even comes close,2024-03-09 07:23:48
it absolutely makes a difference i really miss it when its not there it just magically walks this precipice of being 1mm away from being too loud  the bass makes my bones vibrate,2024-03-12 09:51:44
"i actually did and dune 2 topped that although i will add the caveat that since interstellar i have a better understanding and appreciation of film

but i do remember feeling the interstellar runtime whereas dune 2 is paced really well everything about it is amazing and i may consider it one of the best if not the best scifi films and as much as i enjoyed the first dune i could never motivate myself to watch it again but already have tickets to see part 2 again next week

honestly between the sound and visuals imax was really immersive",2024-03-07 02:20:33
idk if anything can beat interstellar in imax just got out of dune 2 and while it was a 1010 nothing will beat that imax experience,2024-03-11 03:11:47
daly citys cinemark whats your thoughts on it versus amc metreon in downtown with 70mm,2024-03-26 08:18:58
jacksonville,2024-03-03 00:53:07
i tried the premium seats last time i went which are recliner seats at the back but i wasnt able to fully recline as my legs were still touching the seat in front of me,2024-03-20 21:05:01
"yeah feel you for sure only got an old 40something inch and while it was still a great movie nowhere near the same thing as the theatre experience of 2049  had me just hanging out at the theatre parkade staring out at the city thinking about the film for like half an hour lol

can see how missing out on the theatre experience of dune 1 would lack comparatively but i’d also say part 2 is an even better experience all around each get an extra point in the theatre vs at home for me but the second is also a point ahead all to say if you were gonna catch one of the two in theatres you got the right one lol",2024-03-04 03:50:59
a film about about someone leaving their world for new adventures i see the connection lol,2024-03-09 17:38:15
"just watched both for the first time this week

the first movie had nearly zero story its like the entire movie is exposition without explanation some paragraphs at the start ala star wars to explain the status of things before we begin would have helped a lot 

characters had zero reason to care for them and then theyre killed off the doctors betrayal isnt telegraphed in a meaningful way nor is it satisfying when he gets his instant karma for his treason at the hands of a faction he should know not to trust to keep a deal in good faith duncan is set up as this amazing warrior and boy was that character wasted given the time establishing him and the vision of his death the voice gets these big scenes but has nearly zero payoff in either movie

the second movie had too many vignettes of the progression of paul joining the fremen without any satisfying character development paul is really flat imo until he takes the water of life thats like 4 hours of film with a character that is barely surface level because as i understand it the book does all of this growth internally and doesnt translate without narration

the films are beautiful and sound amazing but it feels like theres an entire iceberg of missing information beyond what we get yet theres so much bloat of long shots of desert and visions of chani not speaking at least the emperors daughter gets a journal to narrate her thoughts something like that for paul would have gone a long way to deepening the attachment and growth",2024-03-31 17:49:38
yeah many fans love the story but i just dont know if theyll make great movies,2024-03-07 12:44:29
to each their but things kept getting weirder  more convoluted imo i’ll avoid specific for spoiler purposes but i really wasn’t into multiple characters coming back from the dead,2024-03-05 13:00:50
"i dont know for my part i love the story and the characters and i am really invested in the universe and what happens after many mileniums so i had to keep reading the books i arrived at heretics and havent had the chance to read past it but heretics was entertaining  emperor was strange but allows you to tie a knot to the descendants of paul and where is it all going and yes it is definitely weird 

children of dune is entertaining and i would say more entertaining than messiah it adds to the lore by telling us what happens with pauls sister and it is somehow similar to the first book 

strictly speaking about the film i can see why it would need to end on messiah it ends paul journey and it is a closing to his jihad and aspirations the rest of books excluding children i dont think would make a good movie but who knows",2024-03-21 07:07:27
not to mention spice withdrawal is deadly so the threat was suicidal,2024-03-08 06:12:55
one of the things i was sad to see cut was gurneys first meeting with jessica as he had been under the impression she was the traitor it was a good scene in the book,2024-03-19 15:34:19
the one scene in pt1 i would have liked to see was the dinner scene early in the first book shows just how much scheming is going on everywhere behind the curtains but would have added so much to extra to the movie that was understandably cut,2024-04-03 15:32:12
such a great job of cutting the story to the correct minimum  mentats not actually useful to paul’s story,2024-04-01 04:07:13
i appreciate these movies so much cuz its helped fill in a few holes i had when reading its nice to be able to put a face to the name sometimes,2024-03-02 00:48:55
"does the movie fight play out the same as in the book


i know in the book feyd has a poisoned dagged he cuts paul with


but does paul let himself get stabbed i didnt gather from the movie that he allowed himself to get stabbed but maybe i missed something",2024-03-03 07:22:54
" im only thru book 3

probably stop after the next one it gets really boring and silly and then herberts kid decided we all needed to know the history of checks notes gravitydefying lamps

def skip all the brian herbert stuff",2024-03-02 13:37:47
doesnt in the book he distract him i will not say the word because feyd has the atreides soldier programmed in the arena to freeze by saying a secret word,2024-03-04 21:50:32
feint within feint within feints,2024-03-03 19:50:36
i couldnt get into  emperor the first 2 books are masterpieces imo children is good  emperor is just idk it hasnt clicked with me,2024-03-04 13:13:31
so i thought since he could see the future he knew what to do to win or does it not work on specifics like this,2024-03-05 07:33:23
how did paul survive those stabbings he looked unfazed after the fight was over,2024-03-08 23:02:33
wasn’ a poison blade in the book or am i wrong i swear i remember a poison blade,2024-03-13 04:23:06
"i wanted to respond to this again especially this part 

 he knows if he gets closer to death  bring more emotions out of her he still does love her and needs her to really cherish his existence

what emotions do you think paul is trying to bring out why do presume that i dont understand his feelings for her havent changed why do you think chani does not cherish his existence

idk this just reads like some weird red pill rhetoric like paul is just using chani in a cynical sociopathic sort of way like the bene gesserit used all the people that led to his creation

one of the whole conceits of pauls character is that hes both mortal but cursed with nearomniscience he just wants to chill with his friends in the desert and be chanis partner but instead he is called to walk the golden path in order to break the stranglehold that people like the bene gesserit and the harkonnens had over the galaxy

chani is basically the only relationship he can be real in to suggest that he would violate that by manipulating chani goes against what i see as fundamental aspects of his character and the overall story vis a vis the duality of contentment and purpose",2024-03-03 08:37:28
ive read through the first 6 books so im aware of where the story goes i dont remember him ever doing anything from an angle of emotionally manipulating chani,2024-03-01 23:48:42
ive read that chanis role was changed compared to how she behaves in book so she might have a very different role in messiah movie,2024-03-03 14:27:43
what if paul is playing dead after drinking the water of life and waits for chani to do the tears thing to power up his life signals again,2024-03-03 22:43:35
feyd rautha stabs paul twice once with the emperors blade and the other with paul’s knife if i remember correctly paul uses the blade that was in his abdomen to stab feyd when they’re locked together,2024-03-01 19:40:12
the knife he pulls from his shoulder is feyds knife he redirected feyds  into his shoulder while he pulled the other knife from his side to put the killing blow on feyd,2024-03-01 20:28:20
"denis movies really reward repeat viewings he packs a lot of detail that is often quite subtle into the films

this whole fight is setup over the course of both movies in many ways

for instance

the first time paul kills a man it is in a fair fight where he is almost matched and he almost dies because he tries to let jamis yield then his killing blow is quick nearinstant no flourish death job done

this is contrasted with the introduction of feyd who routinely kills for pleasure against people who are no match to him and he draws the moment out to both increase the suffering of his opponent and the spectacle of the fight

as others have noted the feyd  paul fight is foreshadowed in pauls training fight with gurney paul lands a killing blow on gurneys neck but gurney also has a killing blow on pauls abdomen in the feyd  paul fight paul takes gurneys place deflects the blow to his neck and uses the knife feyd had stabbed him with to deliver the killing blow to feyds abdomen",2024-03-08 21:19:59
he knew he deserved that slap,2024-03-02 07:48:49
no it doesn’t,2024-03-05 03:45:09
"jeepers grammar police are tedious but since you started youre not even right that the usage is improper

 in causation in the law from oxford university press the term mortal wound is given three meanings i an injury that is likely to cause death to an average person under normal circumstances ii an injury that has a high likelihood of causing the victim death if left untreated medically iii an injury that is likely to cause death even though it does not apply to the first two circumstances eg a minor injury neglected by the victim",2024-03-06 10:38:24
"honestly thats a pretty  up interpretation

he doesnt have perfect future vision the books discuss and the movie makes clear that his visions are only glimpses 

he was able to  feyd only by taking the wound he saw the dagger in his side in the vision and assumed that was a future where he died but then in the moment it happened he realized it was the thing he needed to best feyd",2024-03-05 17:50:12
it’s already foreshadowed in the first movie i’m not sure why you’re leaping to denis not thinking about it and not a deliberate choice knowing he gave the audience the information they needed to get that,2024-03-02 03:12:16
pretty cool fact it seems even stranger then that he looks so untrained,2024-03-03 18:34:40
"but the fremen are even better and paul is considered one of their best fighters he has been trained by the fremen the bene gesserit and the best of the atreides

the fact that a simple atreides soldier who had been kept captive gave feyd almost as good of a fight felt out of sync the book scene works because even though paul is the superior fighter straight up his wariness of feyds various tricks hidden blades and poisons levels the playing field a bit",2024-03-03 15:43:29
you’re missing the point of the comment you replied to they understand that what is being asked is if feyd is struggling against an average atreides how is he so dominant over paul some other comments point it out and i think it wasn’t emphasized enough how the atreides fighter that wasn’t drugged was one of the very best,2024-03-11 04:20:01
"what was his line 

so the buffness of the other two felt a bit full on too but the contrast made our guy look a bit lame in comparison  he didnt look lean or lithe and even a bit nerdy more a tactician or military confidant

even so why did they choose him to be undrugged were they fearful that if one of the other two beefcakes were undrugged that feyd would be in danger why did they choose the weakest looking guy to be the trophy ",2024-03-07 11:05:12
is the way rautha dies written explicitly written in the book im curious if the author goes into that kind of detail,2024-03-03 04:25:46
just to add to the chain of details in part 1 paul’s grandfather was a matador and there are multiple shots that linger on a bull’s head or a statue of his grandfather fighting a bull this alludes to how atreides are adept at counterattacking at striking when the bull is charging it is how paul kills jamis at the end of part 1  he side steps jamis as he charges and then lands the killing strike,2024-03-06 08:41:59
 good catch,2024-03-02 06:18:42
yeah i think because feyd is also a kh candidate so he can’t really see his future not sure if that’s spelled out in the book exactly  i know that’s why he can’t see fenring in the book,2024-03-01 13:43:13
"while they never get into what he knows going into that specific fight they do say a few times throughout how paul sees potential fututes even using the word branches iirc   


i didnt read the books so maybe im off here but i took pauls visions of chani dying to be what might happene if he stayed with her for his holy war which is partly why he chose the emperors daughter at the end not just out of strategy",2024-03-01 16:15:41
why did he insist on doing it alone the fremen already believe he’s the one so why does he take such unnecessary risks,2024-03-02 03:06:48
ah okay that makes more sense,2024-03-06 02:35:22
which is cheating bc they are only supposed to use the one blade ,2024-03-10 11:37:55
you saw 2 in paul too right,2024-03-06 02:35:09
"if you mean feyd vs the atreides gladiator at the end of the standoff where they are both holding the single blade feyd pulls the atreides arm forward rips the blade out with his right in and stabs him in one motion

if you mean feyd vs paul feyd manages to turn pauls blade against himself for the the stab into pauls abdomen  so he retains his own blade which paul eventually deflects into his shoulder to bait him close while paul then pulls out the blade stuck in his side stabbing and killing feyd in one motion again",2024-03-11 18:10:16
its very similar to how maximus kills commodus in gladiator the blade is close to his throat and then the next cut its in his throat especially in the made for tv edits,2024-03-26 05:18:52
ive seen the movie five times and can attest that you are correct this is what happens at the end of the fight to a tee,2024-03-16 02:50:25
yeah i figured out in my third viewing haha youre right,2024-03-11 20:10:51
the whole point which is explained better in the books of course is that paul sees the only way to win is to play into rauthas weaknesses paul lets him think he wins the fight by allowing himself to get stabbed in a nonlethal place which makes rautha relax for a split second this was foreshadowed in the way they destroy the ornithopter by attacking it when its shields are down as it fires and in the first training scene fight with gurney,2024-03-03 20:07:35
"that seems like that would be less than honorable no 

i’m gonna need someone else to chime in i don’t remember seeing him remove a dagger from his side because he does it off screen as he’s being stabbed in the shoulder and quickly stabs elvis in one motion presumably he’s holding his dagger in his hand and removes elvis’s dagger from his shoulder what does he do with this third dagger he only ever drops one dagger to the ground elvis’s and stands up holding one dagger",2024-03-01 05:08:03
no idea why youre being downvoted youre 100 right paul knew exactly how that fight was going to go down didnt it even show a brief moment of it during the water of life scene he can see the future he can see all possible outcomes this was the way,2024-03-01 11:00:17
dont know why youre getting downvoted when thats literally what happens in the book paul is simply performing with that duel not actually trying,2024-03-01 06:43:38

nope nope nope nope,2024-03-31 15:17:15

also new to the series but i think when house atreides moved to arrekis they took everything including their arsenal of nukes,2024-03-02 01:02:39
the atreides were given arrakis by the emperor in the first movie so their entire household moved there including all of their belongings they didn’t retain caladan their home world  in any official capacity,2024-03-02 01:52:28
they brought it all with them from caladan i figured,2024-03-02 03:02:19
in the book its illegal to use nukes on humans which is why paul just uses it to blast a hole in the rock wall,2024-03-04 03:26:28

i think she meant it in that lady jessica was supposed to have a daughter but disobeyed and had a son with leto  to reverend mother paul was an abomination in that he never should have been born,2024-03-11 19:55:03
100 they wanted to include the word abomination since its iconica very important concept in the first trilogy but since they decided not to include alia they didnt have the proper character to call that,2024-03-17 18:03:17
spoiler alert this is more relevant in future books fyis,2024-03-13 01:45:35
im not familiar with this whats it in reference to,2024-03-01 13:23:20
stardust memories and zardoz as well yes zardoz is unironically good and shes great in it,2024-03-03 17:56:45
is it cause paul drank the “water of life”,2024-04-07 12:21:46
i noticed that too think it was to create a visual contrast to jessica who can still be identified behind her veil the spice blue eyes also contribute to that,2024-03-02 06:42:32
its so crazy that this is such an old story at this point but i dont think i have ever seen these tropes twisted like this in anything else yet,2024-03-03 09:49:56
she seemed to say abomination directly after paul used the voice on her though as if saying it to him male’s are not supposed to use the voice if understand correctly he also was not supposed to be born lady jessica was supposed to have a female instead of paul i believe she was referring to him,2024-03-01 14:52:24
but she said abomination to paul after he silenced her,2024-03-03 15:26:07
i thought it was because men are not supposed to have the gift,2024-03-02 08:44:17
she definitely said it to paul though,2024-03-03 23:05:48

was a really clever move but they should have had jessica  the baron possibly under alias influence,2024-03-02 02:27:16

"i hate to admit youre right

they had to do the whole aila is cognizant as a fetus which would be hard enough for people not familiar with the source material to understand

i know a big movie buff whos probably not going to like the alia character because they dont like reading as much",2024-03-02 06:17:59
i believe in the first one they set it up as well with jessica getting  for teaching paul the voice in the first place when she shouldnt ,2024-03-04 04:08:50
i dont know if you have read the books but abomination has a specific meaning to the bgs,2024-03-03 20:30:58
as a fellow book reader i actually thought it was better having paul do it in the movie,2024-03-01 06:42:55
based on the fact that she wasn’t born by the end of the movie there is no time gap in the film it all happens within less than 9 months,2024-03-01 06:43:24
my only complaint with the movie borrowed the books of my brother a while back and texted him leaving the theatre “no baby stabbing”,2024-03-01 13:50:51
you are wrong she is talking about fetus alia,2024-03-01 16:01:05
really seems like she’s saying it to paul though she says it immediately after he uses the voice on her she seems to be responding to that definitely confused me but made the audience crack up which was funny to hear if you don’t know the books and the significance of that word it sounds so funny,2024-03-03 05:37:08
ya that term is reserved for alia in the books i’m pretty sure but it really looked like she was saying it to paul here she does it in response to his using the voice on her,2024-03-03 05:39:10
yeah the extra bass on the voice is like a double whammy on the senses being loud is one thing but when it rumbles through you it feels like youre the one being controlled for a second,2024-03-03 01:06:53

"abomination is a term the bene gesserit used for a person who is preborn that is someone who gained prescience before birth andor had their consciousness taken over by their ansestral memories

its the matrix rave but unshowered and tripping balls,2024-03-05 01:26:01
yeah they somehow added a weird subplot that doesn’t make sense and then promptly abandoned it,2024-03-05 19:26:49

its a strand type movie ,2024-03-11 05:10:04

i wish denis was less subtle about that it definitely flipped a switch in them like knowing that they are part of that bloodthirsty clan was a green light to give in,2024-03-01 17:22:21
not sure if you read the books or not but my take from the book is that the drugs in the water helped pauls abilities to see the future past and present i dont think they did the book justice in that paul was constantly struggling to find the right path to avoid the bloody future he kept seeing,2024-03-02 02:04:19
doesnt paul say something along the lines of to survive we will become harkonnen after finding out about their heritage and then it gets pretty ruthless after that ,2024-03-06 09:56:13

obnoxious technicality but jessica was never officially married to leto atreides she definitely felt and showed more loyalty to leto and paul though,2024-03-04 00:11:49
the bg believe they are the stewards of all of humanity  the reverend mother is disappointed in jessica because shes showing loyalty to her family over the bg and by extension the species as a whole,2024-03-01 23:01:18

the brian herbert kevin anderson books made it canon that gaius helen mohaium is jessica’s mother although a lot of dune fans don’t accept their books as canon,2024-03-01 21:40:05
i think its confirmed in the appendices by ghanima i think jessica also refers to her as mother but that happens before she could even know the blood relation and is just calling her mother because she is a reverend mother and played a significant role in her training,2024-03-02 08:55:45
movie idea heist where nerds break into the studio to recover the unreleased scenes from dune after great expense cost and loss they ultimately realize that denis was right to leave them cut out,2024-03-01 22:39:06

yes he was fenring,2024-03-02 05:28:32
it’s one of those things you notice the absence of when you’ve read the books but just looking at the movies it doesn’t really impact the overall plot the first movie doesn’t show that much of thufir at least not enough to convey how important of an asset he was to the atreides and why the baron kept him alive at that point in the book he pretty much just helps to develop the baron’s own schemes to take power,2024-03-02 20:56:59
what did he do in book,2024-03-03 16:33:40

i didnt but just googled and ugh  shes perfect ,2024-03-04 01:31:57
denis al gaib,2024-03-12 08:31:16
its kinda hard to convey internal conflict of what paul wants and how his actions to him are the most benevolent  i wished we had a bit more of paul being almost bitter about what hes doing post water of life,2024-03-04 11:26:14
that’s a good catch and actually i think an important distinction i would just disagree that it wasn’t intended it seems that’s exactly what dv intended and i kind of disagree with that portrayal because we know his internal struggle is greater in the books or at least he realizes he must embrace it as the best path forward for reduction in cost of human lives,2024-03-05 17:57:20
so basically he’s seeing like thousands of years into the future and misinterpreting it as an imminent problem,2024-03-07 11:07:45
that is true he definitely wants revenge those comments from jessica about your father would want revenge and then he said something about not being his father and ya the war was inevitable after he had helped the fremen cripple spice production i just thought he should have had a conversation with his “love” and partner chani to attempt to explain himself at a minimum,2024-03-06 20:04:47
yeah the reverend mother tells irulan that one way or another her father will lose the throne unless she marries paul war is coming regardless,2024-03-07 02:39:16
definitely agree that it’s much more interesting than the simple hero arc in my opinion the books do not do as good a job of leaning into the villain as dv does here probably why he very much explicitly has chani be a vocal opposition and maybe the lack of guilt and remorse paul has in the books i always felt like paul was sympathetic in the book that he really doesn’t have a choice in being the savior because he can see the path with the least amount of death and destruction even though the path still has a lot of death and destruction something that wasn’t really explained in the movie probably intentionally,2024-03-04 16:33:07
"there are a couple reasons why i think we need a little bit more 1 chani is supposed to be his love and partner but he doesn’t even attempt to explain or talk to her post water of life they don’t have a single conversation before the final confrontation with feyd that’s just unrealistic between two people who love each other but perhaps it’s because paul as the kh knows exactly the future so doesn’t feel the need idk seems more like the tired plot device of not communicating just so there’s conflict 
2 lots of people said dune pt1 had nothing happen in it but that’s because it was so dense with information and one line dialogue that’s actually important but it never breathes and let the information sink or be rehashed this is common with book adaptations trying to cover so much story in a shorter time and i feel like this is exactly what happened here like the water of life is the pivotal moment of paul’s journey and it’s like at the 2 hr mark already it’s a sprint to the finish after that scene and i think delving into what the change actually did and means would be more impactful to the tragic hero story",2024-03-13 16:16:19
ive never read the books and i pretty much picked up on everything the movies had to offer watched dune 1 and dune 2 back to back and yeah there are so many small things that the movie never even mentions which dont make too much sense without looking it up online like in the movies its never explicitly mentioned that everyone uses swords because shields can deflect projectiles,2024-03-06 13:54:03
the main issue here is how will you convert soliloquies and internal musings into live action very easy to judge and not come up with solutions,2024-03-10 07:36:54
"i felt like the dune did a good enough job illustrating that paul didn’t really want a universal jihad he wanted to survive and he wanted to avenge his father and  the harkonnens understandable and relatable i thought and i thought there was enough inner dialogue about his “terrible purpose” and disgust with the bg to satisfy me that things were getting beyond his control he was thrown into a rushing river pushing forward and he could only navigate the path he saw as best when he finally understood where the river was leading 

honestly i like messiah but it did feel a little self pitying  paul is understandably upset because of all the death and the loss of fremen life etc but we he never offered or saw another path i think he is mainly bitter in messiah because of the lack of real meaningful choice he had",2024-03-15 15:55:04
and dv even said that he tried to be faithful to franks vision and included aspects from messiah that frank put in to clarify how he felt paul should be viewed,2024-03-18 04:38:31
yeah his next movie is supposedly rendezvous with rama then dune messiah which should easily get the green light based on how well part 2 has been received,2024-03-03 13:00:27
pretty sure he said he wants timothee to age a bit so hes not so teenagerish in messiah,2024-03-03 21:56:56
quite a lot of time also passes between dune and messiah it would make sense to let the actors age up a bit first and give him a break to refresh himself with another project,2024-03-04 02:08:35
that man knows how to budget look as good or better than much more expensive films released in the last while,2024-03-04 07:45:25
i mean its wb so anything could happen but they would be brainless to not do a 3rd,2024-03-02 11:15:59
and the fantastic sequel chef,2024-03-04 08:46:14
cause shooting a shield with a lazgun creates a nuclear explosion everyone would die its why its more common to fight with daggers in dune,2024-03-10 06:54:40
i like to think the movie ends right before you see those transports taking off getting wiped out by the great houses’ fighter support,2024-03-07 02:59:02
agreed makes no sense they wouldn’t use more guns in the desert since worms are attracted to the shields have to not think about the logistics too much,2024-03-06 16:18:47
"the great houses run their worlds like feudal colonies one of the later books talks about how the only transportation for most of humanity is walking because the empire doesnt need to industrialize anymore 


the impression i get is most worlds are not as populated as current day earth and only nobles have access to technology planets are populated mainly to replenish armies when required",2024-03-04 06:38:37
there is no ship to ship combat not in the books anyways the spacing guilding held a monopoly on space travel so no need for any combat in space,2024-03-04 14:08:19
one of their first naval victories they just sailed up in crappy boats and threw chains everywhere then ran across them as if they were on land,2024-03-04 22:07:08
paul didnt lie he wouldnt need to use many nukes to destroy the spice fields,2024-03-04 11:28:02
"theyre leveraging the spacing guild there might be orbital defenses but there arent massive fleets the feudal set up is due to the nature of space travel which is extremely risky without advance system to prevent disasters they way they have is to make navigators which are humans flooded with spice they mutate and gain limit future sight to navigate no spice then no galactic civilization and every trip is a massive risk

the machines that fold space means a large fleet isnt that efficient they can appear behind your defensive lines youd need to place defenses around your gravity well so large fleets arent that necessary more planetary defenses 

like the mass effect reapers which isolated systems and than concentrated power to take them thats what paul will do moving from one system to another burning the opposition and swaying amiable allies he has perfect future sight he cant be deceived and he knows which people he can sway and with what 

hes going to know which area to assault where a planetary defenses is weakest he will also know where to bluff where to burn and  everyone and where to bait the book only covers it as a war burning across the stars because its not that interesting covering an undefeatable force that knows all possible futures that controls space travel for all",2024-03-04 08:30:02
in the first one when the ship is trying to shoot down duncan with a lasgun and hes in a shielded thopter almost ended the whole movie right there by killing everyone of note except the emperor,2024-03-02 18:07:29
my biggest gripe of exclusion was the dinner scene in the first one i really felt like it paced out the attack after their arrival in a perfect way,2024-03-02 12:39:36
"one thing i need to know and you seem to do i get why they fight in melee shields and swords and all the other shenanigans but why do the fight like retards the best about having buddies is that they can help you so why do we see 10000 1v1s if they use swords why don’t they use also physical shields or spears 

it is a slight petpeeve of mine but their fighting is not just unoptimized but bad i get the distinction feeling that a roman legion with sci fi shields and their normal way of fighting would totally rule the meta",2024-03-10 23:41:11
"i agree with much of this but the inclusion of the spacing guild representatives in a few of the emperors scenes and then the final climax would have been doable and good 

could reassert their importance in space travel and hammer home the dependence on spice for it 

without that we have a rather substantial difference in the impact of the threat that paul uses to take over the empire",2024-03-08 18:01:08
but they explained the shields very well,2024-03-03 16:45:29
they didnt film them all at once ,2024-03-03 21:14:03
why did the harkonen squad leader say to not turn on shields when they were getting sniped in the beginning,2024-03-31 12:16:41
"the navigators arent revealed to a later book arent they the first film has members of the spacing guild in full face helmets as well as very cool catholic clergy style outfits during the herald of the change scene 

but youre broadly right dune is an incredibly dense novel and denis first job is to make a captivating standalone series of films not an wiki page",2024-04-05 13:28:38
what suggested that to you,2024-03-01 14:28:58
are they making a third movie,2024-03-02 07:28:14
i have to disagree on them not mattering until messiah the guild reps present at the climax of dune are a huge part of how paul takes power,2024-03-02 18:08:24
probably because lynchs movie opened with one,2024-03-03 12:27:53
they never mentioned in movies that spice is worms poo right,2024-03-03 16:57:44
"yeah im guessing it would be hard to ignore them there and to be fair they were at least somewhat present in the first movie 

they didnt have much room in that one well for mentats they could have but they removed thufir",2024-03-03 09:04:35
whats the conflcit in messiah are fremen still at war with houses,2024-03-03 16:58:22
they def will they have to leave some visual spectacles left over besides space battles,2024-03-06 06:55:28
imagine the marketing oppurtunities sappho juice boxes sappho hard seltzer,2024-03-10 16:32:34
theres like two sentences about choam in the whole book,2024-03-03 07:51:19
i don’t know how anyone can watch what i just did and think it would work better in their living room,2024-03-02 05:42:35
yes but these dials go to 11,2024-03-02 04:58:31
you just need the right tvand a 5000 atmos sound system at home,2024-03-02 15:54:08
i mean one with a budget higher than a bag of peanuts,2024-03-02 16:05:36
“don’t blame me it was predetermined”,2024-03-17 11:35:47
im sorry can you also tell me what i should be looking for u didnt get it,2024-03-03 19:18:43
i will never go back,2024-03-01 08:27:58
kubrick was the same,2024-03-01 08:21:55
not absurd at all i respect the  out of that,2024-03-07 08:44:10
honestly im pretty sure that it was his way of showing respect to paul and that he was appreciating finally facing a worthy opponent,2024-03-05 07:25:50
i did find it funny in a good way how you could tell which scenes were shot earlier because austin butler still sounded like the lovechild of stellan skarsgard and elvis especially when talking about his darlings in the very first scene lol and the ones that were shot later where he was just fully skarsgard to a very impressive degree its impressive cause i dont even think he really needed to do that considering raban doesnt share skarsgards accent either but i respect the fact that he did,2024-03-02 17:58:35
"in fact it was so shockingly good that i wonder if their voices were mixed in post

same with hard left turn here melissa mccarthy in the new little mermaid

either she and austin are simultaneously godtier voice actors or there was some digital wizardry going on behind the curtain

ive worked a bit in studios and filters that make you sound like elvis or yoda etc have been around for over a decade

im sure that a hollywood audio engineer working with ai tools and an huge budget could do basically anything with a voice track",2024-03-01 13:47:15
"it was absolutely jarring but in a good way

gave me the sense that feyd and baron spent most of their lives in the region so they had much in common their two voices stood out among everyone elsealmost like father and estranged son",2024-03-02 15:44:53
yeah so much so that it sounded exactly like him a couple of times in particular,2024-03-02 01:17:36
“i should drown you in that pool”,2024-03-15 15:10:36
"i thought his athletic built was quite hot 

especially in comparison to paul in their battle at the end ",2024-03-10 13:45:34
what didn’t you like or how else did you picture them doing the character,2024-03-15 15:11:28
i told all my coworkers last night that the baron were father son in real life,2024-03-01 16:26:14
lol,2024-03-03 17:24:55
my realization that i saw him in shannara chronicles did not know the actor then so didnt remember him in there even though i loved the show lol,2024-03-03 17:25:57
i thought melissa totally phoned it in on little mermaid what specifically do you mean,2024-03-03 23:45:40
i felt that way about timothee as paul tbh,2024-03-01 07:51:41
no i get feyd was more controllable but i thought hed have more of an arc than he did,2024-03-02 13:22:57
"the shot for me was near the end when the emperors ship is first shown and you can see the reflection of the dunes below

there are a lot of all timers though",2024-03-01 04:44:29
the emperors ship approaching and reflecting everything below it was one of my favourites so cool,2024-03-01 06:23:31
reading this gave me a bonergodamn ive never been so hyped,2024-03-01 04:28:20
dude  i was mesmerized by that,2024-03-01 05:21:20
punctuated by that banger of a soundtrack i actually thought the movie was over since the music in that scene felt like the crescendo before the credits how fun to realize there were like 40 minutes left,2024-03-01 05:35:06
that was a great shot but pretty similar to the batman scene at the end of the movie greig fraser did both,2024-03-01 07:34:36
not just the shot that music oh  zimmer brought his a game again,2024-03-01 18:59:59
that was my favorite shot of the movie this scene was prefaced with the shot of paul approaching the fremen with the worm behind him,2024-03-01 21:16:03
on imax that shot looked so incredible,2024-03-02 19:41:04
that shot hasnt left my brain and probably never will i need to fast forward a couple of months so i can rewatch it as many times as i want on youtube,2024-03-03 22:25:16
this was like asmr,2024-03-02 00:37:48
it really looked like he was moving through grains of sand jaw dropping,2024-03-03 16:31:47

"it seemed to me he was a sandworm
moving through a sea of sand in that scene",2024-03-12 06:27:46
i don’t go to theaters much anymore but this was a movie that i happily shelled out the extra money to see in imax if i’m going to pay a premium to see a movie in a theater i want it to be an audial and visual experience this did not disappoint,2024-03-03 18:42:55
gotta shout out the actual cinematographer too greig fraser he also shot the first dune the batman and rogue one,2024-03-12 08:07:38
the harkonnen soldiers have been juiced up thats why the water distilled from their blood is bad for drinking,2024-03-01 10:02:53
"human populations have been separate on their respective homeworlds now for thousands of years losing pigmentation because of their special dark sun and losing most body hair may be evolution or biological engineering adaptations to their world

makes me wonder why lady jessica is so normal looking to be half harkonnen thank  those atreides genes are strong",2024-03-04 13:46:37
but surely not everyone on gp is genetically a harkonnen the same is true for the atreides not everyone in their employ is related to the bloodline,2024-03-03 06:30:47
i believe its actually ir ,2024-03-01 06:22:30
they mention the black sun of giedi prime i assumed that it made everything infrared,2024-03-01 21:18:52
i do wish they would have shown a bit more how the sand worms are basically intensely hot furnaces on the inside,2024-03-01 16:45:49
not quite its a weird byproduct that their bodies generate when exposed to a  of water which is lethal to them  so the only way to get it realistically is to drown one and to do that its gotta be a small one,2024-03-03 22:40:18
oh lol my bad ,2024-03-01 20:15:17
i really enjoyed chani’s mounting horror through the movie her leaving at the end wasn’t just about irulan it was the culmination of so your boyfriend believes he’s the messiah,2024-03-05 23:33:25

thank you til,2024-03-10 04:21:14
they seemed to be within hearing range to me,2024-03-08 20:14:18
"the atreides literally extracted the resources of arrakis and put them in the situation theyre in theres a reason they are distrustful of them pauls mom even said we brought them hope and thats when paul snapped a classic manifest destination mentality if you dont see the obvious allegories to usmiddle east relations and overall colonialism idk what to tell you  near what the movie is about  add in the fascists with harakens and its touching all parts of the stone

obviously on the surface this is a revenge story but the atreides were not all good people they and the harkens oppressed the arrakins for decades and used them as a middle ground to wage their own wars im not speaking directly to the on surface plot but the overall politics of the universe",2024-03-03 14:53:27
the resources are the fremen,2024-03-03 20:34:46
it’s a religious story about false prophets and radicalization mixed in with neocolonialism the internal struggle and battle for power faith and destiny,2024-03-07 05:34:34

dude was absolutely a psychopathic chaos goblin but he was fair and honorable in combat and honestly just seemed to be having fun both character and actor,2024-03-01 04:44:24
just saw it a second time and im pretty sure he says the same thing to paul as he did earlier to the undrugged atreides fighter,2024-03-03 00:13:01
he probably thought paul made for a real harkonnen sibling over glossu in his last moments,2024-03-02 00:47:33

"giving water to the dead is crying taboo in fremen culture due to the waste of water paul is basically calling out some of the guys inner most religious turmoil where he dreams to have the release of crying for the things he lost in his life but his religious guilt turns the desire into a nightmare

"chani doesnt have as much characterization in the book as in the movie and pretty much is in support of anything paul saysdoes there isnt any anger or running off from her at the end when its determined that paul will marry irulan chani accepts being a concubine instead who will still get all the love and affection from paul while irulan is just a wife for political purposes who will get none of that from him i was a little bothered by the way chani ended in the movie at first but upon more reflection and reading things here i think its a lot less to do with the irulan proposal but rather the fact that paul went against what he said and is using the fremen to launch a holy war

also a big part of the book that was cut in the movie is that paul and chani have a son together who dies as part of a harkonnen attack they sped up the timeline considerably here in the movie such that it didnt happen although to be fair they cut out their son in the 1984 version too",2024-03-02 04:38:38
i read the book and loved how they portrayed chani in dune 2 as paul said she’ll come around eventually but for now let her feel heartbroken i never thought much about her but i felt for chani so bad,2024-03-04 15:57:52
perfectly said,2024-03-03 22:41:07
"yeah theres nothing to do with him colonizing her people and planet like he specifically said he wouldnt do and being the sole cause of the death of millions of her people that is about to happen

like seriously though did you pay attention to any line of dialogue in the movie   


or were you just paying attention to the pretty light show and fight sequences",2024-03-01 05:58:12
yeah i guess it would convert even the proper atheist skeptics at that point  if what he saysknows can only be explained by omniscience,2024-03-05 16:07:17
it is if my ancestors were designing a prophecy on purpose saying that a guy would do this and that and you should elect him president and i do exactly it to gain power im not a messiah just manipulating them,2024-03-06 07:37:44
that makes so much more sense the movie didnt make this point at all the binary in the movie was go south lots of death or refuse to go so presumably those bad things dont happen i dont know how they botched such a pivotal issue it appears hes now going to war with the whole galaxy bc he drank the blue liquid and saw hes actually half harkonnen and hes very angry about it  which is the only dialogue on the matter we got w his mother,2024-03-06 03:54:41
i mean he is one,2024-03-07 10:38:22
which is just like what lotr did,2024-03-12 18:53:52

it is this generations lotr though they may not recognize it lol,2024-03-18 05:14:08
and lotr isn’t also doing that with the hobbit trilogy  rings of power,2024-03-04 14:16:21
that’s not my read but ok,2024-03-01 15:13:40
havent seen a single post mention that buddy ,2024-03-03 19:03:30
it gave me a very avengers endgame “1 way” vibe  but i really appreciated it,2024-03-07 03:43:38
"hes just scared of going south because he knows deep down that if he does he is committing himself to a holy war waged in his name spanning the galaxy which is exactly what happened

its just after drinking the water of life and seeing that really a galactic holy war isnt even in the top 5 worst options for his familypeople he decided to full send it",2024-03-06 13:21:30
it definitely had some annoying tropes,2024-03-11 06:31:33
"its not like they could not tell everyone why she was there

matt damon was also at the premiere of interstellar so",2024-03-01 07:51:20
yeah   me off when they do that,2024-03-01 05:01:24
i got spoiled by reading the  guardian review ,2024-03-02 23:28:54
"in 1999 i had a buddy talk about how oprah interviewed the cast of fight club and spoiled the ending for everyone  and im like dude you just spoiled it for me  then we go see the movie and afterwards hes like  that ending and im like yeah remember when you spoiled it  and hes like oh yeah i totally forgot about that

we were chilling in the living room one day shes browsing facebook on her laptop she randomly says gamora and vision die what does that mean

she was entering some contest on fb someone had left iw spoilers in the replies to the contest and my mom had randomly read it aloud without knowing what it was",2024-03-18 07:27:01

there is one particular scene with alia in the book that i want to see atj do,2024-03-03 13:14:04
probably not one of the effects of spice is that it greatly reduces aging with how much spice he’s been exposed to over the last two movies they could easily keep our twink king in,2024-03-02 07:07:45
the timeline in this movie is compressed somewhat in the book pauls sister is born and the war takes a few years instead of less than 9 months the second book starts a little more than a decade after this first book and shes a teenager timothy wouldnt be unreasonably aged for the sequel especially if they do some more alterations to the timeline for it it also depends if he decides to add stuff that isnt actually in the sequel book as theres quite a bit that happens in the years between dune and dune messiah which isnt directly shown,2024-03-02 10:02:12
dont think so hes 28 now  be well over 30 when they do the next one not sure how old paul is supposed to be but i get the feeling he is very early 20s,2024-03-03 18:50:03
"not really paul was never supposed to be the main character he was supposed to be a girl so he could be reproduce with feyd rautha 

that child was supposed to be the kwisatz haderachmain character that’s why paul  feyd both have prescience feyd mentions he dreamt of lady margot but paul’s is stronger because he is surrounded by assloads of spice constantly by the second movie paul’s child with chani ends up becoming the kwisatz haderach whose mission is to lead humanity on a “golden path” that ensures humans will not go extinct this child fuses with a sandworm they live for millennia in order to enforce the golden path 

i’m not sure why the movie didn’t go into why paul was supposed to be a girl more than it did especially since it was revealed that the bg has other prospects",2024-03-12 00:33:46
do i need to watch the shining before this,2024-03-03 18:51:20
there is a scene in doctor sleep with her and a kid in a little league uniform that will haunt you for days its important that you know the kid actor is alive and doing just fine he just acted the  outta that scene lol,2024-03-13 14:45:40
yep i rewatched it today sober and that’s how i saw it today too she was converting people for him throughout the movie but in the south after the liquid is when his “birth” happened,2024-03-04 22:44:49
more like 100000 generations of sentient adults condensed into one baby but yes,2024-03-01 08:39:52
"no the baby is already a sentient being with the memories of all of its ancestral experiences and persons

spoilers

 abomination is used because when someone is prescient already before even being their own person it’s harder to fight back against the people in the memories and not become a vessel for them paul manages because he is already his own person but a baby isn’t yet this leaves them open to basically being haunted by someone within their genetic past when the reverend mother said abomination after paul used the voice on her it’s because she sees the path they’ve gone down and knows that the baby has been exposed to the spice ",2024-03-01 14:48:38
drinking the water while jessica was pregnant affected both of them the child went through the reverend mother transformation just like jessica did shes pretty much the wisdom of a full bene gesserit while still physically being a child in the book,2024-03-02 06:52:12
yeah anya taylorjoy,2024-03-03 12:55:27
and he sells the progression from skeptic to fanatic as so natural,2024-03-03 16:59:52
i’m fairly sure in one of the books paul even mentions that he misses the old stilgar or something along those lines,2024-03-05 23:33:42
i loved that quick moment where lady jessica whispers too fast shes a master manipulator who knows his approach ends badly 99100 times but because he can see the future and knows exactly what to say to get the outcome he wants he just blitzes his way to leadership,2024-03-04 06:46:37
no superhero movies,2024-03-03 05:05:05
i can never read “timothee” in my head without exaggerating the “thee”,2024-03-03 04:49:55
he was intimidating in this one too when he told jessica you should be the next reverend mother or maybe we will return your water to the well,2024-03-03 18:57:15
i wasn’t expecting any comic relief in this movie to begin with and was even more surprised it came from him,2024-03-03 05:03:08
"one of my favorite shots in the movie is when gurney sees paul put the ring on when hes facing the emperor at the end you see stilgar slowly grow into the raving fanatic that he is by that point in the film but gurney is just following paul but then when paul puts on the ring they cut to brolins face and you can see hes every bit the fanatic stilgar is only its for his duke and house instead
     
its on screen for like half a second but that one shot has stuck with me since i saw it",2024-03-06 21:39:07
"they were still funny even if you saw their danger but that scene at the war summit where all leaders met where paul fully embraced his role it was terrifying to me 

it was the best scene in the movie for me because on one hand i totally understand why people started to worship him i probably would as well 

on the other hand this is how fanaticism rises fanaticism that will do everything in the name of their chosen one every atrocious thing

so i felt awe and disgust and fear all at once",2024-03-01 08:01:36
comedy in the moment tragedy in hindsight,2024-03-01 06:37:59
thats why those scenes are so powerful  its hilarious and the whole theater laughed but then the laughs start getting more forced and then finally fade away as stilgar leads the fremen on the ships to take them to paradise,2024-03-01 13:35:12
there was someone in front of me that was laughing so much throughout the movie you would think we were in a comedy some funny exchanges for sure but come on dude,2024-03-01 15:35:21
ehh… if it they hadn’t happened humanity would have gone extinct within the next several thousand years freman included,2024-03-02 07:09:56
thats definitely the theme but those scenes were objectively captured comically in both performance and style,2024-03-03 01:38:53
i think they can be both you can fully emphasize why chani and her friend were laughing at these guys,2024-03-05 19:13:04
"can you expand i don’t fully understand what the tragedy of the freman dream is in this context

not a book reader please no spoilers for dune part 3",2024-03-07 03:33:11

,2024-03-01 15:37:28
yeah it has never been shy about it i mean  one of the books is called the butlerian jihad and i definitely caught whiff of it a few times but the movie did a very good job of driving it home,2024-03-03 22:11:13
how do you know have you asked him,2024-03-02 01:14:18
stilgar was funny in the books too hes completely straight faced and super serious his insults and mannerisms were always funny,2024-03-01 21:08:41

its because the actual close call to death would have been a huge slap in the face to his belief  instead now he was vendicated and his quickness to respond in that way was him reassuring himself and his own belief that he is right,2024-03-03 03:47:33

yeah if the books had ever been finished i imagine the ending would involve alot of  emperor analogy it didnt work well on screen coming out of nowhere and having no build up but the three eyed crowraven has the knowledge of centuries and the ability to watch events far across the world a living  being could easily make changes to game of thrones stagnant medieval world,2024-03-03 04:15:37
i 100 think grrm was inspired by dune for the ending of game of thrones which to be fair we have not received for the books yet but we do know he said bran would be king i believe bran obtains a prescience and ability to use how powers to gain more power and that sort of thing is always portrayed better in text,2024-03-04 00:37:32
"thats the thing a lot of people miss about the books


ive heard over and over again that the lesson to learn from is fear and skepticism of the cult of personality to beware making a messiah out of a man and the dangers of worship as a means of control

this all the people saying dune reminds them of star wars of course and it isnt that dune is like star wars its that george lucass star wars is a watered down dune ripoff lucas stories were completely inspired from this universe  adding a short dash of the textbook heros journey narrative pattern to give it more mass appeal ref joseph campbells the hero with a thousand faces,2024-03-02 22:07:32

if youve ever read lotr this is pretty much what saruman does his words are poison if he wants them to be which is why gandalf i think warns everybody to not pay any heed to what he has to say because he can corrupt peoples minds just by his words no magic involved its the same here i imagine havent read the dune books,2024-03-03 10:20:39
"i’d explain it in the same way  

language is a tool that we use to essentially make people do things  those that have true mastery of the tool can wield it to do things that normal people may consider impossible  put a pen in your hands and you could at least draw a stick figure  put a pen in rembrandt’s hands and he could do much more  those who can use “the voice” are like rembrandt but their  spoken words  they’re wield it so successfully that they can literally make someone  them selves  

as far as why it’s not advertised… it would presumably lose its effectiveness if you knew that someone was  with you like that",2024-03-01 21:09:04
2 weeks after your comment but the movie genocidal  portrays a character with this same power  i think its pretty effective,2024-03-17 03:48:07
they are also the results of genetics programs to essentially have superhuman bodies on a very low tier the later books really hone in on this idea,2024-03-03 05:20:21
"is it though  i don’t remember any explanation of “the voice” mentioning molecules  

the rest of what you said just sounds like you’re reiterating what i said

“the voice” functions as what we might consider a superpower but it’s really just a mastery of perception and communication being skillfully wielded to make people do stuff",2024-03-03 01:27:28
"i’ve heard that before and that’s exactly what it is  here’s the interesting thing though  dune was published a decade before nlp was introduced to the world of academic psychology  frank herbert came up with the idea before anyone tried to turn it into real science  

moral of the story frank herbert was a pretty clever guy which is why dune is such a timeless story and why the majority of sciencefiction is somewhat derivative of dune",2024-03-23 04:43:57

as someone whos never read the books going through discussions after watching the two parts back to back theres a lot of details the movie just never mentioned but after searching it up you find out theres a lore reason in the books  a few lines of dialogue to explain simple things can still go a long way,2024-03-06 14:19:04

she was when i read the book i didnt picture her necessarily as that character but was very happy how much i loved her in the film,2024-03-03 17:16:43
ive never been more attracted and scared of someone in my life,2024-03-03 17:16:05
"hela

cate with black hair is the hottest thing ive ever seen",2024-03-03 23:37:26
yeah the movie tried to show this when paul is pulling back the scales you could see some openings under the scale almost looking like breathing holes that the worm doesnt want to submerge,2024-03-07 17:50:42
yeah but like thats what ears are for  i dont need a device to tell me if somewhere is loud ,2024-03-04 01:02:58
when you’re adapting it to film you kind of need that stuff to happen in dialogue with another character as you can’t do the whole internal monologue thing that the book relies on,2024-03-01 10:35:37
as a non book reader to me that came off as jessica feeling incredibly betrayed finding out her actual heritage and going full scorched earth against the bene gesserit for retribution,2024-03-01 13:46:08
paul spends the first half of the movie rejecting his role and trying to avoid the coming holy war at all costs until eventually even he succumbs to the fanaticism of the prophecy i’d hardly say he wasn’t questioning it he was just vulnerable to it ,2024-03-01 07:31:34
i feel like it is because paul had 15 years of life to develop his persona before being exposed to spice and awakening his prescience he has chani who he loves and is a driving force in his motivations for taking power leto is preborn so really never had a stable singular identity or as much connection to his humanity that’s why he is able to put it all aside for the golden path easier,2024-03-03 06:55:14
exactly he still decides his revenge is worth going down that path but hopes he can avert it its a super important part of the character that he chooses to go down a path he knows may cost billions of lives,2024-03-01 12:12:59
"to use as little spoilers as possible because everyone should check out the books   in the books paul sees that humanity while spread across many words in the empire is too interconnected and in a stagnant spiral eventually humanity will wipe itself out theres a narrow path to save humanity which is referred to in later novels as the golden path but it requires alot of sacrifice and some very severe decision making paul is never able to accept the actions that would go down this path which forces others to do what he couldnt


paul spends most his time trying to reign in the fremen who are off happily wiping out any religion or world that doesnt accept paul as space jesus his failure on that front makes him pretty fed up with it all",2024-03-03 05:50:14
okay thanks yeah no way this version of jessica was going to comfort this version of chani haha,2024-03-01 03:59:32
"“history will call us wives”

hopefully they’ll find a way to work that line into messiah because i love it",2024-03-01 05:26:15
because lady jessica never married leto right,2024-03-01 05:07:57
she is probably distracted by her child dying they cut the child and its death entirely,2024-03-01 05:41:46
lady jessica tells paul not to do to chani what his dad did to her and then goes straight to making her his consort,2024-03-02 21:10:08
the moment between jessica and chani being stolen from us is something that leaves a bad taste especially with jessica’s really impactful quote just not being said at all,2024-03-03 08:10:38
i just finished the book a week ago and can confirm this,2024-03-02 17:25:36
correct,2024-03-02 06:40:13
oh yeah that sparks a memory thanks,2024-03-01 08:11:15
and they easily could have included this in the movie but wanted zendaya to go girlboss on her own in the desert and abandon literally all of her people and usul,2024-03-01 16:24:09
the miniseries is still the best adaptation and i’ll die on this hill,2024-03-01 12:12:22
he only needs to be called out on his  because movie only people don’t know the internal struggle and dialogues he has,2024-03-10 05:37:47
more than 2 years alia was 4 during the battle of arakeen so paul and chani had known each other for a bit longer than that,2024-03-04 02:58:10
this is also backed up by chani saying “i will always love you as long as you stay who you are” then after paul takes the water of life and chani slaps him and walks away from then on we see her become more distant from him as she watches the man she fell in love with transform her heartbreak at the end of the film is one of the most striking changes from the book that has really stuck with me and illustrates paul’s change in identity,2024-03-06 09:15:46
"why does she receive the entire ancestral download of the bgs through a freman rev mother how were we even shown thats what she received 

the dialogue was that if she were to agree to become the new rm for the fremens shed receive a huge history of pain which i took to mean shed receive the entire ancestral record of the fremans given how theyve been oppressed 

this film fails to explain so much ",2024-03-05 15:51:37
yes i remember noticing that in one of the trailers good catch,2024-03-13 05:15:17
yeah i guess they could have snuck in one line about that via paul… would make his threats  actions seem better thought out since he only targeted the mountain raining boulders and threatened to target the fields none that would illicit a retaliation from other houses,2024-03-01 18:47:42
he could but thats still a lot of micromanagement and communication overhead its implied that there are many ways for them to be defeated although the movie wasnt entirely clear if it meant the upcoming battle in arrakeen or the fight the empire as a whole but only a few ways for victory its all well and good for paul to know that but hes still gotta convey the info to others as to how to navigate the jihad,2024-03-03 17:50:54
i think you could do messiah and children in one movie by compressing things a bit oddly im irrationally worried about how they would portray the  emperor without it looking really weird,2024-03-03 01:02:04
there is a book between dune and children of dune and thats hat the movie will be,2024-03-13 02:20:50
"the book simply states that the emperors army is comparable to all the great houses combined so his whole armada would be too and since paul has perfect foresight he made sure to land the nukes and worms exactly where needed for them to survive

its called save scumming",2024-03-14 07:04:56

"fremen are just that fearsome

iirc paul has a line in the book boasting to the emperor something like you will think back to the gentle ways of the sardaukar",2024-03-04 09:47:18
entire race it appears,2024-03-01 12:02:16
a lot of these commentors know the larger narrative and are speaking from there which is a bit annoying right now they dont get that pauls actions seem quite justified to new viewers right now,2024-03-02 22:44:56
right and its still faithful to herberts ultimate message,2024-03-01 15:27:41
well the great houses are already mad at the kid for usurping the throne why  them off even more by murdering him at his surrender,2024-03-04 15:14:37
"denis basically looked at a list of all the top young stars in hollywood and said gimme 

and they all work",2024-03-02 02:55:53
yeah she showed up at the premiere and they wouldnt say what role she had,2024-03-01 08:14:16
hundred percent shes in the next one,2024-03-01 22:24:24
i always thought she should of been irulan so i was stoked shes actually in it,2024-03-01 08:42:14
and in hindsight of course she is,2024-03-03 03:42:30
i saw her in the premier and was so sure she was going to be alia im hyped up for the third movie,2024-03-01 09:54:30
she was feeling left out since everyone else who’s in everything had already been cast,2024-03-03 12:50:26
okay the makes sense ive never read the books and after seeing the movie i was wondering  anya taylor joy was doing there i thought she was some kind of atreides or harkonnen ancestor for some reason didnt realize she is pauls sister,2024-03-04 15:42:56
its been a while since i read the book but i remembered feeling like the end of the book was a bit too rushed for me so having no alia around beyond visions probably helps the end of the movie feel more focused at least for me,2024-03-01 05:40:45
the only change im not sure about is how paul and chanis relationship is in limbo at the end,2024-03-03 00:33:20
i assume shell reprise the role in messiah and will get a ton of screentime in that if it gets picked up,2024-03-01 05:51:53
perfect casting though,2024-03-02 02:17:58
yeah 84 dune and scifi channel dune tried it with limited success never mind a small child killing someone but child actors just arent good at that age,2024-03-02 14:41:10
i agree but it probably had to do with avoiding the alia problem if it was going to stay completely faithful to the book ,2024-03-01 06:00:59
exactly what i was thinking i dont mind paul killing the baron but with alia not yet born it compressed the narrative just a touch 3 years or so to build a fremen army is a touch more plausible than 7 months or so,2024-03-02 14:39:54
if your sticking point about a movie where a space empire exists because a spice created by giant desert space worms gives the spacing guild pilots  enough prescience to plot ftl  travel paths is that  the prescient space wizard paul took over the fremen in 9 months instead of 3 years then i dont know what to tell you,2024-03-01 05:22:01
whats interesting is the book doesnt expand on margot fenring securing feyds bloodline does it,2024-03-04 03:49:08
agreed i still wish we could have seen the space guild navigators i like the scene in the book where paul bosses them around in the finale and they realize this mad lad can and would destroy spice production,2024-03-01 14:27:45
11 adaptations dont really work either at best they tend to be pretty bland the early 2000s series was quite faithful yet not that great,2024-03-01 22:04:38
yeah i hope they continue but i think they might wait a few years to let the actors age up more or else recast i would have loved to see timothee and anya actual share a real scene together,2024-03-01 15:47:57
if anything the way feyd hissed at that one guard who tried to help him suggests he wouldn’t cheat,2024-03-13 06:26:37
"i actually think a dune anime or animated adaption could make things like that work i think a medium like that can pull off certain strangeness or else weird ideas to a live action could i doubt it would ever happen or ever given the kind of budget needed but it would be something to see 

for live action i’m fine with paul seeing visions of his sister as an adult for now gives the actors things to work with all without any kind of cgi uncanny valley effects if the films continue then she’ll get her time to shine and the films get more people to read the books",2024-03-02 07:00:10
hate to break it to you but denis villeneuve is already on record saying  never do an extended cut for any or his movies,2024-03-13 06:27:40
it still doesnt make sense for her to be in dune 3 though especially with the age similarity with her and tc seems like theyd want a younger actress,2024-03-04 00:52:14
"2 points

1 i was speaking of a general pattern i noticed in a mixture of social media as well as people in real life as in when leaving the theater people were talking about the film and i overheard some conversations and then with my group mix of readers and nonreaders we were discussing the film at a bar and a big talking point were the changes from the source material


2 i was referencing reddit as well as other social media sites this thread is not the only place where discussion about the film is had in addition look at the time of my comment a lot more posts were added to this thread then when i first commented

i still enjoy the film and am fine with the changes",2024-03-03 12:17:02
i have come across many comments on rdune who dont like alia and channi being changed a lot of book purists will balk at any change without keeping in mind the different medium,2024-03-04 00:53:32

nahhh he would fit in too well with the fremen paul is from another culture and planet a big part of his character is learning to be a part of the fremen society,2024-03-02 18:49:54

"i think frank wasnt a great action writer but i also think part of that was to really emphasize that the war was already over before the emperor even got to arrakis

the sardaukar in the books are built up a lot more to be almost superhuman supersoldiers and theyre totally overconfident to the point of it being a caricature  the fremen effortlessly defeating the sardaukar in like 3 pages is supposed to be overwhelming and disorienting because thats how it felt for the supposedly unbeatable army  they lose fast and they lose hard and theyve never experienced anything like that

i think one of my few nitpicks with the movie is part 1 didnt do the work establishing the sardaukar enough so its not as stunning when they lose in part 2",2024-03-01 14:26:50
the entire final battle is basically half a page,2024-03-01 20:13:10
“dealing with some particular nukes” is my favorite dune moment if that gets adapted i can die happy,2024-03-03 07:54:20
yeah the ghola now that we know who alia is the mix looks interesting you don’t cast anya taylor joy for a 5 second cameo they will mix it up,2024-03-03 18:12:30
i was also thinking in the theater just how visually inspired this movie is the fireworks the flashes through the windows when he’s walking down the hall the giant reflection of the ground on the emperor’s ship the underground southern meeting etc,2024-03-04 01:06:13

i never liked chani in the books and just felt like a useless character that had no reason to exist so i’m very glad for the change personally,2024-03-18 07:06:28
"shed be fine doubting what paul was doing without being cartman  you guys im going home felt like a soap opera at times i think they exaggerated it and couldve tone her down  him losing his grasp and she would be the one trying to reign him inuntil she couldnt anymore without making her go crazy like this  
also why didnt paul just say youre my love even if i marry irulan cuz im pretty sure thats what happens in the books",2024-03-11 10:10:02
one of the most poignant comparisons is the difference between paul saying i want to be your equal and paul looking at chani surrounded by worshippers bowing to him,2024-03-04 06:52:32
"  i felt on the whole that could have been emphasized more

i felt this about many of the main characters there were so many little character moments or bits or worldbuilding that either needed like twenty more seconds or to be done slightly differently

yeah i hope he takes his time before going back to messiah there’s a time jump anyway and i don’t want him or the actors to get too burned out,2024-03-01 16:44:35
i had no idea rama series was happening  absolutely same reaction im having right now,2024-03-03 13:25:26
yeah maybe but i think convincing the audience that chalamet and zendaya are supposed to be 40ish years old in messiah might be a more difficult aspect of doing an actual 20 year time jump  a 10 year time jump might be believable especially if they dont start filming until like 2027 but then they could just say that alia has accelerated growth because of the water of life or something like that and itd still work well enough,2024-03-01 22:57:01
this is just a guess but i kind of think the third movie is going to actually show what happens over the intervening years between dune and dune messiah rather than skipping straight to the aftermath of the jihad like the second book does the end of this movie felt much more like a cliffhanger than i expected and of course it ends with paul and chani still not reconciled so a time skip doesnt really seem like itd fit plus the plot of dune messiah is kind of thin and cant be stretched out to two and a half hours but it could fill half a movie or so,2024-03-02 03:52:49
eh i dont see them sacrificing chalamet and zendaya for an actress they had on screen for 5 seconds theyll move the timeline earlier rather than later,2024-03-03 23:36:36

the hilarious fact is remenant of baron wanted to terraform arrakis into trees and oceans but since sandworms are dying the freman were unhappy about it even though freman wants exactly the same in this movie,2024-03-02 02:34:14
"inb4 someone says “plans within plans within plans”



also i don’t know if the books ever said anything like “prophecy within prophecy” but i find it funny while the bg manipulated the fremen with a false prophecy of the lisan al gaib the way they treat the figure of kwisatz haderach is essentially the same as the way fremen treat their meissiah even if they intellectually understood kwisatz haderach is a result of selective breeding",2024-03-05 20:38:28
the scifi channel had a dune miniseries about 20 or so years ago which i recall being three nights of two hours each with commercials they eventually did dune messiah and children of dune as well through a second miniseries of the same length from a cast standpoint overall it pales in comparison greatly to this and the david lynch movie but there were a few good roles like princess irulan and baron harknonen was the highlight for me,2024-03-27 22:46:09

with dune i feel like denis villeneuve did something very similar he pretty much left out everything in the book that didn’t involve the bene gesserit and paul’s religion and upcoming holy war he retooled some characters like chani to emphasize it and ignored time jumps which jackson also did there’s a 17 year time jump in lotr that jackson ignored 

i do think though that both jackson and villeneuve made amazing movies from books considered “unfilmable” they might not be the books 11 but they successfully manage to adapt the themes and ideas from the books",2024-03-01 22:27:39

"feyd used paul’s weakness against him by calling out chani breaking paul’s focus opening him up to being wounded

but then paul used feyd’s weakness to strike back feyd’s ‘desire’  here to finish the job too quickly his insecure need to go for the glory paul baited him into that 

the oneupmanship of not just the physical reality of the conflict but the emotional sides of it really reflected on the rest of the movie as a whole the bene gesserit geopoliticking really running a course through everything",2024-03-02 09:40:55
didnt he use that same move in the fight with jamis,2024-03-01 04:09:09
leto tried a similar tactic when he tried to  the baron in part 1 pretending to utter his last words to get him to come close before he bites on the poison tooth,2024-03-16 14:53:05
100,2024-03-02 17:53:05
to be precise he wasnt a prospect for kh paul was supposed to be female and have a child with feyd and that child was going to be kh still shows that feuyd was insane on a genetical level,2024-03-03 08:24:07
" yeah it was supposed to be a hawat scheme but im guessing that got cut pretty late and obviously the arena is a huge set piece so you cant really work around that

can you go into more detail about this i guess that atreides guy was supposed to be one of their best soldiers and thus hawat schemed to have him at full strength in the fight",2024-03-06 22:21:00
part of me was like really all that thinky stuff and were going to decide this with a knife fight but if it had to be done and it does fit their strict honour culture then let it be done that way the orange backlight was so cool,2024-03-11 06:01:23
reminds me of the leadership rituals in black panther i wonder if they took any inspiration from dune looking back,2024-03-14 22:29:56
yes and no the weirding modules were his attempt to adapt the weirding way lynch didnt like how the book portrayed it as a martial art and pivoted away from what he thought was desert kungfu,2024-03-01 17:03:54
not gonna lie i was kind of waiting for that voice killword i have a hard time buying the zealously behind some dude whos best  power is knowing how your grandma died,2024-03-03 05:37:00
too humble to admit he’s the savior,2024-03-01 03:39:52
somehow he nailed being humorous in an otherwise very grim and serious movie without it feeling out of place i thought of all the marvel movie humor that drives me nuts for doing the exact opposite every time,2024-03-01 04:05:58
thats why hes an oscar winning actor,2024-03-01 04:49:23
he was so good he was good comic relief without being cheesy like gimli in lotr,2024-03-01 03:47:29
i loved that stuff but that line was straight out of life of brian lol,2024-03-01 03:51:24

"if you are familiar with the scene in the book it’s as if gaius mohaim had seen the entirety of the mission of the bene gesserit escape their control after a millennia of work 

her shock is not just personal shock at seeing the kwitzach haderach in person but the destruction of their entire mission",2024-03-01 06:48:57

"yeah it was not intended to be funny 

abomination isnt a very commonly used word but its not archaic or out of place like that",2024-03-01 12:47:03
you are being downvoted but it’s true lol at least in the books,2024-03-03 22:37:25
at least as a reverend mother for sure,2024-03-01 03:45:57
i think part of that shock was that men with bene gesserit abilities basically don’t exist,2024-03-01 05:04:20
it’s a crazy visual to see christopher  walken kiss the ring of paul timothee and admit defeat,2024-03-01 20:52:46
you lucky bastards,2024-03-01 14:38:19
oh my gosh yes what a great scene  i can definitely see how thatll play out,2024-03-01 03:50:17
 they better greenlight messiah right now because i need to see it,2024-03-01 09:32:50
how does he go blind,2024-03-04 01:53:18
dune messiah the return of the messiah,2024-03-04 06:46:07
"hes already full villain lol herbert didnt write dune with paul as a hero but as a warning for messianiccharismatic figures he was actually upset that people thought of paul as a hero after the first book and wrote messiah to make it clear who he was

villeneuve tried to make it clear what paul became by the end imo he managed to do it",2024-03-01 08:34:29
ive seen it hes good in it hes a great actor i just thought he wasnt anything special in the first film but the second films performance was a home run but he also had more to work with here,2024-03-01 04:07:36
yeah i like how many similarities there are with these roles an unwilling heir great inspiring speaker ends up being brutal and vengeful as  i didnt doubt chalamet at all as paul for part two,2024-03-01 21:59:45
austin butler,2024-03-01 07:56:50
what makes him false is that any person with sufficient knowledge of the prophecy and the skillstraining to back it up could do the same thing that was the intention of the bene gesserit planting these prophecies around the galaxy thats what paul means when he tells jessica that its just a story it just happened to be him that used it,2024-03-01 08:29:31
the visual effects were near perfect with very very few misses like only 2 out of the thousands of shots stood out to me   if this does not win an oscar i would consider it a robbery,2024-03-13 12:28:06
yeah that’s wild i hope it’s a good popcorn flick,2024-03-04 00:38:12
it would be super weird for them to not cash grab a n extended version don’t get me wrong i would mad respect it but… it would be weird,2024-03-02 22:05:12
what kind of madman goes to watch a sequel without having seen what its a sequel of,2024-03-04 05:35:46
whether its required or not watching this without seeing the first would be like buying a book and flipping to the halfway point and starting there obviously youre still going to enjoy the visual spectacle but its objectively a worse way to experience it,2024-03-03 08:50:25
i genuinely feel like this movie would be no different with slightly more violence,2024-03-07 10:52:43
you tell me,2024-03-03 11:06:15
can confirm even the godfather would have been improved by having jks playing jjj,2024-03-01 07:31:08
fair point,2024-03-03 16:28:02
agree  it didnt click for me until paul killed the baron  i just thought wait alia always kills the baron  where is she  still excellent adaptation,2024-03-01 06:14:56
days that end in y make me wanna rewatch lawrence of arabia such a good  film,2024-03-01 20:44:46
if youre a gamer make sure to also play some morrowind since that also has a decent amount of thematic overlap and storysetting similarities,2024-03-02 23:25:26
i was skeptical about his stated plan to make messiah the end of a trilogy but now that ive seen part 2 im really curious and excited to see what he and spaihts  will do with it all the changes they made in this one worked for me at least,2024-03-02 20:31:09
"fremen got a lot of bonus and goodies once their gods became their ruler in the books so it’s not like they are missing out 

i suppose being a religious fanatic has its perks when your  is literally walking among you",2024-03-02 12:27:48
adding to this that the really tragic part is that the fremen never had a chance since the bene gesserit orchestrated the prophecy in the first place,2024-03-03 01:12:29
the thing is paul framed it as the path to victory for “us” so it can be interpreted as selfserving that he’s sacrificing billions to secure his throne i’m sure a much deeper exploration of what the “narrowest path” actually entails will be in the next one heck the plot kind of needs to revolve around that,2024-03-05 23:40:32
dang just got reminded of aot  was probably inspired by this,2024-03-10 23:46:30
i forgot that a lot of that happened internally makes sense why you would need to alter it some i just hope it doesnt do the messiah story dirty but they have been great so far so i give the benefit of doubt for sure,2024-03-01 13:05:11
"itll be weird to set things in place for messiah

im willing to bet it will be revealed early in messiah that she is pregnant with their first child and its death is what brings them back together",2024-03-02 02:36:37
chani’s ending is different due to changes to her overall character but otherwise yeah it covers the rest of the first book if we get a third movie to finish the trilogy it will be adapting the second book in the series,2024-03-02 10:46:03
i watched euphoria and i didnt really care for the style of acting in that show from any actor so its not really a zendaya problem i just wasnt impressed especially having been around people who are addicts it felt very inauthentic to me like the shaking and twitching was kinda too much and obvious but outside of that she was fine i just never saw a performance where i felt like she was really phenomenal until now,2024-03-02 00:56:14
yup i dont want to spoil anything but i wonder if theyll change some things to give her more content speaking as a book reader lol,2024-03-01 06:37:58
"what i love about villeneuve is that at heart hes a pretentious art house guy there is an uncompromising nature to his work that sets him apart there isnt a lot of room for directors like that to succeed in the states i think they really struggle to make it past their first few movies

but canada quebec in particular has a film industry that is really geared towards supporting smaller unique voices it was the perfect place for denis to establish himself",2024-03-08 17:41:20
you fought well villeneuve,2024-03-02 23:15:34
okay man you go convince a studio to spend 900 million to let you make a 3 part 9 hour trilogy of dune complete with a walking toddler that kills people im sure itll be a huge critical success,2024-03-01 05:06:39
yeah the book closes out with jessica saying that history will remember the two of them as wives despite bearing the title of concubine paul’s declaration of love to chani in the book’s final scenes before he ascends to emperor is more heartfelt imo but i loved the performance in the movie the way they looked at each other those kids can act,2024-03-01 19:32:17
" chani is the one who will have his love his desire and his children

definitely not clear that chani will be the mother of pauls children in dvs version of messiah if he even has children at all i could see her and irulan essentially being inverted with chani plotting against paul for the good of the fremen and eventually killing him or blinding him and convincing him to walk into the desert",2024-03-04 05:50:43
"been a while since i read the book but my recollection is that chani had more agency and relevancy in this part two adaption than in the novel she seemed much more cautious on the messiah thing in the movie than i remembered whereas in the book i felt like chani was more reduced to being a love interest for paul towards the end

having someone that cares deeply for paul and knows him on a more uh intimate level express skepticism about the messiah prophecy or that the fremen even need a messiah is a good change imo to one degree it makes that theme more overthetable and perhaps a little less nuanced but i feel that it is appropriate on the screen especially if there isnt another sequel to further develop the concepts set into motion",2024-03-02 00:00:28
is the “i would very much like to be equal to you” line in the book because  that was so romantic i fell in love with him right there,2024-03-07 10:56:33
he literally tells his mom shell come around eventually because hes seen it with his prescience,2024-03-01 19:45:24

edit lol all the people up voting the guy saying i spoiled something i havent even read ",2024-03-01 09:10:36
i would assume so since he made a big deal of it and we end on zendaya looking so upset but maybe i don’t fully appreciate the space politics,2024-03-11 20:29:39
she did explain that northerners have different accents and the northerners she was around had more american sounding accents,2024-03-10 18:43:23
ive yet to be too impressed by anything shes been in compared to the hype she gets to no fault of her own usually fairly flat performances imo,2024-03-03 23:33:08
the other houses are not ready to accept him as the their emperor and they are there to attack he has no choice but to fight so he decides to make use of the religious nonsense he has fed the freemen also he is absolutely power hungry at this point,2024-03-02 13:50:38
"he is on autopilot mode because path to victory leads him to steps to complete certain task and since he chose his victory over harkonnen route reality doesn’t stop there it goes further and further into him being a  leading humanity onto the golden path 

its like the matrix he made his choice so the rest is just going through the motions",2024-03-02 12:21:41
"read the book a while ago so someone please correct me if i’m wrong but she doesn’t save him in the book he just survives also book chani is pretty on board with the whole lisan algaib  and basically forgives paul right away at the end when he tells her that the marriage to irulan is a political thing on paper only and  never have a kid with her 

i thought this version of chani was good tho feels well adapted for cinema and more modernized book chani is kind of just a cheerleader for paul",2024-03-01 17:15:52
ohhhhh ok got it thank you,2024-03-01 14:42:43
just hire someone to shake your couch and throw sand in your face at the right moment,2024-03-02 02:32:44
gotta get some surround sound and bass shakers going,2024-03-03 05:15:49
im the book paul loses his and chanis first son which adds to the weight of it it something inside him rubbing his hands together ie revenge on the entire  universe,2024-03-30 05:19:33
you just know someone wants him to darth vader after this or something,2024-03-01 03:55:17
"yeah the fear angle actually made it fine that he wasnt a great fighter

he was just brutal and could be intimidated both by paul and his own brother

though him trying to fight gurney seems a bit dumb he shouldve known how outmatched he was",2024-03-01 15:20:15
oh yeah he was great i do think it’s funny to see all these actors clowning him all the time when dave himself could probably take them in a fight any day of the week movie logic lol,2024-03-01 15:44:25
even lotr does that,2024-03-01 15:01:33
and in the books it was more of a hey wait a minute the bene gesserit have been spreading the missionaria protectiva for centuries isnt that propaganda but then youre like well yeah but the prophet has actually come into being for the fremen so its complicated not just a straight up evil presence and jessica had a lot of conflicted feelings about the bene gesserit and her upbringing in the book where in the movie she just goes full in on it,2024-03-27 16:24:05
from what i remember the baron was good looking early on in life,2024-03-03 01:17:50
okay educate me,2024-03-02 09:59:24
im in the same boat there were a couple things i really didn’t like but i know im just bookpilled and it’s impossible to fully adapt im dying to know what people think of it that haven’t read it before bc i am 1000 blinded by whether they consider it cohesive either way im rereading it and excited to watch it again,2024-03-01 03:20:01
yeah i’m cool with the family being cut but “i was a friend of jamis” is huge,2024-03-01 05:33:30
thank you for that i had forgotten almost all of that i read the book over 30 years ago ,2024-03-02 16:40:09
what examples do you have of that,2024-03-06 13:38:55
" even serial killers have some motives 

like wanting to  people just like antagonists",2024-03-24 18:31:17

to test his blade and enjoy killing you gotta learn to think",2024-03-24 18:32:57
i dont think younger is necessary in my head he was always the same age as he had been,2024-03-01 20:17:43
except the whole point that frank herbert is making is that its all a lie and a made up fantasy concocted by the bene gesseret to subjugate and pacify the fremen people this is the point that chani and paul make over and over again they fed his lie to the fremen over centuries and its coincidence that it happens then but thats how prescience works and the fact that the bg were trying for this very result for thousands of generations,2024-03-06 04:05:01
while stilgar is prepping paul you can see chani and her friend sitting apart from the group talking to each other and expressing that paul is not ready its not a big jump to assume that she waited till he goes off into the desert and then follows him out there to help,2024-03-01 14:06:03
great explanation thank you,2024-03-03 23:03:43
"could be applied to any religious dogma but it takes root best in uneducated populations


yep islam and christianity tbh but majorly islam in this case 

at least his love interest is above 9 years of age

one correction at least his love interest is above 6 years of age not 9 they only consummatedmore like rped their marriage at 9 he was into her at 6 so fkin weird man",2024-03-01 12:07:50
"oh sure he’s gonna use messiah but like i said from the direction they took in part 2 they will probably make major deviations from messiah especially when it comes to chani’s and paul’s relationship and i don’t think there is gonna be much interest in making more sequels from the books since they get very weird and in some cases just bad from what i’ve heard i’ve been told to steer clear of them lol there gonna have to wrap it up in a neat bow somehow unless they already greenlit several more movies which is unlikely since it seems execs were wary to give this a third movie

it’s also very much gonna be called “part 3” hollywood isn’t gonna pass up making this sound like a consistent trilogy",2024-03-01 06:14:53
as a huge dune fan i strongly get the feeling that messiah is a very important book for dv and very likely the movie that he truly wants to make i would guess that he likes it even more than the first book because this paradigm is written all over the two dune movies he’s already made will there be differences certainly but i 100 believe he’s shooting for a faithful adaptation,2024-03-01 08:02:47
 that’s a strong statement i’m having trouble trying to grasp tens of thousands of years of history put down in a few books thank you for your comment,2024-03-03 07:34:46
i just never really considered them but i do listen to a lot of podcasts so maybe it’s something i would also enjoy how do you like audio books,2024-03-03 08:33:15
interesting didn’t change at all in mine wonder why,2024-03-02 17:38:30
"i guess i understood that part i just was confused how the “clear way forward” ended up being exactly what the prophecy laid out 

i just don’t know what “awakened paul” wants why does the worm  give him the motivation to lead this war and manipulate these people despite being so against it prior to 

all in all i loved the movie i just wish there were more explanation for paul’s sudden change in motivation other than “he drank worm juice so he’s enlightened now” 

enlightened by what and why does the juice from the fremen’s sacred animal make him further perpetuate the propaganda created by the bene gesserit",2024-03-02 20:59:21
" once he takes the water he can see the way forward clearly 

i mean he literally says precisely that though

he says he sees one narrow way forward",2024-03-03 02:01:20
shes likely is starting to believe in paul herself but after he takes the water of life he changes in a major way and she said shed love paul as long as he stayed who he was but hes changed hence her being  off,2024-03-01 18:26:18
exactly and i feel like chani will the catalyst for a decision paul makes in the next movie without spoiling anything it will be her begging him not to put that burden on himself,2024-03-04 10:24:51
"jessica and stilgar kind of fill that role already

jessica isnt really that in this movie she comes across as way more manipulative and sinister than she is in the book where she is greatly conflicted about pauls path and how it puts him in danger 

i agree that stilgar can kind of fill the role but he doesnt really in the movie because there just wasnt enough time to develop a relationship between him and paul stilgars faith comes across as more set dressing and occasional comedic relief than something that really impacts paul and his path in the story

seems like in the genre of epic reluctant heroes there needs to be somebody to keep the hero true to themselves

chanis support in the book is exactly that though paul doesnt want to do what is needed but chanis faith in him is what allows him to follow along the best path despite how hard it still is chani believing in him so implicitly is what pushes paul to accept his role and overall fate despite his reservations

we dont really have that in the movie as is and the transition from paul the man into paul the messiah of the fremen feels less convincing as a result chani can still be a strong character without completely changing her personality the dynamic of her relationship with paul",2024-03-04 01:06:48
and being “slow” and “boring” is all about subjectivity things that cannot be measured but are only subjected to their own opinions but to the more factual this movie probably brings home most of the technical oscars along with leading role and director we are talking about 810 oscars for this movie ,2024-03-06 18:53:44
thanks for the explanation ive gotta read those books,2024-03-02 09:16:53
would’ve been unhinged lol,2024-03-03 01:24:24
yea gonna wait two weeks and hope to snag something,2024-03-04 05:45:27

they often also lack vocabulary and theyd miss lots of details hidden in dialogue

and even though in theory everyone learns it in school many people did not enjoy it and they barely use it in every day life

then add those people who never learnt it and the pool of people preferring german dialogue remains big enough to allow the dubbing industry which grew at a time when few people actually understood english to continue to thrive",2024-03-10 11:57:30
awesome bro you influence alot of stuff you are a true international man of mystery did you also invent the question mark,2024-03-17 22:47:18
"okay so basically the shields are pretty much the big thing that changes warfare in dune shields are ubiquitous and can cover anything from an individual soldier to a massive ship and are essentially impenetrable to any projectile weapon both in and out so in most of the known universe warfare demands handtohand combat because its the only effective method of penetrating a shield

as for why they dont just pave the desert with ordnance theres more context for this in the books than the movies the basic explanation is that there arent enough resources to cover every possible ambush location with tons of air support constantly and the fremen actually control the majority of arrakis surface even the sietches near arrakeen are wellhidden and are only rarely discovered by offworld forces and the sietches in the deep desert are essentially impossible to reach from arrakeen

the fremen themselves are betterresourced than expected because they are smuggling spice largely using offworlders as intermediaries and using that vast wealth to both buy supplies and also to bribe choam and the spacing guild to keep arrakis orbit clear of satellites this ensures their true numbers stay hidden and also ensures offworlders are unwilling to take the risk of landing ships outside of arrakeen and its surroundings",2024-04-06 19:54:00
"it’s a public forum if you have an opinion you will have people disagree i agree downvoting opinions we disagree with is petty and pointless 

you’re going to attract dissent if you are a minority opinion it’s human nature the only right choice is not getting down in the mud have a discussion with those open to it move on from those who don’t you don’t owe them engagement 

but if you’re going around with weakly argued opinions you can also expect to be put to scrutiny for it that’s up to you whether you can handle it",2024-03-01 19:57:02

100 agree they made feyd look like a  and then expected us to see him as a threat,2024-03-05 03:20:43
" and then immediately afterwards he went to uncle fatso to whine about how one of them wasn’t drugged and crippled enough

no he went to uncle fatso because he presumed he used the atreides prisoner as an attempt on feyds life feyd told the handlers to back off and disabled his own shield when fighting 

 i did not find him threatening at all because the film deliberately went out of its way to never actually establish him as a particular threat 

i mean hes the one who sacks sietch tabr basically as soon as he takes over for rabban 

but yes i agree he could have been fleshed out more one of the reasons why dune would have been better served as a tv series instead of 2 movies",2024-03-03 03:36:59
just have her only whisper to jessica the film wouldnt really have needed to change that much,2024-03-06 23:35:08
that makes sense and all the more reason the film should have clarified things more,2024-03-01 05:08:14
it can definitely be a tricky balance with adaptations but i am sure certain pacing issues could have been improved upon without altering the story too much although i realize the source material is said to be particularly difficult to adapt into movies,2024-03-02 01:43:03

it’s just a shame that the lead performance detracts so much from my experience of these films a truly charismatic dynamic figure at the center would make all the difference",2024-03-03 05:34:28
i mean for the amount of subject material to cover i have 0 real complaints this was the movie that was supposed to be impossible to tackle and i think dennis did a  fine job i could pick apart any movie under the sun but i am ok with this one,2024-03-03 06:59:49

"of course yes i remember in the movie the harkonnens were questioned why they didnt probe into how many fremen there might be in the south i hadnt considered that 

they definitely were a powerful unit one thing i loved about this movie and i suppose the novels if i had read them is that this was another classic big battle but this time the good guys absolutely flattened the enemy with a calculated move",2024-03-17 09:33:19

"exactly like it or not that battle sequence is the payoff and victory for all that our heroes have endured over this journey funny that it’s only been 3mo and gurney has already got himself a part time gig as a smuggler on a planet that’s galactically monitored  …

so this “conquering” of both the backstabbing emperor’s entire army as well as recovering arrakeen which has required paul to successfully secure and harness the desert power regardless the fact he’s been realized as the kh this battle is the epic realization of our heroes’ hardship and journey …

and it just felt like dv was in a hurry to get through all of it without creating an awareness or investment for the audience in the buildup to the action let alone how he failed to really create any intensity or drama in the action itself…

i love dv but there was some really important emotionalinvestment i kind of needed experience through act 3 to reward my investment in the story from 001 of dune part one and also especially needed to reconnect me to the story after that arduousattimes act 2…

in light of that act 2 the act 3 i think failed to generate in me the emotional excitement reward payoff insert other emotionalserotonindopamine reaction adjective here and it left me disappointed — not sure if any of this makes sense",2024-03-01 10:01:11

i think its so awesome that a major hollywood movie with the trendiest actors in the world has got so much layered discussion going i feel like the more i understand about the plot and themes the more questions i have its tantalising and awesome

obviously the films owes its life to the incredible side material which im slowly but surely reading through",2024-03-21 23:15:39
" bruh ive literally quoted the scenes where hes saying out loud that wants to lie to  manipulate a native people using a prophecy he knows is fake for the sake of his revenge which he also knows could lead to a horrible galactic war killing billions

sorry  i meant not done anything wrong post realisation that he wants to fight for the fremen i agree that he started off selfish a classic heros tale is someone who starts out selfish but realises a greater purpose throughout their arc

has it been a long time since you watched part one

yes but ive read several recaps

after the reverend mother had tested paul she speaks to jessica paul overhears and then jessica explains  what the kwisatz haderach is she talks about how the bg have been mixing bloodlines for hundreds of years trying to produce a mind that could bridge space  time past  future etc and that some believe this being is already here and then in part two jessica after becoming a reverend mother herself tells paul that he would unlock his full potential as the kh by drinking the water of life opening his mind etc both films say multiple times that the fremens lisn al gaib prophecy was a fakepropaganda planted by the bg to control them  and yet paul has abilities he can see the future etc the explanation for this given in both films was him being the kwisatz haderach a person specifically bred over centuries to have these abilities

it doesnt seem to me like these are inherently at odds with one another or that just because the reasons behind his prophet like abilities are breeding that this means the prophecy is propaganda planted by the bg it seems like in the magical universe of dune these two currents could coincide a being that can bridge time and space could still be a prophetmessiah for a group of people even if he can only do that because another group bred him to be it 

basically what i think is missing is your evidence from the film that the bg planted this prophecy in the minds of the fremen if im paul i think id probably be like okay yes i understand why i have all these powers but that doesnt mean im not actually a  like figure since i am doing  like  and this random group of people ive met have all heard of me and know everything i can do and i can read their minds

edit looking into it further it seems like there is literally just a scene where she explains the bg planted the conspiracy my bad on that though its a shame my interlocutor deleted their account rather than just explain to me that this was a literal scene in the film",2024-03-21 11:24:14
"they say  she filled her purpose before he executes her    
i think she would be killed outright if she wasnt a spy for the harkonen  why take random prisoners and present them  to feyd otherwise",2024-03-04 11:08:42
what i meant was it was immersion breaking i understood what was happening but the way it played out felt very off it took me out of the movie,2024-03-05 05:03:33
" ive just explained in detail under another comment of yours using scenes only from the films as evidence exactly how  why what paul does is wrong

i think these were great and show how he is flawed at points in the film but these do not show that him fulfilling the prophecy is bad its possible that the film shows a flawed character realising his potential as a hero and doing what needs to be done despite the risk of it being harmful

part two showed that even the fremen themselves would eventually get hit by a famine or something because of it 

i really did not see this again without the knowledge of the books the premonitions are quite ambiguous and could mean a lot of things 

also the whole friends being turned into followers willing to gleefully   die for the sake of a lying manipulative foreigner who went down this path initially only for his own revenge despite knowing the risk of such a war etc

yes at first but then he has a premonition and realises that he actually does need to lead them for their liberation i think again that the film doesnt compel me to believe that the premonition is strictly false  he really does come back to life he really is able to read the minds of the people he really is seemingly able to see the future",2024-03-21 11:03:27
yeah that makes a lot of sense since they said shields drive worms into a killing frenzy which made me wonder how they used shields to keep the city safe,2024-03-01 17:02:09
"without having read the book this seems to be a case of being faithful to the characterization of the book character even when it makes little sense in the context of the movie adaptation and the other changes between book and movie 

having said that i have heard the character was described looking like a young man with an old soul  in the book which conceptually sounds far more interesting than what the movie gave us",2024-03-02 01:15:34
yeah i appreciate that i just felt like he should have gone south and then spent a few minutes trying to avoid being the religious figure the people there thought he was or battling with the thought of drinking the water of life,2024-03-03 13:55:08
i wasn’t expecting it after he drank the water of life just thought there should be a few minutes of him in the south trying to avoid being a religious figure or battling with the idea of fully committing before drinking the water of life,2024-03-03 13:54:17
i find it an interesting change to add conflict between paul and chani at the end i remember the very last paragraph of the book is jessica saying something like how irulan will simply be a concubine but chani will forever be paul’s actual lady,2024-03-03 02:41:12
how is anything lost they talked over and over about how paul was leading them into a holy war that would cost billions and the movie ended on chanis clearly distraught face,2024-03-03 06:47:14
"i’ve commented a few times that’s legal lol

but my goal isn’t to change anyone’s opinion",2024-03-10 22:45:03
dunes message is that you should be careful about fanaticism and religious figures most people arent going to get the message because dune is a white savior movie while the sequels tells the readers the consequences of said religious figures and fanaticism,2024-03-03 07:27:02
"because it wasnt as evident in the first book there was no consequences to the freedom of the fremen until the sequels dune was a white saviour movie until then you have to have a white saviour to have the message

dune initially had sequels anyways so thats when the plot twist happens",2024-03-04 11:37:10
oh wow a lot of this seems pretty obvious now looking back i just wasn’t sure because i didn’t know a thing about the dune lore and as much as chani hates it it’s still unfortunately better than if the harkonnen had control,2024-03-01 07:54:14
hmmm that’s an alternative for my gf and i to bond over disagreeing with ty hehehehe,2024-03-08 20:29:09
as a non reader i never once got the sense that any of the fremen were ever in danger they also dont even focus on the consequences of feyd rautha shelling arrakis for very long but hey we got to see a dwarf woman wrestle a worm and extract blue goop from it instead,2024-03-02 16:54:50
it wasnt a  scene it was the aftermath of one that we didnt even get to see robbed,2024-03-02 23:12:12
" i think this comes down to an expectations getting into the way from you reading the book first you expect certain things to happen or you compare what happened in the movie vs the book this is why i didn’t want to read the book before finishing the first books content in part 1 and 2

ive never read the book and the scene came off as him complaining that the baron was trying to  him whole scene made him come off as a  and incompetent to be honest he struggled to 1v1 a malnourished prisoner",2024-03-05 03:13:50

i’m not looking to debate but most comments on this thread are just a couple lines and don’t explain the positives or negatives of the film i want to get into the nitty gritty of it all and was looking for someone who had read the book to shed some light perhaps on some of the negatives i had,2024-03-02 04:49:11

but i also choose to look on them as different mediums",2024-03-02 06:16:04
she talks like a kid living in new york ie mj from the spiderman movies rather than someone of arakis in the year 10000whatever everyone else had a distinct way of speaking even chalamet but zendaya just speaks like  zendaya,2024-03-06 17:41:44
i strongly believe this movie couldve been an alltimer with another actor in the role chani is such a meaty character and someone more skilled couldve been absolutely devastating with her quieter scenes,2024-03-07 00:12:04
i think it’s also tough for z bc her scene partner is a master the range of emotion chalamet can convey is deep so when it throws back and forth she just can’t match his variety or otherwise,2024-03-08 21:44:22
" one more thing that wasnt really mentioned in both filmsthe baron paid an exorbitant amount to the spacing guild

i believe the baron does mention this in the first movie  when they return to arakis he instructs rabban to begin selling spice reserves but slowly so as not to plummet the price  i believe the baron mentions how expensive it all was

but its one of those many details that are vital for understanding the book that just doesnt have time to be developed on screen",2024-03-09 16:37:58
" did you read the book

no were talking about the movies",2024-03-14 00:43:12
just say you didnt understand the movie,2024-03-24 20:53:45
but the ending of the film is shot in a way that alludes that the story is going to be continued that is a bizarre choice if the status of the third movie is as precarious as you are saying  it makes everything that chani does in the next book make no sense unless they are going to make drastic changes there also,2024-03-02 21:12:41
if the masses arent worshipping paul the story doesnt really go anywhere and most of messiah doesnt happen or mean anything,2024-03-02 21:14:00

"thanks for sharing i didn’t know this scene was on youtube since i didn’t want spoilers but i can definitely see what you’re saying fremen are known to have unique advanced technology and paul’s mask fits the shape of the visor perfectly just weird at first especially since he wears “ski goggles” with a headband in other scenes

just adds more value to the level of detail from denis and his crew",2024-03-02 04:42:07

well  i wanted to read the books but my friend said that these were written in old english and he told me that it is better to watch original movie with the guy from twin peaks i watched it and he was less sinister and more of a hero than remake paul,2024-03-04 06:45:20
there is no magic it’s the spice melange mixed with his bene gesserit selective breeding that enhances his mental acuity,2024-03-01 21:28:49
"thats a better way to describe it

one minor point though i dont recall chanis part in bringing paul back to consciousness after drinking the water of life being a matter of timing in the book three weeks had passed chani flew in on an orni and suggested using the water of life under his nose was the first to suggest it wasnt intentionally timed to fall under a prophecy",2024-03-02 21:08:02

yes you are definitely right i guess what i am getting at is she seems to have rejected being a mother which was confusing to me maybe if she had been with paul more during the second film like she was in the book it would have worked better for me she just seemed separated from paul so much and the idea that she knew he would take the water of life wasa stretch she also says in the book that when paul is in the trance she encouraged the idea that he was in a religious trance but that she herself had no idea what was going on i know it is nitpicky but i just missed the complexity of the characters jessica did not seem to have any cognitive dissonance about anything that was going on even lady macbeth had guilt lololol out out  spot,2024-03-26 14:14:49
"ugh read your own link nowhere in that link refutes anything i’ve said

it says commanders sometimes led ‘’cavalry’’ charges not infantry this is never a vanguard situation where you are the first person to engage the enemy but after the infantry engages you tactically move in with heavy armor and the best units surrounding you and getting your back practically the lowest amount of risk possible on the battlefield

also by leading the charge most likely they were in the unit surrounded by men not literally the first person engaging the enemy even then this was really rare it is rare to the point that the rare kingscommanders who did it are recognized as remarkablecrazy but yeah let’s have the most important person be the first person uphill to engage an enemy like we have seen many times depicted in dune especially without armor

i cannot believe i’m arguing how insane this is it’s like an iq test

what we see rabban do is a lot more realistic he’s on the front lines but always with his unit and never the first person charging

i hate internet discussions you are messing up my enjoyment of the movie by making me defend earth is round",2024-03-15 14:04:16
"yeah things make more sense when you add book information into it but we haven’t seen it depicted in the screen that much i get the explanations and all but yeah i guess my experience is my experience do you find nothing that i’ve said that you agree with i feel like even though logically you are correct but it could have been depicted better at certain points

i get the storyline logic of not letting anyone get to rabban but still man the most valuable people being the first person to lead uphill charges to fortified positions are so unrealistic to the point it just takes me out of it a little that’s all the movie was so immersive and realistic on every other point that i really felt it usually when i feel i’m just watching a movie i don’t really care that much

i also feel like nobody really engages the point of how unrealistic chani is the only person not believing in the prophecy is i understand in the books she believes 100 and paul is the one not believing it which makes so much more sense again i understand the reasoning but still it makes her look so illogical unreasonable and  to process very obvious facts that’s in front of her i wish paul had to really convince her to not believe in it feel like it made me respect her character more",2024-03-15 14:25:40
"yes thanks for your detailed response

 things wouldnt have reached this loselose or lesser of 2 horrible outcomes scenario in the first place if he hadnt decided to manipulate the fremen for his revenge in the first place though

i guess that’s the one point i’m still not sure of did he consciously decide to manipulate the fremen in the first part of part 2 jessica definitely wanted to manipulate them but paul denied he was the messiah and wanted to be named after the kangaroo rat kinda seemed like he genuinely wanted to become a fremen",2024-03-20 02:54:56

"it was just a way to simplify the plot and get the holy war started the book goes into more detail of how the empire works with their merchant guild monopoly and all space travel being controlled by the spacing guild in the book it is the spacing guild that paul threatens about destroying the spice without spice all space travel ends and the empire collapses so the spacing guild bows to him which forces all the great houses to bow as well then the fremen have free reign to go out and wipe out any religion that refuses to accept paul as space jesus 


since the movie didnt put much focus on the guilds they just simplified it to the great houses rejecting paul which starts the war as the fremen go out to crush anyone who refuses to bow to the new order",2024-03-06 03:58:23
see to me it felt like pauls goal was to free the fremen from oppression and he just had to lean into the prophecies even if he knew they were fake in order to save them most effectively at no point did i get the sense that he was manipulating them for his own ends it always felt to me like he was helping them if the movie was trying to imply that he was going mad with power and actually bad for the fremen i feel like it didnt do a great job of showing that for those of us who havent read the books,2024-03-10 03:38:14

some things just dont translate to movies like having a two year old walking and talking,2024-03-03 21:49:58
im pretty sure it wasnt mentioned i was waiting for that but it never came ,2024-03-02 03:36:38
ohhhh gotcha didn’t baron say that to leto though,2024-03-02 20:21:46
are you sure i think it was in another language,2024-03-02 22:42:15
perhaps but what he actually said in that scene sounded very powerful,2024-03-14 12:30:01
" that makes sense i didn’t notice it will check on next rewatch

ive read the book a bunch and i barely caught it like i knew how much runtime was left so i kinda guessed he had to have been heading to the temple its fairly subtle",2024-03-04 00:00:45
probably just a deleted scene i definitely was wondering why paul turned a different direction there on the worm but it was just because he went straight to the temple without chani knowing,2024-03-03 13:33:22
" that makes sense i didn’t notice it will check on next rewatch    

hes right ive just seen the movie today and they exchange looks while riding the worms and its followed by a top down shot where you can see their paths diverging  
ive read the book and i kept thinking about a lot of details that are conveyed in the movie but so discreetly that im guessing a lot of people would miss them or at least it would be unclear to them",2024-03-10 23:32:36
"that makes sense i didn’t notice it will check on next rewatch

i only clocked it on my second viewing but yes he breaks off from the group and heads elsewhere",2024-03-05 20:04:05
everything that transpired on arrakis happened in the dark as the planet doesnt have satellites so nobody can see or share proof of whats happening the other houses dont acknowledge him bc they still believe fremen to be primitive desert rats and nobody else in the imperium witnesses what just happened and not like harkonnensemperor are sharing news about them losing against a much poorer force,2024-03-03 17:49:38
the first dune book has a more happy ending id say its clear at the end of the book that paul and chani are still together despite the political marriage to the princess but my guess is they were setting things up for a possible third movie hence the talk about a holy war,2024-03-03 20:25:09
"the decision to completely remove the spacing guild is an area that the 2nd movie really suffers from and it clearly resulted in a bit of a rewriting of the ending that isnt as strong as the book 

in the book paul threatens to destroy all of the spice on dune not with nukes but with prespice mass the spacing guild is deeply addicted to spice and requires it for interstellar navigation because of spice consumption the navigators have a mild form of prescience the spacing guild holds the real power in the universe because theyre the only ones who can fly ships between planets all houses are dependent on the spacing guild

in the book the great houses do not resist his ascension to the throne paul through holding the spice hostage essentially force the guild to only allow his fedaykin to travel between planets all other great houses are stuck on their planets from there the freman spread through the galaxy on their jihad and it leads to billions of deaths 

i think the director andor the studio were a bit reluctant to make such clear and intentional by frank herbert parallels between the fremen and muslims and a jihad i think the movie instead made the houses resist his rise to the throne so theres a more direct justification for pauls war",2024-03-07 00:26:34
"the jihad that makes the other houses now to him lasts for around 10 years and ends with 62 billion dead and dozens of planets decimated

it happens between this and the next book",2024-03-03 23:01:29
don’t give him that idea,2024-03-06 21:10:12
bro you arent the messiah lol,2024-03-17 22:23:25
yes thank you the first time i read the book i was so confused because we are told the prophecy thing is a plant by the bg but then paul does exactly what the prophecy says so he actually is the chosen one of a false prophecy so then the prophecy is real so much confusion over that but upon second reading i agree ultimately it doesn’t matter,2024-03-04 03:58:25
this is the message i took from the books as well is it a prophecy or a conspiracy either way it worked out exactly as the prophecy foretold so in my eyes it’s an authentic prophecy that back fired on the bene gesserit,2024-03-13 04:20:16
this is exactly my discussion rn lol,2024-03-04 03:04:23
"what really is the difference between a “true” prophecy and a centuries long plot to make something come to pass 

from your comment i gather your answer is that there is no difference

i think it matters because it matters if the universe is one where divine predetermination as implied by the connotation of true prophecy is a thing or whether the universe is made up solely of sentient beings like ourselves without some grander force guiding events it matters because it influences how we understand free will in the universe

the difference also matters because the truth however you want to describe it also matters",2024-03-21 05:48:12
"it’s more explicit in the books but the “messianic “ prophesy is just a  story that the bene geserits’ make sure is everywhere in every poor population through the galaxy so they can use the story if and when they need it   


the easiest way to understand this is to picture if feyd killed paul   


the bene geserite would have spent lots of effort manipulating the messianic story to support feyd instead of paul",2024-04-01 03:11:55
the biggest difference is if the people who worship paul knew the extent of the calculation and planning of the prophesy they probably wouldnt worship him as a  like figure,2024-03-28 21:38:08
okay,2024-03-17 22:14:36
i thought the prophecy was more like a way for a benne gesserat to use in case of emergency on a planet the general eugenics is the planconspiracy,2024-03-14 03:14:00
fascinating what is the motivation of the bg if the prophecy is a lie,2024-04-06 09:56:15
isnt he somewhat mythical as he can see the future and can use the voice,2024-03-06 08:56:56
i do this they had to simplify down the message a bit just because they thought moviegoers would mislabel it a white savior narrative,2024-03-06 16:53:21
yeah thats true i guess they had to dumb it down for the average moviegoer which makes sense with the amount of comments i saw saying the first movie had no plot or purpose when it was literally all world building and setting up these politicalreligious conflicts for this movie,2024-03-06 21:20:05
they elevated chani compared to the books seems like theyll make her the origins of the true fremen stock,2024-03-11 03:12:36
i havent read the books but i plan to after im done reading the red rising series however in the first movie they talk about their purpose being to direct humanity to the enlightened path so my guess is they spread the prophecy to arrakis to make it easier to control the spice production in the future for whoever ended up being the kwisatz haderach,2024-03-06 16:58:53
how would you know it wouldnt be needed if it was a divine prophecy you can have people act in bad faith and divine prophecy still occur the 2 are not mutually exclusive,2024-03-23 22:08:22
you  and her daughter in her   you to her about how bad your are at ,2024-03-06 23:48:54
imagine how weird it would be for her,2024-03-03 18:36:49
her voice hit me as a little omenish  omeny,2024-03-14 15:33:51
" hes a gruff nononsense leader in part 1 and then his religious side leads him to being the comic relief in the first half of part 2 but while his delivery never changes the laughter in my theater got more awkward and forced and by the end of the movie it had died out completely

as they should they may laugh back then because they had no faith now when they realise they are graced with the presence of the prophet they knew in their hearts that being flippant is unwise",2024-03-06 15:08:52
and who can blame him we can see the prophesy coming true from his pov if  rapture happens right now i will become a believer pretty fast,2024-04-08 12:48:05
"ye i realised that fully in reading messiah and then rereading dune it is more clear 

as i said i was young when i read it for the first time i still think it’s less obvious than in the films and definitely the sort of smug ‘i understand the story better than you’ is perhaps not conducive to truly engaging with the art and the story  i’m not sure what i think entirely 

i definitely never thought of paul as the good guy just complex i think i’ve seen him being painted as definitely bad which i think is maybe ok but also it’s more complex than that anyway what with what he saw in his visions after drinking water of life and what not and also it’s more interesting for people to come to their own conclusions about what they’ve seen rather than being told what they’ve seen and messiah massively helps that but in a way that is conducive to thought and retrospection rather than like premoralisation of a fictional character



edit  just reread comment and i’m not saying you’re one of the smug people just that i have seen them",2024-03-05 13:02:18
did they even say terrible purpose in the movie,2024-03-06 17:04:07
they could also fold some of alia’s cod arc into messiah that could work well,2024-03-12 11:16:57
he did a great skarsgård accent,2024-03-06 06:33:31

i didnt know who they would cast or did cast for his role i have avoided any trailer or media about parts 1 and 2 i love the books and the director so for me seeing dune was a given for the scene leading up to the reveal of the actors faces and who played the part i was absolutely thinking nicholas hoult could play the part well,2024-03-15 03:42:25
glad someone has the exact experience as me,2024-04-08 09:25:00
oh yeah it just didn’t get explained nearly as thoroughly,2024-03-12 05:26:28
yeah i appreciate how crystal clear and crispy the sound was it added to the experience but jeez a couple of times i startled in my seat ,2024-03-11 04:31:19

"you might be better off googling this but i’ll do my best from memory 

the worms have sections fremen riders use grappling style hooks that they sink into the place between sectioned once in place the hooks pull back the tough outer layer that protects the worms soft parts from being abraded by the sand 

as soon as a rider exposes that soft under skin the worm will immediately begin to travel in a way that keeps the exposed part as far from the sand as possible and will continue as long as the skin is exposed 

they also use this to make a turn in the worms direction by adjusting the positioning of their hooks ",2024-03-10 08:25:52
the hooks lift up their skin exposing holes for breathing they want to keep those holes in the air so they don’t choke from sand pouring in,2024-04-01 14:00:27
 you’re definitely right ,2024-04-02 06:53:02
"i love these books so much but im still able to give every film maker plenty of latitude to tell the story as they see it  also just because 10yearold me pictured sand worms lumbering along like massive oil tankers doesnt mean that is what frank intended when he imagined this universe into existence 

i liked the way it looked at the movies but that did pop into my mind",2024-03-14 19:40:37
they generally only stop when ridden to exhaustion otherwise the drivers just roll the worm by moving their hooks down one side or another and people drop off the side the worm instinctively keeps the exposed scales the ones the hooks are pulling back above the sand so by adjusting the position and distance between the hooks they can more or less manage the dismount,2024-03-05 14:21:02

ive got a surround system that sounds great but it doesnt hold a candle to the dozens of channels and total output of a good theater  the nuance was impressive  even with 51 or 71 at home you can kind of feel the blending of channels to place sounds in between the exact placement of speakers but in the theater it really feels like the gasps of the crowd during a pivotal moment are coming from 100 different directions around you

i believe the theater i went to had 60 individual channels  if you looked around during bright scenes you could see what basically amounted to a sphere or cocoon of speakers encasing the audience

yes and i thought i was the messiah but it turned out to just be an old bottle of antifreeze,2024-03-10 02:11:30
for me it sounded like a cross between elvis and the baron couldnt get it out my head aint nothing but a sand worm,2024-03-04 19:21:44
i dunno i think it was just enough of christopher walken to avoid him evoking the campy walken character,2024-03-03 08:21:10
yea agreed you can see why he’s the emperor in the books he runs circles around the baron and is actually intimidating,2024-03-04 03:41:49

"yeah lol i get my seat drop my  off then go grab popcorn or whatever then come in when the last trailer is midway through or if im in the middle of the row and thats annoying i straight up close my eyes and meditate for a bit 

i know im a  freak but trust me its so worth i started doing after when i was younger and was seeing i am legend in theaters with my gf we were emo squad so i was like why tf does my gf want to see a football movie with me whatever i somehow had accidentally missed all marketing for i am legend and thought it was a sports movie based off the title sit down first scene is will smith driving a ferrari around desolated nyc what the  is this  at one point a lion jumps out from behind a car and i jumped and my gf didnt so i asked her why that didnt surprise her she says i saw it in the trailer

the rest of the movie remains one of my favorite movie experiences of my life and honestly i am legend is kinda mid especially with the end but in spite of that it was so  scary having no idea what was going on no expectations walking into it expecting a football movie i wanted to replicate that for every movie going forward forever

after you watch a movie go back and watch the trailer its crazy how often trailers set a completely different tone will show scenes from near the end of the movie so if youre not sure if a character will live or not or whatever you can be like well i havent seen him in this scene yet so i guess he survives whatever is happening right now and sometimes theyll straight up go through the first half of the movies story beats it ruins it",2024-03-08 02:03:20
i show up 20 minutes late and i still usually have to watch one trailer before the movie starts,2024-03-18 19:06:38

eh she’s basically a different character with the same name which worked fine but i generally don’t like it when adaptions do that,2024-03-05 02:28:44
i hope shes not in it,2024-03-13 19:40:16
i haven’t read messiah yet but it shot to the top of my reading list when i stepped out of the theater,2024-03-04 02:11:30
she’s what they call “preborn” because jessica drank the water of life while pregnant which means she’s born with not only the full mental capabilities of an adult but also of a reverend mother there’s also a 2 year time skip in the book so she’s basically a toddler who walks and talks like an adult it… works in a book better than it would have on screen,2024-03-02 23:52:31
she kills the baron with a poisoned needle the gom jabbar the same type of poison needle that the reverend mother and lea seydouxs character use when wielding the green box,2024-03-03 05:17:42
alia gets taken or lets herself get taken prisoner and then no one bothers to search her for hidden weapons because shes literally two years old at the climax vlad grabs her to try to hold her hostage to stave off paul and she stabs him with a gom jabbar,2024-03-04 00:24:30
"i don’t think it’s a spirit i think he’s “remembering” a timeline where he didn’t  jamis the first time they met jamis would have become his friend and mentor teaching him much of the fremen ways


the way the movie framed it i think that’s the timeline if paul gave up jessica the fremen were ready to take paul in but he had to earn the right to bring her mother into their protection which he earned in the duel against jamis",2024-03-05 23:05:51
i just came from watching the film can confirm about 50 of the audience laughed out loud every time,2024-03-03 04:05:01

but wait paul can actually see the pastfuture and is the only man to ever survive the sand worm poison by being woken up by a fullfilled prophecy nonetheless why would he feel guilty he literally is the fremen jesus,2024-03-31 20:39:58
once he sees the damage that paul’s leadership does to the universe he will get more wary of paul,2024-03-03 15:51:23
the answer is literally in the book,2024-03-17 07:25:28
theyre clearly going to change messiah tremendously following that book closely for part three would make for a terrible movie,2024-03-11 18:52:09
a lot of what they show is like 2 pages in the books then iirc it’s fanaticism in messiah then regret in children,2024-03-01 23:08:13

feyd would have too had he not been fighting,2024-03-14 07:09:45
ok but the upvotes speak for itself,2024-03-24 03:57:42
because everyone is in praise mode in this thread movies great but that  was incredibly choreographed thats why it looks so good ,2024-03-04 14:08:57

didnt the threat work in the book too it seems like in the movie he makes the threat and the other houses are like lol nah but in the book didnt most of them capitulate,2024-03-11 22:49:37
the movie could have done a better job showcasing the importance of the spice like hundreds of ships coming and going hauling spice at all times,2024-04-08 13:49:09

thats the thing thats exactly the path he took which he had been trying to avoid the one with most deaths once he drank the poison his visions became clear and realized there was no other path where the fremen would survive or at least survive in freedom if he hadnt taken it more likely than not the empreror and the others would have won as according to him there were many futures where they lost but only one narrow path that will allow them to come out ther other side alive,2024-03-05 16:32:52

yeah i just finished watching it and that really was the only thing from me “loving” the movie but i think it was more me comparing book vs movie than is the movie actually good so that’s on me i think what the movie did is more realistic to our world and really women watching the movie would have been like  had chani not been  i think i’m going to have to watch it again now that i’m over this haha,2024-03-03 07:23:59
i think it could partially be that but it was a far more interesting take on the character chani in the books is fine but quite bland in my opinion shes just chill to go along with whatever paul wants like the rest of the fanatics but thats not particularly interesting as a character,2024-03-03 16:14:52
its a modernization of the story,2024-03-08 09:11:06
yeah agreed this was the only gripe i really have about the film ,2024-03-08 05:28:21
well ok i think i was unclear here  she does believe hes the messiah in the books 10000 but in the books shes also 100 behind him always and is more submissive to paul in the sense that shes culturally accepting of him as the leader  she always supports him  her character was wildly different in the movie,2024-03-10 12:16:04
different kind of spice,2024-03-05 15:48:29
too spicy for you eh,2024-03-07 08:43:23
the power of spice compels you,2024-03-16 20:22:55
it’s complicated the reels are heavy it’s loud as  it’s very skilled work for sure and a union job i’m technically in the union for it but i couldn’t begin to tell you how to do it,2024-03-04 15:26:14
now my mind just flashed back to the barons face covered in ants,2024-03-03 09:17:11
man those thumps had me straight up giddy sitting in my seat,2024-03-12 23:03:19
"ive read a couple comments here saying atmos sound is better

both the picture and sound are both noticeably better but the latter specifically is what the real selling point is the sound systems are unbelievable

as for the volume question im probably the wrong person to ask about that i like things really loud and on top of that ive probably got a lot more hearing damage than most people my age so im not as sensitive to volume

personally ive never found imax to be too loud and dolby is probably a bit louder in recent memory both john wick 4 and dune 2 had me geeking out from how deep i could feel the bass in my chest",2024-03-17 18:46:22
i feel like we’re in the minority i came prepared and for the first time ever i wore ear plugs in the theater  it was so much more enjoyable without ear pain during the action scenes  with how loud it is anyways it honestly didn’t sound muffled or worse i could still hear everything very clearly i’d recommend trying it out,2024-03-22 04:09:16
no pain sound was crystal clear and you could feel it in your body but it didnt hurt the ears,2024-03-15 23:34:03
the audio is strong enough to shake the seats on its own,2024-03-04 23:02:12
as i understand it they put subwoofers directly under the seats,2024-03-05 14:32:15
"the 143 one

is the 143 one that youre referring to is 1570mm imax ",2024-03-14 00:10:28
100  i just saw dune 2 as well and while it was pretty  good nowhere close to interstellar,2024-03-11 22:19:44
my gfs pick it was pretty good though,2024-03-09 17:40:07
people seem to stop during or after messiah or stay for the whole ride either way i’d argue messiah isn’t all that good but it at least has something there that’s adaptable i can’t say the same for children of dune and  emperor ,2024-03-07 14:35:22
not only that but its helped with pronunciation as well of certain names,2024-03-02 00:58:39
what holes,2024-03-03 14:20:15
they dropped the whole feyd using poison thing in the book he gets cut not intentionally and then neutralizes the poison like he did the water of life but acts poisoned to trick feyd,2024-03-04 21:50:48
in the book feyd has a poison pin thing on his hip so he basically pelvic thrusts paul at one point definitely didnt miss that part,2024-03-05 03:55:23
i think in the movie it was intended to mirror how his dad was planning to  baron harkonnen in the first movie luring in the enemy when they think you are at your weakest and give one lethal attack,2024-03-06 16:09:07
its been years since i read the books but from my memory he lets himself get stabbed with the poison dagger to let fayds guard down,2024-03-04 07:23:42
i was absolutely hooked straight through to chapterhouse dune and then brian herbert decided to publish the absolute atrocities that are hunterssandworms of dune after those two books ill never read another book where someone tries to finish the original writers work,2024-03-03 19:17:42
after the next one meaning stop after 3 or stop after 4 because i finished the first 4 and highly recommend finishing 4,2024-03-02 17:51:18
 emperor is the last of the series and thats what im telling my kids,2024-03-03 05:16:40
sooo is the movie gonna have a different ending,2024-03-21 07:53:43
he reveals theyre cousins iirc to startle him and land the blow,2024-03-08 02:16:39
"
he literally limps over to the emperor slowly i just came back from it",2024-03-19 04:16:41
"i think paul spends a lot of time justifying his imperialism in his own head and then consistently makes whatever move gets him the most power anyway  he does a lot of angsty thinking about how theres no other way but then routinely acts in his own self interest

im not sure id agree that he just wanted to live alone in the desert with chani  i think he totally could have done that and instead chose to destroy the universe for his own power  the jihad was avoidable right up until he did everything to make it happen",2024-03-03 12:05:46
i have a hard time believing chani is going to serve the same role she did in messiah seems like theyre setting up a very different role for her which is cool she didnt do much after dune besides not get pregnant,2024-03-04 13:28:59
yeah but chani is totally different in the movie i agree with the above poster that it seems like hes doing it to show his mortality to moviechani,2024-03-02 04:55:58
eh they left room for her to somewhat come back to what she should be,2024-03-03 21:14:35
that exact thought crossed my mind as i was watching that scene,2024-03-05 21:10:03
okay i will look closely tomorrow as i go see it third time,2024-03-01 19:52:40
"not really he was stabbed the first time on the left side then the emperors knife didnt even touch him

he managed to bend it over and stick it to feyd",2024-03-18 08:21:48
 that’s so cool thank you for mentioning ,2024-03-17 15:01:01
well yes but still,2024-03-02 12:28:32
not mortal then,2024-03-05 06:03:43
out of the thousand times ive heard it used it was never in that context til you said it didnt have to do with grammar but touche i guess,2024-03-06 10:47:22
nah i kind of agree that the exact shots in that scene could’ve shown the turnaround better without being too  overt no big deal,2024-03-02 21:55:14
"my issue is that it feels a bit of a clichéd both groan but who killed who fakeout plus the fact that there were way too many callbacks here 

1 paul getting stabbed in his abdomen was a callback to how jamis got stabbed jamis died from it but paul didnt

2 feyd getting stabbed was callback to gurneys lesson

3 feyds callback to his own line earlier in the movie well fought atreidis felt a bit weird that he was so accepting of death and not more angry about it

now im not saying these things were wrongly represented paul may have become op after blue worm  but it wasnt made clear and feyd might actually have been an honourable warrior but it wasnt shown to be that and not arrogance although it was told by seydouxs character

minor nits in the grand scheme of things but the climactic duel of the movie not being the most memorable thing in the movie is a slight minus mark nonetheless",2024-03-03 03:43:31
thats good to know it was foreshadowed at the very least i didnt mean to say it was not a deliberate choice to let the scene play out objectively like it did but i just thought he could have conveyed that point within the scene itself thats merely my personal opinion and id trust he would be more than capable to express it visually within the scene if he had decided to approach it that way i stand by that opinion because most viewers would not remember a small detail from a movie they watched two years ago although that may just be the nature of part 1 and part 2 movies having said that for fans and observant viewers it seems perfectly clear and set up and i respect the attention to detail,2024-03-02 08:42:17
honestly i remember thinking he looked pretty adept like he had a very loose fighting style that seemed adaptable and efficient i could be way off with that assessment but that was the feeling i got i guess if i am in fact not correct about that it could also be explained by just being malnourishedtortured in harkonnen captivity etc ,2024-03-03 19:37:38
keep in mind paul is still a young royal where as that guy was a seasoned veteran ranking just below gurney in arguably one of the best fighting forces in the whole setting they trained paul but they still had decades of experience over him so feyd slightly struggling against him but not necessarily against paul can work,2024-03-10 02:43:44
true i am probably connecting those dots in my head having read the book its a cool fight in the movie but is definitely missing that dune plans within plans that is so present everywhere else including in this very fight in the book with all his hidden stuff,2024-03-03 15:50:00
this is spot on it didnt feel realistic that it was such a close call battle for paul considering hes supposed to be the chosen one and feyd struggled against random atreides although those were grown men,2024-03-04 02:39:53
"the harkonnen come into his cell and he not turning his back to even look at them goes basically “you’ll have to just  me here i won’t go out there drugged and die a fool” way more gravitas than the other two who we only see being pinned down and drugged against their will

and iirc one of the harkonnen says “no drugs for you” and he gives a surprised look

besides the two big guys were brand new for this movie the guy we’re talking about roger yuan played clearly a highranking officer in the atreides army in the first movie you can see him in a few scenes so it’s likely supposed to be the same character",2024-03-07 18:29:05
"the fight plays out differently in the book  
its a close call but paul only gets wounded in his arm but its by a blade with a slowing poison on it and he has to use his abilities to transmute and nullify the poison feyd also has a hidden poison needle on his hip that catches paul off guard leading him to fall to the ground after barely dodging since feyd is then in position to  him paul is tempted to use a bene gesserit trick a triggering word to stun feyd but instead shouts out his refusal to stoop to such tactics ironically shouting that out momentarily confuses feyd paul reverses and stabs feyd through the jaw and into the brain  
its a very detailed fight but i guess they couldnt figure out how to make it work like the book and have it clear just how close paul was to losing without getting knives stuck in him",2024-03-03 09:58:00
 that’s really good i caught that in part 1 but didn’t make that connection here well done,2024-03-18 06:39:46
they also allude to it when he said he couldn’t predict the sietch tabr annihilation,2024-03-02 18:33:13
i wish we got a lord fenring in the movie him denying the emperors orders to  paul and the kind of envy you get from it as he was a failed kh bloodline also just throws some weird on the lady fenring feydrautha stuff,2024-03-06 05:16:24
in the books chani is more supportive of him as a messiah i think denis is just leaning into that to provide conflict for the film and to develop paul as more of an antihero in the book the marriage to irulan is political and chani is his true love,2024-03-01 23:32:32
"the princess irulan is relegated to tell paul’s story it’s cool how it clicks into place at the end of the dune book because her commentary leads off each chapter you see a bit of that in the film here

chani and paul’s relationship is way different in the book they have kids even",2024-03-02 03:05:09
" i didnt read the books so maybe im off here but i took pauls visions of chani dying to be what might happene if he stayed with her for his holy war which is partly why he chose the emperors daughter at the end not just out of strategy

paul marries irulan solely for political purposes to become emperor he still loves chani and vice versa in the movie from chanis perspective she didnt seem anywhere as accepting of this as she was in the book",2024-03-02 03:38:30
basically paul knows at this point that the jihad is inevitable and the universe will burn no matter what  hes seen that no matter what choice he makes the holy war is about to kick off so he picks the path that keeps him in control in an attempt to mitigate the damage as much as he can,2024-03-02 04:33:31
you aint cheating you aint trying,2024-04-02 08:18:38
he doesn’t remove the dagger from his side on screen just the one from his shoulder you’re correct,2024-03-01 05:21:22
i just finished watching the movie i remember him after the duel with 2 daggers clearly stuck in him so there must be 3 blades in total,2024-03-05 15:05:36
"i liked that the movie made it a closer fight though

even if paul knew he would win he still had to get stabbed twice for this path either because it was a more certain path to victory or something else i suppose

also no poison from feyd leaves a better taste since he may be a sociopathic monster but giving a villain a likeable trait is good in this case his sense of honor if all three harkonnens are all completely detestable and rabbanbaron certainly are i find that less interesting",2024-03-01 14:07:22
paul specifically mentions in the book while fighting feyd that while he forsaw this moment and others he has no control over the future in the present he realizes that the fight is the nexus point and he needs to win for his premonitions to come true but he is locked in a very real duel to the death with feyd in that moment and that he can lose he is not performing,2024-03-01 19:35:50
"the whole lasers and shields interact so that they both blow up thing is silly to me imo suicide bombers carrying a one shot laser could easily destroy entire ships and buildings if they wanted to


it would have been much better if an active shield made any laserno matter how powerful would breakfail when it  shield from some kind of feedback and an active shield meant that you cant shoot a laser because the proximity disrupted the laser gun",2024-03-04 15:54:55
caladan was boring anyway way too much water like playing life on easy mode,2024-03-02 04:53:02
is that canon it seems odd since the harkonnens kept geidi prime and arrakis simultaneously,2024-03-03 01:17:57
wait they gave up caladan i thought they would keep some force there,2024-03-03 16:39:47
plus he needed the emperor alive and nuking him kind of puts the kebash on that plan,2024-03-10 02:55:10
sssshhhhh everything is real what is vfx,2024-03-05 02:54:49
"i guess thats what they went for but it was not how i remembered it being used in the books it sounded weird because it had always been directed at alia and to a lesser extent ghanima and leto ii in the context of them potentially becoming mad

so i searched online for a glossary of some sort and that seemed to confirm my feelings

dune glossary on wikipedia

dune wiki

at least the dune wiki does say that it can surface after just consuming the water of life but in combination with psychological instability for her to call paul abomination on sight felt weird to me but i guess in theory there was a chance for paul to become an abomination when he underwent the spice agony

but paul was never fed spice while in utero so he wouldnt have the ancestral genetic memory to become abomination possessed by the voices of his genetic line although he had prescience visions of the future

and i dont remember paul becoming abomination ever being a concern in the books",2024-03-11 21:11:43
can i get some kind of lore reasoning as to how she was supposed to have a daughter on purpose,2024-03-17 23:59:10
yes exactly they just wanted to namedrop the word but it has lost its meaning by doing so its a bit disappointing,2024-03-17 18:32:17
the very short story is that gérard depardieu one of the most famous french actors is an unrepentant and life long  and much of french cinema and others including charlotte rampling defend him,2024-03-01 13:25:42
of course it’s good sean connery is half  for it,2024-03-04 00:53:30
its referring to pauls sister shes the abomination,2024-04-07 15:41:52
"dune is the inspiration for a lot other series star wars bits of aoiaf and that ripples through time with other media so on and so on it’s a testament to frank hebert that his writing skills that over 50 years after publishing the story still resonates and entertains

bear in mind dune is written as a warning about the dangers of following charismatic leaders it was always written as a critique of a “chosen one” “white savior” “hero from nobility” paul is not the hero of the story and you get it 

“the holy war begins”  literal chills and a few gasps in my theater",2024-03-03 13:04:15
"i can see that but disagree

abomination is a big part of the next couple of books and specifically refers to a child exposed to the spice change before being born paul using the voice in the reverend mother showed her the path that they have now gone down and she’s calling alia abomination through jessica it was less directed at paul and more of an open statement to the room for those that understand aka jessica",2024-03-01 14:55:07
i also understood that as abomination was a male being a chosen one when bene geserit plotted for a female to be a chosen one,2024-03-03 15:27:23
"no it’s specifically about someone who is susceptible to the other people in their memories taking over them after going through the spice change this mostly happens to children and babies

paul was supposed to have the gift as he had been specifically bred for it over generations the bene gesserit just didn’t want it to be him because the atreides weren’t as compliant as others anymore",2024-03-02 11:24:18
we need the colin robinson baby cut of dune part 2,2024-03-09 00:56:18
bless the denis and his water,2024-03-11 00:32:38
timeline is a little  up here it seems because paul looks like just facerolled everyone as soon as he got his path to victory powers without a break,2024-03-02 02:10:30
it worked with lynchs dune as the sped up and different ending made for a much lighter tone i liked villenueves adaptation here it kept its darkish more sinister one for a lot of the big scenes and plot points,2024-03-02 09:15:56
good band name,2024-03-03 03:54:51
this made me laugh unreasonably hard,2024-03-06 08:01:47
nah it was more satisfying having paul do it,2024-03-03 00:50:26
the baron got off easy,2024-03-03 00:40:05
i just watched this movie not knowing the source material and i was weirded out by the whole communicating with the fetus thing i even commented on the drive home how i didn’t like that the fetus was so advancedaware,2024-03-03 04:02:57
i have not but in the scene i read it as she was abhorred to the whole situation as a whole however thanks to you and the thread i know it was a direct reference to the fetus,2024-03-03 23:40:49
it really takes away from paul’s ‘vengeance’ against feyd and the emperor later since he already executed his father’s murderer with his own hands,2024-03-01 16:02:09
i would agree there are some things which just dont adapt well and if theyre going to time skip then you can still unleash the character,2024-03-01 16:03:02
in the movie she calls paul abomination which i thought was dumb because that’s alia’s thing and she wasn’t even in the movie,2024-03-02 06:23:45
i agree that it seemed directed at paul it would make sense because jessica trained him to use the voice which goes against the ways of the bene gesserit making him an abomination it could also be a nod or more of an easter egg to readers of the books,2024-03-03 07:29:41
i think it provides for a much richerdeeper image with dolby vision hdr not entirely familiar with how they work though,2024-03-06 05:00:03
yes exactly thats why dune is so atemporal herbert specifically removed computers and aliens so basically the novel never looks aged,2024-03-02 23:34:09
"pre history    
the whole caves of steel era basically is linked to the start of the foundation series    androids predate the foundation  it’s an important plot point",2024-04-01 04:13:54
yes i loved it in dune 1 also the throat chanting,2024-03-31 02:12:49
yeah i’ve had a problem with bautista i don’t get his hype he’s a great drax but such an average actor,2024-04-09 23:16:53
seemed like villeneuve wanted people unfamiliar with the story to be unsure if shed actually gone mad though with the shots from the perspective of fremen bystanders disconcerted by her having half a conversation like shes alice lowe in prevenge great way to ease people into the weirder parts of the story while also seeding the notion that pauls path might not be leading to levelheaded superheroism,2024-03-02 12:47:40
she even told the fetus to shut up at one point,2024-03-05 17:00:41
"love how the unborn baby was an actual character 

rare prolife w",2024-03-07 04:17:07
oh you oughta read the books if you thought that was crazy,2024-03-02 01:55:34
desperately need a what is she thinking moment in there,2024-04-08 00:57:32
how come i feel like her look definitely fits the part and shes a very strong actor,2024-03-03 14:38:55
there are people coming out of the movie still thinking they paul is a hero villeneuve cant be more subtle with the material because most viewers arent media literate enough,2024-03-01 22:49:59
i don’t think it’s about them becoming more harkonnen i think it’s about them becoming more bene gesserit,2024-03-02 17:17:42
i felt it was more that they could see the grand scale of the universe past and future and so small present day issues are insignificant in comparison,2024-03-03 08:34:42
i haven’t read the books but i thought they made that pretty clear in the movie when paul was debating going south and went out and held his hand to the ground a voice told him something along the lines of ‘you see only fragments’ i can’t remember if it was also at this point but it was strongly alluded to that if he drank the poison it would unlock his visions,2024-03-02 03:09:00
i thought that was pretty clear in the movie ,2024-03-02 15:32:49
but why  for what do they need to be more like the harkonnens he can have his revenge on the harkokkens and even the emperor the usual way  with just enough rage plus fire power the harkokkens reigned in order to control spice production at what point does the storytelling show us paul has taken on the desire to control spice production  become lord of the universe,2024-03-05 12:14:45
i mean branthree eye raven is pretty directly copying paulletos prescient godking thing,2024-03-02 19:54:43
"hen given that perspective the lives of a few billion are in fact the smaller number to sacrifice  and im all for it  fish speakers forever

is there any context telling us its actually a sacrifice for the greater good it seems more likely this is just the only situation in which things work out well for paul in the way that he envisions ie he gets his revenge and so he chooses to proceed on it",2024-03-05 03:03:28
mesa filled with terrible purpose,2024-03-18 05:16:29
legitimacy and a hostage   hes the emperor by right and marriage   nobody can claim he stole the throne  not really   there will be an adjustment period and a lot of death but in the end the throne and arrakis are his,2024-03-05 02:45:58
marrying the former emperors daughter sends a signal of continuity it will be easier to make peace with the great houses if they think he will respect their positions and marrying irulan suggests that paul doesnt want to fully overturn the old order when he gains power,2024-03-06 00:48:54
yeah you know what i mean,2024-03-04 00:54:46
"truth is jessica caused this entire mess and led to leto being killed which she demands revenge for

the bg are assholes but their plan was originally not to wipe out the atreides that became inevitable when she had a son instead of a daughter to bind the atreides to the harkonnnens",2024-03-07 22:11:29
i have never read the books nor was spoiled on pt 2 and i kinda got the impression that it wasnt literal telepathy or whatever just communication through looks across the room and knowing each other,2024-03-08 01:54:18
"absolutely my assumption as well and when you and another person share 95 of your memories being ancestral then knowing someones body language would be on a level we couldnt imagine

however kinda awkward in a movie with no time to explain it",2024-03-04 13:02:37
no thats just been gesserit training all high level bene gesserits are capable of essentially controlling every function of their with someno focus and are trained in a bajillion secret methods of talking to each other this includes getting pregnant or possibly communicating with carefully timed eyebrow lifts,2024-03-12 02:25:23
been some time since the book for me but its not magic so much as just amazing biological control over psychology,2024-03-05 22:43:13
"the atreides were basically on track to take over the empire wholesale in a generation by their buildup of armies and power and also the sheer magnetism of their scions leto and paul

they were too powerful and out of control",2024-03-01 15:16:29
yep paul and jessica were uncontrollable so they were hoping to eliminate them and look for other candidates,2024-03-01 13:45:17
its in response to paul using the voice so probably not the bg powers are not supposed to be used by a man so thats why hes an abomination,2024-03-01 13:12:14
" what are they offworld best warriors in galaxy now that atreides are gone

its only lightly touched across the films but the reason the emperor is so powerful is because the sardaukar are so insanely skilled herbert uses the false tough environments make good warriors theory to explain the sardaukars skill as due to being raised on the harsh environments of planet salusa secundus the corrino prison planet

however the fremen are raised in an even more harsh planet which therefore according to the books logic makes them even better fighters as well as having a population magnitudes greater than officially recorded paul uses the fremens pure skill as warriors combined with their numbers and zeal to conquer the other houses",2024-03-05 23:52:00
i havent read the books but how would the fremen fare in the meta that the rest of the galaxy follows with shields and ship to ship space combat as far as i know most of these guys have never ever been to space and most of their fighting style is based around unshielded combat due to being on arrakis i feel like they would get slaughtered fighting anywhere else against any great house,2024-03-04 19:55:44
it had been hinted at by frank herbert previously also the old dune encyclopedia which he did not write but which he was consulted on stated that mohiam was jessicas mother i always presumed that brian and kevin just threw that in based on frank herberts notes and because they have no original ideas of their own,2024-03-02 04:46:05
she said mom not mother thats quite the difference in context of the movie,2024-03-03 16:29:15
just put the deleted scenes on the bluray and let fan editors do the rest as has been the practice,2024-03-01 23:37:37
area 52 they cant stop all of us,2024-03-04 15:08:02
you son of a  im in,2024-03-14 07:17:42
suicide squad 2016,2024-03-02 07:32:57
yeah but jackson also doesnt recognize the extended as his own,2024-03-01 07:27:07
hard disagree,2024-03-01 07:43:57
"it is really interesting where there are some artists who are like this is the thing this exact thing and only this thing

i honestly dont love that kind of artistic purity though i have a kind of oldworld respect for it

i want to live in a world where if you a superfan of a movie there are like 400 different versions of it that you can see like every cut and change made on the way to the final product i want to be able to read every script rewrite and view fullon ai projections of how those scenes might have played out given the rest of the film

on the other hand i got really annoyed the other day when i watched alien 3 and learned only afterwards that i watched the wrong version of it because there are two somewhat authorized versions floating around out there

i want there to be a definitive cut and then to have access to all of the previous cuts if i want to deep dive but to never be able to accidentally watch the wrong version of a movie

its tough though because who is to say which cut is the definitive cut

certainly we want to live in a world where if a studio meddles too much we might later get a definitive directors cut right but there are also famous examples of directors  up their own movies later francis ford coppola the outsiders george lucas just all of it man richard kelly donnie darko

its a challenging problem to solve hope we can agree though that as amazing as denis villeneuve is one of my favorite directors ever trashing all extra material forever cannot possibly be the best solution",2024-03-02 04:59:40
ew no the fact that visions werent as big of a focus in this movie was amazing,2024-03-01 07:36:57
allegedly no confirmation,2024-03-03 16:32:42
that was one of the angles that i loved from game of thrones all of the plotting and scheming its unfortunate that they didnt include that story line,2024-03-02 21:01:56
"right after his fathers death he has an awakening of sorts i cant do the passage justice but it really bothers his mother for one she can tell that hes extremely powerful but on the other hand shes worried because he hasnt been fully trained so theres a strain on their relationship thats rather unspoken but i feel like thats extremely important in the context of the overall story that will continue in the next movie

right around the time of this awakening paul continues to struggle decerning between the now past and present hes almost paralyzed in at points in time for fear or doing or even saying the wrong word in my mind the internal struggle was profound and it added to the laundry list of difficult struggles as in the second movie they detail the fremen rights of passage or tests well which are all deadly however paul has to contend with this as well as the possible deaths of billions

then there are blindspots he cant see past or through certain things then right before he has the water of life he realizes his mother is the source of the jihad he keeps seeing while the water helps him the process of the water coupled with jessica doing the ritual with the old reverend mother is way more significant imo jessica became significantly more powerful im not fully finished with the last book in the original novel so im not sure what kind of issues will arise but i do love that story line 

its a  of a book its hard to cram all of the different layers into a movie i think they did a good job but i have a difference of opinion with how some of it was done like the sister remaining in eutero",2024-03-03 16:55:03
smokeshow,2024-03-04 02:32:21
yea they could have had a couple more conversations post water of life to show that internal struggle like they had several conversations about his hesitancy to go south but then almost none about why he decides to embrace the messiah role,2024-03-04 16:14:09
i would have liked more scenes of him looking through possible visions and mentioning of the golden path,2024-03-04 23:41:40
luckily most of messiah is him thinking about it,2024-03-06 16:10:21
downside to a movie is that internal strife and development are hard to depict,2024-03-09 23:56:02
no its an imminent problem that will have ripple effects over thousands of years its not adequately explained in this movie but spice is the most important resource in the universe and it only exists on arrakis control over the planet and the spice is incredibly influential over the universe going to war with the great houses will cost millions if not billions of lives but he can see futures with much greater loss of life if the harkonens maintain control of arrakis or if feyd rautha becomes the emperor or the harkonens reveal the emperors betrayal to the great houses or any other scenario,2024-03-09 01:25:50
i think he’s seeing thousands of years into the future but i don’t think he’s temporally confused he knows how far off events are supposed to take place i have to read the later books but i think he’s seeing the extinction of humanity in most timelines in the far future with a narrow path where humanity survives indefinitely but only if he takes a particular course of action right now,2024-03-07 13:50:44
"chani is supposed to be his love and partner but he doesn’t even attempt to explain or talk to her post water of life

why should he this isnt a normal person anymore hes forseen the future if he forsaw a future where talking to chani would help at this current time hed probably do it he tells his mother this when she questions it and he says shell see the reason in the future

x200b

they don’t have a single conversation before the final confrontation

he tells her in a wistful way that he will love her for as long as he breathes at that point he already realizes there is nothing he can say that will make it any better or she has a part to play in the coming future that she needs to perform with her current mindset

x200b

lots of people said dune pt1 had nothing happen in it

sure but lots of people also loved the movie the director takes a lot of time actually not conveying information but setting up shots of the world so it feels expansive its hard to do both well sometimes but i think it does a good job of showing and not telling editing the density of the books into a workable screen play to convey the overarching story without getting too in the weeds of inner thoughts and background story

it does so through concise meaningful dialog fever dreams and other devices",2024-03-13 19:42:57
" like in the movies its never explicitly mentioned that everyone uses swords because shields can deflect projectiles

isnt it explained in part 1 when gurney and paul are sparring",2024-03-09 01:35:47
"honest question looking for your perspective only 

 its never explicitly mentioned that everyone uses swords because shields can deflect projectiles 

is that something that takes you out of a movie  or does the scale of dune allow you to say i dont know what that means but i like it

im curious where your level of enjoyment falls in show vs tell",2024-03-15 14:46:23
i wonder how much more useful information we could have gotten with less slow motion shots ,2024-03-07 07:41:55
but both swords and projectiles do pierce the shields in the movies,2024-03-07 11:08:23
you mean how are films supposed to convey characters thoughts films have done that since the beginning of film even silent films,2024-03-10 08:18:38
cant think of anyone more capable of tackling rama,2024-03-04 07:04:45
what a time to be alive,2024-03-04 09:02:09
he also has cleopatra on his plate for sony and i can see him doing that first just to shake it up from scifi for a bit  i’m excited to see what kind of period piece denis can do i’m sure it will be amazing,2024-03-04 20:29:31
oh my  id love to see a rama movie from him,2024-04-03 17:26:50
i had the same thought its insane how good this looks relative to budget when compared to other movies that cost the same or more,2024-03-04 21:51:00
so in the books pauls sister is born and isnt talking to the mom from inside her belly,2024-03-02 20:10:52
"right but that means people with lazguns don’t shoot shields now given what we know about islamic jihadists post 1980 it could be argued that the fremen are more likely to partake in suicide bombing style attacks but dune was written 17 years before suicide bombing became a popular tactic by jihadists and i think it’s some level of problematic to assume that the fremen would adopt that style of fighting anyway it would be kind of reductive and stereotyping plus they aren’t really muslim their religion did half descend from it though and buddhism 

so turning on a shield means your opponent won’t use their lazgun cause they don’t want to commit suicide so i don’t see how this answers the question shields make worms berserk but i assumed they were safe on that rock",2024-03-10 11:31:16
"he who controls the spice controls the universe

paul controls all spice production and he made it clear he would be fine with nuking it alli in addition to controlling the most badass army in the galaxy in addition to literally being able to see the future they aint doing ",2024-03-08 16:29:02
except in the books paul is able to  tens of billions in like a decade which just seems insane,2024-03-06 16:19:51
guess they put those lazers away as soon as they leave atmosphere no need for any combat ,2024-03-04 14:44:35
if its  but works then its not ,2024-03-05 13:05:50
"until the advent of shipmounted artillery in the 16th century every naval battle that wasn’t won by ramming or fire was won in a similar fashion to the battle of the masts which i assume you’re referring to  by disabling and boarding enemy vessels with ship mounted marines

 this was still an effective strategy well into the 15th century as evidenced by the fact that four italian ships fought off hundreds of ottoman vessels by lashing themselves together while trying to run the turkish blockade during the siege of constantinople in 1453",2024-03-06 17:41:54
in the book or in the movie because in the book the great houses accept pauls ascendancy making the point moot at least initially and in the film the spacing guild didnt seem to have a presence at a time when they would otherwise very much want to be involved,2024-03-04 11:47:41
"so much of the dinner scene in the book relies on internal dialog to explain what is actually happening as its all subterfuge and double speak this would have been almost impossible to put onto screen and make it engaging 

close ups of peoples faces while they talk to themselves would have been so boring",2024-03-02 13:01:14
the dinner scene is the best scene in the book but you can never really show the politics of whats going on and all the layers of everything,2024-03-03 12:10:12
i was gutted they skipped it too but i dont know how you could do scenes like that that are 90 internal dialogue,2024-03-03 06:39:19
yes my favorite scene from the book i hope they filmed it to include in an directors cut or something,2024-03-02 18:05:51
"for the fremen it makes sense that they fight like that bc they have a heavy cultural focus on honor and individual prowess plus they rely heavily on ambushes in pitched battle it can be explained that they want to break up formations and play into their individual strength


the sardukar are similar i guess


for the atreides and harkonen it makes a bit less sense but we do get at least one scene of formation fighting in part one",2024-03-11 16:46:10
"we see some formation fighting in the movies but yeah  no metal shields

the thing to remember is that in the books we see very little actual combat battles are basically only mentioned in passing from my recollection there are pretty much no scenes describing the actual details of battles just who won and how usually past tense pauls duels or various assassination attempts are an exception

combat just seems to be a passing throught for frank herbert in a universe where some characters already know the outcomes beforehand its only describedmentioned in the bare minimum way to be able to tell the story the series is all about characters plots and internal schemes which is why its been thought to be close to impossible to adapt to the big screen

that being said theres probably a reasonably strong argument that could be made against metal shields being feasible projectile weapons are very strong against anything unshielded were also talking about a culture in which bloodlines and breeding have been huge for thousands of years and soldiers that are much more highly trained than anything on oldearth i think a fairly decent argument could be made that metal shields would be more of an encumbrance for soldiers that skilled and outfitted how they are id put a single sardaukar up against a hundred roman legionnaires with shields  easily from the combat we do see in the books its all incredibly fast and skilled

in the movies the typical soldiers are made to look like plebs just to obviously differentiate them from the really gifted fighters like duncan gurney paul jessica feyd etc but this isnt so in the books for example all the sardaukar and atreides soldiers are total badasses the atreides becomming so skilled is one of the main reasons that the emperor wants them wiped out pauls father had managed to train some atreides soldiers to be almost comparable to sardaukar  who were usually rated as being a match for 10 highly trained house soldiers when duncan kills as many of them as he does before dying its spoken of as a legendary combat feat for millenia afterwards

theres also weird stuff like the bene gesserit fighting style basically teleporting around and its left a bit ambiguous as to whether it just appears that way due to mental tricks or whether theyre actually doing it we get a glimpse of this during the 2nd movie at the very start where paul and jessica are hiding at the bottom of the cliff and the bodies are falling paul sprints to grab the sword and  the soldier who floated down when hes about to get shot jessica was suddenly 100 meters away behind the guy in the open and killing him with a rock there was no way that there was time for her to cover that distance and that felt like a nod to the weirding way  although it broke the rules around the distances that are usually possible

so yeah theres lots of weirdness in the dune series and denis villeneuve has to just scrape the top as to what will be acceptable to a typical audience i saw a clip of him saying the other day that hes not sure how to do anything after messiah as it goes way out there and i agree i dont think the audience that liked the movies from the first book are going to cope with movies made from books 3 and 4 ",2024-03-14 17:13:12
"not really i love the movies but to go hypercritical for a minute

they explained how the shields work in melee combat during the training scene in the first movie we later got fight scenes with shielded opponents who were stabbing through shields at seemingly full speed not enough effort was put into showcasing the slower penetrating stabs

that then caused some issues with pauls challenge during the jamis duel due to being too used to fighting shielded opponents it couldve been better explained and i feel like an uninitiated audience could just assume it was because paul had never killed and didnt want to  jamis jessica even makes this point instead of anything about shields

that was all fine  nothing blatant enough to be a huge deal

in the 2nd movie we have a melee attack on a harvester with a rocket that chani shoots exploding against a thopter shield but then during the opening paul created by baiting the thopter to shoot the shield has reactivated and yet the projectile is slowly forcing its way through ok a bit weird

after that we get a few scenes where they just lasgun a bunch of harvesters making it confusing that theyd ever deal with them differently if they can just do that but thats a bit of an aside from the shield issue

what probably bugged me the most and it was only a bit is that i dont think they adequately explained that shields attract worms or that lasgun vs shield  big boom they even cut the lasgunshield explosions from the book my friends were confused by how they were just shooting dudes with projectiles in the first fight scene

and lastly as someone else has mentioned  the first movie nearly ended when they were trying to lasgun the thopter duncan was piloting 

i can live with all of it but theres just some inconsistencies that would mean id have to go do a bunch of googling afterwards if i hasnt read the books",2024-03-03 20:09:47
"they did but there was still 2 years of pickup shots compared to like 1yr of initial filming but the part that was most impressive was how he convinced the studio itd basically cost the same to do all 3 at once  thats the part ive seen george lucas joke about

like everything the truth will be somewhere in the middle would any movie execs be naive enough to believe that no must jackson have been so convincing that they bought it anyway yes",2024-03-03 21:29:38
theyre prominent in messiah ive just reread it im pretty sure theyre in the first book too but its been a while since ive read it might just be at the end,2024-04-05 20:34:32
"end of the movie 

 all of the other big houses now have sent forces 
 all of the other big houses are refusing to recognize paul as the new emperor 

thats going to put the other houses and the space guild at risk given paul now singlehandedly controls the spice perfect time to introduce the need for spice in the universe when its threatened and the power that the space guild has",2024-03-01 20:43:57
right is everybody glossing over the fact that paul threatened to destroy the spice with nukes for some   reason and the landsraad called his bluff is he going to destroy the spice forever or was he actually bluffing in the movie,2024-03-01 16:16:04
agreed to me the guild reps being so out of their depth and thinking they had everything under control was extremely important,2024-03-02 20:29:25
dont think so was it mentioned in part 1 when paul and jessica meet up with kynes either way barely mentioned at most,2024-03-03 20:32:16
the core plot is an assassination attempt by the time messiah starts the fremen and paul firmly rule the universe already,2024-03-03 18:00:35
"i thought there was more than that where they explained why house atriedes has outsize influence because they have a big part in choam as well as the landsraad 

i may be misremembering though its been a grip since i read the books",2024-03-03 17:46:53
"quick question do you only watch films at the cinema the vast majority of people will watch dune part 2 in their living room on their tv by the simple fact that people will watch it years from now and it aint gonna stay in theatres for eternity

people still watch the lord of the rings and star wars films to this day all of them on tv outside some rare theatre releases

so for the majority of people theres no going to be any difference between a film originally resealed on imax and a tv show",2024-03-02 10:22:47
it cant but with a proper sound system and tvprojector it can come pretty  close,2024-03-02 07:26:43
you can see thufir hawat in the far right hes the mentat of leto atreides in dune part one,2024-03-03 23:32:21
i respect it if all goes right the theatrical cut should be the directors cut its only not if theres studio interference or something like that adding scenes for the sake of adding scenes does not a movie better make,2024-03-01 11:14:12
along with spielberg and nolan,2024-03-07 08:43:39
seems like people only respect creative vision up until they’re denied more content to consume,2024-03-12 06:43:20
honestly for being a psychopathic  killer dude was very honrable to his opponents even the atridies prisoner in the arena fight he showed mad respect for im pretty sure the bg leader even hinted as much that dude is a crazy  but is your bound for the most part in battle,2024-03-06 05:06:06
came here to see if anyone else noticed this i felt like his accent was in and out through parts of the movie,2024-03-03 00:49:39
you could make an argument that the characters drive for power resulted in him imitating the one who is in charge think andy personality mirroring michael in the office lol,2024-03-18 21:43:40
i saw something recently about stellan praising butler for how he mimiced his voice,2024-03-01 22:11:50
i was surprised at how good his gollum impression was in his snl opening monologue so i’m inclined to think he’s just phenomenally talented with voices,2024-03-02 00:56:26
yeah at times his voice was so good that i wondered if skars adrd it for austin,2024-03-02 01:31:23
he’s supposed to be attractive seductive villainous and somewhat of a sociopath i didn’t get any of these vibes from him as the character him being albino and bald was really distracting as was the inked black teeth he seemed rather tame and silly and not fully serious and didn’t seem to be very ‘evil’ or cutthroat i think part of the problem is that he didn’t actually have much screen time either i dont know that i think the idea to not have him present at all in movie one and then just randomly have him show up in movie two helped i understand that not everyone felt this way but he just really didn’t do it for me felt like a mid character at best,2024-03-16 01:34:11
confidently incorrect,2024-03-01 22:48:11
lol that’s funny it’s reverse for us cause i enjoyed timothee’s performance the most well zendaya also when butler first takes the screen and he “licks” his knife… super cringe and predictable seen that coming from a mile away i also didn’t buy his character being able to punk bautista just ,2024-03-01 07:52:33
also they nailed the shadow of the sphere as it moved across the landscape  in reflection so  cool looking,2024-03-01 11:33:02
my favourite visual sequence was the one where glossu rabans men are getting picked off one by one by the fremen fighters who are just weaving in and out of the dark,2024-03-02 05:22:45
and they went for the extra effort to render separate reflection for each panel of the ship instead of going easy by doing one simple sphere with one reflection,2024-03-01 16:40:54
this i think is mine too one of the coolest things ive ever seen on screen the only problem is i had that thought probably 40 times in this film,2024-03-01 21:52:03
that was so incredibly well done i fully believed i was watching a physical ship actually reflecting the planet,2024-03-01 22:04:11
pretty much every scene has a frame that could be considered the shot the entire movie is insane looking,2024-03-02 13:26:28
for me its paul running on top of the sand dune as the grandfather worm breaks the dune from the middle and we get that overhead shot what an incredible visualisation to tell us how giant that thing was,2024-03-03 10:08:06
oh  i caught that too,2024-03-01 11:15:51
probably an obvious comparison but really strong lawrence of arabia vibes across the whole thing,2024-03-01 20:47:53
that was the best absolutely stunning,2024-03-01 17:56:36
oh that was so good the reflection of the terrain the shadow of the ship in the reflection so  cool,2024-03-02 19:40:31
same that just looked like a classic book cover or something,2024-03-03 06:06:00
for me its the first time seeing something i know isnt real but believing what my eyes saw as real it was a cinematic moment i wont forget,2024-03-04 02:20:32
i audibly gasped in the cinema when i saw that,2024-03-08 15:55:47
this was supreme,2024-03-02 12:14:32
oh man so many shots that haven’t my brain not even once,2024-03-04 04:37:42
atreides genes i dont think lady jessica has those unless she and leto were on some sweet home alabama time,2024-03-09 22:37:10
i think it’s more a matter of the harkonnen’s being the ruling noble family on geidi prime but geidi prime’s inhabitants themselves all have “microevolved” to be the baldheaded bastards they are now,2024-03-03 07:31:06
there isn’t really a science reason i can think of that would explain how it is portrayed but it is a cool visual effect i suppose if the sun only emitted down to around 800 nm or so our eyes would have some sensitivity but everything would look deep red but even that doesn’t really explain it,2024-03-01 21:29:56
,2024-03-04 10:00:41
i have no idea about the plot going forward so i’m going to assume the future vision where paul’s sister is on a shore is the result of paul importing a  ton of water to arrakis to drown them shaihulud to get more blue juice,2024-03-05 17:25:01
geidi primegammuzon,2024-03-10 06:56:32
he even said that himself in the film,2024-03-07 22:50:51

they do it that way cause computers are illegal but it ends up horribly mutating them",2024-03-10 04:26:27
she talks to the fetus telepathically most of the time she didn’t say a word,2024-03-09 23:58:31
watch the movie again when she is talking about converting the weak its focused on her face and shes not speaking out loud lol,2024-03-10 08:04:59
"but the atreides were not all good people

its hyper cynical they use the trappings of honor and concern for subjects to build loyalty to make better soldiers and workers without having to invest in tools of oppression and to gain soft power in a planned analytical way weighing the cost of being kind with the gains theyre not as bad as the harkonnens but not selfless saints its tools for power and calculated for the resources they have",2024-03-04 08:35:34
we can definitely make connections to middle east conflicts and white savior but thats not the vibe the director is going for the director pointed out that one of the key messages from the movies is a caution against overly charismatic leaders and false prophets which is very relevant today also theres no evidence the atreides mistreated the fremen recall that leto ii wanted to create an alliance with the fremen in one scene stilgar spits on his desk which is a positive sign as water is precious in fremen culture,2024-03-04 01:02:11
"these allegories and political themes are all present but the narrative is still largely directed by the foundation or grounded in revenge the entire story is set in motion because of the emperors actions none of this happens if the emperor does not give the atreides control of arrakis thus sending them to their deaths paving the way for pauls vengeful crusade 

one of the only reasons it works and further supports the revenge theme is because the bene genesserit have planted their seeds of indoctrination on every inhabited planet in the universe if one of their missionaria were ever in trouble they would use their propaganda as an out thats exactly what lady jessica does on arrakis with paul adopting the role of lisan al gaib 

in theory mankinds future could have been set in stone and paul atreides couldve been anyone else",2024-03-03 22:47:44
you realize dune was written in 1965 right i could see an allegory to colonization of the americas for sure but usmiddle east that’s just you applying your own bias,2024-03-05 04:11:26
thats because he cant get the elvis accent out yet and he filmed it right after elvis iirc he had to hire a coach to remove the accent,2024-03-01 21:58:02
that’s because the guy irl he’s playing acted like a hammy cowboy,2024-03-02 11:56:00
he regularly fights drugged out people with a shield on him wheres the  honor in that,2024-03-01 05:34:44
i think he knocked it out of the park super fun villain  every other villain is a political schemer and then you have this guy who is just a crazy person,2024-03-02 22:08:13
very different than the book character in that regard,2024-03-01 07:07:45
least evil harkonen for sure,2024-03-02 09:10:28
tbh bill is 33 but looked young in barbarian,2024-03-01 06:33:00
"my friend asked who the actor was after the movie and i instinctively said bill

i am not content he wasn’t in the movie,2024-03-02 18:25:58
"he has that weird speaking style in the books

i hmm dont know hmm hmm what you hmm mean",2024-03-02 21:22:49
ikr he would have made a perfect count fenring,2024-03-03 03:45:58
his name was mentioned in the the director would like to thank section of the end credits,2024-04-09 21:56:50
it may just be my memory since the fenrings are such minor characters overall but i dont remember lady fenring having powers or anything  for her to secure the bloodline to me implies that shes the quasikwisatz in the movie like count fenring is in the book,2024-03-05 02:14:28
yes i thought the same thing but then he sort of pauses and watches his uncle feebly try to crawl to the throne and seems to be like “nah that would be too easy”,2024-03-01 07:44:28
dare i say he looked legit turned on ,2024-03-17 11:55:00
oh my bad read that wrong,2024-03-01 14:30:11

"theres infinite beautiful details in this story another is the harkonnens raging at the fremen being rats and rabban telling his soldiers to exterminate the filthy rats

then you learn that the name paul takes is muadib the sand rat",2024-03-06 03:20:00
as someone who was not raised religious what so ever i’m having a hard time understanding still  ,2024-03-12 04:38:22
you would too if someone had that kind of blackmail and was about to blurt out your even more embarrassing dream next,2024-03-14 06:49:56
clearly tapping minds at that point he just previously read the other dudes grandmas eye injury like a book,2024-03-06 07:04:36
youre correct not sure what the previous person is talking about,2024-03-06 06:50:53
paul can see past and present like a clairvoyant,2024-03-13 04:14:17
and without posting spoilers the path forward was literally all humanity on the line every living human,2024-03-14 06:53:26
hes colonizing her planet like he said he wouldnt do and is now leading millions of her people to their death being  about is to be expected,2024-03-01 05:55:14
because its clearly a different interpretation of chani dv made her more interesting than book chani not everything needs to be 11 alia was literally a fetus in the film,2024-03-01 21:23:27
the guy just started a holy war that’s going to lead to millions of her people dying slightly harsh to call her a brat,2024-03-02 01:21:04
she heard paul telling gurney hes not a prophet shell be with him as long as he stays who he is etc suddenly he takes the water of life and fully embraced everything he previously denied plus in the movies her father isnt an offworlder so shes less accepting of the lisan al gain mythos,2024-03-01 07:18:35
like a brat shes protesting an extremist religious jihad sounds pretty courageous to me but i guess you think that makes her a brat lol,2024-03-04 00:30:32
i think you missed the point,2024-03-03 01:23:57
what should her reaction have been,2024-03-04 19:00:34
shes probably already preggers with twins,2024-03-04 08:44:28
"she really didnt though she was resisting paul until she felt he genuinely did not want power and wanted to be a part of and fight for the fremen and she started to doubt him again the second he reconnected with halleck and found out about the nukes and she saw that he was starting to waver 

by then she already loved him and he still showed resistance to being the chosen one she probably hoped that he would stay true to his original promise maybe even hoped she might be able keep him grounded but that fell apart",2024-03-05 14:49:28
the fremen have been oppressed for generations paul isn’t colonising them he’s leading them to greatness that’s clear not only in the book but in the movie they’re freeing themselves from the shackles of their masters and fighting back with paul’s guidance and abilities the books and movies make it clear that paul considers himself fremen they are his people,2024-03-01 08:40:58
he assumed those bad things wont happen  until he heard a voice saying that he sees only fragments then consulted with jamiss presence in his head  which convinced him to go drink the blue water,2024-03-10 15:51:29
dude hes not ,2024-03-07 13:43:12
categorizing people by their generation is so  indeed,2024-03-31 10:00:22

"i think the difference is that those properties are homages to the text and based on beloved stories i agree they arent good the hobbit was bloated and i fell asleep in the premiere rings of power was also mediocre but to be fair you can tell that the people who made it care about the story

but star wars on the other hand was almost disrespectful to the original after they decanonized all of sacred texts that the og fans loved they proceeded to make more and more tv shows and films that just fell flat not just one but dozens people can tolerate a certain amount of commercialization but they went overboard to the point that it became distasteful",2024-03-09 16:12:56
nah,2024-03-07 20:41:43
"neither of those spat in the face of lotr they just weren’t that good

especially the butt scene,2024-03-14 06:54:32
well im gonna enjoy furiosa no matter what the critics say because of the visuals just like fury road it is meant to be seen on the big screen and ill be there for it,2024-03-03 17:03:27
"that’s what people said about fury road before its release

it’ll be good maybe even great but it’ll definitely be good",2024-03-02 22:53:16
the graphics look so bad,2024-03-18 00:42:32
"same for me


shes a great actress but she looks like a cross between a porcelain doll and a praying mantis and i just cant ",2024-03-02 12:32:52

"i have seen a lot of people cal him the “comic relieve” of the film and he is… but i feel like a lot of people will miss the point of his character and that’s kinda sad

if i see people calling paul a hero i’m gonna lose it",2024-03-04 19:05:09
the book dune messiah if i remember right actively comments on pauls sadness towards stilgars transformation from fiercely independent leader to fanatic follower really impressive performance by javier bardem and direction by villeneuve,2024-03-06 13:12:50
doesn’t stilgar also become annoyed at paul because he’s aware on some level because he thinks paul doesn’t believe the prophecy or just because he thinks paul has gotten soft,2024-03-08 23:52:30
"paul “thanks for setting up the fanaticism mom i got this from here” 

jessica “hold on wait a se“

paul “come my fremen follow me to paradise the stars and beyond”",2024-03-12 23:57:13
and yet he was inspired to be an actor by a superhero movie,2024-03-03 18:20:57
do you exaggerate it like teeee or thayyyy,2024-03-05 11:19:22
yes i saw it today the parallel was fascinating,2024-03-11 03:18:45
"bring them paradise

pure horror",2024-03-02 03:09:55
this scene alone tells me villeneuve fully understands the message at the very core of herbert’s books while the fanaticism from the fremen and how paul commanded the room was awe inspiring it was terrifying at the same time it shows how people can get swept up in the messiah and the dangers that poses,2024-03-02 06:39:50
same the awe i felt made me tear up the best scene in the movie indeed,2024-03-01 12:53:13
agreed i was constantly at the edge of my seat this terrifies me more than an actual horror movie well maybe some notable horror movies still scares me more lol,2024-03-01 16:06:49
yeah but he did actually see into the future and the past to these people that would seem godlike  in reality it sort of is godlike,2024-03-03 03:42:11
and were told from the start it was all planted by witches generations ago,2024-03-03 05:44:01
it got more and more depressing as the movie went on and nothing changed about his delivery that was one of my favorite parts and i dont think ive seen that in anything else incredibly impressive,2024-03-01 08:24:01
ah yes the name of my  tape,2024-03-01 15:11:11
one of the key differences between the two is timing,2024-03-01 15:37:24
"can you expand i don’t fully understand what the tragedy of the freman dream is in this context

not a book reader please no spoilers for dune part 3",2024-03-07 03:33:20
"  humanity would have gone extinct within the next several thousand years 

from destroying each other would they nuke entire galaxy",2024-03-03 18:26:49
i always thought the parallels are very balatant arrakis looks like the middle east or rather what americans think the middle east looks like spice could be oil paul was essentially helping the fremen do terrorist strikes on the harkonnens in the movie he even tells josh brolin “fear is all we have” etc,2024-03-05 19:11:54
what did the atreides ever do for the fremen,2024-03-03 17:00:49
nope nor do i plan on it it would expose oneself as incredibly naive to ask a serious director if he decided to break out of his serious narrative to reference life of brian listen to any interview with villeneuve for more information jesus how old are you guys that youd think this if you guys were fans of this  at all you could find out what his actual influences on the film were examples lawrence of arabia the last temptation of christ akira persona beep beep,2024-03-05 15:42:58
he wasn’t the butt of silly jokes though there’s a difference between a character having a sense of humor and the character being made out to be the joke in the scene in question stilgar is not intending to be funny,2024-03-01 21:37:00
why the oh nos,2024-03-01 17:15:31
your reaction is valid and its one of the things that herbert was trying to express just because this leader is charismatic and deserves it doesnt mean he is going to be benevolent,2024-03-03 14:10:19
something that i feel gets glossed over even in the book was paul having received mentat training too,2024-03-03 01:55:50
"im curious if the books version is actually better in that regard because fundamentally the fremen beliefs arent based in rationality as someone who didnt read the book i thought the way paul convinced them was nearperfect this is a deeply spiritual superstitious people whove been awaiting their savior for centuries then in a time of great strife and tragedy an outsider who fits the prophecy even if the prophecy is vague comes and announces himself 

these people are already emotionally charged in a way that lends itself to an almost dreamlike stupor or a trance caused by their religious belief so when paul performs seeming miracles or maybe actual miracles by seeing deeply into the minds of some of the fremen they simply bowed because they believed that he was who he said he was

i dont think using logic to convince the fremen would in my opinion be better writing i think the scene using very clearly emotional arguments for a deeply troubled people is analogous to many real life religious and political figures and situations",2024-03-05 17:46:20
if you have the time any way you can summarize how he did it in the book so those of us who haven’t read the book can understand it better thanks,2024-03-04 23:12:21
 plus denis hates dialogue thus allllll the great scenes that were excluded,2024-03-02 05:32:47
"i love this movie a lot but its making me laugh how much of its little shortcomings show me how much better lawrence of arabia was at portraying that very same dangerous messiah character its the age we live in sadly studios are worried about movies being too long worried about audiences wanting action over nuance villenueve probably managed the best he could under the circumstances

edit downvotes really which part do you not agree with talk with words",2024-03-03 09:54:39
"usul is his secret name exclusive to the sietch he was from so even fremen from outside sietch tabr were not supposed to know or hear that name

muaddib is his actual public fremen name although they let him use paul muaddib since he is a somewhat unique case

cool to see how one extremely brilliant guy in an extremely niche field set himself up for life  the conlang work in this movie was extraordinary i thought it was even better than game of thrones absolutely every actor sounded so natural which game of throneshouse of the dragon struggle with at times,2024-03-11 01:14:39

cue,2024-03-04 05:39:53
"paul says he sees a holy war he doesnt want in the future he doesnt want to lead the fremen he wanted to join them 
his mother jessica kinda acts like macbeths wife especially in part 2 with spreading his legitimacy as a prophet despite him not wanting too he married for political motives and relegated channi to mistress 

while paul leads a lot of this after drinking the water of life he never wanted to get to that point so id argue that paul didnt want any of this really and even then he didnt want to be duke he didnt want to go to arrakkis 

so while he succeeded in what everyone else wanted i dont think paul really got anything he wanted his dad is dead his mom became his own false prophet he presumably wont be able to live solely with channi he doesnt get to go back to calladan and put this all behind him 

its also somewhat game of thrones esque where paul is constantly putting aside his personal desires for the social and cultural demands of the society he lives in


edit originally wrote hamlets wife when i meant macbeths",2024-03-07 13:10:03
yes but they did so by ridding humanity of its addiction to heroes and strongmen hence people arent missing the point at all and you might be,2024-03-03 23:15:40
honestly everything explaining why that wasnt shown or mentionedlike the jihad is a spoiler dune messiah makes it abundantly clear that he is in fact the baddie and its because hes the messiah,2024-03-07 03:48:45

"and quite frankly i hope he sticks to that 

the specific thing that denis does well is put together a slower paced story crafted in a way that is very satisfying to the patient viewer hes been my favorite director since arrival if you want marvel pacing then youre out of luck here 

he and deakins get the perfect shots and the editing is done carefully to achieve the effect he desires and you get perfection on the screen now are his stories always tight and exciting no but the experience of watching the movie is always perfect",2024-03-09 16:20:17
if the studio wants to release an extended cut does he have any say in the matter,2024-03-11 14:52:00
sucks i was just hoping for an extended version,2024-03-15 03:33:36
"honestly i feel the opposite

 his recent comments make me think he won’t ever release deleted scenes nobody should be forced to make a longer cut if they don’t want to do so but hiding an hour of deleted scenes fans would love to seeand lose nothing is a mentality i just can’t get behind 

i’d love to see the actors putting in the hard work even if it didn’t make the cut",2024-03-08 07:09:52
"he needs to release an extended cut anyway

the worms people demand it",2024-03-04 11:00:02
"i mean all of those things were pretty explicitly laid out in the first movie even in the absence of the dinner scene

as to why he left out so much stuff from the book the movies together are already 5 hours long while important for world building they are much less essential to convey the message and themes of the book hence why they were in my opinion expertly and successfully left out",2024-03-04 00:21:23
just print off a copy of the glossary with peoples tickets,2024-03-04 04:50:25
i think that despite their brief presence in the book both are extremely important and the movie is worse for their omission,2024-03-02 18:40:22
tbf to denis you dont want to have a scenario where there could be a chance where the original and arguably best cut of a movie would be lost to time due to the director insisting it so cough star wars and spiderverse cough,2024-03-02 06:22:08

how loud is dolby my wife thinks imax is too loud i might have to watch it with her in a regular theater,2024-03-04 22:27:35
"im not saying its not written like that in the books but that last argument actually makes no sense

one cant just make someone  themselves by being very well spoken in seconds in just a few words too or even in just one word in a tense or hostile environment andor with loud noises around 
this is not something humans can do 

sure you could talk someone into doing a lot of things but there are some limits 

the comparison doesnt work because its not as if say a hundred people would jump and clap two times after just glimpsing rembrandts painting 

it could work as just being a subtle coercion or sth if it only was subtle coercion using whats already there power of suggestion and generally kind of mix of perceptiveness and a long type of game
but if in the books its also possible to have an aggressive enemy aware of possible consequences of failure to  you  themselves instead by saying for example  yourself or sth its not just being master of rhetoric",2024-03-02 22:49:59
like a lot of things in the book you can basically interpret this as human evolution over thousands of years following the butlerian jihad where you have human supercomputers so this is basically the mind manipulation equivalent,2024-03-03 08:19:45
ah interesting,2024-03-23 15:37:00

women children and old people hitch rides in the book its a sub status which is why paul had to ride one they use the same hooks to hitch a ride after the worm has been hookedi dont think getting her on the worm was ever discussed in the books at this time paul already had a first child with cheni and alia is 2,2024-03-03 06:42:29
yeah but then you dont want the entire film to be full of exposition i suppose its easier to just leave it to imagination or a trust that lore wise there is a way they dismount but its not all that important,2024-03-06 23:54:36

i also didn’t see it as succumbing to fanaticism to me it was the escalation of direct conflict via the destruction of sietch that forced him south and he reluctantly accepted it was the only move after resisting for so long fearing what would happen once he did,2024-03-01 21:20:56
"i don’t know if he succumbs to it… he harnesses it after taking the poison and “opening his mind” he kind of loses sight of individual humans and sees the imperium’s past and future as a machine with humans acting the knobs and levers which operate that machine

this includes the prophecy it’s a means to an end for him i think he certainly has no reverence for the bene gesserit or for the fremen traditions as we see him act remarkably callously towards both of them postpoison drinking",2024-03-03 13:09:32
is that the same as alia,2024-03-03 09:09:56

i liked this version of chani with more agency and her own voice and apprehension about what paul was doing and what it meant for her peoples dream i didnt like that it meant seemingly sacrificing the relationship at the end unless they reconcile in part 3,2024-03-01 22:28:40
that was my thought as well yeah no way the exact ending of the book is happening in this movie,2024-03-01 05:18:58
and that’s a major problem with the adaptation for anybody that hasn’t read the last line of the book abandoning this completely is such a weird choice and in my opinion shows disdain for the source material,2024-03-01 16:21:37
i remember seeing this line in one of the trailers but it wasnt in the movie unfortunately,2024-03-01 07:20:59

in the first film there’s even a scene where he tells her “i should have married you”",2024-03-01 06:09:46

"my only issue is the youre a foreigner lines when she herself is technically not pure fremen

 i dont get why the movie decided to focus on her character more and completely ignore that her mom was liet kynes who is a 100 converted offworlder  

is that even the case now i always assumed the existence of their relationship was important but they seemed to swap chanis dreams of a green dune for stilgars",2024-03-12 15:09:17
before seeing this movie i didnt tell my wife how the book ended just that it ends somewhat abruptly paul kills feyd on the secondtolast page then is giving orders on the last page and i wonder if the movie would have a bit more closure i had to tell her afterwards that chani prepping to mount a worm wasnt the abrupt ending i talked about lol,2024-03-18 14:56:48
they allude to this in some of the graphics of the trip but its better explained in the books  the film is more show less tell but i can totally see how it leaves a nonbook reader scratching their head,2024-03-05 16:36:52
he doesnt have to micromanage when he can just give people a page of what to say ahead of time threatening to expose whoever if they dont do as he says again it could be anything as he has become basically omnipotent,2024-03-03 20:29:30

"i think you could do messiah and children in one movie by compressing things a bit

maybe you could but not ending with paul walking out into the desert blind seems like it would be a huge miss",2024-03-03 21:27:58
i think they could do a reimagined story which the ending seems to suggest,2024-03-03 01:14:33
bro…you ain’t ready for what is to come,2024-03-01 04:33:28
youre in for a ride lol,2024-03-01 08:08:31
he doesnt know,2024-03-01 13:20:21
which makes zero sense why would an elite unit bred and raised for battle be so heavily outmatched by sand people who have to devote their lives to surviving in the desert id understand sardaukar being at disadvantage when faced with fremens guerrilla tactics but in open combat that comes down to pure martial arts skill  and then the prospect of the fremen just boarding the emperors ships and going on their merry way to conquer the galaxy is just ridiculous i dont care if your leader can see the future theres no possible future where a near uninhabitable planet with no discernible military industrial complex or even agriculture which would severely limit the number of people who could actually populate it would pose a genuine threat to a galaxy full of factions with centuries of experience fighting each other itd make a scenario where the taliban went on to conquer the earth with the leftover us equipment after the americans left afghanistan seem downright realistic in comparison,2024-03-01 11:29:29
but weren’t the houses also mad at  lost trust in the emperor for plotting against the atreides,2024-03-04 15:32:51
there are like 5 major female characters in the first 2 dune books and all of their cast are all known except for alia process of elimination made it pretty obvious even if the age and timeline would be different than the books,2024-03-01 09:12:29
"shes the same age as chalamet but is going to play his teenage sister its a bad casting


if the studio wants to do children after dv finishes messiah and dips sure she could work but i hope dv would cast someone else for the third movie",2024-03-02 05:09:45
surprised me too but then florence was so beautiful and perfectly irulan and nailed it anyway what a film,2024-03-01 09:07:49
anya is a great actor but shes so other worldly i think she suits the alia role better  florence has a grounded presence that would make her good for the politicking irulan gets up to,2024-03-01 23:38:12
 of been,2024-03-01 11:09:04
messiah is definitely happening this ones having a great debut,2024-03-01 06:38:56
yup the decision to not have alia be born required them compressing the entire film into 89 months which is a bummer i think she could have at least given birth to alia without it being too weird,2024-03-01 16:36:11
something had to be done with alia i agree they couldnt have a 2 year old running around being super serious murdering people im not sure if what they did was the best choice but it didnt really impact my enjoyment of the movie so i guess its fine her moniker st alia of the knife is gonna make a lot less since in messiah though,2024-03-01 21:01:16
"i think its a perfectly fine criticism within the context of the narrative the fremen are highly distrusting the northern ones more so because theyre less religious and have had to deal with offworld stewardship more often and in every culture shown in the series thus far from harkonnen to atreides its hard to rise quickly without the help of birthright much less as a foreigner 

it being a story with fantastical elements doesnt change that otherwise idk may as well just say everything is excusable because lol blue magic water",2024-03-01 11:50:39
yes im hoping theyll be in the third movie,2024-03-01 14:28:44
what do you mean the next part of the story is 12 years in the future shes supposed to be a young adult in messiah should work just fine,2024-03-04 01:37:14
nope i go out enough to see plenty of movies never heard people boo certainly don’t believe people boo’d during dune part 2 appreciate the concern though you might wanna try a better story that’s more believable,2024-03-01 19:10:44
at least i’m not full of  bud because i’m 100 sure most of your theatre did not read the book nor did they watch the 1984 lynch version i’m willing to bet more than half we’re not even aware of the barons original death “my theatre literally booed” ,2024-03-02 00:32:56

i definitely agree about the sardaukar being a bit nerfed in these movies theyre meant to be these super elite soldiers who go through so much torture and training to be basically unstoppable only to be beaten by these dessert rats who have their own training just by being in the harsh desert conditions,2024-03-01 16:18:39
the war is over arguably when paul is conceived,2024-03-02 12:36:50
"the end of the book itself is pretty abrupt feyd dies on the secondtolast page then the last page is paul giving orders

my wife hasnt read it going into the theater i told her that the book ends abruptly and i wonder how the movie will handle it

i had to tell her afterwards that chani prepping to mount a worm was not the abrupt ending i mentioned lol",2024-03-18 21:55:27

agreed all around,2024-03-11 15:10:38
that was my problem i’m the book he makes it very clear that he loves chani but needs to marry irulan for political reasons chani becomes his concubine like jessica was leto’s but if it was changed in order to provide opposition to paul’s destiny then i’ll allow it,2024-03-27 05:13:42
he and chani grow closer through their collective trauma while at the same time it further spurs his desire for galactic jihad it just added more fuel to the fire,2024-03-02 05:43:07

"  who holds the film rights for hyperion

there was some nonsense with bradley cooper for a long time being involved in a film version that probably isnt up to date i think its grant king films gk films and warner bros in some weird agreement that currently hold the rights for all hyperion adaptations

i agree atj will age as well by the time they film but makeup her down to late teensearly 20s add some stress induced grey streaks to paul  kinda ignore mentioning exact ages which they already did and nobody will care,2024-03-01 07:03:28
"yeah i would probably have to try acid to see his take
on  emperor lol

"also paul is supposed to be like 15 or something and timothy is nearing 30 they can just put a little less make up on him or something to make him look like an older man

sandworms dying would destroy the supply of spice though wouldnt it,2024-03-02 06:03:17
i think it was necessary to have her be his voice of reason when the movie cant really show his internal conflict having her say out loud the kind of stuff he was thinking in the book means we can see he sees this glorious purpose and jihad as a terrifying concept that he cant escape from,2024-03-01 22:52:29

"yeah so obviously hawat was pretty  about house atreides being torn down and getting imprisoned by the harks  baron thought he could control him by doing some wishcom version of the 1984 torture sections then pretend to be his friend so  start working for him instead

obviously hawat is extremely intelligent and sees right through this pretends to agree to work with the baron but then immediately tries to secretly dismantle harks from the inside doing mentat things  theres a 2 year time just in the book and when we get back to hawat hes been doing his best to mess with the harks in secret one strategy was to have the soldier not be drugged and disguise it as a mistake by the battle master so the baron would  him off the hope was that the soldier would have a better chance to surprise and  feyd severing one of the hark lines of blood rights to the throne

kind of makes the baron look like even more of a dufus to trust so much into the sworn loyal mentat of his slain house enemy so im not completely upset it got axed besides the soldier but would be nice to see his performance at least",2024-03-07 07:12:34
i maintain it actually worked out if the atreides had a sonic weapon that could defeat shields it makes even more sense that the emperor tried to wipe them out,2024-03-02 03:31:36

yeah villeneuve really succeeded in weirding me the  out when the intergalactic jihad started towards the end because i suddenly realised how i got enthralled with the the pull of martyrdom at first paul was hesitant to lead because he didnt want to see all those billions people die at last muaddib sees a path to lead and billions of people will die its kinda interesting that both jessica and paul really change fundamentally after having sipped from the water of life they really shed part of their humanity at that moment,2024-03-01 18:55:55

"no much of the dialogue has been rewritten to fit 21st century sensibilities for what today’s audiences feel goodnatural dialogue is

and that’s a very 21st century  line no way a white dude in the 1960s would write that line in such a fashion

the overall spirit and themes and most of the plot remains intact though but one of the big changes was making chani feel more equal to him in the relationship before he turns to emperor leading a holy war chani was basically a donothing cheerleader for paul in the book whereas in the film she challenges him every step of the way and is a far more 3dimensional character as a result with her own beliefs and agency",2024-03-18 07:33:20
"path to victory guys

so why did he become power hungry i know drinking the water of life gave him uber precognition basically path to victory but did gaining that power make him him power hungry by showing him what he could attain,2024-03-02 14:55:37
so basically the only path that results in him getting revenge on the harkonnens is also the path where he commits to the messiah role so hes just playing the part he needs to play and cant stop playing it now or else  derail off the chosen path which would presumably lead to him and everyone he loves dying,2024-03-02 14:53:25
if i remember in the book paul converts the poison i think everyone ends up drinking the water of life afterwards too since paul makes it safe that’s when everyone is like holy  he really is the lisan al gaib,2024-03-01 19:36:02

 chani was more on board with everything in the books and understood what paul was doing at the end

 they didn’t really go into the worms and how they create the spice not that big of an issue
 no hawat
 feydrautha gladiator fight he didn’t know about the atreides soldier not being drugged and there was nothing about a secret word
 jamis’s wife wasn’t in the movie
 paul and chani don’t have a child in the movie no time jump at least not a 2 year one
 gurney never believed lady jessica was the traitor
 no guild

of course that’s off the top of my mind i’m sure there were quite a few",2024-03-01 05:57:18
i am happy with most of the plot changes the main thing i think i’m missing from the book is the really trippy spicevision scenes there’s a big opportunity there for some weird  and denis kept it pretty grounded relatively speaking still and all around fantastic film and someone who hasn’t read the book wouldn’t feel anything missing,2024-03-01 03:48:42
funnily enough i actually preferred it to the book yeah yeah burn the heretic questioning the master that is herbert but still in this one we see the good bits frank always just glossed over those,2024-03-01 04:02:58

he also congratulated his brother for defending the family honor after he had paraded a woman  down the street and then cut out her tongue for saying columbus was lowborn

yeah im fine with the inclusion of her talking to him but we never actually see paul during the rest of the test not showing that is also fine but the edit made it seem like it was missing not gonna use the word sloppy but it was a bit jarring,2024-03-01 14:37:55
"in the movie it obviously kills people in the books is pretty explicit that paul considers this act to be in accordance with the great convention because the atomics are not used against humans but rather against a natural feature of the desert frank herbert is also well known for being very sparse on the details when it comes to action scenes so the description in the book is very short i think this is a nice reflection of there not being any witnesses left anyway if there were people there the great houses didn’t see it and it’s paul’s word against nothing 

so we aren’t told if anyone specifically died directly from the atomics we can assume maybe some people were there or maybe no one is on the wall at all since the shield wall is basically just a small mountain formation and there’s no reason for people to be out and about out there it’s not like people go hiking on arrakis for fun

either way it’s a political move and that’s the justification for it along with the fact that the other houses don’t have the power to move against him anyway even if he did use it directly on people",2024-03-22 22:52:02

"so keep in mind the bene gesserit knew jessicas son could turn into this thats why they wanted her to only give leto daughters they have a pretty good idea of which children will be what based on their own planning 

paul fitting into their propaganda so perfectly is exactly why they never wanted him to exist",2024-03-02 21:07:11
"paul’s motivation was always to avenge his father once he accomplished that his other motivation was to provide the fremen the green paradise they desire  

his paralysis from doing that was due to his fuzzy visions of what would be the costs and what would be the likeliness of success also they establish in the first movie that paul has a problem assuming responsibility he doesn’t really want his father’s throne doesn’t want to lead the fremen doesn’t want to be the kh even though circumstances keep forcing his hand 

in the book they do a better job because paul and chani have a child that ends up getting murdered by the harkonnanemperor so that becomes the catalyst for his change they didn’t choose that route in the movie because they had to speed the timeline up

edit also the prophecy was a lie the bene gesserit generated a messiah story for every planet as a way to insure safe passage for any of their sect in case one gets stranded or imprisoned paul was just fortunate that he was also part of the centuries long breeding program to create ‘the one’ among the sisters",2024-03-02 21:08:13

funnily enough forums that don’t use karma like tv are 10x better for actual discourse than reddit which is interesting considering it’s 4chan sure i might be called a  slur but there are way more contrasting and interesting perspectives there i just think getting rid of imaginary points would do wonders for this site and actual discussion of topics rather than the 50th karma farm low effort “dae think villenueve is a good director” bot post",2024-03-02 01:21:06

"in the first movie they say the line there are no satellites over arrakis the atreides will die in the dark

the reason for this is not explained in the movie but it is actually because the fremen are bribing the spacing guild briefly name dropped in part 1 so that their settlements in the south can remain hidden this works because the spacing guild has a monopoly on space travel and are hopelessly dependent on spice",2024-03-18 10:46:04

yeah imdb became a joke around 2003 but its getting worse every year if dune is really 16 right now thats ridiculous,2024-03-03 05:22:09
"youre welcome  and thank you for the kind words of appreciation 

and yes dune definitely has more thematic depth  a relatively complex layered plot especially in part two despite its cinematic language being that of a blockbuster the only way it could realistically get the budget it requires and then profit enough for the next film to get made a lesson poor denis had learned the hardway when the excellent but very slowpaced blade runner 2049 had bombed even dune part one had received some flak for putting some viewers to sleep

most of how thoughtprovoking youre finding the film can be traced to the book except for the interesting ways in which villeneuve has drastically changed  thereby improved imo chanis character but villeneuve has added plenty of his own inventiveness into how he each part of the story has been visualised  put onscreen  harkonnen soldiers scaling the mountain using their antigravity gear fetus alia geidi prime feyd himself etc i thoroughly enjoyed both books  films alike partly for the same strengths  but partly for different ones as well and am glad to hear that youre doing so as well cheers then",2024-03-21 23:49:59
"a classic heros tale is someone who starts out selfish but realises a greater purpose throughout their arc

and yet if the selfish actions of the beginning cross a certain threshold of horribleness and then  for whatever reason  the person ends up doing  causing a horrible end result which wouldnt have happened at all if it wasnt for his initial selfishness the description of a tragic antihero fits way better than hero the latter being usually associated in peoples minds with a force thats more good and not this dark

ive read several recaps

well clearly youre not adequately recalling multiple key dialogues so best not pass judgement this freely based on insufficient data

what i think is missing is your evidence from the film that the bg planted this prophecy in the minds of the fremen

 the film outright says multiple times that it was fake madeup propaganda planted by the bg paul is aware of this too what more evidence do you need of something being fake than the movie blatantly telling you its fake and there being more scifi explanation for the powers than a magical one at this point youre just believing what you want to believe despite any amount of evidence to the contrary why even waste others time by coming into arguments with your mind already made up

 if im paul i think id probably be like okay yes i understand why i have all these powers but that doesnt mean im not actually a  like figure since i am doing  like  

well you arent and paul in the film clearly didnt think so  what you bene gesserit have done to this planet is heartbreaking  so this is how we survive  by being harkonnens ruthless selfish etc  the latter when he decides to embrace the path of becoming the fremens fake messiah despite the galactic war killing billions that could result  btw i cant believe that you keep handwaving away any war with that level of bloodshed the religious brainwashing of an entire native people by foreigners etc as nothing bad

random group of people ive met have all heard of me and know everything i can do

was clearly explained to paul in part one that this was a result of bene gesserit propaganda go watch the  movie instead of basing your arguments on recap videos

edit 
its a shame my interlocutor deleted their account rather than just explain to me that this was a literal scene in the film

i didnt delete my account lol  i just blocked you because it seemed as though you were intentionally playing densethe broken record routine which is a known troll tactic also i had mentioned multiple times that the film outright says these things  so im still not sure that youre engaging in good faith here as a result do not bother responding because im no longer interested in continuing this conversation with you",2024-03-21 11:32:34
watched it again today she was a loyal fremen nothing in the scene indicates she worked for the harkonnens she killed 9 of them and refused to talk to them not exactly traits of a harkonnen spy,2024-03-05 02:02:54
i must have missed that i will need to watch this movie again,2024-03-04 11:10:50
"but these do not show that him fulfilling the prophecy is bad

my man a foreign guy  his mother brainwash a native people into believing that hes their messiah of a fake prophecy turning friends into followers primarily for his personal revenge at least to begin with and eventually sending them off to fight a galactic war killing billions which he already knew from his visions way back when he actually had the option to prevent it by just leaving like his mother had even suggested  and this isnt bad to you the movie outright tells you that this will eventually turn out to be bad for the fremen as well through pauls visions

all that aside  this is also a clear allegorymetaphor for antiimperialism a deconstruction of white saviour  chosen one tropes because the real world almostequivalent of something like this is a western country empowering fundamentalists in some middle eastern country to perform a religious revolution  coup in the name of liberation when in reality this is primarily for the formers own agenda getting oil in return from the new more cooperative regime etc the islamic revolution of iran certain events in afghanistan etc come to mind

i really did not see this again without the knowledge of the books the premonitions are quite ambiguous and could mean a lot of things 

like what did those visions of skeletal people crawling  groaning on a cracked desert floor mean anything good to you especially when you couple it with pauls obviously horrified response to it 

i think again that the film doesnt compel me to believe that the premonition is strictly false  he really does come back to life he really is able to read the minds of the people he really is seemingly able to see the future

the film outright tells you after jessica survives the water of life scene that high level bene gesserit are able to transmuteneutralise poisons paul is said to be the kwisatz haderach in both films which is essentially a male bene gesserit superbeing bridging time  space past  future  this is how he is able to survive the water of life see the future etc",2024-03-21 11:23:22
"yeah i also felt a similar way him going south made sense but i felt him deciding to also drink the water of life was a bit sudden and unexpected especially after seeing what it had done to lady jessica 

even chani was in a similar position i guess as she didnt expect him drink it either

i understand he had visions telling him to drink it before but didnt fully get why now he had decided to agree and do it just visions didnt feel like enough reason maybe it made him feel it was necessary",2024-03-03 14:51:00
yes and it is poorly done,2024-03-03 06:50:10
"villeneuve made it blatantly obvious how manipulative the messiah prophecy is just look at how chani was changed to be disgusted by it and jessica was made much creepier even outright saying she would turn people into believers starting from the weakest

there is no way most people just think it is a white saviour movie unless they want it to be one whether to criticize it or idolize paul well it would reinforce the point of the movie heh poor stilgar

edit on your point i did read an essay on a muslim subreddit by someone who was discussing orientalism and they did try hard to present the middle eastern influences in dune as just that made me sad because i think they even did that white saviour argument and sounded like they wanted to miss the point and even fauxmoi well no surprise complained about one of the costumes that a dune actress wore to the premiere because it resembled muslim attire turns out it was inspired by an old catholic nun costume but i still want to dismiss a lot of that idiocy as the loud pathetic minority of the internet",2024-03-03 08:30:14
yes but paul knew he was taking on the a fake religious mantle even in the first book thats not the traditional white savior movie,2024-03-04 11:42:32
"and as much as chani hates it it’s still unfortunately better than if the harkonnen had control

cant go into this without spoiling future books though heck but even with what information we already have  while the fremen continuing to be oppressed on arrakis is ofc bad the alternative now becomes them being plunged into a long holy war across the galaxy for the sake of their new warrior religion which is bad for both the fremen as well as everyone else in the galaxy  and if you think about it not even fully in the fremens own best interests alone  that is if it wasnt for the sake of their new prophet  religion why would they ever go to other planets to fight wars they would have slowly but steadily focused on improving the ecosystem of arrakis instead even with the harkonnen nuisance in the northern parts

in the end there are no easy right answers in dune  which is why its been revered since the 60s to be a great  still thematically relevant complex work of scifi

all of this aside to chani  not only is this a betrayal from paul but it also changes him their relationship her people their culture etc for the worse religious fanaticism has never ended well for any society or for others around them blindly following charismatic leaders especially foreign ones with their own agenda is also just as bad  which is the main reason why dune is said to be a deconstruction of white saviour  chosen one narratives than actually being either of those things",2024-03-01 08:02:05
yeah the first film did a better job is showing off the freman were great fighter but the sardaukar could still take them down we should’ve gotten some scenes of them being taken down in the final battle,2024-03-02 18:00:22
"the book was very very long

there was a lot skipped in this movie but it was either skip it or have a 3 part adaptation of nearly 3 hour movies with a midpart missing almost all combat action

for context the audio book for dune is 21 hours

you got the story in 2 movies that were each just under 3 hours",2024-03-02 17:05:51
"you mentioned the book so i had thought you read it

that’s the surface level interpretation of it feyd does say that the baron tried to  him but it’s so very clear that both of them knew it was not meant to  him but to test him and as a gift for feyd 

he did not struggle he was winning the entire fight but it’s a testament of the atreides fighting skills rather then the lack of by feyd 

i did not get that interpretation at all in no way is that scene meant to make feyd look weak he fought and won against an arteides even removing his shield and getting mad when interrupted i’ve seen the movie twice and i’ll assure you your interpretation is not what it’s meant to be nor what it comes off as",2024-03-05 03:44:50

"yeah the movie could have showed the level of technology a bit better in the sietches themselves but their high tech is also implied multiple times

for example through their use of advanced suits the availability of the thumpers that call forth the worms the rocket launcher they used to take down the ship their laser guns that they used against the spice harvesting machines and the many uses of tech to extract water from bodies for example during the burial ceremony for jamis

maybe its lower tech than what the high houses can bring out but clearly not by much because theyre able to humiliate the harkonnens in direct combat",2024-03-06 16:18:34

no that was an ending not a conclusion there’s a difference between those in storytelling,2024-03-02 14:44:40
hence what the whole point of the book is pauls rise to power and how they use religion and propaganda as a means to gain control of the fremen its not about battles and ,2024-03-06 17:12:57
movie’s already 2 hours and 46 minutes long thufir’s scenes were deleted unfortunately but like the other guy said his arc would be repetitive and not ultimately important to the story writing a film is different than a book and cutting out  is good filmmaking any and every movie ever has good scenes that the director most likely had to force themselves to cut because it didnt fit into the flow of the movie lotr extended editions are great for fans but are just straight up worse as film watching experiences,2024-03-04 23:06:27
that would be another 30mins in a 3hr movie for a side plot that adds nothing but an interesting side plot,2024-03-04 23:04:43

"i wasnt talking about the book at all

in the film chani hated her desert spring name  its revealed in pauls water of life scene that its because its part of the prophecy that the lisn al gaib would be saved by desert spring tears which is why jessica uses the voice on chani to force her into doing her part in cementing pauls messianic nature  the prophecys credibility beyond a doubt this isnt at all how this scene played out in the book after all",2024-03-02 21:13:49
"theres no guarantee that they would have been successful at doing so if paul actually didnt have kwisatz haderach powerspotential or at the very least  his bene gesserit training under jessica in the book its mentioned that he also has mentat potential

even the reverend mother only tells jessica in part one that a path has been laid on arrakis better hope he doesnt squander it or so this only gives them a chance to manipulate the fremen for their safety the way so many false prophets fake godmen  even modern day mega church preachersevangelists do irl  wasnt 100 guaranteed to work",2024-03-02 21:45:53
"why even bother asking this question here if you had already decided that you would never accept any other answer 


there’s an animal kind of trick a human would remain in the trap endure the pain feigning death that he might  the trapper and remove a threat to his kind

this part of the quote wasnt in the movie theres absolutely no reason why i have to use the book to explain a scene from the film

a human wouldn’t just hang out in the trap because he loves the way it clamps painfully on his leg

youre also being pedantic af here  the gom jabbar already puts the subject under more pain than a trap would on a leg  so if feyd could withstand the pain from the trap  act as rationallynormally as he usually does even if its because he finds the pain pleasurable hes still technically passing the test 

why not just sit on your hand until it becomes numb before you take the test then you’d pass easy peasy

for someone who claims to be oh so bothered by how theyve changed the test  its very meaning you seem to have no qualms about changing how its performed for the sake of making your own arguments since when is the subject of a gom jabbar informed beforehand of the test  its nature in order for them to just sit on their hand until its numb  pass easy peasy

so the test of feyd shows that he loves pain and they allow him to live because he can be controlled

the result of the test was simply that he could withstand the pain regardless of the reason  stay as rational as he usually is  therefore a pass the fact that he finds pleasure in pain was an additional inference  hes allowed to live because he passed the test just like paul was not because he could be controlled the latter made him a more attractive prospect for the bg

but how does the test show he can be controlled

jesus fing christ do you need everything spelt out for you they literally said out loud that his levers were desire  humiliation  that hes sexually vulnerable this neednt have been shown by the test alone but by fenrings research on him they did spend the night together afterwards have  etc as well for someone who claims to have read the book  considers every word of it gospel you seem to be awfully befuddled by how the bene gesserit agents are so obviously portrayed to act  go about their plans in them 

its so blatantly indicated in that scene that the plan was for irulan to marry feyd and while hes emperor manipulate him to fulfil the bgs agendas via her taking advantage of his  vulnerabilities further details of this plan is neither known nor relevant considering his fate at the end of both book  film alike

it’s a change of context for the whole concept that doesn’t quite hang together for me

it isnt but feel free to cry some more about it

what scene are you talking about",2024-03-15 19:49:35
"did he consciously decide to manipulate the fremen in the first part of part 2

he outright says in the beginning of part 2 that i must convert the nonbelievers if im to disrupt spice production its the only way i can reach the emperor 

paul denied he was the messiah and wanted to be named after the kangaroo rat kinda seemed like he genuinely wanted to become a fremen

him denying he was the messiah  that he just wanted to be one of them the first time  after jessicas water of life survival  was just him telling chani  co what they would prefer to hear but by the time he chooses the muaddib name ie once he had spent some time with  gotten to know chani and the fremen better he did come to genuinely care for them he changes his mind about his initial plan then which is when jessica  or rather alia  complains that he was getting clouded by love but by then like ive already mentioned events leading to the holy war were already well set into motion by him  accelerated by jessica 

this was his tragedy  that he didnt want to manipulate them anymore after a point but that it was too late  fate brought about by his initial choices forced him back to his original plan anyway  btw another visual indicator of when paul is thinking more of himself  his own atreides interest and not just whats best for the fremen was his fathers ducal signet he takes the ring off after falling in love with chani saying ive found my way father he puts it back on during the war council scene with a shot of gurneys face showing the guys immense approval of it when paul announces that hes paul muaddib atreides duke of arrakis 

like weve said before while he is driven more by choosing the seemingly less horrible of 2 outcomespath of immediate survival in the latter scene the act of taking off and now putting the ring back on are clear visual indicators of when he became just one of the fremen versus when hes primarily acting for paul atreides",2024-03-20 05:34:10

in the books jessica tells paul that the bene gesserit use a command when they may lose a fight if i remember right she reminds paul of that when feyd has him near a lethal move paul yells something along the lines of i will not say it and that distracts feyd momentarily for paul to gain the upper hand,2024-03-06 20:55:46

in your opinion do you think there will be another film its literally millions sitting on the table im not a book reader but with all the changes they made it makes sense to continue their spin on the story",2024-03-06 04:08:19
"see to me it felt like pauls goal was to free the fremen from oppression

his goal at first was simply just to fight alongside them which he pointed out numerous times throughout the movie its only once he consumes the water of life that he loses his identity and starts to play into the messiah role 

the movie also clearly shows his goal is to rise to power hence why he decides to betray chani at the end and take the hand of princess irulan to solidify his claim to the throne 

at no point did i get the sense that he was manipulating them for his own ends

i mean how many times did you need the movie to tell you that the prophecy is literally bene gesserit propaganda and that he that he knows he isnt actually the messiah that is the definition of manipulation he knows the prophecy is  and he is still using it as a means to control the fremen

it always felt to me like he was helping them

he is doing both he is helping them defeat the harkonnens and free themselves but at the same time he is also manipulating them and becoming a false prophet to achieve his political goals thats what makes him an antihero and a morally grey character 

 if the movie was trying to imply that he was going mad with power and actually bad for the fremen

again this is an oversimplification he is neither a pure hero nor is he a pure villain he is a complex morally grey antihero while on the one hand he is helping the fremen he is also manipulating them and using them thats part of what makes dune so great there is a lot of nuance it isnt just a story about good guys and bad guys 

fremen i feel like it didnt do a great job of showing that for those of us who havent read the books

the movie actually makes it much more obvious than it was in the books the movie is much less subtle about it chanis character basically spells all this out to the audience which in the book she doesnt i think you should give the movie a rewatch and pay closer attention to the details this is all part of what makes dune so great there is a lot of nuance and complexity to it it has a ton of thematic depth it isnt just a surface level good guys vs bad guys movie 

you are not wrong that paul has some heroic traits about him and that in many ways he is helping the fremen but you also have to pay attention to the manipulative things he is doing and how he is taking advantage of them religious colonialism is a huge part of what dune is all about",2024-03-10 03:58:17
"paul’s only goal is to avenge his father

he never wants to be a leader even before he comes to arrakis he has trouble accepting his role as the eventual successor to his father then he keeps rejecting the fremen who want him to be a leader he keeps insisting that he is just a warrior

then fate makes it so he has no choice he’s a tragic figure",2024-03-10 04:22:53
they call them atomics in the book but given how far in the future this is they very well may be based on a form of fusion as opposed to fission that doesnt create nuclear fallout,2024-03-06 00:06:24
"sorry i had a long response but the reddit app ate it for some reason

 further warfare will claim more lives

ya pretty much pauls jihad that he starts at the end of the movie kills a ton of people

 now i’m intrigued how you can believe that nuclear fallout

pre1955ish nuke created a lot of fallout and it caused terrible issues like the ones you mentioned in japan little boy the bomb dropped on hiroshima was especially bad for this as it was a crude gun type bomb as fision type devices these bombs ended up not using all their fissile material and scattering the unused material over the area

post 1955 bombs switched to thermonuclearhydrogen bombs these use a combination of fission like previous bombs and fusion hydrogen which means they consume much more of their fissile material extensive use of hydrgen also creates less radioactive byproducts than a purely fission bomb the end result is much less fallout as the radioactive material is used up

during the cold war the bombs very quickly got destructive enough so the major powers us and ussr began to focus on either making them smaller to allow more to be fit on the same missile to do weird stuff with them the russians were really into using them for earthmoving projects like canals or reducing the after effects mostly so you can invade the thing you just nuked the end result is that we got to the point where the only thing really stopping nukes from flying was mad which thankfully works amazingly well

youll hear some stuff about dirty bombs that intentially spread fallout by including radioactive material thats designed to not be consumed and instead just spread by the explosion the main examples of this are small theorized terrorist bombs or macarthur wanting to nuke the entire northern korean border with cobalt laced bombs making it nearimpossible to cross by the chinese

ill try and find a source corroborating this but it might be a bit",2024-03-06 02:17:49
there was no need to refresh anything you just didnt enjoy it and thats fine,2024-03-09 23:59:37
paul wasnt supposed to drink the water of life that wasnt part of bgs plan it shouldve killed him thats why the bgs have beef with jessica she concieved a son instead of a daughter and she taught him the skills of the bg,2024-03-14 14:57:22
they probably can a little if they have enough spice and guild navigators definitely can they just have a much more conservative attitude about using that ability than paul does,2024-03-04 01:57:07
i dont understand your take we see him struggling with his visions and destiny for not only this movie but there are scenes in the first movie as well him drinking the water of life didnt need any more setup he made the decision after feyd slaughtered his sietch and he didnt have the prescience to see it,2024-03-04 11:58:56
are you just upset that all the avengers didnt show up or,2024-03-02 22:32:02
"i have not read the books so i cant really comment on the specifics as to how or why billions in casualties was the toll due to the jihad

but my point was that i think dennis choice of making the great houses defy paul as the emperor is a reasonable and believable explanation for what causes the holy war for the movie i honestly dont see how this has somehow obliterated the themes of the novel i understand that it simplifies some subtexts from the novel but judging the movie by itself i see a wellwritten story

regardless i still see your concerns about the great houses defying pauls leadership as a nonissue it may be an issue for you because in the books there is more nuance that is missing in the movie but thats just the way it is in adaptation

say what you want about dennis choices but i hear the man talk about the novels with so much love dune was considered unadaptable until this man came in who has been drawing storyboards since he read the novel when he was 13

i think you are being overly harsh in your criticism",2024-03-06 20:00:17
"the biggest theme of the story according to frank herbert himself is the importance of distrusting political and religious leaders and that theme absolutely shines through

it was immediately obvious that you didn’t really understand the movie but i’m beginning to suspect you didn’t really understand the book either",2024-03-06 19:22:46
yeah i meant dont write a review on imdb or comparable websites where your vote will affect the score,2024-03-10 00:56:57

this movie is ripe for a rewatch",2024-04-08 12:07:47
"yes but a few times in the movie they talk about how dangerous pauls survival would be to the emperor since the other houses would unite behind him if they knew the truth it gets mentioned a few times

and then the time comes and its just a quick nope i guess i just expected paul to have done more to try and make his case",2024-03-03 22:24:05
the houses acknowledged paul as emperor in the book right,2024-03-06 21:07:49

"keep in mind also that the bene gesserit do not think in years they think in generations sure once in a while much changes in a short time and is less predictable like the events in the movie but when you think in generations the overall path of history can be predicted and more importantly directed

this point is one that herbert gets deeper into in later books",2024-03-04 10:55:59
it’s exactly like how dumbledore was explaining how voldemort actions created the prophecy itself in harry potter much confusion,2024-03-04 10:44:59
"“he who controls the spice controls the universe”

whether its the bg the emperor the houses or the spacing guild each faction wants one thingpower this is the realpolitik that herbert reflects in the world of dune the bgs plan to gain power is the centurieslong eugenics program to create a superhuman the kwisatz haderach kh which they want to use to gain control of spice 

the purpose of planting the prophecy amongst the fremen was because the bg knew they needed to control the fremen in order to permanently take arrakis as well as all the other planets they planted prophecies so that when they finally do create the kh the road is laid for them to take control so the bg controls the kh who controls the fremen who controls arrakis therefore the bg ultimately controls the universe

this plan is a choice on the part of the bg to manipulate individuals and societies to their will through propaganda which is very different from a real prophecy which is a matter of divine predetermination

their plan went off the rails when jessica had paul who eventually cuts the bg out of the picturethey cant control him but he certainly used the groundwork they laid to seize power for his reasons but thats beside the point",2024-03-21 05:28:32
i think its fake i dont think it really happened,2024-03-17 22:15:46
it could still be both though the grander force guiding events could be working through the bg they have incredible powers and can see the future,2024-03-28 03:08:07
i mean on a general level he’s definitely freeing them you can always argue people aren’t free if you look at all the intricacies of freedom the people were an oppressed native population getting exterminated by the harkonnens now they are leading an imperialistic crusade ,2024-03-07 08:40:03
how is it a lie they are completely subjugated by the harkonnens and the greater empire for the production of spice the war is to take control of their own planet just because he has additional motivation doesn’t mean the war doesn’t primary benefit them,2024-03-07 13:42:18
but the goal of the eugenics plan is to create the kizach adarak which is the prophecy,2024-03-17 07:13:32
the motivation n what sense  the “prophesy “ is just a story the bg makes sure is around so the bg can take control of a population  the kh is a breeding program to make a male bg,2024-04-06 12:54:46
yeah thats what i dont completely get and think the movie did a terrible job at explaining are his visions genetic because his mom is bene gessiure if so wouldnt pretty much most bg also see the future or is it because of the spice if spice makes you see the future then why arent there more people who see the future why did he live if hes not special and men physically cant survive the blood of life,2024-03-06 13:41:56
sigh,2024-03-11 22:45:39
i mean sure maybe all of the bene gesserit machinations are out of their control and maybe we have no free will at all and  is just toying with us but i think thats a crappy story,2024-03-23 23:13:01

very cool story and i agree i love going into movies blind but i can never tell when the final trailer is before a movie starts i try to arrive 20 minutes after the start time but often trailers are still going and i don’t want to push it and miss the beginning of a movie,2024-03-08 04:00:15
"hi love this comment and honestly i am in the same boat it is such a privilege to go into cinema not knowing  

trailers absolutely ruin the experiences for me and whenever i see a trailerclipposter i shut it off or close my eyes i dont want to see any ‘spoilers’ and it always pays dividends 

the riding worm scene for example was one of my favourite scenes ever and if i watched the trailer i wouldn’t have been half as thrilled",2024-03-10 02:02:19

good luck its very different but still good,2024-03-04 02:54:22
i am very glad they made the change because there are just a lot of confusing things going on as is especially for those who haven’t read the books it would have just taken up a lot of precious time in a movie that could’ve been hours longer although i was a little disappointed deep down we didn’t get to see a denis portrayal of alia in this film as the toddler i know she was in that one dream it was definitely for the better but  it would’ve been so badass if he could do it somewhat realistically haha,2024-03-03 04:16:14

what makes the quote even funnier is that this isnt the first time he thought he found the lisan al gaib,2024-03-06 09:43:19
"he is the kwisatz haderach the product of a 10000  year long breeding program he wasnt the prophecied messiah he was a glorified labrat that the prophecy ended up coming true is only a testament to how utterly brainwashed the fremen were to believe that this white saviour was destined to save them the prophecy could only come true because the fremen were manipulated into believing it was true by the bene gesserit for their own mysterious purposes later by lady jessica to ensure her and pauls survival and then later by paul himself to weaponize them to avenge his father and fight a war for him

even if pauls intentions were good and the outcome of his actions positive it doesnt change the fact that he achieved it by manipulating the fremen through a false prophecy one he didnt create but did fully intend to take advantage of from the start in order to avenge his father",2024-03-31 23:13:46

they originally used computer to calculate the paths taken for intergalactic travel but have since outlawed computers due to the threat of rogue ai so now spice is used instead to grant individuals the prescience to make those calculations instead,2024-03-08 22:03:47
"in the book the threat was most directly targeted at the spacing guild representatives who could see with their abilities that he was completely serious about it the guild role was omitted from the movie but in the book they are have the monopoly on space travel and paul having them over the barrel means the fleets in orbit are forced to flee regardless of whatever unstated wishes there may have been for the forces on board those ships were   
guess villeneuve wanted a more straightforward explanation for why the fremen are about to launch their purge of humanity",2024-03-12 02:40:19
dune is one of those seminal works of fiction that youll start seeing it everywhere now because it is indeed everywhere,2024-03-23 02:34:03
"i know this is getting meta now but doesnt this become very boring for the audience now if the path is known and hes just going thru the motions of realizing it why should we care weve now been told this is the least awful path least deaths the fremen will survivethrive per this path the imperium presumably becomes less oppressed or inequitable or whatever it is   so as the audience ill take your word for it and dont really need the blow by blow 

 ive read other comments that theres a space guild in the book thats not shown in the movie at all we havent been told what the issue is with the galaxy besides that everyone needs spice and spice production is controlled and this means what exactly that paul has to go upend the entire galactic order the only thing that will truly improve the galactic order is to deal with the bene gesserits who orchestrate everything and paul doesnt do this at least by the end of part 2 the movie doesnt show him intending to tackle this",2024-03-06 04:10:10

"hes acting in his selfinterest in the sense that he believes he alone can guide the galaxy towards a better future but hes acting against his selfinterest in the sense that hes haunted by the blood on his hands and unable to bear the weight of authority

im not sure if youve read the books but the second book explores this more to the point that he in fact just goes to live in the desert abdicating his power im hoping the third film gets greenlit because i think denis is doing a better job of telling the story than herbert did",2024-03-03 12:19:16
"is that the whole arc of what dune  pauls life is about i havent read the books just seen the two movies and know nothing of the story except what villeneuve shows i dont understand pauls development revenge  ok understandable got it wanting to fight alongside of the fremen since they share a passion for the common enemy  ok yes what exactly after he discovers hes half harkannen makes him go on a rampage and seek submission of the fremen and declare himself duke and his rage and needing to take the life of the emperor for it  yes ok but then to go on and want to fight the entire galaxy where did that come from the storytelling is just not compelling 

hes never shown any ambition in that way as a person he didnt even think he wanted to be his fathers heir he keeps relying on visions  but all things being equal why follow the visions that lead to war vs the ones from much earlier on that said dont even go south isnt he just making it a selffulfilling prophecy and delivering it on a silver platter for the bgs very confusing

i agree with the comment elsewhere in this discussion that the whole thing is a reverse pincer maneuver and hes playing right into their hands",2024-03-05 11:25:40
"the comment i was responding to said not going to spoil but she still has a part to play

the only part she could play which he could spoil is the part she plays in the books so if hes referencing that info i am also referencing that info

i kind of also think its a callback to the training he had with gurney in the first one where paul wins but gurney points out that he would die too,2024-03-01 22:05:42
 i’m considering a third viewing tonight or maybe i’ll wait a day,2024-03-01 20:45:36

i had the exact same recollection i almost thought i remembered the books wrong and forgot chani was against everything but i personally loved the way she was portrayed in the film it established more of the non religious side and definitely showed pauls antihero side which ultimately makes it more interesting,2024-03-03 09:12:57
"i disagree  i think villaneavue used chani’s character to express the conflict that paul mostly experiences as internal monologue in the books   


 paul knows the messianic prophesy is the most grifter of   he knows that to use the grifter  is  the start of the golden path

i reeeeeally don’t think so for one because i remember there only being two and it being cool that he stabbed elvis with the blade he got stabbed with but also paul randomly pulling out a third dagger that no one knew about seems extremely dishonorable,2024-03-05 15:57:27
"this is correct in the book paul did not know who would win he did not willingly get stabbed either he gets cut in the arm because feyd hesitated earlier in the fight as a feint and then went in with a quickness paul didn’t expect there was undetectable poison on feyd’s knife that made paul move slightly slower in a dodge and feyd took him to the ground and once feyd was on top there was a undetectable small needle on his hip that was coated in muscle relaxants that he was going to use to help him  paul paul managed to swap positions with him in the grappling and then he stabbed feyd in an uppercut through the underside of the jaw 

the fight in the movie was awesome and i think did a better job for suspense but i don’t think the intent was to purposefully get stabbed",2024-03-01 21:57:42

"i think in the books that would violate the law you could use suicide nuke ships as a last ditch survival thing but otherwise the other houses and the emperor would pound you for that

i think the house atomics are the same illegal but everyone has them just in case only on arrakis could you get away with using a few nukes  no one wants to nuke you back",2024-03-13 04:32:04
like subnautica shudder,2024-03-03 03:48:05
the harkonnens held a planetary fief on geidi prime each house can only hold one planetary fief at a time they were in charge of arrakis through a quasifief which was basically a temp work contract to mine the spice,2024-03-03 02:58:29
yep caladan was given to… duke or lord or whatever something or other someone with the same family name as lea seydoux’s character so her dad i guess not sure there’s an official explanation since i only read 25 books but given that the emperor was explicitly out to eliminate the atreides since they were growing too powerful i think it makes sense,2024-03-03 01:19:44
the book does make a distinction between the harkonnen quasifief and atreides fiefcomplete that requires the latter to leave caladan,2024-03-04 03:24:29
nope their new fief was arrakis the harkonnens had a different arrangement during their control of the planet which is why they held arrakis and giedi prime simultaneously i actually just decided to reread the book and it’s explicitly explained in the first few pages i’m sure they would have retained a good deal of popular support there but officially they had nothing further to do with caladan after the emperor gave them arrakis,2024-03-03 16:41:44
yeah thats part of why they recognized that the emperor was scheming against them and why arrakis was a curse rather than a gift despite how much power the title of duke there should grant the family and they couldnt turn down the gift of the planet,2024-03-04 08:04:12
"you’re definitely right i was also a little annoyed they used the term in the film considering it was used inaccurately based on how the word “abomination” is defined in the dune books i’m not even sure it’s used in the first book considering alia is not born yet 

what was annoying is that when they used the term “abomination” in the film it felt like an attempt at fan service for those of us who have read the books but they used it in the wrong context so it wasn’t even gratifying",2024-03-24 02:08:05
i dont remember how but iirc they have pretty much mastered human breeding to such a degree that they can control their bodies and when to get pregnant and they can choose the  of the baby they allude to it with lea seydoux and how she could get with feydrautha once get pregnant and immediately knowcontrol that the bloodline heir will be female which is most beneficial to the bene gesserit unless its for the purpose of breeding for the kwisatz haderach male,2024-03-22 23:33:11
"so as the other two who answered your question already said it one of the bene gesserit powers to quote the wiki here physically a bene gesserit could control every muscle and nerve in their body right down to the individual fibers which in dune logic apparently allows for fertility control exercising control over their own menstrual cycle and at conception their childs 

more importantly tho the bene gesserit have an at that time century old breeding program going their plan was for paul to be a female and feydrautha a male and their child shouldve been the kwisatz haderach jessica pauls mum didnt give a flying  about that plan tho because leto pauls dad wished for a son their might also be some ego stuff going on here in which jessica is arrogant enough to think she can bring forth the kwisatz haderach herself

so why is this now a problem the bene gesserit want to be able to have control over the kwisatz haderach and with paul and by further extend all atreides born there is no control to be had thats also why the bene gesserit try to delete the entire atreides bloodline

honestly there is so much more about all that stuff but i think a yt vid or the wiki itself will do a much better job in explaining all the intricacies",2024-03-24 03:37:45
"i actually havent read the books and i cant remember if they gave a reason in part 1 but this is what i found online jessica was instructed to have a daughter so the bene gesserit could wed her to baron harkonnens nephew feydrautha

edit also the bene gesserit can only be women and i assume they wanted to bolster their ranks",2024-03-18 01:18:35
oh wow thank you for answering i had no idea ,2024-03-01 14:40:01
i did not realize gerard depardieu was a  now i know,2024-03-03 02:15:44
ive read many times how much star wars was inspired by dune but i didnt realize actually how much until i watched those movies,2024-03-03 15:25:33
warhammer 40k is another one that owes a  of a lot to dune starship troopers the novel dune alienaliens neuromancer and a couple other novels or movies are basically the foundation upon which all scifi has borrowed from,2024-03-04 04:24:35
" “the holy war begins”  literal chills and a few gasps in my theater

i hoped that she would have called it jihad in that moment to really drive home the point",2024-03-04 19:25:57
in some ways dune is to scifi what lord of the rings is to fantasy just absolutely foundational and its got way more competition than lotr did,2024-03-10 03:07:35
i must have missed the timing of the scene i agree and your point makes sense but the timing seemed to be so immediately following being knocked back by him that i understood it as a direct reaction to his use of the voice but a bunch of stuff was going on in that scene so i may have misremembered excited to see it a second time will try to pick up on this during round 2,2024-03-01 15:03:02
im familiar with the books but in the scene she did seem to direct it at paul however we were shown the gom jabbar test in the first part so his use of the voice shouldnt come as a surprise to her perhaps it is because he used it on a reverend mother she probably realizes at that point that paul is the kwisatz haderach but maybe shes angry that the bene gesserit arent controlling him,2024-03-01 20:34:42
i think youre just reading into it too much because you read the book as a movie watcher you really wouldnt have the impression that she was saying that as an open statement to the room when she said it pretty much right after paul used the voice on her,2024-03-05 18:48:25
can you cite the passage in the book that youre getting this from,2024-03-02 22:04:14
somebody needs to get paul a nice hat,2024-03-03 01:48:35
is that a worm reference those are rare to see unprompted haha,2024-03-04 06:55:09
well he can see futures better believe he chose the best one for the future but how far,2024-03-04 01:29:39
paul addressed him as relative and gave him a quick death i loved how the baron had a glimpse of the throne but could never reach it his whole dynamic is opulence bathes in oil smokes  and has a life support system even his body is large like the kings of before who had gout due to their gluttonous ways,2024-03-03 10:35:47
better explaining the superpowers taking the magic space worm puke drug give probably would have helped,2024-03-03 04:09:04
i dont think it was a reference to the fetus yes it means alia in the books but in this context it simply doesnt make sense especially after paul used the voice on her i think this is probably abomination in the general sense like u had in ur original comment but like an easter egg of sorts,2024-03-04 15:46:12
"in the movie i think its aimed at paul but it references the fact that jessica should have had a girl as her first child  
jessica instead chose to have a boy and this is reason the bene gesserits kh plan failed",2024-03-10 23:54:09
i took it as paul killing the baron for the atreides getting revenge for the past and muaddib killing feyd for the fremen carving their way forward,2024-03-02 08:41:06
great point,2024-03-02 04:26:23
"right but a baby gestates for 9 months so that’s the maximum amount of time that the second movie can be set across consider that she already knew she was pregnant so she was already a month or so into it at the start of the movie so that brings it down to 8 months and then by the end of the movie alia wasn’t born yet and jessica also didn’t look like she was about to pop at any moment so probably another month or so left before alia is born that leaves at most 7 months that the movie is set across 

in the books there’s about 5 years between when duke leto is killed and baron harkonen is killed the chani line is probably just something that came from the books and wasn’t tweaked enough to work with the movie timeline",2024-03-01 20:28:47
that makes much less sense than the simple fact jessica hasnt given birth yet,2024-03-01 18:23:50
yeah they put that in there strangely n,2024-03-06 13:41:17
"he was good in his limited role in blade runner 2049

i think he was solid as a dull lump of muscle under the thumb of the baron in dune",2024-04-10 06:02:07
nailed it my daughter asked if jessica was losing it after the movie and didnt quite put together that anya was playing pauls sister in one of his visions she also asked so is paul like a bad guy now extremely glad this movie respects its audience instead of going for a cheap hollywood ending,2024-03-04 01:54:07
the freudian vibes are also played way down in the movies in the book its very obvious jessica wants to bang paul,2024-03-03 20:40:14
we probably have to for messiah again for clarification on how to interpret stuff all this sceptical talk about religion might hint something but everyone still called jessica’s pregnancy an abomination i can’t wait to see how they portray alia in messiah and what they do to the ending,2024-03-05 12:23:57
can you explain to me without spoilers lady jessica’s plan sorry if this is a  question but like it seems like she was bad in the movie,2024-03-08 03:25:37
shut up nerd,2024-03-09 14:16:59
i loved that,2024-04-08 00:56:37
i was wondering what 4 year old actor they would get for paul’s sister but i liked the way they’ve done her,2024-03-02 22:30:59
"i agree that she might fit it well but literally every film ive seen has her in it we were laughing about the new mad max trailer which looked really cool but she plays furiosa and we sort of collectively groaned and then of course she randomly shows up in this film 

i guess its just crazy how theres not other promising actors filling these roles",2024-03-03 22:22:10
i saw the boston globe give the film a bad review because it had “white savior complex” ,2024-03-01 22:55:15
the character development is just not well done the whole movie lacks transitions or ambiguities built in where looking back the signs were all there i can do inception level of mental gymnastics but in this movie one moment it was i wont go south i cant lead you bad things will happen and the next moment so im half harkkonen you will all kneel before me who dares to doubt me,2024-03-05 12:04:23
its all of the above pretty much all high born women are inducted into the bene gesserit so theyre going to have that blood running through them for generations upon generations,2024-03-06 10:56:29
i was very surprised we didnt get some sort of visual of time as sand flowing over different dunes like the description in the books denis loves those kinds of visuals,2024-03-03 14:41:19
the struggles were much more nuanced in the book for instance before the water he figures out his mother is dangerous ill be careful on the spoilers but i did prefer some of the more nuanced stuff they didnt include from the book here thought it was a missed opportunity,2024-03-02 15:40:49
yes thats clear,2024-03-03 00:44:35
"exactly i feel like i watched a movie with lots of chapters missing just wholesale chopped out  for length complexity whatever the revenge arc is the only one we were shown why exactly hes now determined to go to war with the whole galaxy isnot shown 

this is tenetlevel broken storytelling",2024-03-05 12:19:21
thanks for sharing i might actually appreciate the book version more i can appreciate clear eyed thinking  leaders often make choicesthat seem unthinkable they eliminate obstacles in the path that they know they must take doesnt mean they have no conscience but they decide,2024-03-05 15:00:32
" paul is much less vocally conflicted about exploiting the myth in the book in the book he and jessica are pretty in tune about the plan with minimal dialogue going over it all of his hesitations are internal as such taking over their religious leadership and paul playing into the lisan al gaib role is much smaller of a dramatic point
 
 

even in the movie he starts off wanting to convert the fremen

even when he throws water on jessica fulfilling the prophecy its easy to see it as cynical since he explicitly says he has to win over the skeptics and being humble was a way forward

its only after he falls in love with chani  who is much more against this  here  that he flips",2024-03-07 22:06:58
"also to me it was pretty clear all of paul’s actions were to save himself and his family 

“enemies all around us” and that scene where he describes how there’s one way for it at all to work and the bloodline to survive

due to this it makes his actions unquestionable as the viewer all we know is every action he takes is required for his family to survive and to do that he needed to marry the emperors daughter made perfect sense imo if you missed this aspect of the movie i don’t think the plot and underlying themes fully sank in with the viewer",2024-03-05 03:48:54
" truth is jessica caused this entire mess and led to leto being killed which she demands revenge for
 
 the bg are assholes but their plan was originally not to wipe out the atreides

source",2024-03-18 03:23:36
ever hear your mom use your full name,2024-03-13 20:10:16
why did they tell the baron to spare jessica and paul then,2024-03-01 15:32:28
but a man being able to use the bg powers is literally the kwisatz haderach the abomination is alia which is why i didnt like that line,2024-03-02 06:16:04
my takeaway was the abomination was still directed to alia through jessica but paul being able to use the voice on her was the giveaway for her that they have gone down that path now,2024-03-01 14:36:53
also imagine them with the shield protectors,2024-03-18 03:32:59
it isnt shown in the movie but paul and jessica teach the fremen the advanced fighting techniques they know so the fremen are ultraformidable and can cope with shields,2024-03-05 00:45:57
one thing the movies didnt show and i think outright are not using at all due to what we see on screen is that shields arent used on arrakis because it drives the worms into a frenzy this also allows fremen to use laser weapons since in the dune universe shield  laser  essentially a nuke,2024-03-12 02:38:03
either they looted harkonens shields or paul would start equipping them with shields from atreides or somewhere,2024-03-04 21:51:38
i think there’s also quite a few atrities survivors who can probably be more formidable pilots also any of the left over sadakur if there are any got blended into the general army of friemen also the friemen have showed to be able to pilot the copters so they can probably do that at least,2024-03-06 05:02:31
its weird to rewatch the scene from part 1 where mohiam speaks with the baron on giedi prime and try to spot any these two have  tension between them ,2024-03-02 17:51:08
the dune wiki says that they found it in franks notes but doesnt cite a source,2024-03-04 05:25:08
meaning that i don’t think the lotr extended editions are masterpieces they are paced like absolute  and a lot of the additional scenes have too much redundant information,2024-03-01 12:32:21
he doesn’t mean literal visions but the story as originally envisioned,2024-03-01 07:39:50
unless each part was four hours long i just dont see how they could fit everything unfortunately,2024-03-03 00:03:21
this movie in particular echoed got a lot for me everything with paul and the fremen felt exactly like jon and the wildings but with a shade of the daenerys mhysa worship thrown in feydrautha reminded me of ramsay bolton even down to he and paul getting a final duel and chani like ygritte becomes disillusioned with paul for straying from the fremens best interests and the bene gesserit scheming to  feydrautha into their control felt like what the tyrells were trying to accomplish with joffrey initially,2024-03-18 08:21:00
"ok but look how much they ended up cutting from game of thrones even whilst having a multihour format to include as much as they could

at least this film ended up good unlike the latter half of got",2024-03-03 00:23:24
ahh interesting reads but i actually asked what thufir did d,2024-03-03 20:28:43
"my take is that he had the prescience to understand that once he headed south that the path was set  hence the gravity of that decision  once he was headed south there was no longer a choice  i thought they played that well if i head south millions will die

any convo after that could show that hes not happy about it  but paul and anyone hed confide in seem wise enough to not waste breath on that hes not the kid from part 1 whining about destiny anymore",2024-03-04 16:26:47
100 there was a dirty look over at his mother after waking up from water of life then a line of dialogue about finding out hes half harkonnen that was it,2024-03-05 13:02:53
nah they dont address it gurney just says fight me,2024-03-09 02:40:49
eh its within the realm of my suspension of disbelief so it didnt take me out of the movie but when i found out why they used swords it made a lot more sense the people i watched it with didnt know why so there were times they were wondering why people didnt just use guns,2024-03-15 14:56:07
as i was looking at reviewscommentary on the movie shout out to the weekly planet they mentioned that it has to be slow moving so a fast bullet wouldnt work but yeah its weird because they do show projectiles sometimes working,2024-03-07 13:44:40
a dart does things have to be slow to get through the shield i believe you cant use the lasers on a shield cause it causes a catastrophic explosion but thats not explained in the movie,2024-03-13 07:05:26
hold on to your papers,2024-03-06 13:55:04
yes she’s essentially a toddler with the speech capability and physical abilities of a full grown adult you can see how that would’ve been hard to adapt to the screen and the change was probably for the better,2024-03-04 02:11:01
i really like how dv changed the ending to dune it gives us a sense of inevitability in pauls choice of becoming the  emperor,2024-03-03 08:12:08
bro  are you going on about they didnt turn on shields cause fremen were sniping them from afar if one of the harkonnens turned on their shields it would  the rest of the harkonnens including the shield wearer even if fremen were somehow not far enough from the blast radius they can easily use the terrain to protect themselves the patrol also were not aware that paul and jessica were near the rock,2024-03-10 13:31:30
yes but i need to express my frustration at how  the combatants in dune are visually the movie looks great amazing soundtrack classic story and the whole thing is populated with saturday morning cartoon villains with the iq to boot,2024-03-08 21:54:36
"no the guild has straight up rules against fighting in spacein their ships if a house breaks the rule the guild refuses to transport for them 


so everyone plays nice with the spacing guild and behaves in space ",2024-03-04 15:03:22
not only does the guild have rules against space combat but you cant use those lasers against a shield and survive the impact of a lasgun against a shield creates a nuclear explosion you cant set them to fire manually either there is a galaxy wide ban against automatons as ai caused some sort of extinction event and largescale war so theyre taboo which is why everything is handled by people,2024-03-05 02:37:45
 this is  hilarious lololol,2024-03-09 06:14:26

"i dont disagree though something like a directors cut where they adapt it by maybe having the external dialogue a bit more overt about the plotting reducing the bg instincts other than maybe a glance you see from jessica or paul in the background as the plotters talk maybe one of the telepathic communication things theyve danced on making a thing in the movies rights as paul and jessica think there may be a fight then and now 

i dont think you could do a direct from book to screen adaptation but with some creativity i think it could be done",2024-03-05 04:13:41
that scene wouldve brought to life the city of arrakeen though,2024-03-05 20:11:33

wont happen

 denis villeneuve said he will not release any deleted scenes explaining im a strong believer that when its not in the movie its dead i  darlings and its painful for me sometimes i remove shots and i say i cannot believe im cutting this out i feel like a samurai opening my gut its painful so i cannot go back after that and create a frankenstein and try to reanimate things that i killed its too painful when its dead its dead and its dead for a reason but yes it is a painful project but it is my job the movie prevails im very i think severe in the editing room im not thinking about my ego im thinking about the movie  link",2024-03-04 05:12:27
there isnt going to be directors cut,2024-03-03 16:46:07
just watched the movie as a non book reader loved it its too bad denis has to sort of pander to the general audience because of money to make such a beautiful word on the other hand without that money we wouldnt be witnessing that spectacle on the big screen quite a conundrum its such an intriguing universe but the more i read about it the more im surprised it was greenlit like can a director refuse to continue the story even if its hugely successful studio would get a new director and it would be a disaster id imagine,2024-03-27 06:46:44
" i dont think they adequately explained that shields attract worm 

in part one paul asks why they cant shield the harvesters and lietkyens explains it    

shields a death sentence in the desert  it attracts the worms and drives them into a killing frenzy   

so there is some explanation for that portion  

  also in part two immediately before the sardaukar get hit with the projectiles when they land on the rock the leader says something about shields implying they knew not to use them while on the sand but they start dying before being able to turn them on      

the lasgun with duncans copter came up a lot in discussions when the first film came out  there was some theories that the rockets that hit and showed the shields protecting the craft in fact disabled them since they look like they almost fizzle out and it briefly cuts to an alarm in the cockpit right after they hitbut there is definitely nothing that specifically goes over the lasgun  shield interaction for anyone who hasnt read the books",2024-03-04 02:26:16
" in the 2nd movie we have a melee attack on a harvester with a rocket that chani shoots exploding against a thopter shield but then during the opening paul created by baiting the thopter to shoot the shield has reactivated and yet the projectile is slowly forcing its way through ok a bit weird

i think the implication here is that the rocket is already partially through the shield sort of stuck in between layers of it and thus manages to push through because it is going slow enough when caught inside like the darts in the first movie",2024-03-04 05:29:28
nothing about the greenlighting of the lotr movies makes any sense but im still glad it happened peter jackson somehow managed to convince the studio of all that and to place that kind of responsibility in him when his biggest movie prior was a horror comedy that flopped at the box office with a budget of 26 million whereas iirc lotr was about 100 million each,2024-03-09 15:49:50
"i can only assume the movie will start with the space guild telling all the other houses to  or be stuck on their own planets without spice and without an economythis is a great plot point in the books you learn early on which i feel they totally ignored in the movies

there was no word about it in movies,2024-03-03 20:46:33
well there is a difference you’re incorrect people can watch wherever they want i don’t care but few people have an imax screen in their house and that is different experience do you realize that ,2024-03-02 15:07:59
i really don’t agree,2024-03-02 14:59:43
they can at least put the deleted scenes as an extra on the physical release though,2024-03-03 05:17:50
i get that but for a book adaptation like dune where a lot had to be cut purely it seems for runtime it seems like a no brainer to release an extended cut even if it isnt a better movie a lot of book fans would love it if nothing else,2024-03-01 15:32:10

i just also wouldnt be surprised if some audio wizardry was used to boost an already great voice performance into godtier

both can be true basically stellans compliment could have been genuine and deserved and some digital filters in post could have also been used

even something as simple as boosting the bass frequencies would technically count and would get butler closer to stellans naturally deeper timber

in any case it was  phenomenal in the theater and thats what really matters i just enjoy speculating",2024-03-01 22:21:43
i also read that austin butler had to take languageacting coach to help him stop sounding like elvis for shooting masters of the air,2024-03-03 17:23:39
"you may be thinking of this where stellan says austin studied his films and it surprised him the first time he did it

also heres austin himself explaining whyhow he decided to do it that way
 then it dawned on me that he wouldve grown up with the baron and the baron being the one who has the most power and how we end up soaking in through osmosis those traits of people that we grow up with but particularly those that we admire in some way

 i was working with tim monich whos sort of the godfather of dialect coaches and he helped me to really hone in on stellans voice and what he does in the film it is also just figuring out how his childhood shapes him into who he becomes when youre raised in brutality you have a necessity for violence in order to be able to survive so i think that ends up changing the way that his mind is",2024-03-05 17:47:45

"they did the sun rising over the desert thing as well  except this time with the two moons eclipsing it into a batman sign 

which actually makes me question we saw the eclipse in the first sequence and then again the next day as well a bit weird to have two eclipses that soon or i might have missed something",2024-03-03 10:10:44

they wanted to create an alliance with the fremen to use them to fight their war against the harkonnens the arteides did treat the fremen better than their former occupiers because they saw them as a resource rather than a nuisance,2024-03-04 20:52:32
in the end the atreidies takes all the pride and autonomy from the fremen and they become theme park attractions essentially what the us did to the native hawaiians they have a green arrakis but they no longer have a fearsome survival culture and instead play act as their fearsome ancestors for tourist dollars in the further future but before that the atreidies uses them to genocide their enemies,2024-03-04 08:39:51

also the movie is not a carbon copy of the book the way it is directed and visually presented to us will obviously tell a slightly different story than the original book they managed to add some relevant parallels for the times",2024-03-05 05:20:18

seemed like he didnt have the option the staff wanted to stop the fight when they learned one of them wasnt drugged and it was the barron who set it all up to finally testunleash his nephew,2024-03-01 08:05:41
"he did that because its how the fights are done rather than it being what he wants he relished the chance to fight the atreides fighter without drugs or shield its not really about honor for him though its all about pleasure straining his limits proving just how good of a fighter he is being in a true life or death duel is exhilarating to him while the show matches are boring

hes a psycho that enjoys danger",2024-03-02 09:06:38
eh its heavily implied in the book that its custom and feyd wouldnt actually be allowed a real fight not at that scale at least,2024-03-03 22:32:47

real commodus vibes,2024-03-09 16:21:19

the film is like the ultimate antireligious statement and it definitely feels right in the zeitgeist it exists in",2024-03-17 17:54:57

the closest to a setback there was was when the fremen were attacked but it wasn’t dwelled on very long and the only character lost was someone we barely knew

i did like the pacing and payoff of arrival it was a mystery movie and the mystery had a satisfying solution i don’t know what payoff dune 2 had besides protagonist beat antagonist

"nah dude… i’m sorry but the argument you’re making is silly not supported by the original novel and it just sort of seems like you’re insisting upon the way that you prefer to understand it  

maybe i did a  job of explaining it  “the voice” is something that only special people can harness  it takes a combination of  gifted talent and dedicated practice… and it certainly functions as a super power but the book explicitly explains that it’s nothing more than a nearperfect understanding of verbal communication

that’s what makes it so cool  it’s not like any was bitten by a radioactive spider  certain people are just that good with their words  

the idea that no one could be so good with words that they could convince other people to  themselves is empirically wrong  it’s happened jonestown that girl that convinced her boy friend to  himself etc

“the voice” is just a theoretical example of how far “the tools of humanity” could go  

it’s not supposed to be a real thing  it’s supposed to be something that makes you deconstruct a specific aspect of human progression  

once upon a time humans just grunted at each other  

nowadays we have complicated language and some people are better at wielding it than others  some people can’t speak to a room full of their classmates some people can stand in front of thousands and convince that crowd to commit heinous acts

dune is just asking you to consider what happens if we keep progressing down that path  it’s asking you to consider the actual function of language  the only reason you say anything outloud is essentially to make or convince people to do things and we’re all capable of “making” people do stuff with just our words

again  i don’t need “the voice” to “make” someone punch me in the face  i don’t need “the voice” to “make” someone call in love with me  say the right  and those things will happen we all do it  it’s how verbal language works  

dune is just turning that grounded fact all the way up to eleven  so yeah if we’re talking about a fictional universe in the deep future where generations of people have dedicated their lives to the mastery of rhetoric… i have no doubt they could make someone  themselves with a few words

ps  you clearly misunderstood the rembrandt analogy  i wasn’t suggesting rembrandt could make you  yourself with an illustration  i was just saying rembrandt could do things with a stylus that many people might consider impossible  we can all pick up a pen but we can’t all use it the way rembrandt did",2024-03-03 01:17:23

basically yes,2024-03-03 20:39:10
itll definitely be a part of the story either the reconciliation or itll further progress their divide leading channi to lead the war against paulive only read the first book like seven years ago so i dont know how far off base i could be,2024-03-02 14:27:59
"i don’t think it’s that big of an issue they will presumably have an entire third movie to explore the complexity of chani and paul’s relationship and i actually found it to be a cool choice to make it a bit more complicated than it was in the book that line could very well end up in part 3

also in the book paul and jessica teach the fremen the weirding way that the bene gesserit fight so they are the toughest men who could previously match the sardauker now given training

because paul controls the spice he controls space travel the jihad is them picking off planets that resist one by one because the rest of the imperium cant gather and mobilise

the houses refusing the ascendance was a change for the movie in the books the houses accepted but the imperium is just so vast that securing that rule still required killing billions however thats thematically weird to have so many die for so banal a reason  so the houses saying no worked well to set the stage for said holy war",2024-03-01 13:32:19

the explanation for why they are so elite is that they live and survive in a nuclear wasteland but dune is even more brutal and breeds the fremen to be even more elite the harsher the challenges the stronger the warriors and while the sardaukar face a greater trial than any of the great house soldiers the extremes of the arrakis desert are even harsher",2024-03-02 04:18:49
part of the reason the sardakaur are such a strong fighting force is that they are raised and trained on a prison planet with brutal conditions but the desserts of arrakis where the fremen live are even more brutal compared to the fremen the sardaukar are pampered pretty boys just as most of the great houses are compared to the sardaukar,2024-03-03 15:57:38

yeah she seems great im not judging havent actually seen the movie but im a fan of the books and have thought for awhile she would be a good irulan so it was super cool to hear she plays some role in it,2024-03-01 09:30:37

a talking baby would have been a bridge too far for most of the audience not for me i dont know how you do that without getting into look whos talking territory i think theyll age up alia to 78 which isnt as much of a stretch when shes running around all stabby,2024-03-02 02:25:59
from the day paul arrives on dune he is taking advantage of a prophecy that anoints him the messiah and he is trained by some of the best soldiers in the universe a trait the fremen respect more than anything,2024-03-01 18:31:11

no clue  but its not really about audibility i can hear the dialogue just fine i just cant comprehend it because theyre whispering and mumbling and the music is like 10x louder",2024-03-01 23:19:11
some of my favorite scenes in the book are incredulous offworlders being totally stunned by the fremen fighting against sardaukar so im a little biased but its really the only flaw in the adaptation imo,2024-03-01 16:25:47
in the film the harkonnen soldiers are downright scary even though they are defeated pretty easily and quickly but the sardaukar are just well…soldiers,2024-03-16 19:11:00
you have missed something,2024-03-04 05:06:55

someone in the audience at my screening was clutching his hardcover copy this movie must have blown his mind,2024-03-01 03:42:19
did this movie end where the first book does it felt like that couldn’t be the case to me because i assumed it was more or less a complete story but this was very much a middle entry like empire strikes back,2024-03-01 04:17:08
do the 2 movies cover the first book,2024-03-01 06:33:59
"lisan al gaib were going to space
",2024-03-01 15:56:06
thats exactly what the fremen want though its their main desire for the lisan al gaib to make dune green again,2024-03-18 14:04:33
make new culture beats living like a rat,2024-03-16 17:20:59
in the book paul learns of his sons death right before the raid on arakeen happens i didnt read it as having changed paul at all but showed that he was so far gone that even the death of his child couldnt pull him off of his path,2024-03-03 03:13:00
do imperial years  earth years maybe so but the movie doesn’t say that i can handwave all day,2024-03-04 00:21:56
i’m all for actors trying against their type though now i’m wondering how he’d do in a role like that,2024-03-05 20:35:05
disagree that was my favorite part,2024-03-03 06:31:39
you could also just cast someone else they dont have to be locked into her just because of a 2second cameo,2024-03-01 07:05:58

its everything after children where things get tough",2024-03-01 15:32:18
in my defense its late here,2024-03-01 04:27:28
as terrible as it is to say shes behind a viel almost the entire time she could be recast difficult to replace her presence though,2024-03-12 03:42:13

he is the messiah and a very naughty boy,2024-03-01 14:05:08

"they became a powerful faction by the empire and emperor’s chief enforcer nearly infinite resources at their disposal it doesn’t get better than that 

stilgar for example went from desert hobo to one of the richest man in the universe and lived comfortable life

its quite telling by  emperor any semblance of their “hardship culture” have been lost since they just got what they need than sand",2024-03-02 23:16:58
that is not really something that happens in messiah tho,2024-03-02 06:10:01
no worries because thats not in the book,2024-03-02 07:13:31
its also far shorter of a novel than the 1st its a nice landing point for a trilogy,2024-03-03 21:34:49

i havent read the dune books but worm is one of my favorite things ever and watching dune part 2 earlier tonight i kept thinking man paul is basically contessa but even better this is  tight,2024-03-02 08:09:12
thats very accurately put haha,2024-03-27 09:03:03
in the books its a bit better laid out how he became emperor for revenge and self preservation but once obtained the fremen just kind of continue on to secure his place paul resists the golden path the narrow path he talks about in the movie because he knows that path leads into a jihad that is out of his control but in his name the book is literally just a warning against religious zealotry although it doesnt really do the best job,2024-03-02 16:39:21
its more that hes set down a path that will lead to the fremen purging humanity with a massive interstellar jihad even if he gets killed in the war or in the duel at the end theyll carry on in his name even if he is dead and he wont be around to have any control over it his threats to destroy the spice are an alternative path in the book that are meant to be serious enough to be even worse than a war killing untold billions as it would effectively end interstellar travel and reduce humanity to isolated pockets to waste away,2024-03-02 16:55:59
yes,2024-03-03 18:36:02
hmm could  movie shadow id love it if so but i feel like hed be outta paramounts price range at this rate maybe if they booked him before this lol,2024-03-01 16:46:01

oh wow i guess alexander is the one that really took after his dad,2024-03-06 15:34:38
well hes younger than revenant mother pauls ma so i dont really understand how he could be her dad,2024-03-02 23:28:21
you got it apparently there was hawat footage deleted from the final cut which is really too bad i don’t usually care about scenes cut from movies since they often just trim the  and help with pacing but dune is so massive let me have it lol,2024-03-01 14:44:32
that was my biggest issue he did such a great job showing the distinction between arrakis kaitain and caladan that i was genuinely shocked there was no standoutpsychedelic contrast to the visions and what we were shown in them but i’ll live,2024-03-01 03:53:02
if you’re a big reader w adhd and loved the movies you are in for such a treat with the books just get one with a really cool cover so you’re incentivized to keep grabbing it ,2024-03-01 14:30:01
it seemed like there were zero moments where i thought to myself “ah they’re explaining things to the audience right now” in these movies they didn’t hit you over the head with it and somehow still delivered the info pretty clearly,2024-03-01 04:34:01
the samurai practice of tsujigiri testing new blades by killing innocent passersby was immediately what i thought of during feyds introduction,2024-03-08 03:09:30
i just did a search through the text of messiah and i couldnt find anything about that even so i think that its important that the audience be able to recognize him so even if he was meant to be younger i could see keeping the casting,2024-03-01 20:34:20
did you even read the books the movie tries to make the point but herbert hammers home that all of this is due to fanaticism and blind devotion to charismatic leaders like paul the jihad is a consequence of all of this,2024-03-06 20:30:38
it was a little strange but then again he just had to walk across the desert and back  not the most exciting test,2024-03-01 14:46:33
"ah i know where i misunderstood i had assumed the prophecy was all a lie to mislead the fremen which is partly true i forgot that the end goal was to provide a messiah for them they just don’t want it to be paul

i was confused on how much the prophecy is actual prophecy and how much of it was “fake”in order to control fremen

thanks for taking the time to respond",2024-03-02 21:28:04
so you bring up a movie that won the make up and hairstyle award good job,2024-03-06 19:06:01
wow so you can more forward and backward in time but you still risked it at taco bell i guess some things are worth the risk in life ,2024-03-17 22:54:07
yeah i grew up with them too even watching them 20 years later i can still enjoy them rose tinted glasses and all that maybe force awakens was great but man last jedi and ros honestly made me despise star wars for a few years until i tried the clone wars,2024-03-01 23:42:39
well either way a movie should be judged on its own and sadly i found there were pacing issues with the final result although understandable considering the source material not all may agree with that of course and thats fine,2024-03-02 02:31:45
"agreed about butler 

it’s insane to me people that people are suggesting such a thing in a year where the acting nominations are so strong emma stone sandra huller cillian murphy paul giamatti… all vastly superior performances than anything in these films and i really like bardem’s and ferguson’s 

and yeah the relationship was very poorly done absolutely zero chemistry between them",2024-03-03 05:45:46
"yeah that’s my recurrent complaint about chalamet i can tell that he tries very hard and gives it his all but he can’t quite manage to embody a character

yes it was a backhanded insult towards anya tj her acting doesnt impress me and the plastic surgery to make her beautiful irritates me even more 

have you ever seen photos of priscilla presley that is what atj is heading towards if they do another dune movie she aint gonna look the way she looks now cosmetic surgery looks awful when time passes

haha that was funny but still i don’t see gurney trying to “fight his way out” either,2024-03-02 03:28:15
i see so thats why in the second part its such a surprise just how many fremen there are in the south i suppose the bribing paid off for them in more ways than they wouldve expected i love how it all comes together,2024-03-19 05:42:17
"i guess we are just going to alone on this one  

you listed out all of my unanswered questions they make me feel like this isn’t a satisfying ending 

it’s weird that both movies end with paul fighting a duel and then someone else saying that this is the beginning",2024-03-01 04:37:15
"not op but i share his opinions regarding the climax the whole twist on a heros journey wouldve worked too had we gotten 1015 mins after the throne room scene to reflect and realize the gravity of pauls actions and how the fremen fanaticism will lead to death and despair 

ending it on that dark note wouldve hammered home the point of the dangers of fanaticism and prophecy but we didnt really get any of that so the payoff wasnt really there whichever way you look at it",2024-03-01 21:42:14
" was clearly explained to paul in part one that this was a result of bene gesserit propaganda go watch the  movie instead of basing your arguments on recap videos

yeah i understand that now my apologies  i had just thought that you were saying it was obviously implied by the things you did mention which were not just the literal scene where his mam tells him explicitly that its propaganda i get that now my mistake i wasnt trolling just genuinely didnt grasp what you were saying

btw i cant believe that you keep handwaving away any war with that level of bloodshed the religious brainwashing of an entire native people by foreigners etc as nothing bad

this war doesnt happen in the film and its not made clear by the film alone that a war with untold levels of bloodshed will actually happen its only because of the books that you know this is true theres nothing in the film to suggest that pauls premonitions will definitely come true and it certainly seems like his premonition after drinking the worm juice has shown him a new piece of knowledge that causes him to reassess his aversion to these visions 

i accept that religious brainwashing is bad but he rejects trying to do this until he gets the vision which seems to show he needs to do it i think its fair to say that the film implies he has noble intentions",2024-03-21 14:57:38
"maybe i got in wrong  then   
what does this scene suupose to tell us  though  that feyd is cruel  we got that on many occasions already",2024-03-05 07:02:29
" like what did those visions of skeletal people crawling  groaning on a cracked desert floor mean anything good to you especially when you couple it with pauls obviously horrified response to it

they definitely dont mean anything good obviously but they dont specifically mean that he has seen the fremen perish because paul follows his specific premonitions

i think a lot of the rest of this comment is touching on other points ive made in the other comment so well leave it for there",2024-03-21 11:29:49
how is it poorly done exactly the stakes were incredibly clear,2024-03-03 07:02:50
"white boi timmy saved the fremen from the harkonnens and the emperor its a white saviour movie even wikipedia agrees lol

the sequel to dune changes that",2024-03-03 08:35:05
he still becomes a white savior regardless if it was real or fake,2024-03-04 11:45:01
appreciate the time,2024-03-01 08:12:08
the bene gesserit girl literally says that the fights are always rigged in his favor and they talk about stopping the fight then after he kills the non drugged guy he goes and complains to the baron about trying to  him he even threatens to drown the baron in the pool for it maybe we watched different movies because it made him look weak as ,2024-03-05 03:54:02
our context level as the audience is the movie we shouldnt need to have the read the book to know that atomics are prohibited,2024-03-14 18:38:24
ignorance is bliss,2024-03-24 21:00:13
but that is also what makes messiah interesting its a complete flip from the start with a plot to  him right off the bat and none of the changes of the movie do anything to drive home that point  borrowing those themes for this movie makes no sense if his jihad hasnt started yet hes just another really talented fremen fighter who pushes to a position of power in a society based on the strongest leading  if anything it makes it worse since theres maybe two shots of him contemplating what his actions will lead to then he just shows up and generic action hero fashion and kills the baron and feyd and saves the day anyway and it didnt really feel framed that it was a selfish thing,2024-03-02 21:27:11
ok man lol,2024-03-06 18:29:44
i had no idea someone becomes a worm my friend told me they’ll prob stop making dune movies after messiah because they become crazy after that and is that what he meant lol,2024-03-03 07:30:16
thank you i think you’re definitely right i think my interpretation was clouded by me wanting to believe paul is a good guy despite and also because of reading the books,2024-03-20 06:52:30
"yeah i think part 3 adapting the second novel is a safe bet the second novel is shorter and plays out like something from the godfather only real issue is theres not much action in it its more of a political conspiracy thriller but it would make a good movie 


i dont think any of the changes will fundamentally change the story characters have some different or more fleshed out personalities but events can still easily follow the books",2024-03-06 09:22:40
either way this wasnt clear in the movie and should have been explained better or dropped howd they move the atomics on the backs of worms,2024-03-06 02:07:16
so i thought all those prophecies were laid by the bg but it seems there was a prophecy about paul not only drinking the water of life but also being revived by the tears of chani,2024-03-14 15:40:06
"whitebread reddit users when their precious dune isnt that good

youre arguing that justin fields should have been drafted by the broncos youre clearly mentally unwell",2024-03-02 22:34:39
" i have not read the books so i cant really comment on the specifics

you cant really comment on any aspect of whether the movies are successful adaptations of the books except whether the movies are coherent and intelligible stories in their own rights

 for the movie i honestly dont see how this has somehow obliterated the themes of the novel

yeah because you dont understand the novels

the important thing is that this development now contradicts elements of the movies themselves  the spice is no longer the key to controlling the universe as it is presented multiple times in the films including the very beginning of this film because paul seized control of the spice yet the great houses defy him

more importantly if atomic weapons were the key to seizing control of the spice any of the great houses could have done so  including the harkonnens who held control of arrakis

not only was this change a bad idea in itself  which im not going to bother arguing with people who havent read the original novel  it creates a massive plot hole  the saudarkar mean nothing against the massed forces of the entire imperium  thats an aspect of the originals preserved in these films  and possessing the ability to destroy the spice is the ultimate motivation to surrender  having armies in orbit is useless if the guild wont cooperate and the guild is terminally addicted to the spice

so why didnt the harkonnens ever attempt to seize the throne while they held arrakis in fief",2024-03-06 20:12:40
"why no it doesnt shine through because all of the elements where that theme existed were removed from the story

stilgar is no longer slowly converted from an independent leader and thinker to a creature of the lisan algaib hes a devout believer who pushes paul into a religious role from the beginning

we dont have the increasingly fanatical fremen becoming increasingly brutal to the point that guerney hallack is disturbed when he realizes that his former pupil is muaddib the vicious warleader  we dont get him rebuking paul for abandoning the atreides code

we dont have paul either failing to foresee the death of his firstborn son or choosing to accept it as part of the price he must pay for selecting a future that leads to victory  that entire plotline is eliminated as pauls stay with the fremen no longer occurs over years but a few months

in short we dont actually get any of the elements from the novels that herbert used to illustrate that fanatical devotion to a leader both religious and secular was a terrible thing  we dont get pauls despair at realizing that it doesnt matter whether he lives or dies the jihad isnt something he can control

the greatest overarching message of the novel explored in its appendices is that every group and faction that imagined itself in control of their plans and their situations were deluding themselves and were merely parts of a greater plan they didnt even imagine

thats gone too",2024-03-06 19:33:32

it could be the lens that they decided to shoot that particular shot with different lenses will make your face wider thinner etc,2024-03-10 01:35:12
right so just because it was in the book doesnt mean it has to be in the movie which was your whole point,2024-03-03 21:59:05
yes daddy you’re right,2024-03-02 22:47:47
yea i don’t get this either if paul told them i thought they would side with him seems like he didn’t really tell them what the emperor did,2024-03-04 10:29:41
the houses were pretty agreeable after the holy war in the books,2024-03-07 00:18:26
pauls not a villain but hes not a hero either he clearly has his back against the wall but a true hero probably wouldnt go through with the revenge plot knowing it kills billions one of the main themes is the nature of fate paul can see the past and future but hes effectively locked into a single path he either gives up and dies or billions of people die,2024-03-04 00:04:56
lol sure im the messiah too,2024-03-17 23:48:43
like psychohistory from the foundation that makes paul the mule,2024-03-04 14:53:08
i think this all makes great sense but i don’t know what to make of that scene when paul got to the south and was announcing himself and rallying the freman in that big cave room in that scene it seemed like he spoke prophetically to two freman one at a time who then fell to their knees in belief how does that scene square with this interpretation ,2024-03-31 04:52:46
wasnt kh always supposed to be a male so despite her defying their wishes of a daughter her having paul still aligns with the overall planprophecy no,2024-03-27 21:40:14

these movies do a poor job of explaining all that theyve barely mentioned the guild and havent shown a navigator yet yet the guild were very important at the end of the first book for how paul took over because of their reliance on the spice and their monopoly on space travel",2024-03-07 04:51:51
did you read the books  coming at it with the background information filled some of the gaps  i really thoroughly enjoyed the film but a few more establishing scenes would have been helpful  i dont disagree with the decision to focus more of the humandrama and less on the scifi details,2024-03-07 01:43:24
i think paul already has an innate talent to see the future since he already see visions before going to arrakis in part 1 the spice only enhances his visions some select few bene gesserits has that power and paul is only one of the candidates he is special in a sense that he is the only male bg also the bgs only say that men cant survive the blood of life because they want theirs to be female which causes this whole thing thats only my interpretation as a nonbook reader,2024-03-07 05:04:55
"im not judging what makes for a good story its just logically there is no necessary contradiction between the bad faith actors and divine or transcendent plan in addition even a deterministic universe wouldnt even bar autonomy either but thats a debate for a different subject 

its just you made it seem as its an obvious deception thus foregoing the possibility of interpretation as prophecy in my opinion the richness of the story is the ambiguity and questioning whether its actually a prophecy or just a deceptive ideology",2024-03-24 21:22:37

"i think in both books paul is a slightly unreliable narrator which is ironic for an omniscient character  he does a lot of oh noooo i once again have to do the thing that benefits me the most type of thinking  i definitely agree he does a lot of hand wringing about it but i take that with a grain of salt and think its partially   paul talks up a big game about how the atreides arent like the other houses and then he plays the exact same game just as ruthlessly as everyone else

denis is really doing a good job of making it clear that this is not a happy ending and that paul is the worst thing that ever could have happened to the fremen  i think choosing to shift chani to the skeptical role was a really good choice and itll be interesting to see if he can sweet talk her back to his side while he destroys her people in the exact way that shes predicting",2024-03-03 12:24:53
"iirc from the books paul is basically stuck in his role as the savior of the fremen he can’t stop it after a certain point and the reasons kind of start to shift for him at first they have mutual goals he wants to avenge his house and destroy the harkonnens and the fremen want arrakis to be liberated and these happen to be the same thing he does care about the fremen though sort of 

but because arrakis is the most valuable planet in the galaxy the moment he liberates all the political intrigues kick up to gain control over it again which means it’s not exactly liberated which is fuel for the jihad the fremen believe in without paul to guide them the fremen lose their liberation without the fremen paul has no army which is the whole reoccuring reticence he has about going south he ends up being right since nobody has a shot against his omniscience so he’s kind of just stuck having to conquer the entire galaxy in order to preserve what he believes in

now i’m really rusty it’s been like a decade since i read the books and this next part i’m even rustier on but i believe at a certain point he kind of grows disillusioned with it the fremen are zealots and ultimately they never stop pursuing their goal paul gets tired of being this political messianic warlord and eventually just gives up and wanders off into the desert

however his kids tho…",2024-03-09 19:56:48
these were my thoughts exactly i was very surprised  felt it was inconsistent with his character to go south the paul up to that point in the story seemed like he’d rather die while having a nice relationship with chani more so than he’d rather live but as a messianic warlord without chani,2024-03-17 19:12:28
"shes clearly going to play the same role despite being a different character what paul did was for movie chani as well as beating feyd raytha and movie paul thats down the golden path would 100 manipulate because he has no choice thats my point

prejihad movie paul wouldnt care about being emperor and wouldnt care about taking irulans hand hed just go off into the desert with chani but he cant because this is the path he has to take so prejihad and postjihad paul do different things",2024-03-02 10:39:44

yep definitely also i loved the double throwback of i recognize your footsteps old man also gurneys emotionally twitching face when paul shows the ducal signet just that shot of a couple seconds served a big purpose it reminded us of the atreides family and what it meant to so many people and how gurney saw it live on in paul because the atreides house is kind of forgotten when were just getting so deep in the fremen stuff,2024-03-01 22:32:32

"what plan do you mean the whole bene gesseritkwisatz haderach mission or specifically her personal goals in part 2 i think she mainly just wants to guide paul to unlock his full potential not necessarily to avenge house atreides or seize political power just as part of the job of parenting a unprecedentedly superpowered kid

that would be a good thing if he was heading on a heroic path but the bad vibes you got from her are a red flag that this isnt that kind of story hence the end of the film where he embraces the holy war jihad in the books that he was so terrified by visions of in the first film",2024-03-08 17:45:59

"i disagree i thought it was pretty clear paul was having visions of possible futures and didnt want to be responsible for the deaths of millions but as the harkonnens continued to attack them he began to run out of options paul wanted revenge but he was trying to avoid too many deaths 

his visions convinced him to drink the blue water which made his visions clearer and he saw the only paths to victory and like his mother the water seemed to change him making him more ruthless and aggressive",2024-03-06 00:40:16
given the movies length denis was probably forced to cut every possible seconds he could,2024-03-05 10:31:28
i thought he knew his mum was dangerous before the water it was clear to both him and chani what was going on he was seeing his mum in his visions he essentially just resigns himself to it in the end though,2024-03-03 17:23:59
"the movie is choppy as  one scene you have been poisoning the people spreading your evil stories soon after to gurney go south protect my mother thats an order 

i have not seen in 6 hours of this story where paul realizes its the bgs he has to deal with not this house or that and hes offered to marry another bg  he may enjoy his expanded role but hes still just playing a role orchestrated by someone else",2024-03-05 12:09:09
"why exactly hes now determined to go to war with the whole galaxy isnot shown 

its kind of implied just on how big feudal societies like that work the spice must flow and the wolves are ever at the gates weakness of your own house leads to its death if the fremen arent absolute masters of arrakis then theyll be made more and more slaves to whoever is if paul and the fremen are going to take the throne they have to go all the way and make the other houses subservient to them

obviously just watching these movies doesnt make that explicit but they do allude to it especially so with a lot of his father duke letos lines about the danger atriedes is in and how he who can destroy a thing has power over it",2024-03-10 03:28:51
except theres no pure atreides blood left right there never was the bgs have been designing and mixing the blood lines for 90 generations i walk away confused why paul thinks hes in any way in control of anything unless he addresses the bgs,2024-03-05 12:33:30
"umatchameetcha is mistaken  the reverend mother literally said she advised the emperor to wipe out atreides because they were defiant and not as easy to control  

in the books its also explicitly stated that the real reason the emperor conspired against the atriedes is because leto inspired love from his people which was more powerful and more dangerous than the loyaltythroughfear the less benevolent houses practiced",2024-03-18 05:48:43
"part one 

lady jessica atreides did you have to go that far

gaius helen mohiam you chose to train him in the way in defiance of our rule he wields our power he had to be tested to the limits so much potential wasted in a male you were told to bear only daughters but you in your pride thought you could produce the kwisatz haderach

lady jessica atreides was i wrong

gaius helen mohiam youre lucky he didnt die in that room if he is the one he has a long way to go his sight is barely awakened and now he goes into the fire but our plans are measured in centuries we have other prospects if he fails his promise

lady jessica atreides do you see so little hope

gaius helen mohiam on arrakis we have done all we can for you a path has been laid lets hope he doesnt squander it

this is made clearer in the books but jessica was supposed to bear only daughters  who could be unified with other houses paul and feyd are around the same age to bring peace 

she decided she knew better had a son and thats what led to the outcome we see  in part two the bg basically seem disgusted by her stubbornness the emperor is fearful of leto especially since he has a son he could marry to his daughter and seize the throne and the atreides are destroyed as a result the bg merely attempt to spirit away jessicapaul to a place where they can be controlled as a final hedge 



 books 
you thought only of your dukes desire for a son the old woman snapped

and his desires dont figure in this an atreides daughter couldve been wed to a harkonnen heir and sealed the breach youve hopelessly complicated matters

we may lose both bloodlines now",2024-03-18 12:45:43
"oh right maybe the idea was that they hoped jessica and paul would if they survive flee as exiles and no longer protected by house atreides would become subservient to bene gesserit

not sure",2024-03-01 15:36:02
"theres probably some conflicting interests here too it isnt like the bene gesserit control is 100 even if theyre very influential we do see in later books that there are other strange groups like this the emperor himself was very concerned about the popularity of the atreides with the other great houses we dont get the full sense of it in the movie other than maybe at the very end but the political arrangement in dune is perhaps a little more like the holy roman empire where all these houses have significant autonomy and influence and meet to vote in a large council setup

ultimately for the bene gesserit its the plans within plans stuff they have multiple bloodlines going because they cant risk their whole plan on any individual when those individuals might do silly things like die in sword fights another scene we didnt get in the movie is lady fenring the woman sent to  feyd discussing all this with her husband who was himself a failed kwisatz haderach so the idea is always that they have lots and lots of prospects theyd probably never prefer anyone of their projects killed off if it could be avoided if for instance jessica had simply been captured during the fall of the atreides perhaps she could have been made to remarry feyd anyway",2024-03-01 16:39:03
i was thinking this exact thing too i now think that they originally planned to eliminate the atreides but in dune 1 there’s the scene where the imperial court comes to caladan to oversee the stewardship of arrakis change there’s a shot where the bene gesserit is watching paul i think that on this scene she sensed paul’s emerging powers and sent for gaius helen mohaium to come test paul i feel like they change there plans on the fly and after seeing paul’s potential they decided that they might be able to control him hence why in the following scene she tells jessica that “a path has been laid don’t squander it” and also later when she asks the baron to spare jessica and paul they also hedge their bets they gave paul and jessica a way out in case they can control him but wouldn’t really care if they died because they have other kwisats haderach prospects,2024-03-01 21:32:18
"this is mostly head canon but it could be simply because the reverend mother asking the baron to spare jessica and paul and declaring them to be under her protection guarantees that they wont wind up in harkonnen hands instead

the bg and the emperor are using the harkonnens for their own purposes but theyre not blind to vladimirs own ruthless ambition the last thing they want is him coming into possession of a bene gesserit who has basically gone rogue and her clairvoyant son weve seen what harkonnens do to their captives and servants after all 

in the first movie we find out that the harkonnens managed to get dr yueh to turn traitor against house attreides by capturing and torturing his wife and possibly turning her into that  up sixlegged antlooking creature who the reverend mother dismisses using the voice when visiting giedi prime what goes unsaid in the movie though is that yuehs wife wanna is actually also a bene gesserit member so if the order are aware that the harkonnens have previously captured one of their own and done horrible twisted things to her possibly learning some of their precious secrets in the process then they have that much more reaosn to not let paul and jessica fall into his hands even if the bg intend to  them right after",2024-03-02 17:50:01
they wanted to eliminate their power base but probably wanted to preserve the genetic line at least until they could get paul to impregnate a bg,2024-03-03 04:21:07
i dont remember if thats how the movie portrayed it but i just read that a few days ago in the book and the doctor yeau i think that betrayed leto to try and save his wife arranged to give paul and jessica a chance it was bonus motivation to use the poison tooth on the baron as a kind of contingency,2024-03-05 03:59:39
sure but the way paul is going rn he isnt the kwisatz haderach they wanted jessica defied orders and while they still had hope for paul as a possible candidate in book one it seems like the path hes on now doesnt really vibe with the bene gesseritt since they cant control him hence abomination hes not the kwisatz haderach they wanted,2024-03-02 11:44:52

realistically speaking they should get cut apart on any planet that isnt arrakis",2024-03-12 03:21:56

the two towers especially suffers because there is almost no action for the first half of the movie you get gandalf falling with the balrog and then there isn’t an action set piece until the warg attack 

rotk has a lot of great added scenes like saruman the mouth of sauron the showdown gandalfs showdown with the witch king gothmog’s death",2024-03-01 14:56:48

visual artists ranging from egon schiele to georgia okeefe have had public showings of hundreds to thousands of variations that they have painted or produced on a single theme sometimes the exact same painting with that many takes

and in terms of more of an exact behind the scenesdirectors cut content there are soooooooooooooo many instances of artists whose notebooks we have and publicly share which show dozens or hundreds of variations on their big artistic works before the final one

maybe they hadnt planned to share those notebooks but in art schools we do share them absolutely

"so in the books there is actually two years time between the attack on the atreides and pauls revenge

what happens during this time is that thufir gets captured by the baron he gets poisoned by the harkonnens who are the only ones with the antidote thus being forced to serve them

still loyal to the atreides but also believing that the entire house has been wiped out he starts to quietly sabotage the harkonnens causing friction between feydrautha and the baron and gets his revenge this way the arena battle in the movie where one of the atreides captives is not properly drugged is part of this

in the end when the fremen attack the throne room he finally discovers paul has survived the baron has a last ditch effort to wipe out the atreides by giving thufir a poisoned needle to stab paul with paul who has foreseen this offers his life and gives thufir this opportunity as reward for his enduring loyalty to house atreides

however thufir ashamed of and blaming himself for letting the initial attack happen instead embraces paul and stabs himself giving his life for the atreides one last time

its a very powerful scene but i can see why it was cut as it would have required a lot of set up",2024-03-03 23:39:54
"ah sorry

the other answer is great but it doesnt speak to something left out of the first movie

initially jessica and thufir expect that one another are traitors theres a great exchange where thufir wanted to make an attempt on her life whats nuts about this at least from reading it it happened right before they are attacked

then theres the back and forth that the other comment mentions i would have liked to have seen that but you dont get a great sense of how important mentants are from the movies which again is something i didnt like but it was still good enough",2024-03-04 02:12:01
but where were we shown that if he does not head south supposedly many more millions will die what were we supposed to imply that from,2024-03-05 13:05:01
maybe i missed it but i felt like it was never explained why millions would die why millions had to die there is the one conversation with jessica in the temple about the slim path forward but imo that does not adequately convey or justify what he does next by storming into the circle and saying “im him follow me into battle” probably intentionally it doesn’t show that there is no choice why must he embrace the messiah role why can’t he use his powers to forge another path he should have had a discussion with chani his partner but also most vocal opponent to the fundamentalists and the prophecy but i think they purposefully don’t so we are more scared of paul which seems to be herbert’s original intent,2024-03-04 18:14:38
nah you’re wrong i just rewatched the scene paul visually demonstrates it to warm up he swings his knife at his own arm a few times and the shield activates when he swings fast but not when he does it more slowly a few seconds later gurney literally says “the slow blade penetrates the shield” from that a viewer can infer that a projectile faster than any sword swing would also activate the shield it’s true they don’t spend a lot of time explaining it,2024-03-09 03:00:13

both the poison dart and the bombs slow down when they meet the shield not because of the shield but the design its an interesting situation as a viewer because its a very did i just see that happen intentionally or well thats weird moment,2024-03-15 14:48:29
yeah i like what they did in the movie with the baby then no need for unrealistic things,2024-03-02 20:46:53
"memories of all women in her genetic line leading up to her

she sticks him with a gom jabbar,2024-03-04 00:14:07
"they weren’t sniping with lazguns it was some sort of projectile you never saw a beam 

it’s also heavily implied the explosion happens at both at the shield and at the lazgun you both die every time at the minimum and probably everyone around both of you there’s no cover or protection from that besides spacing your troops far apart from your laz gunner

the shieldlazgun setup of the dune universe is a cool way to allow for hand to hand fighting as well as the navigator ban on space fighting but it makes tactical storytelling difficult because people end up doing illogical things there should be way more projectile weapons when out in the desert since in many cases using a shield will put you at risk of worms elsewhere in the universe they’d be useless because people will just be shielded all the time the worms change the math",2024-03-10 13:36:01
well that makes some sense i guess,2024-03-04 15:15:50

" not only does the guild have rules against space combat but you cant use those lasers against a shield and survive the impact of a lasgun against a shield creates a nuclear explosion

"yes but how would you do it 

denis villeneuve is obviously not a fan of exposition and i really appreciate how he handled things in two whole movies it feels like we got 5 minutes of exposition we obviously got a lot more than that but its used so sparingly  just a line here or there

with that approach  and it being an important reason the movies worked imo  how do you do a dinner scene that is 95 internal dialogue

the only options i can think of are either through a ton of flashbacks adding a bunch of cheesy dialogue or literally hearing peoples internal dialogue i dont see options 2 or 3 as viable and option 1 probably results in a 30min scene to be done well",2024-03-05 20:40:39
i respect it but i hate it too,2024-03-04 06:03:48
thanks for finding that quote that was very cool to read,2024-03-08 23:43:28
"i want the movie to be well liked by a mainstream audience it might get more people to read the books  which are fantastic and so deep so im ok with the compromises so far

i think the next movie 2nd book will be very challenging you can read conversations 10x and still get more out of them its pretty insane really and i think book 4  emperor will be almost impossible not sure about book 3 children of dune planning to reread it soon just going through messiah again denis seems to agree as ive seen him say after book 2 it just gets way too out there for a general audience if studio execs read book 3 and 4 i doubt theyd greenlight anything with much of a budget 

where are you up to in the books planning to read all of the original series",2024-03-27 08:40:08
"all good points forgot the lietkynes part  thx

like i said i love the movies and think hes walked a good line here between info  visual effects  truth to the source material

theres a couple minor things that i think would end up being a bit unclear for a smart audience who havent read the books but i can absolutely see an argument that the exposition needed to cure that wouldnt be worth it",2024-03-04 02:36:15
"oh i get it its just inconsistent we saw bombsrockets penetrating ship shields in the first movie by slowing down and pushing through

this was some freakshow hybrid where it was doing that because paul got the thopter to shoot but it was multiple seconds between when it last shot and when chani fired the rocket let alone the travel time that all couldve been much tighter or just have the rocket do its thing thats consistent with the first movie

no biggie but its definitely a bit stranger that it needed to be",2024-03-04 06:08:01
the guild doesnt have the power  its a major plot point in dune that the guild consistently chooses the safe path that doesnt seize power for themselves but that route results in stagnation  theyre so risk adverse that seeing the future ends up being a weakness and they atrophy to the point where they are a parasite on the imperium but they can never actually gain control of it,2024-03-03 12:12:13
what are the two dudes at the end of the first book not navigators but just guildsmen,2024-03-01 21:55:30
"there are two navigators at the final scene of the book they are the ones that paul makes the threat of destroying all spice production to

the guildsman seemed to stare into space for a moment then yes you could do it but you must not  

ahhh paul said and nodded to himself guild navigators both of you eh  
  
yes",2024-03-03 03:05:29
interesting i didnt like them being shown so early in the lunch version,2024-03-01 22:02:34
"paul said that because the ability to destroy a thing is the ultimate power over it the guild accepting paul’s ability to destroy the spice not with nukes that’s ridiculous now anybody can hold the spice hostage from space is what gives him power over the spice and therefore the imperium not the emperor’s kindness 

in the movie the landsraad refuses to accept his rule sparking immediate jihad at paul’s command but this is nonsensical the guild and landsraad would never do anything to jeopardize the production of spice and it also shows that paul was bluffing and his ability to destroy the spice is actually irrelevant because he won’t do it and the jihad was not commanded by paul to gain control of the imperium it was launched by fremen beyond paul’s control the jihad is the unstoppable death and destruction that paul fears though in the movie he is its’ principal instigator 

if paul has to gain power by the sword what is when the point of marrying irulan the political machinations of the dune universe utterly fall apart in the second movie leaving a messy chaotic and nonsensical story in its wake",2024-03-01 16:50:05

yeah it’s definitely a neat visual effect and dune science is always kind of fantasy anyway so it doesn’t bother me it’s just fun to try to think of ways to explain it,2024-03-01 22:28:51
you will absolutely see a navigator in part three in particular one called edric who conspires with gaius mohiam irulan and the bene tleilaxu to dethrone paul im not explaining the tleilaxu for you simply due to how awesome they are you can discover them for yourself  ,2024-03-11 16:57:52
my take is that duke leto had more pure intentions than that he valued their culture and so does paul he wanted an alliance based on mutual respect and benefit to share the planet jessica on the other hand just wanted to use the fremen as a resource for war unfortunately for the duke that philosophy gets you killed in the dune universe paul only steamrolled when he realizes through his visions that he has to tap his harkkonnen side so you are right that the atreides wanted to use the fremen as a resource but not initially and it is only because of personal revenge rather than political power,2024-03-04 22:49:58
"what major middle east conflicts was the us involved in before 1965 the us was fairly isolationist before the second world war and shortly after they only really cared about stopping the spread of communism recency bias is a form of bias 

however i do see extremely strong parallels with european colonization in the americas i think you’re right about that emperor representing the pope pope allocated spain and portugal land based on the papal line each house representing a different european empire the femen representing the natives etc not everything is about the us we’re not that important",2024-03-05 12:10:20
but he was super upset upon finding out he had a pretty big confrontation to the baron afterwards about not knowing about it,2024-03-01 15:45:34

he wasn’t truly  he was just acting like it,2024-03-04 13:32:38
well the harkonens are a bunch of  assholes in the books so in that sense the movie actually elevated feyd slightly in the book when hes about to lose he says a keyword that the atredies fighter is conditioned to respond to that makes him pause and then he kills him,2024-03-12 01:33:31
yeah the blade is poisoned in the book and also during his birthday duel in the book paul needs to do a poison transmutation midfight,2024-03-01 14:42:22
honestly didn’t realize butler was 32,2024-03-02 11:16:57

decapitated whole big thing we had a funeral for a worm,2024-03-10 06:50:49
the funny thing is that feyd in the book tries repeatedly to  the baron through some very duplicitous underhanded schemes in order to seize power prematurely lol like i vaguely recall something like sending the baron a pretty boy  with a mole on his thigh vladimir is a  in the book that had some kinda poison gas or microexplosive implanted inside that would go off and  the baron when he touched it,2024-03-02 18:04:41
to each their own man but i thought butler had an amazing performance great psycho villain,2024-03-03 03:33:18
its a logical consequence of his powers both in the book and movie if he can see infinite possible futures then hes actually met with and spoke with everyone heard their confessions including as an alternate reality mahdi but in a path that didnt eventually lead to victory the later books make it clear just how absolutely perfect his future visions can be and that he can remember them down to being blind and still knowing where everybody is,2024-03-14 06:51:18
at this point his prescience is nearly perfect and he also has the ancestral knowledge of the fremen after taking the water of life so he can both see the future and remember everyones past,2024-03-27 09:52:35
"the harkonnens knowledge of the fremen barely scratched the surface their estimative of their population was wrong by millions the only reason they were attacking so far south was because they were searching for atreides

they wouldnt have died by the millions and have their culture extinct if paul didnt colonize them for his holy war",2024-03-03 08:36:53
shes doesnt just fall in line with paul like everyone else in the book she has a moral compass questions pauls decisions and feels betrayed when paul breaks his word movie spells it out pretty much in your face,2024-03-01 22:01:21
in fact it ends up being even too much for paul,2024-03-03 07:45:24
this one’s not even the golden path that one’s much much worse,2024-03-04 00:11:36
totally fair i think these changes do a good job of capturing the intent of the source material while giving her character more agency and seeding plot points for the next installment but it is a departure for sure,2024-03-03 04:23:55
they gladly make that sacrifice to survive and thrive they become the most powerful group of people in the universe they follow paul by choice not by force,2024-03-01 10:44:26
im not arguing the result is good for the galaxy on the contrary the user above argued it was a bad outcome for the fremen and on that count i believe theyre wrong the fremen have lived thousands of years in oppression can you really tell them that theyre wrong to want to fight their oppressors until paul arrived they didnt have the tools necessary to fight back he provided those its a prototypical messianic fundamentalist story,2024-03-02 14:17:59

"i think an extended discussion of which disney star wars shows are good or not is probably a silly topic for a dune thread but suffice it to say of the 15 or so different disney movies and shows obviously there have been 3 or 4 that were well regarded but most of their projects have diluted the franchise rather than build it up 

i think the point is more the general vibe of the star wars vs lotr commercialization one has done two unsuccessful adaptions of their source material but you can at least tell they were trying their best

the other one essentially sold their soul to disney who’s milking it for every drop they can seems pretty obvious to me that there’s a difference but that’s opinion of course",2024-03-13 13:43:14

so as a newbie to dune rabban is basically just an incompetent nepo baby right,2024-03-19 21:50:10
this line happens in the movie tbf at one point after reuniting with gurney he asks why paul won’t amass the south as an army to rise up and paul expresses his concerns mentioning that the fremen have gone from friends to worshippers or  words to that effect,2024-03-19 21:51:43
"more than happy to help

so ill only talk about things that are mentioned in the movie or that were entirely left out by this point in the story

1 paul sees possible futures not definite futures
2 in all of his visions where he and jessica survive he becomes the lisan al gaib and this results in a universewide holy war that results in billions of deaths he sees that following jessica to the south is what causes this
3 he is trying to find the narrow way through his visions where he and his mother survive but where he doesnt cause the jihad he wants to prevent the holy war but without him and his mother having to die and the fremen remain oppressed on their own world
4 the reason he goes south is that the water of life can vastly improve his visions their clarity and accuracy  so even though he sees that as the first step towards the jihad he also thinks its the only way to avoid it
5 the problem is that paul cannot see other prescients like him they are invisible to him in the book lady margot fenring the woman who sleeps with feyd has a husband he cant see at all because he was a failed kwisatz haderach  in the movie its strongly hinted that feyd rautha is also partially prescient which makes sense since if you remember the first movie paul was supposed to be born a girl to marry to feyd and their child would be the kiwsatz haderach but jessica disobeyed her orders and had a son because leto wanted a son so badly what this all means is that there are actions by people both living now and to be born in the future who are 100 absent from his predictions so his predictions are inherently inaccurate
6 the one important group left out of the movie is the spacing guild they solely control interstellar travel you cannot travel through space without them everyone has engines that cold fold space and move you faster than light but only the spacing guild has the navigators navigators use the spice to be partially prescient and see the future this way they can avoid planets suns space debris etc that would just annihilate anyone traveling through space  this is why the spice is all important space travel is impossible without it controlling the spice means literally controlling the galaxy 
7 so this brings us all to why its horrific  paul thought that trapping the emperor marrying irulan the emperors daughter and taking singular control of the spice would prevent the jihad if the emperor the spacing guild and all spice production were under his control then everyone would stand down and it would all be over makes sense right and thats what he foresaw everything that happens in the movie is supposed to be the narrow way through the great houses were supposed to capitulate at the endbut they didnt

so now were in a situation where paul is trying to prevent a holy war hes sending his soldiers to go  force the great houses to accept him but hes lost sight of the golden path the narrow way through hes so certain at the end of the movie that getting the landsraad the great houses to accept him will prevent the jihad that he sends stilgar and his fanatics to attack themwhich is the first step of the beginning of the jihad

bring them paradise that paradise is billions dead on every world in the galaxy",2024-03-07 03:53:12

a mentat is a human computer because actual computers are outlawed in the dune universe because of a robot war thousands of years before the events of the bookfilm they have humans perform these calculations themselves but it requires a lot of training thufir and piter in the first movie are both mentats,2024-03-03 19:03:03

"still they cannot convince me or anyone to for example buy an ostrich egg by just walking up to me out of thin air on the walkway and saying buy 

excellence in rhetoric can certainly take someone far but  at the point when you can make someone do something completely against everything they want stand for andor believe in by using one word or a short sentence without and previous priming of the target or any preparations  i do not agree that it can still be called just excellence in rhetoric because youre not using any rhetoric really to achieve your goals

no one can convince anyone to  themselves in one short isolated sentence and i thought i made that clear in my original comment  that its not possible if not connected or without some previous context

in the same way i cannot use rhetoric in the way some of the politicians or philosophers or people who use the power of verbal manipulation on the daily

the power of speech is already powerful as it can literally sway crowds of millions at once among other things 

that is physically not possible for any being there is no frequency that can achieve that and any form of mind manipulation requires a lot of time and effort

edit re silly argument not supported by books  im saying that if its described like that in books then i dont agree with the logic in books and that the book trying to make it seem more logical is making it less realistic ironically as it opens this ability and its explanation to readers scrutiny personally id consider it as an unreliable narrator or not allknowing narrator moment",2024-03-03 13:45:27

why is everyone parroting this nonsensical argument in the entire thread why are your assuming everyone is dumb funny how you excluded yourself studios use the same  logic to make movies dumber and then people cry about exposition and underestimating the audience i like what they have done in the movie some things work in the novel but cant be translated visually but this argument is ",2024-03-02 11:48:39
she was 1617 in the book they can tweak the length of the timeskip 12 isnt an important number they might need a new actor for paul,2024-03-13 12:20:01
brother you are just lying there’s nothing more to it than,2024-03-01 21:44:47
your responses back to me say otherwise but keep going,2024-03-01 21:48:02
dialogue clarity is highly dependent on frequency response of your speakers if you are using built in tv speakers or something similar you could have significant treble rolloff that makes it harder to hear as i said i have watched the 4k bluray of dune a ton of times and have no issues hearing stuff clearly even in the middle of loud music,2024-03-02 00:56:13
yeah it gets weird and bizarre towards the last couple but dune and dune messiah are excellent,2024-03-01 03:35:37
all 6 are great  emperor of dune is my absolute favorite 4th book but the books themselves span roughly 5000 years,2024-03-01 05:52:05
1  3 are paul mainly with leto 2 introduced 4 is jarring but is a ton of peoples favorite in hindsight its basically sci fis marcus aurelius writing meditations 5 and 6 are when herbert goes full space  though miles teg is  awesome 6 ends on a cliffhanger because herbert died his son wrote some stuff using notes to wrap it up but it isnt liked,2024-03-01 07:07:53
first ones good if a bit dry heard wonderful things about messiah but found that even drier and couldnt stick with it after that it goes off the rails after herberts son takes over it really goes off the rails,2024-03-01 03:45:18
3rd and 5th are my favorites,2024-03-01 13:47:33
read the first 3 for sure,2024-03-01 04:41:34
what a  dork,2024-03-01 20:07:35
"yep the book ends in that room right after paul claims the throne it’s extremely abrupt

thing is herbert really wanted dune to be about the danger of charismatic leaders and the cult of personality that forms around them and one of the major vehicles he uses to express that is the religious fundamentalism exhibited by the fremen when they thought they found their messiah 

the end of the first book i think is supposed to come as somewhat of a shock paul exploits these people takes over the imperium and we can assume that the holy war in his name occurs afterward it’s not celebratory there’s no falling action and i suspect that was done with intentionality to leave the reader with a feeling of emptiness

and yet many regarded dune as a cool badass hero’s journey white savior story so herbert then wrote dune messiah the sequel to really beat the audience over the head with the themes he was trying to convey in the first book 

the movie ends in the same spot as the book only with the full 2020 hindsight of knowing what happens in messiah so in that sense the ending of the movie feels a bit more like a cliffhanger than the book does because it’s actively setting up the future that messiah establishes 

in other words dune part 2 the movie feels like the version of the book herbert would have written if he had dune messiah planned from the beginning",2024-03-01 07:22:16

no worries lol but yeah the movies good paul very much is not postwater of life just like in the books refreshing to see them not even try to justify or rationalize his jump into madness been a long time since weve seen that for a nominal hero whos really anything but,2024-03-01 04:31:31
"when she gets older she becomes a very strong fighter so i imagined her having a toned muscular body anya looks like her limbs would snap like a twig if she tried sparring

theres a scene in the book where shes training against robots  drenched in sweat its pretty iconic the dune books have a theme of incredible optimism about the human capacity of our minds and bodies are abilities to learn and become experts at everything from being a human computer fighting to commanding someone with just the inflection of your voice  to me the  alia scene isnt just frank herbert being  its about the athletic perfection of a human body in peak physical form",2024-03-17 17:17:12

"no there is nothing abomination about paul he is exactly who they made him to be completely according to their plan there is no possible reason for a bene gesserit to call him that alia and jessica however are right to be named abomination by the reverend mother and are constantly referred to as that in multiple books

its as though mohiam said jessica and youre arguing that she was addressing paul im sorry that the camera wasnt clear when it cut back to him but hes not an abomination thats a specific term that refers to alia and has nothing to do with paul",2024-03-06 17:44:48
that line was in reference to her feeling paul’s sister,2024-03-02 03:29:37

there was definitely some non book stuff that was unnecessary and that time could have been spent better the biggest flaw in the change was making it all happen over the course of a few months,2024-03-01 05:13:49
so its not necessarily that he becomes power hungry its that the golden path is the only path where he both gets his revenge and survives and since he wants revenge and also to not die he is basically forced to play the part of the messiah in order to walk the golden path,2024-03-02 16:44:41
so essentially once he commits to the golden path he needs to go all in on it in order to get the optimalleast bad outcome and the reason he commits to the golden path in the first place is because its the only way he both gets his revenge and survives so the jihad and becoming the emperor is all something he doesnt really want but he has no choice but to commit to fully in order to get what he does want which is revenge and survival,2024-03-02 17:27:01

"as i wrote before i havent read the books and i understand what he is trying to say but that message rings pretty hollow to me if you have literally the messiah appearing like im not religious but if jesus appeared transforming water into wine then i might become a religious zealot too and i already have a good life cant imagine if i was oppressed like the fremen 


and paul is not a charismatic leader  he is the messiah who can see all past and future how can you now bow to that ",2024-03-07 07:15:14
"again its more about the cut and less about what might have been cut

it also would have been the perfect opportunity to give paul a second moment where he admires one of the kangaroo mice out in the desert it would reminded the audience about them and given paul a serendipitous relationship with the muaddib before he made it his namesake",2024-03-01 14:54:44

"im bringing up a flaw in your counter response yes they deserved that award for makeup but that award doesnt equal  good movie

i invented time,2024-03-17 22:57:50
i dont entirely disagree but i see where the pacing issues come from,2024-03-02 11:43:54
"bardem and ferguson did great i enjoyed all of the performances other than the two leads 

i still have to see anatomy of a fall but seen all of the other nominees i agree with you every single one of those performances are head and shoulders above what we got out of chalamet and zendaya 

by the way oppenheimer is one of my favorite films of the decade thus far cillian expressed so much with his eyes the holdovers is going to be a repeat viewing every christmas season moving forward",2024-03-03 05:48:57
exactly it’s really hard to put into words but i see chalamet rather than a character he is playing i think my favorite performance of his was in bones and all but his frame and  structure really helps to buy into his character of a cannibal drifter in my opinion,2024-03-03 05:51:18
"i dont know how anyone can watch this movie and think that is a conclusion i assume the people saying otherwise are fans of dune that are happy that book 1 was done so well and thats great i enjoyed these movies   

but this movie ended on a to be continued the war just started that was not a triumph",2024-03-01 05:20:52
"
this war doesnt happen in the film its not made clear by the film alone that a war with untold levels of bloodshed will actually happen 

is this seriously your argument the last dialogue of the film is literally the holy war begins the same war that has been explicitly stated and bits of it even shown in part one in pauls vision at the tent to be galaxy spanning and definitely with enough bloodshed to absolutely horrify even paul an heir to a noble house so presumably welleducated in the scale of pasthistorical wars

its only because of the books that you know this is true

ok at this point noone can blame me for saying that youre some troll intentionally making  arguments in bad faith cos its either that or you really are a media illiterate dimwit your words from your very first comment  not mine  because everything that ive said so far ive backed up using evidence from the films alone 

its not my  or the films  fault that you havent even watched the first one or only seem to recall what you read off some  poor recaps or that you seem to be selectively blind towards everything outright shown  stated in the films that dont fit with your bewildering obsession with the idea that paul is a 100 good hero according to these movies if you prefer believing that then knock yourself out and say the earth is flat too while youre at it you probably havent confirmed that with your own eyes either

forget dune  even in other movies do you always need everything spelt out  spoonfed to you more explicitly than this i mean whats next characters in most visual media are actually incapable of pooping because they arent specifically shown to be doing so onscreen 

youre literally questioning even the most basic elements of the story here  if our extremely prescient protagonist has seen visions that the galactic read this word very slowly as many times as you need to understand the scale of it ok holy war will be shockingly horrible then when the movie ends with that war beginning how the  are you arguing that well gee uh they didnt actually show that this galaxyspanning religiously motivated war will really be that bad

i think its fair to say that the film implies he has noble intentions

too little too late though  up hard enough selfishly  manipulatively in big enough ways to forever be more of an antihero than hero but you keep thinking that hes santa claus champ  

and what part of stop responding to me do you not understand if i could block you again right now i would  but now im wondering if even thats gonna confuse you again lol so if youre gonna reply im not even going to read it  and ill block you again as well first thing tomorrow same thing i do with any other garden variety troll or energy vampire hope you had a nice  wasting peoples time then have a feeling thats what this  was actually about",2024-03-21 15:57:49
"because it spends so much time leading up to it and then the actual decision from the drinking of the water is incredibly rushed plus the movie muddies the whole true messiah vs a deliberately spread story for control and the visions have no clear relationship to the actual future  sometimes they are exactly what happens other times they are metaphorical and the vision of the starvation is rote and repetitive with no clear indication of who is affected or why add that all together and it is a mess of competing interpretations that villeneuve mishandles or the book does i havent read it 

thats how",2024-03-03 07:41:45
"your link supports me

however this accusation remains controversial as herberts original novel is considered a critique of messianic archetypes and the white savior tropes they inspire

so essentially your link just says some people dont understand critique and have a controversial take yeah sadly they do make the same mistakes with the films as with the book

yes herbert wrote dune messiah to make it even clearer what his message was in dune but like i said villeneuve made changes in dune part 2 to dispel notions that paul is saving fremen so that audiences wouldnt have to wait years for a possible sequel to get it

without those changes i might agree with you but now saying most wont get it sounds a bit hyperbole",2024-03-03 11:05:40
disagree the white savior trope is much different than what paul is in both the novel and denis movies,2024-03-04 11:57:42
that’s literally what happened but you could not see the true meaning of that scene i can’t help you this is the surface level but that scene is not one dimensional,2024-03-05 04:20:19
you seem to not know what the book is about and yet complain that the movie doesn’t have more of what it’s already going above and beyond delivering in the book the jihad is an inevitable future with the bulk of the story being about paul trying to survive while fighting against that future,2024-03-06 21:40:57
"im so pumped that part 2 was this epic the dune cinematic universe is going to be  awesome 

this aint star wars thats for sure",2024-03-03 17:43:47
"it wasnt in the book but in the film jessica clearly uses the voice on chani  orders her to do her part why else would this be added in the film then answer this

her secret name being a part of the literal prophecy in the film the desert spring tears resurrecting paul etc  this being shown to exponentially increase faith in the prophecy amongst those witnessing it as well 

its outright stated that the fremens prophecy is just fake propaganda planted by the bg multiple times it would defeat a core purpose of this story deconstructing chosen one  white saviour narratives for paul to actually be a chosen one of fate  for stuff like chanis desert spring tears  mixed with the water of life  to be the one specific thing™ capable of bringing him back to life for no conceivable reason besides the prophecy being true the film had added the earlier scene of paul telling chani stilgar and the audience that it was possible to transmute poisons through bene  gesserit training after jessicas water of life survival for a reason",2024-03-02 21:40:22
"you cant really comment on any aspect of whether the movies are successful adaptations of the books except whether the movies are coherent and intelligible stories in their own rights  
  
which im not going to bother arguing with people who havent read the original novel

you are getting quite aggravated huh

the spice is no longer the key to controlling the universe as it is presented multiple times in the films including the very beginning of this film because paul seized control of the spice yet the great houses defy him

how is this contradictory the great houses defying paul despite him seizing control is an example of how desperate the great houses are at trying to retain that control because of how valuable the substance is

and possessing the ability to destroy the spice is the ultimate motivation to surrender having armies in orbit is useless if the guild wont cooperate and the guild is terminally addicted to the spice

possessing the ability to destroy the spice shows who has the real control of it holding the spice hostage is not done to make everyone surrender it is done to demonstrate that paul and the fremen have the real control of the spice and it is them who decide what happens to it and how its used based on how the fremen want to terraform the planet and change the face of spice production the great houses have no choice but to defy paul and the fremen

so why didnt the harkonnens ever attempt to seize the throne while they held arrakis in fief

i think you already answered that

even the saudarkar mean nothing against the massed forces of the entire imperium",2024-03-06 20:32:17
"the greatest overarching message of the novel explored in its appendices is that every group and faction that imagined itself in control of their plans and their situations were deluding themselves and were merely parts of a greater plan they didnt even imagine

that is not an overarching message or a theme or anything plus its in the movie

we dont have paul either failing to foresee the death of his firstborn son or choosing to accept it as part of the price he must pay for selecting a future that leads to victory

paul clearly foresees bad things including personal cost chani and accepts it you are essentially saying its not enough but thats not for you to decide based on having reading the book its for the audience to decide

in short we dont actually get any of the elements from the novels that herbert used to illustrate that fanatical devotion to a leader both religious and secular was a terrible thing we dont get pauls despair at realizing that it doesnt matter whether he lives or dies the jihad isnt something he can control

i think you are overrating how much these themes are actually present in the novel dune they are not developed very well pauls despair is barely there i have read many novels that made me feel despair dune is not one of them the relative absence of these themes in the first dune novel is why previous adaptations have largely ignored it and why villeneuve is adapting messiah",2024-03-07 08:02:13

"paul is muadib an extremist religious leader who leads fremen hordes he threatens spice production the lifeblood of the empire he wield his family atomics which are supposed to be used as a deterrent and kept just in case

lack of communication does not help but theres a lot to dislike about having that guy as your ruler",2024-03-04 19:34:46
the holy war meaning what was shown in the movie or the jihad that is to follow,2024-03-07 01:26:53
i think he’s a tragic  the book because of his “fate” like by the time he fully realizes the jihad is inevitable because if he dies  just become a martyr and the fremen will still go to war or he can  himself before he gets to that point but really what choice is that it’s why he hates the bene gesserit he feels they robbed him of any choice and made him be a “villain”,2024-03-04 03:36:21

"yah great question the way i see it is the prophecybelieving fremen are like a great power sword and ofc with great power comes great responsibility that the bg has crafted on arrakis for the kh to one day wield for the bgs designs pauls whole hesitation about going south is his visions telling him that if he picks up the power sword that is the prophecybelieving fremen he inevitably will be directly responsible for the horrific crusade that will sweep the galaxy under his name so hes very reluctant to go south because if he goes south he knows events will require him to pick up that sword its not until the attack that he realizes he has no choice but to go south so the scene rallying the fremen is act of paul picking up the power sword he is stepping into the role of muaddib to fulfill the prophecystory laid by the bg by demonstrating his kh seeing abilities thus making the prophecybelieving fremen his devoted crusaders he doesnt want to pick up this sword because of what comes after but he knows its the only way he can defeat the harkonnens

the bg dont want paul doing this because they dont control this they wanted jessicas daughters son to do it because they planned to have control of that kh",2024-03-31 19:09:35
he knew their lives their dreams their ancestors and who to yell at of his knowledge to convince,2024-04-02 17:52:26
"late but this is basically how it is if paul goes south even by killing stilgar he would convince others that he was their messiah he can foresee parts of the future and him going to the south would mean he would bring millions and even billions to death

him speaking at the circle was him using his power to see the past remember kh can see all things past and the future which is the entire reason kh is supposed to be the ultimate power he can see all futures and always choose the one he wants no one can hide from him except other kh but that is for another day",2024-04-07 20:30:37
"yes i agree it all went according to plan and the bg says as much to jessica when she says you chose the wrong side 
they just didnt count on paul being stronger than them bc he could use the voice against them d",2024-03-28 03:06:28
the bg plan was for jessica to have a daughter and then that daughter would have a son who would be the kh one they conceivably could control better but jessica skipped ahead a generation it violates the plan overall but youre right that paul uncontrolled by the bg becoming the kh still works with the much looser and interpretive tool of prophecy that was laid down as one component of the plan,2024-03-28 09:11:11
"thats the point of part 1 and why they didnt  paul even after he passed the test because he still qualified for the kh supposed plan was to have jessica give birth to a daughter who then would marry a male harkonnen say feyd for example who then would go on to have the prophesized kh male heir 

the thing is bg knows the kh is a male and thats why he will be strong they are controlling the prophesy because they are also purposefully having bg control their body so that only females would be born and only when they are ready they would have a male on purpose bg are still superhumans in that they can control others their bodies and even whatever they consume",2024-04-07 20:27:51

"im only just starting to read the book but its what ive gathered from explanations of the lore from other book readers the bene gesserit had been trying to carefully breed the kwisatz haderach along a number of bloodlines the harkonnens too they thought they were very close to achieving it with the atreides bloodline which iirc also had other advantages compared to other bloodlines that i dont remember

to culminate their plan jessica was supposed to birth a girl that they would marry to feydrautha producing a harkonnenatreides kwisatz haderach they were sure this child would be a kwisatz haderach and it would also end the centuriesold feud between the atreides and harkonnens

jessica however was in love with leto atreides who wanted to have a son so she desperately wanted to give him one bene gesserit can choose what gender they give birth to she also felt that even though it was not what they had planned she was already capable of birthing the kwisatz haderach if she produced a male so she disobeyed her orders produced a son and gave him the proper training he would need from birth to be the kwisatz haderach

as we now know she was right paul had every capability that they had imagined the kwisatz haderach would have the only thing he didnt have was the planned bloodline but he did have the genetic capabilities he wasnt literally produced in a lab but he wasnt a miracle either he was very carefully bred by the bene gesserit over the course of 10000 years a product of pure science",2024-04-06 08:36:07

without much spoilers you can think of other kh candidates like feyd and one that was cut from the movie even though he has a good plot in the books they can also see the future to a point kh are basically what you call the one eyed king in the world of the blind if there are other one eyed men he has no power over them,2024-04-07 20:45:14
yeah they would have either needed to do it like it was in the movie or have an even bigger time jump and have alia be 5 it is more plausible that a hyperintelligent 5 yearold could stab someone,2024-03-06 01:02:24
i guess they can comfortably do a time skip and just say spice keeps people young which it does,2024-03-03 16:24:11
yes i’m aware but the fact is that most people don’t have a gt laser that near them or even one with a 143 ar liemax is an annoying term because it  on literally most imax theatres when in reality they’re all still a fun time and miles better than any standard theater,2024-03-14 23:29:28
frank herbert pronounced it chainee that said he also once wrote to a fan who was asking about pronunciations and told them that as far as he was concerned any way that the reader wanted to pronounce any of the names would be correct,2024-03-04 04:15:14
now imagining  cheney as chani,2024-03-03 04:03:19
it sounded like johnny to me,2024-03-04 06:18:54
it took me the 10th time for them to say chani to realize they werent calling her johnny,2024-03-10 05:05:13
until i saw it spelled out here i thought they were pronouncing it like johnie,2024-03-24 05:06:13
not who you replied to but i have a similar opinion there is a lot going on in this world a lot of names to keep straight and relationships between parties its one of the denser worlds ive committed to reading in that regard i didnt make it thru lotr not trying to brag about my reading level just being able to see it helps bring things together more cohesively,2024-03-05 03:40:58
cuz 1v1 fight is easier to follow and feel more intense big battle are always a chaotic mess,2024-03-21 07:51:48
"i would be satisfied if paul let himself be deliberately stabbed by feyd in order to get close to him


i suppose thats up to our interpretation",2024-03-12 09:44:14
feyd fell victim to one of the classic blunders,2024-03-09 11:11:54
dune gets thirsty,2024-03-02 22:29:07
its funny because the last one bucks the trend and is less  than the one before still  overall thiugh,2024-03-04 19:55:16
its also worth reading chapterhouse because of the random space jewstm ,2024-03-07 21:30:48
"5 and 6 are good books but  emperor 4 is essentially the ending of the story and 56 are just kinda tacked on as more stories in the dune universe  emperor is really the end of the story that starts with dune

many authors would have started 56 as a new saga but during herberts era solely for business reasons you just added on more sequels",2024-03-03 22:17:14
five and six are  awesome these fools don’t know what they are talking about it’s so wild and totally focuses on the bene gesserit,2024-03-02 23:42:19
ive read dune dune messiah children of dune and  emperor of dune three times over the years  ive read heretics and chapter house dune only once  they are all worth reading obviously but i think  emperor of dune is a fitting conclusion to the saga   emperor is a trip like nothing ive ever read,2024-03-02 23:44:57
books 5 6 and 7 were meant to be their own trilogy,2024-03-05 21:08:43
" then he plays the exact same game just as ruthlessly as everyone else

no paul is not 10 as ruthless as any harkonnen

 while he destroys her people

is he destroying her people or is he uplifting them

anyway these are beside my overarching point which is that basically the only real human relationship paul has is with chani and the idea that he would manipulate her in a deceitful way doesnt comport with that",2024-03-03 12:30:10
"interesting that progression makes a lot of sense 

based only on what the films have shown the only plot hes internally motivated by is revenge even then hed have been smarter to start with the end goal in mind  his revenge is against the bgs who control the emperor who deployed the harkonnens to do his dirty work so obviously getting rid of the harkonnens from arrakis again is just step one if hes surprised and burdened and then disillusioned that the situation just keeps getting bigger and bigger from there is justwell it makes him not a very smart person i know hes only a teenager or something but were being asked to care about this heromaybe later antihero and i just cant 

his father didnt take it upon himself to reorder the universe i wonder what he would have wanted",2024-03-10 05:08:28
yeah im probably never watching this movie again but it seems like a chapter got ripped out from the book accidentally got left on the cutting room floor  tenet was convoluted but this was just like did no one watch the whole movie back again after editing,2024-03-18 00:50:17
i understand the point of view youre presenting i just disagree with it,2024-03-02 16:47:12
man i wish i had access to imax,2024-03-03 14:26:21
"just to tack on recallbacks paul striding onto the emperors ship like he owned the place was giving me stilgarmeetsleto energy

like here comes this dude who seems alien to your culture and couldnt care less about your perceived authority",2024-03-02 14:07:18
i would love to be your equal changed his mind about 15 hrs later in movie time,2024-03-05 11:46:33
makes sense though she’s one of the only freman who really knows him not as a mythical messiah but just as a person she knows his struggle with his fate and fears what his path is doing to him,2024-04-06 06:18:36
"i was confused first too but i think it’s because it was so excellently done with a bit of intentional misdirection to the audience and feydrautha

paul was stabbed with his own blade somewhere on his left side below his chest feydrautha then comes at him with his dagger and paul grabs the blade with his left hand right before being stabbed again the camera shows only a chest up shot of both so we don’t see paul’s right hand or his own blade that is still in his side at this point

my understanding and i’m pretty confident this is how it went down now is that in one smooth motion paul directs feydrautha’s blade into his right shoulderchest area using his left hand his right hand we don’t see this at the same time removes his own blade from his side and deals the fatal stab to feydrautha 

maybe the fact that we have to break this down and debate what actually happens means it was poorly shot and it could have been more clear but i’m left more in awe of a neat action scene with a rarely seen unique ending that didn’t feel cliche",2024-03-06 02:20:04
yea there were multiple scenes in this movie where i felt like there was a scene missing or that the pacing was really weird,2024-03-31 21:20:34
having watched the film i dont think paul is performing anything and got stabbed because feyd was really good at fighting,2024-03-03 02:23:04
smdh the french are gonna french,2024-03-04 05:54:19
 no wonder roman polanski went almost straight to france,2024-03-10 03:05:33
could be why they don’t allow the french to do dna tests for genealogy,2024-03-06 04:14:22
"i think the confusion stems from the biggest moviebook change which was the removal of the 10 year jump in the books that allowed alia pauls sister to be born and grow up into a 10 year old without that jump we dont see what alia becomes and why she is considered an abomination 

book spoiler i understand why villeneuve avoided the 10 year time jump but we miss two important book moments because of it 1 the loss of paul and chanis first child in a sardaukarharkonnen raid and 2 alias birth and growing up in the book she kills the baron herself by pushing him out of the ship",2024-03-01 16:15:40
a quick search tells me the bene gesserit do use spice to access their psychic powers but perhaps youre right and they consider it unnatural considering he drank the water of life at least i hope they had some type of reasoning to include that in the movie and it wasnt just a blunder but considering villeneuves love of dune i dont think theyd be so sloppy,2024-03-01 20:56:38
i think the use of “abomination” is a little different in the movie than the books it does seem to refer to paul out of mohiam’s mouth,2024-03-03 03:03:42
allegory,2024-03-03 18:47:53
"iirc they dont explain why the spice is so important

the cutting out of the guild is a big mistake",2024-03-03 07:52:18
there has to be some scenes left on the cutting room or writers room floor that would have helped,2024-03-03 07:17:09
thats true if they wanted it to be direct they could have just gone with oh  lol the film definitely meant it to be subjective,2024-03-04 16:37:39
thats a really strange thing to nitpick its all relative itd be perfectly normal to say someone hasnt had a specific dream in a long time if that meant a few months had passed,2024-03-02 07:35:19
i think its less them we need to worry about and how were currently failing them at pretty much anything important,2024-03-07 22:28:32
yep you werent imagining that the book is much more on the nose about it,2024-03-05 23:31:56
jessica looked younger in the first movie like only a decade older than paul at best i also felt some incestuous tones,2024-04-08 14:33:08
"in that scene maybe but its a nod to the books

the water of life give access to ones ancestors personality and thoughts but theres a possibility that the consciousness of an ancestor will overcome yourself and take control of you essentially becoming you the bene geserits call those abominations

because alia the foetus was awakened by the water of life before getting its own consciousness theres a strong possibility of this happening",2024-03-11 02:31:31
yeah theyre twink exclusive radical feminists,2024-03-08 20:57:35
"jeez they outright call it jihad in the books i mean i got the muslim references pretty clearly when they invoke the name of mahdi and prayer for the fremen looking like a stereotypical islamic prayer 

tho i guess that makes sense given it was written in the 60s haha",2024-03-12 00:36:46
the way they handled it meant the entire 2 movies take place over a 9 month time period though which does make the speed at which everything happened kind of unbelievable,2024-03-06 10:49:40
"agreed

though i have to wonder if they had any tests of trying to make it work like the book before they ended up choosing the shall we call it golden path 

i wonder the same thing about the ornithopters in the first movie did they try any tests of them being more birdlike before settling on the dragonfly aesthetic",2024-03-03 00:01:05
you realize the movie has to stand on its own right,2024-03-03 00:55:50
"visions that tell you to do something so that your visions would be clearer is a kind of logical fail in itself  

is the water opinionated is it supposed to possess them and change them or is it neutral and just acts as a psychotropic if the latter then it cant make them anything  

what exactly couldnt he accomplish in terms of revenge with a combination of war heads and the northern fremen gurney was amazed what they had been able to do with 200 fremen did paul go south because it allowed him to gather a larger number of fremen for fodder",2024-03-06 04:17:28
he did he literally confronted her with it,2024-03-03 19:40:37
"jessicas inner dialogue was telling in the book its what caused me to start question whos the true villains is her being weird and talking to her baby supposed to tell the audience something important does the audience have any understanding that jessica is multiple reverend mothers im just not sure what the angle is for revealing her and the bgs motives if crucial information is being with held from the story 

its a bummer im about 80 pages from finishing the book within the first book i thought they did a great job preserving the story in the first movie this second one though maybe im missing something here but it was all over the place and didnt make a bunch of sense to me",2024-03-05 12:48:17
"the movie is choppy as  one scene you have been poisoning the people spreading your evil stories soon after to gurney go south protect my mother thats an order

this felt pretty natural to me he recognizes that his mother is dangerous but she is still his mother and the only family he has left and she is carrying his little sister even if he doesnt fully trust her protecting her is going to be a top priority",2024-03-06 00:43:09
“himself and his family” i don’t think it’s about the pure atreides bloodline at all,2024-03-05 13:58:09
"he is in control because he has usurped the bg power and become the quizad haderach i know i spelled that wrong lol 

even they are outmatched by the ultimate power in the universe even though they caused it",2024-03-06 04:02:13
" umatchameetcha is mistaken the reverend mother literally said she advised the emperor to wipe out atreides because they were defiant and not as easy to control
 
 

part one 

reverend mother mohiam contd 
duke leto atreides means nothing to 
our order but his wife is under 
our protection and by extension 
her son you may not harm them 
allow them the dignity of exile

the reverend mother is the only reason paul and jessica are alive at all if she hadnt said anything theyd be dead 

youd have been better off sticking to movie canon the books do say what you say but they are also much clearer that jessicas mistake of making a boy instead of a girl that could be wed to feyd as opposed to being a match for irulan which makes the atreides even more dangerous to bring peace is a huge part of the problem it made the vendetta unmanageable so the bg did the best they could and tried to save paul

in the film the bg say they decided as opposed to made the most of a bad situation  the atreides had to die because they became defiant about the breeding program and jessica deciding to make an executive decision and  give rise to the kwisatz haderach had no part in that",2024-03-18 12:51:25
yeah i dunno i didnt read the book but off the movie it definitely looks like the plan from the bene gessirit was for house atredies to be overthrown and then paul to become the chosen one by surviving out in the desert,2024-03-01 16:02:26
yeah that was my take on it as well seems like while paul wasnt meant to be the one they were willing to take a chance on it and see what happened it just may have ended up backfiring on them,2024-03-01 17:04:02
wait but in the movie didnt freyd impregnante fenring its strongly suggested after their meating,2024-03-03 16:14:17
half the women in that  universe are bg,2024-03-03 00:04:54
giving you an explanation without spoilers may be difficult but i’ll say that the ramifications of what jessica did with the waters of life while pregnant with alia is what causes alia to be an abomination,2024-03-16 12:26:01
yes but in th book there is a specific thing called the abomination which is alia,2024-03-02 17:26:49
"well whats interesting is that the flashback to baby jessica reveals that the baron already uh looked like that when she was born apparently so reverend mother mohiam seriously took one for the team there 

i think in the books the baron was of normal weight and stature first and only becomes morbidly obese because of a disease that he gets infected possibly by a bene gesserit maybe mohiam herself after he forces himself on her i honestly cant remember if that was in one of the later books written by the authors son that arent quite canon compliant and whether that was even mohiam specifically so i have no idea how much any of that is or isnt relevant to the movie timeline",2024-03-02 18:19:15
rotk benefits a lot from some of the scenes but the army of the dead stuff really drags,2024-03-01 21:55:52
the first movie with the visions of fremen slaughters and a holy war expanding over the universe,2024-03-08 14:21:02
agreed either the film was poorly edited or if this follows the books its poor writing that forces more plot to happen than we can give the story credit for its an anticlimax from all the slow motion timothee being agonized scenes weve endured across two movies i didnt even get the sense that the galaxy as a whole was in turmoil such that things were headed towards a great war of some kind we were shown that this is just how its been for centuries  a game of thrones with the bene gesserits orchestrating and this was just the latest chapter of it paul set off the chain of events thats now culminated in apparently all out war and threatening spice production for the entire galaxy,2024-03-05 13:09:05
i mean hes kinda like doctor strange right like he saw all possible futures and saw that there was one narrow path forward this was the only way,2024-03-07 02:18:24
nah gurney just says “paul atreides nuts” and then they fight,2024-03-24 22:52:28
makes sense i interpreted that as the tortoise and hare story where making slow and calculated moves is better than randomly swinging,2024-03-09 04:22:18
like giant worms,2024-03-02 21:14:15
"the fremen did use laser weapons throughout the movie so its safe to assume they had one and could choose to use one if they wanted if the fremen were spread out itd still be one death vs the entire patrol no real sense in making yourself a live bomb when you have a higher chance of surviving a projectile or jump down where theres more cover

and dont forget about friendly fire lol",2024-03-10 14:38:08
the setting is full of contrivances so we can have knife fights even after 8k years of technological advancement its also a treatise about control of valuable resources and what people do with that control so you end up with some hand waving rules that everyone follows or has a  good reason to risk notfollowing them ,2024-03-04 15:34:05
no an atomic explosion occurs both on the shield and on the lasgun as well also in the dune universe any use of atomics against any house forces all houses to join together into obliterating whoever the person that did it belonged to with their own atomics herbert thought of almost everything i dont think youll be able to find a loophole,2024-03-05 04:58:42
imagine if peter jackson had that mentality ,2024-03-10 09:32:49
yes they dont take control for themselves because they dont seek it its not in their interests i think the books do explain this right they have have great control and power though at least comparable to that of the emperor if you want to do anything off your planet you need the guild spice guild have an economy guild power projection guild at the end of the first book all the houses were waiting like well behaved dogs to even enter arrakis its orbit they need the guild permission for that,2024-03-03 12:53:20
that’s what i thought members of the spacing guild but not navigators themselves,2024-03-01 22:42:13
 the endless ahhhs in the book are such a weird writing tic,2024-03-03 23:42:53
"what about the dinner version …

 jk",2024-03-03 07:19:15
doesnt paul bluff in the the book as well about destroying the spice albeit not with the nukes wasnt it a ploy to get the landsraad armada to depart,2024-03-01 17:45:52
i’m super with you tbh i had to open back up the book after seeing the film because that ending had wildly different implications than i remembered the book having and they’ll be important in the next film the jihad was never something paul commanded and that’s a huge distinction to make,2024-03-03 08:00:39
have to agree i think the ending dropped the ball a little for the sake of a tense cliffhanger,2024-03-02 03:02:13
lol what be serious many rulers have gained power through the sword and then done what paul did he controls the emperor and can easily use him to show he’s putting down a uprising he needs legitmacy you think rulers can just burn everyone who disagrees with them i understand your sad all your book whatever’s didn’t make it into the movie but a lot of your criticism based on the film itself is incredibly hyperbolic,2024-03-05 18:26:06
well thats dumb so no space empires just single planets in a sea of planets dumb,2024-03-04 01:27:27
i just handwave it away as the harkonnens are so rich they customized their own sun,2024-03-01 22:36:05
thank you can’t wait i plan to read the novels once we finish the trilogy only then i can see the big picture and how it differs from novels and the movies i could read it now but yeah it’s just gonna spoil things for myself haha,2024-03-11 22:31:36
are the tleilaxu the  matriarchy,2024-03-29 03:42:12
he was more upset because he saw it as baron trying to  him in all honesty he clearly  enjoyed it,2024-03-01 16:37:30
that was a show to gain power playing up his victimhood was a tool in the power struggle between him and his uncle hes smart enough to use the situation to his advantage independent from whether he enjoyed it or not better to also get something else out of it,2024-03-02 09:07:40
if he was really upset he would not have removed his shield nor would he have shouted at the stadium helpers to not intervene,2024-03-02 12:23:36
he wasn’t actually upset,2024-03-04 13:29:39
i do wish they showed a visual somehow displaying jessica and paul transmuting poison,2024-03-01 15:00:55
"everyone is entitled to their own option and then sometimes those opinions are wrong lol


butler was great and i cant believe that would be anyones read of feydrautha unless theyre just trying to be edgy and contrarian",2024-03-03 14:52:02
"it does but how is that more interesting lol

so pauls in the wrong and she follows her moral compass",2024-03-01 22:02:33
its the welcome mat before the golden path,2024-03-04 08:42:59
another thing her character gained more agency and we didn’t have to have tons of exposition from paul to understand his conflict because other characters helped represent what was happening through interactions,2024-03-03 18:07:33
the fremen in dune messiah through  emperor are deeply  by having no identity or purpose paul took that from them and turned them into genocidal maniacs  no more terrible disaster could befall your people than for them to fall into the hands of a hero,2024-03-01 14:11:58
they are literally being religiously indoctrinated by the bene gesserit for generarions quite a choice that is ,2024-03-01 11:55:10
you really seem to think about men’s body types a lot,2024-03-24 13:28:38
quit yapping no one reading those,2024-03-03 19:03:58
 oof,2024-03-15 15:31:14
really i just saw the trailer before dune and it felt really good,2024-03-03 17:10:53
it looks like how every episode of the mandalorian feels to me im not sure how to explain it but its not ideal like a play as opposed to a movie,2024-03-03 20:50:19
it would be so crazy awesome to see the divided  himself in this movie universe  emperor would be even more epic than paul,2024-03-12 09:01:03
yeah canonically just not smart,2024-03-19 21:58:59
why did the great houses tell paul to eat  at the end paul has all the leverage plz no spoilers also,2024-03-07 14:17:29
you are awesome thank you kindly,2024-03-07 04:03:56

"on the contrary it was decidedly inconvenient leto ii had to give up humanity become a hated tyrant and live a very long life of no surprises which he hated in order to pull off this plan he had no personal desire to do this other than prevent humanity’s extinction 

heck paul had the same visions as his son and rather than become a monstrous wormman hybrid ruling with an iron fist for millennia he abdicated and wandered off into the desert to die",2024-03-12 12:26:46
huh do they ever explain how their spaceships work without computers,2024-03-10 07:26:04
wild how much 40k is ripped straight from dune i’ve not read it but i really want to now,2024-03-18 01:07:02
they also showed the tree in kynes office but i dont think either is enough to convey the scope of work that has actually been put in to make it an actual reality at least i felt so as someone who has read the book but didnt remember a ton i knew what i was looking for and wasnt totally sure of a lot without googling thats just my opinion but at the same time i dont think it influenced the plot enough that it would have changed the movie fundamentally either way so i think its fair that it ended up in the bin of compromises translating something written to screen,2024-03-17 20:19:34
thats what i was saying be for real about for sure dude,2024-03-02 15:50:37
i agree with you on the film needing an extra 15 minutes but for me im thinking about it from the filmmaking angle cause im a film nerd and because i havent read the books some scenes definitely could have used a little more breathing space its nowhere near my favorite movie of all time but i did love it maybe another rewatch and i see some more of the positives and it might end up being top 50,2024-03-03 19:29:28
"thanks for the link guess i missed that but its not like any of his movies have been much criticised for having bad dialogue i think what he did with benicio del toros character alejandro in sicario is a good indicator of his actual stance towards dialogue rather than that quote from the interview which doesnt explain much and seems a bit devoid of context he took a character that had a lot of dialogue and voiceover in the original script and stripped most of it away to make him more of an enigma letting you discover who he is through his actions rather than the character telling you

so i take it as him saying show dont tell in a bit of an extreme way with perhaps an unnecessary dig at tv lol but getting back to the point i dont think this movie wouldve been better off with a bunch of more dialogue especially since part 1 is a bit more dialogue and exposition heavy this movie having a healthier balance towards action makes viewing them backtoback flow much better 

i do understand and respect your pov though i havent read the books yet so i cant comment on whether the dialogue left out was vital his acceptance by the fremen felt pretty organic to me thats all i can say",2024-03-02 17:41:02
"“frankly i hate dialogue” the filmmaker told the times of london in a recent interview “dialogue is for theatre and television i don’t remember movies because of a good line i remember movies because of a strong image i’m not interested in dialogue at all pure image and sound that is the power of cinema but it is something not obvious when you watch movies today”

man i love villeneuves films but this is a wild take",2024-03-03 02:41:36

"gosh i hate reddit  

i jump into a thread just to addon to someone’s comment about “the voice”  

then i end up spending several comments clarifying my point to someone who clearly misunderstood what i was saying clearly just wants someone to tell them they’re right and clearly didn’t even read the book… which is clearly what my original comment was referring to

oh you don’t think a specific detail of dune is realistic  good for you  it’s science fiction  

nobody is saying anything here is “realistic”

you say no one could convince you to buy an ostrich egg… again good for you  you’re wrong though  at the very least you’re wrong to think your personal convictions mean that no one is capable of convincing someone to buy an ostrich egg  you’re literally just describing salesmarketing which is a very real thing and you’re acting like it’s a ridiculous concept 

let me try this one more time…   “the voice” is a vague and theoretical “talent for making people do stuff with spoken words” maybe even stuff they never would have done before hearing it  that’s it  the movie plays it as if it’s a jedi mindtricksuperpower because that’s the way they chose to depict it  the book doesn’t  the book deliberately explains that “the voice” is nothing more than a comprehensive understanding of interpersonal perception and a complete control of verbal communication  the thing frank herbert was asking you to do is consider how powerful language is how we use it to varying degrees of excellence and how in a theoretical deep future… some folks might manage to get really good with it… yes even to the point that they could make you  yourself with a few words

you’re trying to argue against someone’s explanation of a science fiction novel that you didn’t even read  i’m not saying your opinions are wrong and i’m not saying anyone could make you buy an ostrich egg… i’m just saying your argument is wrong and i don’t understand your motivations in making it

it’s like if someone referenced tolkien’s work to explain why gandalf was so weary of wielding the one ring then you roll up having never read any of tolkien’s work to say they’re wrong… because gandalf would definitely want the ring   it would be such a confusing incorrect and pointless argument to make  

like it’s not up for debate  it’s in the book  and the book is a fantastical allegory for generally grounded ideas  if you’re hung up on how certain aspects of the allegory are unrealistic then you’re missing the point of the specific allegory and probably what an allegory is in general",2024-03-03 23:01:56
i disagree to me a movie should be self contained to itself and its sequelsprequels it shouldnt be expected for google to answer big plot questions i agree that yeah its a really big book to adapt into 5 hours of film but thats what they chose to do also i should clarify im talking about the low hanging fruit they could easily mention not like every single part of the lore,2024-03-11 11:42:33

"guns largely fell out of favour because of the massive explosion should they hit a shield

armies therefore arent trained or equipped with them

by the time that they might even start to adjust you then have to wonder  what if surely after each victory the fremen would salvage shields what if today they are wearing them",2024-03-01 17:07:46
"so why not just equip the imperial forces with guns to lay waste to them

because they were absolutely not prepared for fighting the fremen the predominant idea is still that theres just a handful of them living in the more habitable areas of the desert and most of them must have gotten killed by rabban on his campaign of extermination rabban to his credit does realize the potential of guns on arrakis which is why the ornithopters have them 

but its worth noting that the absence of shields is very distinct to the desert because there they attract worms the idea of waging war against people without shields is something nobody was really prepared for",2024-03-14 15:20:05
"yes and no the emperors position is tenuous and requires juggling the needs and ambitions of the houses the houses arent a single block each will act in their own interests  many seeking to claim the throne for themselves if possible having the emperor alive and able to tell people i stepped down and my soninlaw is emperor now would greatly strengthen pauls position which is how the book ends  with the houses reluctantly accepting that paul is emperor for now though they will 100 try to remove him from the position if the opportunity arises the films emphasize that paul is now an unknown factor with unknown goals who just committed a violent coup its fair that the houses could be united in rejecting said claim 


the politics of the houses and the throne is why the atreides were sent to arrakis in part one they had become diplomatically powerful enough that they could have potentially made a push for the throne  especially if after the emperors death if he had still failed to produce a male heir they were seen as capable administrators and were very  popular they were essentially close to a civ diplomatic victory many of the houses would happily see them in power a succession crisis could see them empowered by wave of popular support to rule

meanwhile the harkonnens had become immeasurably wealthy during their stewardship of arrakis this had allowed them to amass a sizeable army what the films didnt really introduce was that interstellar travel is managed by what is known as the spacing guild a supposedly impartial corporation the harkonnens were wealthy enough that they could and were bribing the spacing guild to favour their interests it was plausible that given another generation on arrakis they would have been wealthy enough to try to take the imperium by force bribing the spacing guild to strand opposing houses and cut off trade to force submission to any coup the baron was aiming for his nephew freyd to eventually be able to make a play for emperor

there were two houses on the cusp of possibly usurping the throne giving arrakis to the atreides set the two houses against each other the conflict would greatly weaken the harkonnens who had to spend a fortune to first relocate off the planet and to then covertly return with an invasion force and reestablish themselves the conflict itself would reduce the strength of their forces provided the atreides were fully wiped out the two greatest threats to the emperor would be pacified however should the atreides survive they would be in a much stronger position than ever  which is why the emperor lent extra troops to the harkonnens to ensure their victory

the book spends plenty of time inside different characters heads to explain the machinations of each faction which is hard to translate to film as a book reader all this felt represented on the screen  but the film doesnt dwell on or overly explain all of it",2024-03-04 16:50:25

that’s an absolutely psychotic way to end a book part of me loves it but another part loves when the good guy beats the bad guy and rides into the sunsets with zendaya to live happily ever after i’m sure i’ll be experiencing deep internal conflict while i watch it but i’m even more desperate to see messiah now i almost want to just read it lol,2024-03-01 15:17:32
yeah thats actually the reason i didnt like messiah it basically just says paul is bad over and over again for a couple hundred pages i thought the visions of billions of people dying in a holy war were more than enough to understand where this was all going and the themes the author was trying to get across messiah just felt like it was written out of frustration more than necessity but i guess since some fans still think paul is cool i kinda get why it had to happen,2024-03-03 04:16:33
honestly i worry for anyone who doesnt understand who shes meant to be of all the things that villeneuve let go unsaid so the viewer could just take in the world without being explained to this one was pretty dang clear,2024-03-01 07:12:36
if someone doesn’t realize who she is than they are pretty dumb she literally says “i love you brother” to paul and paul only has one sister,2024-03-01 20:00:29
yeah they do a good job with making a point of that with chani instead of her just going along with whatever paul does in the first book oh you wanna marry that princess  thats fine i guess distinction between the north fremin and the fanatics,2024-03-01 07:57:39

well making dune part 2 occur within nine months was to save screentime from alias birth just practical and it was not going to be years anyway because then alia would have to have scenes too",2024-03-01 15:22:38
i guess i didnt explain the golden path very well it is his personal path to survival yes but also humanitys as a whole think of how dr doom saw how humans only survive long term under his rule and its basically the same but yea thats about right on the money for why the jihad happens itll be interesting if villeneuve does adapt messiah as that book is basically just one giant internal monologue of paul saying he doesnt want to slaughter billions of people or the repercussions of that happening and the end of part 2 he seemed to accept it more,2024-03-02 16:59:59
"ive only read the first two books so i dont know all the details about the golden path i believe that is really dealt with in book 3 and 4 when it starts getting really weird but the way it is presented in the first book is that paul realizes humanity is proper  with his godlike abilities for reasons that are pretty weird and esoteric and probably wouldnt able to be transferred to film its described as a greater race consciousness of humanity growing stagnant and seeking turmoil on a grand scale on a genetic and downright  level so when he goes to fight feyd at the end hes seeing increasing darkening and blindness of possible futures in part because his threat to destroy the spice would lead to the end of prescience but those that remain are that of the jihad and he realizes that any attempts by him to change it even slightly at that point were futile the jihad would happen even over his dead body   
the movie changes chani to being the one who is deeply disturbed by all of this happening but in the books it is mostly within pauls internal monologues that he hates his own role in it despite going along with it but the mess hes gotten into is far greater than any personal desires for revenge or power even if his earlier actions were based at least in part on those motives",2024-03-02 18:59:02

"good lord i see that you really dont understand fhe point that frank herbert makes in this whole story paul is not a messiah he is just a man that has powers that are human in this world according to the books the kwisatz haderach will be a male bene gesseret bg with the abilities of a mentat space guild navigator and bg all in one their ultimate power to be able to subjugate and control the universe as they the bg see fit since they will be able to control him as well they fed this messiah story to the fremen to pacify and subjugate them for centuries as they wait for him to be born due to the bgs centuries of genetics manipulation why because of the spice melange which is the single greatest commodity in the entire dune universe

the spice melange is everything in this world its like if you had something in our world that could slow down aging to a crawl extend your life for centuries give you access to space travel and was also  all in one the whole economy is based on this substance and its only on one world that the fremen also live on oppressing these people was the entire point of this economy so they did it anyway they could this was the one method that was wholly effective but it backfired on the bg because paul didnt appear when they forsaw and was outside of their control

and paul is not a charismatic leader  he is the messiah who can see all past and future how can you now bow to that  except thats exactly what he was and he didnt want to do it at first because he knew what would happen if he used the fremen to exact revenge on his enemies if you rewatch dune part 1  2 again with this mindset you will see that he says over and over again that he isnt their mahdi and that its heartbreaking what the bg did to these people in order to pacify them and gain access to the spice melange he only finally does it because he wants revenge but he also sees that the fremen jihad is inevitable and cannot be stopped no matter what even if he dies it will still happen 61 billion people dead and 90 worlds sterilised in dune messiah he even says that he cannot stop them even if he tried he has seen that they will  him and continue on",2024-03-08 01:58:43
it’s one heck of a difference if a movie wins one award for make up or if it wins most of the technical ones along with director and best leading actor it’s like when oppenheimer hits the double digits on sunday and then have you claiming that the movie is boring and slow and say that the physics community came together in a board meeting and said that everyone has to be a fanboy my wife hates sci fi and everything surrounding the genre but watched the first part on monday and the second part yesterday and she didn’t want this movie to end for us it was a spectacle and neither of us are into the dune lore so your statement about the fanboys are ,2024-03-06 19:41:16

then when the movie ends with that war beginning how the  are you arguing that well gee uh they didnt actually show that this galactic war will actually be that bad

because the film does not show that thing that begins will actually be what pauls premonitions show it to be some characters believe it to be the holy war but why are we supposed to believe that they are infallible particularly when paul appears to have had a premonition that shows him a narrow path that he must follow 

if dune 3 were to come out and paul uses some part of his premonition to effectively quickly win the holy war with minimal bloodshed that wouldnt be some totally incoherent shift in the narrative itd be completely congruent with what has come before

and what part of stop responding to me do you not understand if i could block you again right now i would  but now im wondering if even thats gonna confuse you again lol so if youre gonna comment again im not even going to read it  and ill block you again as well first thing tomorrow same thing i do with any other garden variety troll or energy vampire hope you had a nice  wasting peoples time then have a feeling thats what this  was actually about

this is a weird approach im not trolling you im just not getting the same interpretation from a silly scifi movie as you theres no need to be this mad and rude i think your takes are interesting and i am learning and updating my perspective on the basis of this conversation you can cool it down a notch",2024-03-21 16:28:27

"how is this contradictory the great houses defying paul despite him seizing control is an example of how desperate the great houses are at trying to retain that control because of how valuable the substance is

how does refusing to acknowledge paul as emperor retain control of the spice  all that would do is ensure the spacing guild would refuse to transport their forces and their trade

possessing the ability to destroy the spice shows who has the real control of it holding the spice hostage is not done to make everyone surrender is to demonstrate that paul and the fremen have the real control of the spice and it is them who decides what happens to it and how its used

and the only purpose to demonstrating that the fremen have the ability to destroy the spice is to force people to surrender and capitulate

what do you think its to impress the universe into believing pauls worth following  the fremen are holding a loaded gun to the universes head because the entirety of human civilization is dependent on the spice and the people who control that civilization are lethally addicted to it

i think you already answered that

nonsense  that point reinforces that the harkonnens could have seized control themselves given the situation the movie presented  if the harkonnens had merely threatened to limit the production of spice the entire universe would have united against them  but if they had the ability to permanently destroy the spice that wouldnt be possible

ergo suggesting that the family nukes were sufficient to destroy spice production means that the harkonnens could have seized control directly and simply  this is a plot hole",2024-03-06 20:41:12
"that is not an overarching message or a theme or anything plus its in the movie

the thing about paul that’s tragic is that he never wants any of this he never wanted to go to arrakis he never wanted to lead the fremen he never wanted the throne but the events and characters keep pushing him to embody this constructed prophecy except it’s not fake because he goes and makes it real

he did want vengeance which was pretty valid but basically paul had two options go live in the desert as a hermit not even with the other fremen or lead a galactic jihad those are the only two he ever truly had from when he was born that’s where the bene gesserit  up they got the wheels turning and finished their prophecy",2024-03-10 05:32:42

the spice drink they take in the film is at such a high concentration that it’s not comparable to the small amounts of spice that everyone inuniverse takes daily in their food and drink

including it isn’t a blunder it’s integral to the story and is what takes paul’s very good abilities to use the voice truthsay and have some visions to him becoming the kwizats haderach and being completely prescient",2024-03-01 21:16:04
indeed,2024-03-03 15:31:26
they mentioned it in the first film i believe,2024-03-03 08:17:10
i guess theyll explain it in messiah when the spacing guild is more important but they briefly mentioned it in the beginning of 1,2024-03-03 23:00:28
they made mention of it being a big deal when they found out she was pregnant but i thought that just meant because they had to poisonkill her,2024-03-03 16:49:24
im almost 30 with decent savings and cant buy a house but at least i have absolutely phenomenal dune movies finally ,2024-03-08 03:33:56
i remember reading the book and wondering if the baby was pauls,2024-03-06 06:42:44
excuse me but why,2024-04-08 00:53:44
thanks i’m def gonna make it a point to go through the books,2024-03-11 02:34:25
grandpa harkonensp gonna take over a little girls body,2024-04-07 12:18:08
someone told me dune was just people having a big turf war at the end of the day but i guess i didnt get it at the time smh,2024-03-08 21:02:15
yes the book called it jihad,2024-03-16 16:44:03
why would talking about jihad be anachronistic,2024-03-18 05:00:35
yeah they really dropped one ball by not having a scary way too smart little sister running around i always loved the bit where they had her in the throne room talking to her grandfather,2024-03-10 16:15:08
but i think it does i was reminded that the first movie starts with chani saying i wonder who our next oppressor will be and it cutting directly to paul’s facei mean they do a great job humanizing him but if people could t tell this is a “power corrupts” story…,2024-03-03 06:23:15
the movie makes it very clear over and over and over that paul is consciously manipulating a government program to enslave these people to his vengeance plot that truth is what drives him and his love interest apart and the movie ends on her disgust and despair at whats been made of her people by the boy she fell in love with,2024-03-03 03:42:52
honestly it felt pretty clear in the movie as well that paul was dangerous and bordering on villainy,2024-03-06 00:29:28
the movie made it pretty clear that a holy war was bad,2024-03-06 10:51:58
"is the water opinionated is it supposed to possess them and change them or is it neutral and just acts as a psychotropic if the latter then it cant make them anything

one theory i have seen is that since the water gives people a psychic connection to their ancestors it changes how a person thinks and it seems to have amplified pauls visions and all of this has caused paul to give less consideration to individual people and focus more on the overall state of the galaxy which also makes him more willing to sacrifice others

what exactly couldnt he accomplish in terms of revenge with a combination of war heads and the northern fremen gurney was amazed what they had been able to do with 200 fremen did paul go south because it allowed him to gather a larger number of fremen for fodder

it the story was actual a pretty realistic look at asymmetrical military conflicts in terms of weapons and manpower the 200 fremen were much weaker there is no way they could beat the harkonnens in direct combat so instead the fremen used guerilla combat striking at the weak points of the harkonnens with the most obvious target being spice production the harkonnen had to get spice but it meant going into fremen and sandworm territory paul at the spice production to slowly weaken them but in conflict guerilla combat alone rarely wins wars for example while the nascent american nation was famous for guerilla combat this didnt win the war alone it weakened the british but the war was won through battles like saratoga where the american army engaged the british in a traditional battle 

and in this same way while the fremen were doing significant damage to the harkonnens this wasnt the same as actually beating them and even if the harkonnens eventually lost the empires favor and had arrakis taken from them it would just mean another great house for the fremen to fight what fremen and paul needed was a significant direct victory against the harkonnens that would drastically change the status quo

and this is where the going south came into play pauls actions had drawn the emperor to arrakis but the harkonnens city was still secure and while paul could have theoretically just nuked the city killing the emperor and the baron this would have also just been a temporary victory the great houses would have selected a new emperor and one or more great houses would have invaded arrakis again this time being aware of pauls atomic weapons

so paul needed to capture the emperor alive to gain negotiating power and he also wanted to capture harkonnen and imperial equipment which would have been destroyed in a direct nuclear attack the fremen dont have ships which would make fighting the great houses difficult

in order to capture the emperor paul needed more soldiers he would be assaulting the main harkonnen reinforced by elite imperial soldiers the emperor wouldnt have traveled to arrakis without enough manpower to protect himself against either paul or the baron with just 200 fremen paul would have lost the battle they just didnt have the manpower to take the city but the fanatics of the south greatly boosted his soldiers",2024-03-06 04:44:27
the water gives you access to generic memory which means that their entire personality which is shaped by memory is going to be changed by the addition of new memories,2024-03-06 10:54:10
and she and alia basically told him he was whipped lol,2024-03-07 22:03:26
i totally agree part 2 had like random pages ripped out so the scenes didnt connect i thought jessica was pushed into becoming rev mother and didnt want the role next thing shes accelerated evil and the baby was jessica possessed by that dialogue is the baby dangerous or was she exaggerating the dialogue with the baby to extend the spell over the people what is jessicas purpose in part 2 ultimately  to secure any kind of future for paul to specifically put paul on the throne some more convoluted plot as required by the bgs to specifically defy the bgs because they tried to have the artredies killed ,2024-03-05 14:49:27
" is her being weird and talking to her baby supposed to tell the audience something important

yes its showing something is wrong with jessica or the baby that things are off with the pregnancy this takes the place of a 2 year time skip with the awakened baby killing the baron so i think they made the right choice for the screen something about a fully awakened toddler just feels wrong in a nonhorror movie 

 does the audience have any understanding that jessica is multiple reverend mothers 

they outright say pretty much this so i would hope so",2024-03-09 15:47:49
i can agree with that esp since little sis is at least half atreides blood however it cant be some puzzle he hasnt put together yet that the bgs manipulate all events since he now feels omnipotent why isnt the challenge against the bgs instead of any particular house or group of houses just go to the source as far as were shown hes the only male with bg training and this makes him capable of doing more than being shuffled around like the other dukes or even the emperor,2024-03-06 04:01:06
" he recognizes that his mother is dangerous but she is still his mother and the only family he has left

its also an easy order to give to an atreides retainer whos already failed his duke that doesnt sound like what hes asking  and do nothing with these foreigners while i die",2024-03-07 22:02:30
meaning house atreides is he taking the throne as house atreides  with an army of 5 who are actually artreides a bene gesserits mother whos harkonnen and a sister whos half harkonnen,2024-03-05 15:05:06
"i think that term however you spell it  was outlined in the first film which was 3 years ago and no one remembers part 2 does not flesh out this concept ever again 

to me villeneuve got  on his creamy palette cgi and forgot to actually tell the story the slow motion visionsfor the umpteenth time instead of just verbalizing some important points for the audience eg if you go south if you drink this blue liquid you will become all seeing all knowing across every known timeline in the universe you will become the quisad whatever then paul can grapple with whether he wants that kind of power or to know the future as much as he wants",2024-03-06 04:54:33
i felt like the reverend mother figured after the whole house fell jessica and paul would be more subservient and be neutralized as a threat i also think she knows there’s a chance paul does make it because of all the groundwork the bg have laid it’s just actually surprising her and upsetting other plans  that paul is that dude,2024-03-04 14:19:20
"yes im not sure if you mean thats supposed to be contradictory to something above

they never got their female paul a pauline if you will for him which was the original plan and trying to overthrow the emperor is risky business so who knows if  succeed and live to be able to marry irulan so again its plans within plans backups of the bloodline none of it has gone as they preferred if youre talking about the husband hes fully aware of what his wife is doing",2024-03-03 17:51:08
that was only in the  prequel books in the original books it was only because the baron was eating all the time ,2024-03-02 19:27:12
" i think in the books the baron was of normal weight and stature first and only becomes morbidly obese because of a disease that he gets infected possibly by a bene gesserit maybe mohiam herself after he forces himself on her i honestly cant remember if that was in one of the later books written by the authors son that arent quite canon compliant and whether that was even mohiam specifically so i have no idea how much any of that is or isnt relevant to the movie timeline

yes it was mohiam and yes its only in the prequel books i doubt dv really cares about them that much",2024-03-04 05:26:27
 i dont remember that flashback,2024-03-03 16:28:16
isnt that what he thinks would happen if he does go south not if he doesnt,2024-03-09 00:10:11
why would you take this comment without reading the books,2024-03-10 07:35:42
exactly either you die or they do and they definitely want you dead too,2024-03-07 09:32:20
touché but a toddler’s arms can’t reach up past their giant head so to  the baron feels way too weird visually the worms were  dope though,2024-03-03 05:20:11

"but people don’t use laz weapons against shields it’s one of the conceits of the story there is a huge sense in making yourself a live bomb if it’s infinitesimally small chance it will go off and the alternative is getting a bullet to the brain 

the shields exist they are used in the movies people don’t ever suggest they don’t use shields because they are afraid of getting blown up they don’t use lazguns because of the blow up chance if robots existed in the universe which they don’t because of the butlerian jihad you could have a remote laz gun turn the patrol into a bomb that would be a good use but we don’t see the fremen doing suicide tactics 

the patrol was getting slaughtered a soldiers suggests shields and he is ordered not to it doesn’t make much sense and that’s okay i loved the movie it’s tough to make concepts gel sometimes when you’re juggling dozens of threads and want a certain visual to occur 

i dont understand your friendly fire comment because one of the reasons why the fremen aren’t using laz guns there they don’t want to friendly fire themselves which means it would make sense to use your shields for the purpose they were built",2024-03-10 14:48:21
" no an atomic explosion occurs both on the shield and on the lasgun as well


that doesnt make very much sense to me do you have a source for that


edit predictable


edit 2 i think its fair to say the mechanics of lasguns and shields in the dune universe arent exactly common knowledge ive read the book and dont remember anything resembling chris claim in there nor can i find anything online about it other than general references to a very large explosion presumably where the laser impacts the shield and some hazy speculation on reddit if someone has a link or quote for me id love to read it


edit 3 alright fair enough still a contrivance with obvious ways around it both tactical sacrificial shooter and technological pulses instead of beams but hey we get spaceships and swordfighting and isnt that what really matters in the end",2024-03-05 05:05:15
"paul explains towards the end of the first book that the guild have foreseen that taking power would have resulted in a golden age followed by their eventual decline and downfall so instead they chose to maintain their current role forever  he says though that they refused to grasp the scepter for so long that their hands have atrophied and they no longer have the strength to grasp it  

the guild need the spice and paul has seized total control of the spice  the guild maintained their balance in the old system but the price of doing that is that theyre now helpless and totally at pauls mercy",2024-03-03 13:04:02
it gets retconned  theyre wearing contacts to hide the fact that they have mega spice addictions and paul notes that they can see the future and that they are navigators but then in messiah they clarify that navigators are the mutant ones that live in the tanks,2024-03-03 12:13:34
no he wasn’t bluffing he really would have destroyed the spice forever the guild members who have a level of precognissance can foresee a future where the spice no longer exists they don’t know how paul would destroy it merely that a possible future exists where he does,2024-03-01 17:47:48
the guild looked ahead and saw he would do it if pushed he was not bluffing  but he new what they would do also destroying the spice by injecting a catalyst like the water of life  into the pre spice blow would  off the sandtrout which are the vector to the worms thus ending the spice cycle forever not nuclear weapons,2024-03-02 18:03:57
"without the landsraad the emperor has no power marrying irulan a bene gesserit  presents no advantage to paul in this situation because the landsraad has already rebelled against the emperor with their presence and refusal

you’re",2024-03-05 18:32:11
the padishah emperor’s whole thing is making sure that none of the great houses in the landsraad gain too much power for example by allowing a single house to amass several planets worth of resources and manpower it’s the whole reason he sends duke leto to arrakis in the first place he was getting too popular among the minor houses and the emperor thought that the atreides would make a move for the throne thus he ships them off to arrakis to be slaughtered by the sarduakar before reinstating the harkonnen a house that he believes is much easier to control,2024-03-04 12:06:58
or atmospheric composition to give that visual effect,2024-03-07 20:31:38
"i’d even say upset is the wrong word he seemed interested imo 

like it’s all been too easy and almost boring up to this point but this is different why of course he must be trying to have me killed 

he didn’t seem offended to me at all he seemed calculating",2024-03-03 03:32:53
right all we got was one line from paul saying that bene gesserit know how to do it,2024-03-02 14:26:53
hard agree i thought he stole every scene he was in even that final battle against paul,2024-03-03 14:53:32
because shes now a foil to paul if anything shes probably pregnant leading into dune 3 if were following messiah so that creates a complex dynamic between her and paul especially since she ran away way better than just being a lovesick puppy she was in messiah lol,2024-03-01 22:04:40
did you somehow read these books and come away with the idea that paul is not in the wrong,2024-03-03 06:30:12
yep a good change for film instead of having whispers or monologues to represent that internal struggle from the books,2024-03-03 18:36:26
you could interpret it as an allegory for islam i suppose but i choose to believe even religious people have free will i suppose this is why dune is such compelling writing so many ways to interpret the messaging,2024-03-01 13:08:52
"isnt that their culture
genuinely asking at least for the millions in the south the religion they follow is very much part of their identity",2024-03-03 08:34:09
you have bottom energy,2024-03-29 15:01:09
still face palming about it,2024-03-15 15:50:26
"the trailer before dune was significantly better than the first full trailer i saw miles ahead 

saturation felt off in the more recent one but that can be waved off as trailer studio decision making",2024-03-04 07:53:19
it gives 300 style comic book vibes to me much more cartoony and less realistic than the first mad max that wasnt even trying to be realistic in the first place looks worse graphically,2024-03-11 01:40:02
im with you it didnt look good,2024-03-03 21:04:31
i kinda liked that tbh,2024-03-19 22:07:17
"in the books they do accept him because he threatened to use the rest of the nukes on the spice fields and literally destroy intergalactic travel itd be like someone blowing up every ship and road in ancient rome in one day 

what makes little sense in the books is that the jihad happens even though everyone submitted to him given his fathers popularity theres no reason the rest of the galaxy would really be that bothered by the corrinos being overthrown especially when their crime of conspiring with the harkonnen came to light and with paul marrying into the family 

denis  i think  made it all make more sense irulan is much more hesitant to marry him clearly is afraid of him and does so only under coercion this much better explains what she does in the next books 

with the landsraad refusing to accept him the war starts right then and there and it makes perfect sense why it starts and we see in people like stilgar and his fanaticism why its going to get so bad 

so honestly denis has stuck to the spirit of the books but also cleaned up some points that didnt make sense hes clearly a terrifying figure that they view as a religious fanatic and are afraid of like irulan",2024-03-07 14:39:47
in before texans and californians go to the movie and somehow take away from it theyre right we have more in common than we thought we should start a civil war,2024-03-02 18:04:16
"allied seems unlikely although war makes strange bedfellows

sharing a common enemy not as hard to believe",2024-03-03 05:13:23
i’m responding to the civil war comment which was in the previews for dune which the person above mentioned  are you illiterate lol,2024-03-03 05:34:34
they have dumb computers not smart computers their navigators use spice to gain a form of prescience that lets them chart a safe course through the stars ai was used for this before the discovery of spice on arrakis but there was an ai war that ended with all smart computers and ai being destroyed and outlawed,2024-03-10 08:44:01
i think from what i saw others comment that’s what spice does it’s like oil but also navigates that may not be entirely accurate tho,2024-03-10 08:20:03
yeah they load up human blobs with spice to navigate,2024-03-24 16:29:22
i have no idea what you just incoherently said dude,2024-03-02 19:12:14
"pretty much everything fremen was spot on and even better than my mental images

it greatly diminished the harkonnen by cutting a lot of their scheming dialogue just turned them into menacing",2024-03-02 18:02:05
he likes “show not tell” which frankly cinema is the medium for we don’t always need pithy dialogue to add exposition or get the point across,2024-03-03 06:18:10
i love denis films but i absolutely do remember movies because of their good dialogue how does he think tarantino occured  even bladerunner that line at the start where gosling says i prefer to eat after the hard part of the day or whatever that is such a good yet haunting and tragic line for the character to deliver so i cant really grasp him saying this as that is one of the first things i think of when i think of bladerunner2049,2024-03-04 03:41:31
hes just saying he hates exposition which is what too much dialog becomes in the end unless youre  allen i agree with every word he says here because i feel exactly the same didnt love oppenheimer for exactly this reason,2024-03-03 09:57:55
bro if a viewer does not associate fremen with islam then i dunno about that viewer the parallels are right there,2024-03-21 08:56:48
totally bizarre like a cd that skipped a track and he didnt just decide he actually must become the messiah he seemed to turn into a violent version of that for no reason didnt he already have a lot of fremen worshipping him,2024-03-05 13:58:15
okay but also they are telepaths so it’s well established they have powers that go beyond mere charisma so it’s pretty clear that is also an extension of that,2024-03-04 03:20:46

"i’d argue dune is not the typical book to movie rendition dune is famous for a type of world building unparalleled in nearly any other literature you literally have to check the glossary to read the book it’s an inherent feature of the original storyline that it requires an external guide to understand everything


besides that this isn’t a big plot line if this is considered a big plot point why wouldn’t you explain how a crysknife is acquired why wouldn’t you explain why there’s only worms in certain parts of the desert why wouldn’t you explain why they have to use spice to navigate why do you lace your boots differently i could come up with hundreds of these questions having read the series and seen the movies there’s simply too much to answer regardless of how short of an explanation it is",2024-03-11 21:13:59
"yeah i did think afterwards theres no way all of that couldve happened in under nine months but watching the movie i was too caught up in it to think about the timeline too much

there were tradeoffs for not having creepy baby alia i think they were worth it they just did have to make tradeoffs",2024-03-04 01:06:27
i thought it was quite slow until he had to accept the jihad then it went fast because he knew each step so how else would it go,2024-03-10 17:40:35
i really cant see the story being changed that much,2024-03-05 03:21:59
in the book she was no characterization other than blindly loving paul and that’s kind of it in the movie she’s much more complex and loves him while also being conflicted about his actions and motives i think it’s a lot more realistic that somebody would be upset that their person they love is marrying someone else even if it is political,2024-03-04 06:37:34
chani will be the hero of movie three because she left paul before the ‘holy war’ and she will end up calling him ‘back to the light’ and saving the souls of the fremen for eternity just wait why adapt these stories if you intend to create your own original plot,2024-03-01 21:38:41
"armies therefore arent trained or equipped with them

the ornithopter crew seemed trained alright so was gurney when he shot that mine he of course was no ordinary soldier but he worked with lowly smugglers at that point so his gear probably reflected what smugglers had access to

also in the movie the ornithopter blocks the first missile with a shield and theres no big boom so i wonder if that part of the lore even applies in the movie granted i may be forgetting this being mentioned in part 1 but even if that was the case then the aforementioned scene seems like an inconsistency",2024-03-01 21:08:59

interesting seems like a pretty major plot point that the movie just completely omitted his entire motivation from the book was essentially left out,2024-03-02 19:06:51

" good lord i see that you really dont understand fhe point that frank herbert makes in this whole story

well considering he wrote the second book because people were not understanding his point maybe he didnt really make his point well and i have only watched the movies although i now started the book super excited to see this world fleshed out but lets get to what i think is the crux between me and you

  paul is not a messiah he is just a man that has powers that are human in this world

dont you see the contradiction in this how is he just a man when he has powers that no other man has ever had 10000 years hundreds of billions maybe trillions of people in all of history and only him has ever managed the seemingly impossible feat to achieve all those powers it might be orchestrated by the bg for centuries and what not but the fact stays that he is the only one who has ever done it he is the definition of super human he transcends humanity he is a  maybe the messiah to some who were waiting for such figure so lets get to the second part of your post about the prophecy

yes i understand that those are all lies to keep the fremen docile and easily exploited but what happens when those lies actually happen what happens when the prophecy becomes the real and the messiah appears as predicted in those fabricated lies they stop being lies

this whole convo was born because i disagreed with someone calling stilgar blinded by faith i stand by that point all those  purported lies are not lies anymore they are just reality he absolutely is the fremen messiah no matter the terrible consequences of that",2024-03-08 10:00:22

yes dune some exciting moments but overall its not an exciting film subjective or not thats my opinion",2024-03-06 20:01:15

"i had a chance to see anatomy in theaters but it was only playing at a theater roughly an hour for me and something came up that day i’ll check it out soon hopefully before the oscars next week 

i think two films that got snubbed this year but it’s pretty tough to fit them in since this year was so competitive were the iron claw and all of us strangers thought andrew scott and zac efron were quite impressive",2024-03-03 05:57:52
thats fine but i assume we would get resolution on it,2024-03-01 06:17:21
because im judging this film on its own merits how on earth am i supposed to judge it on things i have no idea exist i havent read the books and if these movies only work for those who have then they have failed as movies i dont necessarily think that this is the case  the story is fine to follow it is just muddled and messy  but you seem to think the movies should only be judged within the context of the knowledge of the books which is not a good aim to have for this film series,2024-03-03 08:01:59
"ill speak for myself and say that paul and his mom clearly had an agenda that entails the death of millions of people presumably for the greater good and paul utilized his role of lisan algaib to make it happen but i dont see him doing that in the name of starting the holy war was inherently evil perhaps its something that needed to happen in the dune universe


btw i havent read the books or anything just the average moviegoer


also something im not sure about paul was clearly lisan algaib and the prophecy was right right like clearly there was some things that happened according to the prophecy that seemed too unlikely to be chalked down as coincidence desert spring tears reviving lisan algaib",2024-03-03 16:50:57
"why did he write three sequels he actually wrote more than that but the white savior trope isnt even an accurate description of what he was writing about it was more about religious leaders than white saviors and even beyond that he discussed a lot more than religion

but as for the fremen the white savior not only frees the oppressed people but also preserves their culture in effect he becomes a superior version of the best traits of said culture

in this case paul exploits them for his own benefit he changes their culture by turning them into a cult of personality

but many people missed this they did see paul as the white savior because they simply ignored or missed all the signs indicating otherwise",2024-03-04 12:07:08
"bro you took a surface level understanding of a scene and ignored all the other dialogue after such as “i have another gift for you” and the explanation of feyd by the bg you ignored the  expressions on feyd during that entire scene and formed a completely void understanding of feyd as a character yet you blame it on writing 

you want everything spelled out for you

feyd is a different character from his book counterpart your suggestion is for him to have say the artedies are weak but that scene was not depicting a weak fighter you want him to boast but what does boasting accomplish other than weakening the character that was shown to value honor 

you completely missed the point of this scene and that has caused you to misunderstand the final battle it has caused you to feel that rabben and feyd to serve the same purpose but ignore the sudden shift in harkonnen aggression as a result of feyd as compared to rabben 

you also wish to cut 25 minutes out of the film in a section that i like many think is a highlight of the film 

i can’t take your position seriously",2024-03-05 05:09:01
"youre dodging the main part of the question why use the voice on chani at all why did the movie add that and the whole chani disliking her desert spring name bit later revealing that its because the name is part of the prophecy and finally her being forced against her will to be part of making the prophecy seem to be true

most importantly  are you seriously saying that the fremens lisn al gaib prophecy which was outright stated multiple times to be fake is true lol because if youre saying that it was actually chanis tears that helped wake paul up  how the only explanation for why this random fremen woman would have such an ability on top of having the secret name desert spring thats specifically from the fake prophecy  in relation to exactly such a situation would be the prophecy being true paul actually being a true chosen one etc which goes against some of the most important themes of this work

youve got to understand that villeneuve has made changes in the film specifically to avoid people confusing paul to be a real chosen one of the fremens prophecy hes even said it himself in interviews herbert himself regretted that so many people misunderstood paul in this regard after reading the first book as well and here you are still making the same mistake although to be fair its because youre trying to explain whats in the film through the lens of what was in the book",2024-03-02 22:13:53
"how does refusing to acknowledge paul as emperor retain control of the spice all that would do is ensure the spacing guild would refuse to transport their forces and their trade

again i dont know how things go in the novels but as the movie portrays it the great houses and by extent the spacing guild would 100 be onboard with defying fremen leadership and fight back against paul and fremen for the same reason that they are addicted to the spice i dont see this as a contradiction less nuance than in the books sure

and the only purpose to demonstrating that the fremen have the ability to destroy the spice is to force people to surrender and capitulate

exactly but in this universe they did not choose to do that and for logical reasons as i explained above

what do you think its to impress the universe into believing pauls worth following the fremen are holding a loaded gun to the universes head because the entirety of human civilization is dependent on the spice and the people who control that civilization are lethally addicted to it

again exactly that i could not have said it better myself control of the spice cant be given to the fremen who absolutely loathe the imperium

if the harkonnens had merely threatened to limit the production of spice the entire universe would have united against them but if they had the ability to permanently destroy the spice that wouldnt be possibleergo suggesting that the family nukes were sufficient to destroy spice production means that the harkonnens could have seized control directly and simply this is a plot hole

i think the movie is making the argument that absolutely no one would hinder spice production but the fremen which is why nuking the entire planet is an ok substitution than what is used in the novels

the fremen with pauls prescience become the only ones capable of having full control of the spice and ability to obliterate anybody who defied them",2024-03-06 21:05:12
