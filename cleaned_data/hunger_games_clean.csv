somehow managed to be disturbingly violent but also bloodless,2023-11-17
snow prob sometime in the near future yeah …so can we do away with the whole putting them in zoo cages and no showerschange of clothes  from when they are chosen to basically the games   they smell like literal ,2023-11-17

i do wish hunters role as tigris was bigger but that last line of you look just like your father was brutal,2023-11-17
would they have dropped the games if it wasnt for snows manifesto on how to improve and make the game into a great spectacle since the viewers werent interested,2023-11-17
those crappy drones cracked me up,2023-11-17
as someone who didn’t read the books i genuinely thought snow was going to shoot lucy in the cabin good tension building they did a good job of showing his descent into madness despite the pacing issues,2023-11-17
the tributes looked like actual kids this time around rather than casting adults to play children in the first hunger games i think the only one that passed was rue and that was pretty intentional,2023-11-17
"i thought it was fantastic personally the writing in ballad is more sophisticated than the others and that translates well enough to the screen

i usually just read everyones discussions on this subreddit but the movie sat with me long enough to make me want to chip in random thoughts

 couldnt disagree more with complaints about pacing the three act structure works really well for me we expect stories to lead up to a giant climactic conclusion and tie up loose ends with a quick scene or two to me thats less natural than what ballad offers a proportionate before during and after the games each is important to snows development as a villain the third act is frustrating because its the ending to a tragedy
 speaking of snow i like how this story shows he is an unadulterated sociopath you can empathize with his feelings  his frustrations with sejanus unpragmatic attempts at benevolence his care for tigris and grandmam his affection for lucy gray  but he only ever acts to use these people as fuel for his own goals the book is more deliberate about that dissociation via the internal monologue but the movie pulls it off too theres no mistaking this guy for an antihero hes a villain
 clean editing particularly liked the shotreverse shot of snow seeing lucy gray in the tv to the live reaping there wasnt any filler movie couldnt have gone much longer anyway its already 2h38m
 production design was great i dont remember what year these stories are meant to take place but definitely seemed like a 1950s60s cold war style in the broadcast reminiscent of the reallife golden age of television the capitol evokes that same era too maybe more soviet than america cmon look at that statue if you go back and look at hunger games or catching fire the capitol architecture has become much more fascistbrutalist
 acting was great hunter schafer looks perfect as tigris jason kills the comedic relief the throwaway line about the dinner reservation made me chuckle and viola davis is terrifying tom blyth and rachel zegler had good chemistry and even if her accent is a little questionable i thought zegler did a great job bringing the songs to life",2023-11-18
"jason schwartzman killed it as flickerman

i want him to make weather reports especially now that david lynch doesnt do them anymore",2023-11-17
"a good albeit uneven movie

 world building was great it was actually interesting to see how poorly the initial iterations were planned and executed
 performances were great especially jason schwartzman as lucky flickerman him doing weather reports in between the deaths were hilarious
 lucy gray was a compelling character i can never tell if shes genuine or playing up to survive
 deaths in the games felt more personal because of the enclosed area 
 3rd act felt rushed and snow made a 180 very quickly

would love to see different hunger games prequels specifically haymitch abernathys",2023-11-17
"after nearly a decade of everyone on this sub complaining about mockingjay being a twoparter the constant calls in this thread for ballad to have been a twoparter as well are driving me insane lol i know for a fact you guys would be  if theyd actually done the thing youre suggesting right now you probably wouldnt have even bothered to see the first one if theyd split it into two parts and theres not even a good place to split the movie either

i feel like the studio head for the itchy  scratchy show in that one simpsons episode you kids dont know what you want thats why youre still kids  cause youre ",2023-11-18
im not a fan of how they changedshortened the betrayal of sejanus but of all the additions in the move i enjoyed coryo calling his  out for his privilege most that he could afford to be reckless because of his fathers influence which was no longer a luxury provided to snow i did always think of sejanus as sweetly  in his obvious rebellious actions but that added another layer to me as to why he felt he could almost openly be treasonous,2023-11-17
"as a book reader and one who considers this the best or second best of the four books i understand the criticism that this book doesn’t translate well into a film i think the driving force behind why i loved the book is the same thing that has it struggle as a film which is snow’s internal monologue 

it is so intriguing how hypocritical his thoughts are and how he will in the same breath criticize someone and then do the same exact thing but of course for him it’s okay and the movie did an okay job showing that but it definitely got lost in translation also just the juxtaposition of how charismatic he was externally but how toxic he was internally 

putting that aside i have to say my biggest criticism was the cut of ma i think she should’ve been included i also didn’t love how they condensed the mentor timeline to add more arena timeline and also how they had cameras in the tunnel i get why they have to for a movie the need for action but i didn’t like it 

i did love flickerman though he was so corny and great comic relief i think sejanus’s hanging was very well done much better than how i imagined that scene when i read it",2023-11-17
"jason schwartzman as the comic relief was perfect because it wasnt like the marvely punch lines to lighten a dark moment it was just an absurd narcissist saying wild things it fit the worldnarrative so well while making me giggle to myself as children were dying

on another note the book was amazing but i really liked this more mostly due to rachel zeglers singingand viola davis being insaneand peter dinklage just being perfect honestly everything in this movie was great fantastic adaptation the crew should be really proud",2023-11-17
my favorite part is the janky drones everyone shoulda just spammed that it wouldve been glorious,2023-11-18
i loved lucius lucky flickerman a man who needs no introduction whose introduction of himself somehow gets longer every time we hear it,2023-11-19
"read the book when it came out and really enjoyed it

few thoughts on the movie

everything up through snow becoming a peacekeeper felt really long everything after felt really rushed  snow descending into madness needed more time  

lucys accent was justdistracting they should have dropped that early on

for the most part the movie felt and looked like i imagined the book while i was reading  

i generally liked it but i think it sorta suffered from similar issues at the mockingjay moviesnot spending enough time getting into the head of the main character to really understand what they were going through",2023-11-17
i really just wished they did something about his internal monologues it would’ve shown perfectly that there was no transition from hero to villain he’s always been narcissistic and in every scenario it’s just him finding a reason to justify what he did especially the ending  hunger games must continue because it’s a reminder of who we are aka it showed me i am horrible so then everyone must be horrible too,2023-11-17
"you look just like your father 

such a cold seething line really solidified snows descent for me",2023-11-21
am i the only one who thought snow had mercy on lucy gray when he gave her rat poison i thought he gave it to her to  herself as the last resort since she had a very low chance to survive,2023-11-18
i was half expecting there was going to be a transition from young snow to old snow at the end of the movie especially that last shot wouldve been cool to see donald sutherland play him again instead of hearing just his voice,2023-11-18
did rachel zegler think her character was born and raised deep in the heart of texas,2023-11-17
id never seen viola davis in a role quite like this and she was amazing,2023-11-18
"this movie kind of slayed but i’m a sucker for this series and the teen dystopian novel era

my friend who i saw it with pointed out that later on snow hates katniss so much because she reminds him of lucy gray the little curtsybow was even the same i haven’t read this book yet but i plan to now didn’t even know a prequel had come out until the movie trailer dropped lol",2023-11-17
the movie was better than i expected tom blyth was superb,2023-11-18
"stripping away the scifi technology and pageantry from the first hunger games movie really emphasizes the brutality of the capitol and the games much more effectively here

overall i thought it was a great movie though with some pacing issues near the end but the performances in this movie slapped though i wouldnt have expected anything less from viola davis tom blyth as snow was the perfect choice",2023-11-19
the author was cooking with the snow lands on top line,2023-11-21
anybody else hope when they showed his face staring into the camera at the end that it was going to morph into the old snow,2023-11-17
you know its a good movie when it haunts you i watched it and ive been thinking about it all day all the complex characters and their relations and motives wow the movie felt really realistic and suzanne collins really is a mastermind for coming up with believable explanations on how the games changed overtime,2023-11-18
"it seems to me that lucy’s intent was never to  snow she set it up in a way so that he would think she’s trying to  him so he would not have to choose between herthe outdoor lifestyle and his capital lifefamilypower if he’s under the impression she wants him dead he has no reason to stay essentially she gives him an easy way out because she did love him this also gives her time to escape from him who is clearly unstable and no longer trustworthy 

the snake under the scarf assuming it wasn’t there by coincidence is also a test to see how he would react had he been calmer instead of trying to shoot her she may have considered staying or talking it out 

i think most likely it was both as even if snow failed her test which he did she wouldn’t resort to  again like snow does so easily snow is projecting his readiness to ",2023-11-21
"i should preface by saying ive never read the book and went into it blind

for a moment i was worried lucy grey would get pregnant without telling snow and we would find out that katniss was related to snow this entire time especially after she mentioned the plant

also its no wonder why snow was so rattled when katniss sang the hanging tree in those propos was it just me or when lucy grey was singing it was blended with jennifer lawrences voice i swear it sounded super similar",2023-11-17
i swore sejanus and snow were gonna kiss,2023-11-18
"i like how the rules were lax and the technology was pretty primitive in those days 

 district residents could mix with peacemakers in buildings
 it was easier to escape id like to believe lucy escaped
 residents had more freedom to do activities eg go swimming in the lake 

and then of course snow had to come along",2023-11-22
when snow pitched all his ideas for the revamped games he ultimately caused his own downfall by giving katniss a platform to rally panem during her games,2023-11-18
i actually enjoyed the movie quite a bit i had read the 3rd act wasn’t good but i didn’t have an issue with it if it had been made into a two parter a lot more people would have complained that part would have  it would have faired worse than mockinjay part 2 i think it was the better move to keep it as one movie overall,2023-11-17
"the whole time watching the movie i kept wanting to know what happened between coriolanus and tigris 

the first time i ever seen viola davis having a blast in her performance shes usually in heavy drama and this is really not something we get to see her in often 

also in the 3rd act rachel zegler keep pronouncing coriolanus cornelius instead that really bugs me 

overall its a great movie i really enjoyed it and makes me want to read the book",2023-11-18
anybody noticed the scene where snow stared at the bow and arrows in the arena,2023-11-19

"hunger games the musical


no seriously rachel zegler just bust out in song like a dozen times i started rolling my eyes by the latter half of them they really could have cut some of that out 


also i dont believe that was tom blyth in the third act it was eminem from 1999 who time traveled to star in this movie",2023-11-17
"man i literally cried when that tribute carried all the bodies of the fallen and covered them from the capitals view i wonder how many other contestants did other little acts of defiance but it wasnt televised 

i thought the movie was brilliant i didn’t read the book but i could easily fallow snows descent into madness the violence felt very heavy despite not seeing any blood especially the cries of the bird near the hanging tree 


i loved lucy greys character accent and all",2023-11-18
"i am curious how people will perceive sejanus on reddit i personally like him but if people view him as flailing and naive and does not use his privilege in an effective way 

that aside i do think they made a point of making a lot of the tributes even more tragic this time granted they felt less defined than in other ones but so many of them look younger than 16 they look constantly dirty and or sick or injured way more than any of the previous movies that little girl had to be younger than 14 

i’m not sure how audiences will view a young snow if they did too much to make him sympathetic for me that goes out the window with how he treats sejanus one of his few close friends who now i wonder if he was friends with him at all 

also i’m not sure about anyone else but he existence of the covey these music base traveller group makes district 12 fate in the future movies even more tragic whether it was by snows had or not but the complete destruction of literally the last ray of light in this community the destruction of the culture like this is one of the only times and places in the franchise where people are happy in the district by katniss era they are so beaten down they just work to survive with countless constantly starving it makes me sick 

like others have said or will say this should have been like a 46 limited series",2023-11-17
i swear rachel zeglers accent vanished for the middle hour of the movie,2023-11-17
"i read the book several times  just got back from the movie and loved it  i was aware of the changes that were made between the two but this is one time when i think the changes were necessary and actually made the movie better  they consolidated certain things so they flowed better and they sped up the third act which really dragged in the book  the games also moved a bit more quickly which worked as well  

the scene where lucy wins the games was amazing  and so much better than the book in which it is fairly anticlimactic  i feel like i would go back and watch it again just to see that scene  

much like in the book you understand why snow becomes what he becomes but he still isnt completely sympathetic  tom blyth did a great job  all of the actors did really  viola davis was amazing  im sure people will pick this movie apart and trash it but as a big fan of all of the books i thought this was a fantastic adaptation",2023-11-18
love the range of diverse tributes this time around,2023-11-17
i loved how they made janis  a sort of face value protester like he cared but only the righteous parts the dark part of what changed involved was not something he assumed he very much was a person who loved to play rebel but knew he had mom and daddy as a safety net  in his last moments with the other rebels they stood stoic but he pleaded the entire even his last words calling for his mother,2023-11-17
i just got out movie was fantastic to me granted i didn’t read the books but i like how dark it was and the retro aspect like no fancy arena and drones,2023-11-20
"the scene in the cabin was intense as  i love how lucy catches on quick that something was off with snow

“the world changes awfully fast”

 i like how they made another strong female character without having to resort to katniss clone who fights good",2023-11-20
how was this movie simultaneously so long and yet so rushed mindboggling that they didn’t make this at least two parts,2023-11-17
really enjoyed it as a book reader but ive never felt the limitations of a 12apg13 rating more in a movie the scene where a mentor gets stabbed in the neck with a broken bottle and there is zero blood was borderline comical understand why but wish they could have pushed for a higher age rating also the mainline hunger games movie did a much better job working within the limits,2023-11-17
"i enjoyed it but did anyone else confused with the voice recording at the hanging i hadn’t read the book but it sounded like they played snow and plinth talking so when lucy didn’t understand why snow said he killed 3 people i had no idea  was going on i assumed she already knew  
i feel like that could’ve been conveyed better as it is really important to understand his deception to lucy it’s the big turning point in their relationship  
snow murdering that woman in cold blood earlier on was also rushed over i think everyone’s reactions just seemed strange and they all just accepted it  
  
just my nitpicks i still thought this movie was great",2023-11-17
"this movie is really great the theater cheered at the end great casting acting sets story based off of a book of course and worldbuilding just to find out it received mediocre reviews what gives im no movie critic but this was a very good film

the main character does show a real life hypocrite attitude by criticizing others for their wrongdoing and then does the same behind their backs i love that side to him i wish we got more out of his crazy mind since i cant imagine this movies character becoming the snow from the original books his character does show a lot of innocence but then can be cruel a minute later which didnt really chime with me thats my only criticism but very good character overall 

will there be another one or is this it for a prequel",2023-11-17
"i have read the book and now seen the movie and i think snow is a different character in the two of them 

in the book his thoughts are hypocritical all throughout he does truly care about lucy gray but the prize stays above everything however you can still see his motives and how the world has shaped him to be the way he is

in the movie possibly due to the lack of internal monologue i found myself rooting for him in the beginning though it may have only been because he was a good liar he seemed to really care at first there were hints such as his hesitation at lucy gray’s kiss and when he was asked if he’d support her even if there was no prize but the acting made it seem like he wanted her to live i feel that this made his descent into madness more sad rather than me hating him due to good writing i felt bad for him rather than coming into the story with him broken and seeing the story with his broken morals i felt that i was watching him break

both the book and the movie left me thinking it has been a few years since i read the book and i think it’s time for a reread i preferred the book to the original series and i think that may be true for the film adaptation as well i think as long as they are well written movies about broken people will resonate more with me than those about brave heroes

tom blyth’s portrayal of snow and his descent into madness was very well done i liked the costuming as well it’s not something i normally notice but the hairstyles seemed thought out especially for snow he starts out with the loose curly hair when he’s closest to being likeable then gets a buzz cut when he’s forced to straighten up and ends the movie with a haircut i’m not sure what to call but one that definitely fits the character he ends as",2023-11-19
"there was an incredible shot when snow was talking to lucy in the tunnel in act 3

snow’s face was covered in darkness despite having a bright background and lucy’s face was illunimiated while having the dark tunnel behind her

lucy tries to bring light to the darkness while snow infects the light with darkness",2023-11-19
such a good movie  easily my favorite hunger games movie it’s dark  gritty you really empathize with the tributes this time around hard disagree on people saying the movie should’ve been two parts— for what just like with mockingjay by the time the second part comes out you have to recaptivate everyone’s attention it was easier with mockingjay but this was the return of the hunger games universe  probably wouldn’t have worked as well with audiences also this movie being split up would’ve messed with coriolanus’ descent into evil as we saw it unravel piece by piece in the film i would’ve loved the movie to be a little longer but had no problems with the pacing  storytelling hoping we get the 4 hour directors cut soon,2023-11-22
"you know it wasn’t bad…

but it kept going after the games and i wasn’t as into that not to mention for a movie as long as this was the ending felt very rushed i felt coriolanus’s turn was pretty out of nowhere and unearned i didn’t leave with a feeling that he earned that epiphany at the end",2023-11-17
"i have a lot of criticisms such as
 the one everyone will mention the pacing and lengthiness
 the odd accents tom blyth was trying to keep that american going and rachel zegler’s voice was… ummmm
 the lack of visual craft in comparison to the original series watched catching fire again when i got home from this and it was so beautiful and visually striking compared to this movie
 the overuse of music i have read the book and i understand that these songs were included there but in a movie where much else is cut out we did not have time to include all of these songs and keep the movie going imo
 clunky dialogue we started off bad with “you’re the best cousin” to tigris and we had some other pretty bad lines in there
 sejanus my boyfriend watched this as someone who hadn’t read the book and was able to boil down the issues with his character to a simple statement “he was just boring” sejanus is really just a foil with more screen time than he deserved in this movie which was disappointing compared to his character in the book i found my mind wandering whenever he was on screen

yet still with all of these critiques and more something just worked for me here i think that a lot of it came down to blyth and davis’s performances which both elevated and exceeded the material and blyth and zegler’s chemistry the film has a bunch of interesting ideas that it doesn’t really flesh out the book had a similar problem but it was lessened in a lengthy novel whereas it was exacerbated in the film with the constraint of screen time 

i think a lot of the film’s strength comes down to the solidity of its lore we as an audience know panem we know katniss and we know how the games work the film recognizes that it’s a prequel quite well and uses this to its advantage much of the movie spends its time explaining how the hunger games that we know came to be with its excess and its showmanship it does the same with snow’s character the 25 hours successfully turns a charismatic empathetic young man into a nowiconic literary villain and it just feels entertaining on a very basic level

i don’t think it’ll reach the classic status of the original movies but it’s something that i’d rewatch on a flight or on a rainy day it may not successfully start a new franchise as a lot of worldexpansions aim to but that doesn’t feel like the goal here the goal seems to be to explain and expand the hunger games world and it does that quite successfully it didn’t leave me wanting another film with these characters but i’d love some more content from this world if it’s able to match this quality consistently",2023-11-17
"the structure of this movie reminded me of full metal jacket this absolutely would have bombed if they split it into two parts thats a dumb idea

also josh andres rivera is a dead ringer for a young vincent donofrio change my mind",2023-11-18
"i thought this was absolutely fantastic nuanced storytelling complex characters and maybe its just me but emotionallycharged despite the limited screentime for some of the cast everyone brought their best here not a single weak performance to be found i was gripped the entire runtime and never felt an ounce of boredom i just wish they went the extra mile and gone a full three hours for the sake of the last act but im still very pleased

i truly think this is leagues above the other four hunger games films",2023-11-17
"random thoughts

 dont understand the mixed reactions at all to me this was the best hunger games movie by a wide margin

 the pacing was up and down but the plot was so engaging that i never felt like the movie lost me with its pacing 

 the main actors were all good snow and lucy grey especially killed it wayyyyyy better than those wet paper bags peeta and gale 

 those mockingjay screams after each execution will haunt me all night totally wasnt expecting that

 i wouldve appreciated some time cut from the games to focus on the third act

 people say it came out of nowhere but to me snows turn was pretty well communicated he got given 2 opportunities to start a new life and join a cause he thought he supported joining the rebels andor running away with lucy grey but when push came to shove he chose his personal gains over both 

 lucy grey was an absolutely fascinating character to watch she was never the symbol of purity and straight as arrow heh moral compas that katniss was she clearly had a dark and manipulative side to her since the very beginning and it became more and more evident by the end she doesnt even flinch when snow kills mayfair or when he lets spruce take the fall for the murders she only gets alarmed after seeing snow also sell his best friend out which means she will never be safe with him hence the stone cold betrayal at the end

 this worked so well as a single movie wouldve had nowhere near the level of excitement and pull if it was spread over a tv show or two movies

 the idea of a sequel is farfetched but i want one so bad snows arc seems pretty complete but i desperately want to see more of lucy grey",2023-11-18
should have been a mini series but all the actors did fantastic the cinematography was well done you could tell that the director used different framing intentionally highly recommend if you liked the series before,2023-11-17

the down syndrome tribute broke my heart so much she was oblivious to what was going on and she lasted so long as well i wonder if the other tributes let her live out of sympathy i can’t imagine it being me and her and making the decision to  her,2023-11-21
"i liked the movie its a welcome return to the surprisingly decent hunger games series of movies which is better than most ya adaptations the other imo being the maze runner trilogy

that said act iii feels hella rushed snows change from a broken human being to a cold sociopath because he killed the three men the last one is directly by his choice and his conscience even and lucy gray left him felt abrupt and sudden feels like the things we see in the games should be the climax while snows slow change should be pushed to the second movie felt like them adapting the book in 1 movie when it has such a dense story is a mistake

also this movie is also partially a musical not really a fan of musicals in general but they surprisingly made it work here i didnt feel like cringing when hearing these songs love the backstory of the hanging tree tying very neatly to snows decent had a feeling it would go viral again the same way it was 10 years ago",2023-11-17
"the reports from test screenings earlier this year claim this film was around 3 hours long and after watching it i really wish they would have just left it alone instead of cutting out a bunch of scenes they should have just committed to a 3 hour epic if they were so adamant in not splitting the book in two 

i felt like everything was rushed even before the third act there was no room for the characters to breathe and they cut out too much from the book in my opinion 

in saying that all the performances were great the casting for this franchise has always been top notch the production design was fantastic as well i really hope they release a longer cut with the physical release this film could have been great",2023-11-19
"didnt read the book and my initial impression of the trailer was why do we need this but i really enjoyed getting the backstory and expansion of the lore 

honestly it felt really bittersweet that snow and lucy may have ended up together but in the high pressure situations they were  into they couldnt shake the lingering thought that they each had ulterior motives

i guess im more invested in the story of panem than i previously thought wouldnt be upset if we get more movies leading to the timeline of the original film",2023-11-19
those first two parts were just amazing i was fully into it the world building was so interesting and i just loved everything going on that third part slows down to a crawl and becomes a very different movie brings the score down for me but that ending mostly made up for it best hunger games film ever for me,2023-11-17
i enjoyed it tom’s acting was great and the songs were awesome i laughed at “tuberculosis on legs”,2023-11-18
"i haven’t read the book so forgive me if im wrong

one detail i like is that throughout the film it was unclear whether lucy gray was acting out of love or survival we are strictly looking at it through snow’s pov so a lot of it is romanticism but i felt like there were hints she was more pragmatic and selfaware than she acted

great performance",2023-11-20
"i just got out of a showing of this and i have to say it was spectacular i read and watched the original series however i had not read this book  i am someone who watches a ton of movies i love letterboxd and work in the industry  i did not watch the trailer for this i havent watched trailers in about 5 years now and it makes movies 1000x more enjoyable 

  
id recommend this movie to anyone and everyone  it had wonderful easter eggs for the original films but it held its own  my only gripe was the opening scene i wanted the moment they were behind the statue to last much longer to really show the violence of what was happening 

  
acting was superb by the whole cast with a huge shout out to the three leads zegler blyth and davis were remarkable soundtrack was phenomenal mixing was wonderful production and costume design was superb just like the originals  there were some gorgeous shots in this film really wonderful lighting and overall cinematography 

i was blown away by it i truly loved it  in fact my only criticism was i wish we had another 2030 minutes in act 3 literally defined in the movie there was quite a rush at the end and i think having a bit more time to let blyth really expand on snows personality change would have done wonders 

  
really no complaints loved it go watch it",2023-11-17

the actor playing snow reminded me of paul walker mixed with freddie prinze jr mixed with hayden christensen but a better actor than all of them

can someone explain why lysistrata agreed to send water to her own tribute knowing that the rabies made him afraid of water maybe i’m misunderstanding the scene did she feel like jessup was already beyond saving so snow convinced her to help lucy instead",2023-11-20
"seeing a lot of comments about snow always having been a sociopath but i’m not sure i feel that’s the case did not read this book though so maybe it’s more the case there i thought snow being a complicated protagonist was what made the whole movie i thought he was a great main character 

obviously by the end he’s fallen to the dark side but i felt like it was a gradual descent marked by a few major events and people he does care and love his family and i do believe he loved lucy or at least the idea of her i think he cared for sejanus as well i mean breaking news here sociopaths don’t cry from guilt and loss alone in private they just don’t 

i think lucy actually may be closer to what we define as a sociopath i didn’t feel that anything she did the entire movie was genuine i think she was a well rehearsed act from the moment she was reaped and very likely even before that i think she did everything she needed to in order to survive and i think snow was never someone she actually cared for i think even saving his life was strategic and only made when she calculated correctly that she wouldn’t make it in an escape she wears a mask the whole film and i’m not sure we ever see it lifted except briefly when she floats the idea that she could ruin him with a word 

highbottom was also obviously a major catalyst in pushing snow to what he became classic tragedy of great intentions but his actions directly created snow and his own demise had he at any point tried to see snow as something other than the son of his enemy his whole arc could have potentially been avoided i genuinely think had snow gotten that prize day 1 he doesn’t become the president snow we know 


not to say he’s a good guy his seeds were always there for selfishness arrogance and violence but i disagree that he’s a sociopath and i do think his descent could have been avoided",2023-11-21
just a thought  snows experience in the woods with lucy would be why he eventually makes the forrest off limits taking away the one good thing they had living in district 12 the reason lucy wanted to stay there,2023-11-27
"as another comment mentioned i really don’t think we need more of these splitpart movies and i’m glad we got a fully formed narrative here even though i think this one would’ve been better suited as a miniseries 

songbirds and snakes part one would’ve been portraying snow as too sympathetic and as the clear hero while part two would veer too far the opposite direction when his characterisation is more layered than that and i think they did a decent job with him given the lack of an internal monologue you could get from the book however that might be more of a credit to tom blyth’s performance than the script",2023-11-17
"i absolutely adored the movie 

it has some pacing issues like the book but overall has excellent acting a gripping story  beautiful visuals

i’m hoping i can catch again on the big screen in next couple of weeks well worth the return to panem",2023-11-18
were they afraid to split this movie in two,2023-11-17
i wasn’t gonna see this but maybe i will,2023-11-17
first half was great second half left me wanting more like where is lucy gray curious to see if this ever gets continued,2023-11-17
"jennifer lawrence believable southern accent in winters bone doesnt bring it back for hunger games despite district 12 being in appalachia still delivers a criticallyacclaimed performance as katniss that propels her to superstardom

rachel zegler never acted with a southern accent before attempts one for appalachian crooner lucy gray doesnt really nail it",2023-11-17
i forgot how dark these movies were as a casual fan of the earlier films i had no expectations going into this and enjoyed it for the spectacle it was rachel zegler was lovely as lucy gray as were all her folk songs i forgot how good her voice was i was definitely rooting for snow and lucy throughout so its not exactly how i expected it would turn out is it possible snow was being paranoid and lucy had accidentally dropped his mothers scarf while a snake just happened to be under there lucy is such a mysterious character that you never really get to know throughout which in turn makes it all the more mysterious that we never find out her fate beyond this movie,2023-11-21
just saw it i read a bunch of reviews beforehand that complained about a rushed endingi honestly dont know what they are talking about i thought the ending was strong and well paced i thought the whole movie was great if you liked the other hunger games movies youll like this,2023-11-17
im not the biggest hunger games movie fan and stopped watching them after the catching fire but i have got to admit i really enjoyed this movie in my opinion this hands down the best movie in the hunger games franchise,2023-11-17
sejanus’ actor has the exact same voice as matt damon,2023-11-18
i was skeptical about it being a 25 hourlong film but it didnt feel excruciatingly long to me and id easily take this over a part 1 and part 2 after mockingjay the film did a great job showing snows fall to darkness and the tone is consistent with the original trilogy the production design and costumes really sell the setting as a vintage version of panem rachel zegler and tom blyth turn in fantastic complex performances and chemistry here i didnt read the book so the build in tension really made me had me on the edge of my seat wondering what would happen as coryo and lucy gray went into the woods,2023-11-22
is it me or does peter dinklage always seem to play alcoholics,2023-11-21
i know there’s years between but i feel like there’s a disconnect between young snow and old snow old snow was having fun with malice this young one doesn’t seem to enjoy it but i guess that happens over time,2023-11-17
i just watched this with my friends last night and one of them looked at me and asked with a straight face if lucy grey was supposed to be katniss’s mom,2023-11-17
"it was pretty good solid 810
especially hunger games scenes were intense and tbh it was better and more realistic casting than first movie
i find rachel sometimes cringe but it was tolerable",2023-11-17
"i personally dont mind not knowing what happened to lucy at the end  imo this was snows story not hers 

the singing was not bad but it also felt out of place in the first half i could see the guy next to me whip out his phone the moment lucy started singing during the reaping  it felt like a disney moment

a very good experience overall 910",2023-11-18
nobody is talking about viola davis she really carried this for my friends and i,2023-11-19
this movie was so  good far and away my favorite of the series incredible,2023-11-23
i went in completely blind and i enjoyed it i think it kept a good pace and the story felt well rounded to me,2023-11-17
not as good as catching fire or hunger games but better than both mockingjays imo  solid and good movie  tom blythe was good as  and performances were good  surprised this felt more in tone like mockingjay and grittier than that of catching fire  way darker than expected but was good  i can see how some critics didnt like it though,2023-11-19
ngl the singing started to irritate the  out of me,2023-11-17
"this definitely felt like it should have either been a twoparter or a mini series i liked the movie but it felt as if they adapted the sparknotes rather than the book itself they cut a lot of stuff from the book but the stuff they kept in was very well done

on the plus side i really liked all of the performances—excellent casting—and the worldbuilding",2023-11-17
really loved the soundtrack in this movie and the bluegrass inspiration they took especially with nothing you can take from me it really sounds like the song little sparrow which i found interesting,2023-11-17
moral of the story life is hunger games who are you victor or loser ,2023-11-23
"tom blythe was truly good here i have no idea who he is but he and rachel zegler did have chemistry that carried this film 

but just what everyone is saying last act was rushed it could have ended when the games ended 

my favorite character is the cousin though she just exudes the kindness and purity and serves as an anchor to snow her last line of “i think you look just like your father” was perfectly delivered",2023-11-19
rachel zegler does a great ricky bobby impression,2023-11-17
i kinda loved it i was worried about all the singing the first song at the reaping was kind of cringe but other than that i thought it was awesome it’s long but never drags,2023-11-19
"why was the main girl plucked from a disney movie bad outfit and all forced to have a inconsistent southern accent and the singing pleasekatnisss song was iconic because of the context and how jennifer lawrence couldnt really sing

its like her character was transported from another universe that had nothing to do with the movie",2023-12-25
"i can totally see why people were saying it shouldve been split into two however i would have liked to see it split right in the middle of the 10th hunger games if that were the case too much of the mentor interaction was cut as is  the extra running time would have given some space to breathe if the latter part of the action was pushed over to the second movie also the third arc peacekeeper would probably have felt dragged out if it were given a standalone treatment

that being said as a book reader im satisfied with this adaptation despite its flaws the retrofuturistic notquiterecovered image of the capitol is just like how i imagined it and the action in the arena was intense",2023-11-17
i liked the first two thirds of this movie not so much the last third,2023-11-18
"“enjoy to the show” and the jabber jays is hella sinister and ominous i feel like and i haven’t read the books or watched the other movies in a while snow is playing chess while everyone else is playing checkers i think he understood something that made him know to stay in line and play the part so that one day he could have the right conditions again to permanently bring peace it had to come from the people uniting themselves 

plutarch and snow went to school together and snow notices everything he knew what he was doing when bringing on plutarch in the later movies 

he hated district 12 because of what it meant to him not katniss but he saw the opportunity to make things right like he should have when he started 

he knew how to play the part and to use his money and status to one day make the permanent change

again i have not read the books or rewatched the movies just my take from watching it with little prior knowledge",2023-11-19
just saw it expected nothing really and ended up liking it a lot definitely better than the first one imo,2023-11-21
that last line that tigris said to snow,2023-11-25
"it was hit a little harder in the book but i like how gaul is just seeing what she wants to in the games every time people are given a choice even in the arena they choose to help each other 

they become animals and  each other when you make them yeah or if you convince them its the only way see how quickly even the ringleader of the gang broke when she saw that the killimg was for nothing she had strangled the human inside her just like snow does at the end but he never has to face that lie cause it works and dies laughing 65 years later because that kind of cold blooded pragmatism is still being chosen by those in power after the second war",2023-11-27
"great movie man i think this was very well directed and although a lot happens except for a rushed 3rd act it was paced really well first of all credit to the storytelling i was engaged throughout and very early you do feel for both the leads there was definitely good chemistry between the leads and both blyth and zegler were brilliant throughout you are thoroughly invested whether they end up together or not in the end the other characters were fine too particularly elevated by the actors such as dinklage and davis

the visuals and score were competent it does feel like a big movie despite having a reasonable budget of 100m more studios should take note on budget efficiency

the games themselves were not as interesting as in the og series but there were enough memorable moments the scene where one of the tributes carries all the fallen tributes and places them in the centre and lays the flag of panem on top of them was excellently done

collins has a fantastic grasp on creating complex lead characters and it is the same here snow is easy to root for the most part blyths charm helps but you also see how he is fighting against many odds to relift his family to their past glory its the ambition in him to become successful in the den of snakes which is the capitol which does not seem evil at least before part 3 begins which drives him whereas for lucy she just wants to survive and live life having been dealt an unfair hand by being chosen as a tribute

but things get interesting when both the leads fall for each other you are left questioning whether they really are in love indeed were they just trying to gain advantage from the other like it is easy to see why snow helps lucy and is keen to see her win as his eyes are on the plinth prize which will get him a seat at the university whereas lucy relies on snow as a lone source of help in the dangerous capitol and for the games too but by the end of part 2 you are left convinced that they indeed had something real between them lucy does save snow after the explosion in the arena whereas she could have run away and for his part snow is genuinely concerned for her safety when the games end

in part 3  starts to fall apart i think it is funny how its snow who is the one on the lookout for lucy which is why he bargains to be sent to d12 whereas while lucy is happy to see him it does seem she has moved on comfortably back to her new life snow at this point seems more concerned with lucy than her with him even after first seeing each other it is snow once again who searches for her and finds her in the woods i do feel at this point snow has real love for her whereas lucy does not seem too into him however once snow sees a way out back to the capitol and a chance to redeem himself his ambitions take precedence over his love while this does paint him wrong one has to see that these ambitions have been in his head since forever 

i do feel that snow still values lucy and wants to take her back to the capitol but it is lucys fragile love for snow which immediately makes her question him and the relationship in the lakehouse i feel snow would not have harmed lucy until she raised the possibility that she is the last loose end that is when his ambitions take over because lucy can possibily be a threat to his long lasting dream

as for lucy it is understandable why she would be wary of snow firstly he is not being 100 truthful to her and she realizes that for his ambitions he got his close friend of old killed so why is she special

the love story has a hint of tragedy tbh things change instantly with a few accidentally uttered sentences which plant the seed of mistrust between the two it does show that their romance was fragile and in its budding stages and perhaps neither was fully committed to the other

this feeds into the main theme of the movie that the hunger games exist to represent the true violent  selfish nature of humans snow and lucy had something beautiful in the making but slight missteps cause it all to crumble and fall apart great story tbh and snow  lucys relationship is a memorable one particularly how it continues to affect snow decades later too as we see in the og series

its the things we love most that destroy us",2023-12-10
not enough praise for the wicked but not overdone villainess performance by viola davis,2023-12-14
this movie was  awesome i’ve only read the first three books so i went into this blind but i thought it was so good i have no idea how critics are giving this anything less than a 610 it’s objectively super entertaining,2023-11-20
i liked it a lot more than i thought i would if i had any complaints its that the last act felt pretty long while the rest of the movie flew by imo i loved the cast,2023-11-21
once he became slim shady he became very shady i personally felt that his descent went too quickly i can accept some of it but the fact that he was suddenly a threat to her was too much boromir and the ring,2023-12-01

"the depth poignance and sincerity of the hunger games franchise that came through so strongly in the original films was lost in this movie in fact the best part of this movie was the renewed appreciation it gave me for the original movies

there is solid commentary on fascism and the personal battle between good and evil in the film but the style of delivery was so far from the mark that i cant really buy in to the messaging 

first of all weve got lucy gray maybe its because i didnt read the book but her character comes across so flagrantly inhuman and doused in protagonist syndrome that it makes the movie nearly unwatchable where the hunger games shows victors coping with the trauma of their victory the ballad of songbirds and snakes shows lucy gray back to her honkytonk performances with zero indication of any emotional impacts from the games

then weve got the cheesy boarding school vibe of it all theres an quality of gossip girledness injected into the capitol schoolmates this upper echelon attitude strays from the flamboyantness of effy and is so literal that i would bet the term daddys money was used at least 3 times there is no subtlety in the betrayal of privilege in this film it is a perfect example of tell not show

the actual hunger games in the film felt low stakes the scene of the reaping in the original hunger games was so poignant this reaping however felt goofy lucy grays reaction did not match the magnitude of the horror at hand in fact her reaction was so cloyingly juvenile it made me wonder if this book and therefore movie were meant to act as a booster to get younger kids in the door of the main franchise something about the juvenile framing of the film makes it even more confusing to watch given the quantity of violence i would even say body horror death and discussions of fascism maybe kids today are more clued into political commentary idk 

again the games centered on a nearly perfect protagonist who was unable to  unless morally justifiable this makes the games hard to watch beyond lucy gray the named tributes were given little depth or consideration the original hunger games series does such a great job world building the tributes beyond district 12 but in this film it just fell flat all in all each tribute couldve been summarized by a single word like one of the 7 dwarves sneezy stabby sobby etc i was particularly baffled by the decision to include a tribute with down syndrome frame her as a ruelike character and then have the character have no interactions with other tributes and ultimatelybe overtaken by snakes

in the end this movie wasnt bad as a standalone the issue is that its supposed to exist in conversation with the original hunger games the original series did such a phenomenal job worldmood building that the obvious flaws of this film stick out like a sore thumb",2023-12-12
"i havent read the book and what i gather from other comments is that a lot of the richness of snows character is lost in the film

that tracks as my biggest complaint is that snows motivations and his descent into darkness seems incredibly rapid in the third act obviously in the first two acts we see the battle of good and evil within him play out  but in the third there doesnt really seem to be anything that sparks his rapid and sudden change into a purely sociopathic killer it just kinda happens im not saying its inconsistent with his character  it isnt  but the way its handled is pretty abupt and shallow

other than that fun movie",2023-11-17
"surprised at the mixed reviews i was enthralled the whole movie with the exception of plinth sejanus scenes really did not like that character im also usually a big stickler for pacing however i felt this was done appropriately and laugh at those saying it shouldve been two parts 

lucy grays accent was jarring at first i have not read the books and did not expect it at all but got used to it quickly and really enjoyed the portrayal her use of the snake on mayfair at the reaping was a good indicator of her characters depth in my opinion foreshadowing that her trust in snow was possibly a facade to understandably survive maybe there was a genuine connection but ultimately she didnt like what he had done even if in snows perspective it was all for familysurvival 

left me wanting more from this universe i honestly could do without scenes of the games i really love the world building so much more",2023-11-20
"this movie wasn’t great the pacing was super weird snow’s decent into madness felt incredibly rushed at the end the movie didn’t earn the ending it had because it never really took the time to show us snow’s transformation which was really disappointing it’s also just too long probably would have worked better as a miniseries 

lucy gray annoyed the  out of me the overthetop southern accent the constant singing the fact that she was able to win the hunger games despite never once picking up a weapon made scenes with her really hard to watch imo the actress is also super theatrical which isn’t bad in certain contexts but definitely didn’t work for this character 

the dialogue is stiff part of it is the way that lines are delivered but i think most of it is just that the script isn’t great characters have conversations that don’t feel like the way that humans naturally talk especially snow’s schoolmate who gets killed by the tribute in the beginning most of her lines felt straight out of a middle schooler’s ao3 account 

snow had way more chemistry with serjanus than with lucy gray 
also snow looked exactly like eminem when he got his hair cut

"would have been better as a mini series i liked the book but the film moved at a breakneck pace from scene to scene with little room to explore characters’ relationships or motivations 

my partner who hadn’t read the book found the transitions between acts jarring especially beginning of act 3 and didn’t understand coriolanus’ decisions because his internal dialogue was missing 

you wouldn’t know that coriolanus never liked sejanus unless you’d read the book",2023-11-18
i loved the book and loved the movie as well however i do wish we had been able to see clemencia and the aftermath of the snake bite but i get it way more of the story to move on to other than that it was perfect,2023-11-19
i loved the fact that when snow is after lucy in the forrest is like a hunger game and then the first katniss game is also a forrest designed by snow,2023-11-26
"what an odd movie all over the place tonally and i thought the way in which lucy gray’s character was portrayed was just…weird the southern accent really took me out of every song scene

the transition of snow going from good to bad was also handled in such an odd way theres little hints throughout the movie of his mindset changing but it felt like out of nowhere his intentions drastically change in that forest scene

for a film that is 25 hours the ending was oddly rushed

and im sorry but killing off the down syndrome tribute by mowing her down with snakes out of nowhere was unfortunately…comedic what was even the point of that character 

this was such a strange film but i definitely won’t say i didnt enjoy parts of it for the most part it is fine just kind of bewildered at some of the casting and writing choices",2023-11-29
best movie i’ve seen in a long time,2023-12-21
i actually really enjoyed it i agree it was pretty long and should have been split into two different movies other than that i felt as the acting was okay i do have one question though snow said he killed three people who were those three people i know the kid in the arena but who else,2023-11-17
everyone was hating on rachel zegler before this came out but i thought she actually did a really good job really good singer too i really should’ve checked the run time before seeing it though i had to  for the entire part 3 and kept thinking it had to be over soon but no,2023-11-19
they snubbed district 8 hospital helper the star of the original series and it really shows,2023-11-17
that story was just all over the place i didnt enjoy it that much there just wasnt really any build up for a single character for me to care about anyone cool if you got time but would not recommend,2023-11-17
i’m probably not the target audience but i thought the movie was so bland with every cliche possible nothing felt original and i actively cringedheld in laughter at many points it wasn’t a bad movie by any means and some of the set design was nice it probably just wasn’t for me,2023-11-17
rachel zeglers vocal chords were the best part,2023-11-19
is it bad that i actually sympathized with coriolanus more than lucy gray the guy lost everything was poor and was in a way just trying to survive as well sure  did he go a little overboard yeah but everyone does,2023-11-21
this was surprisingly good i thought the book was just okay when it first came out l but i might need to reread it now,2023-11-22

"i thought this movie was really good like solid 810 which i did not expect i’d rate it right behind the first and second hunger games i thought it was better than both part 1 and part 2 mockingjay movies 

snow had something wrong with him from the start likely triggered when he was a little kid watching people literally eat each other to survive he’s just way too calculated and cold with how he goes about things you can’t say for certain he’s always acting in his own self interest because you don’t hear his inner dialogue but i thought the scene when he tells his sister that killing the tribute made him feel powerful was telling it’s likely all his “good” deeds were probably half about doing the right thing and half about this is what’s best for me",2023-12-03
at least tom blyth was nice to look at for two and a half hours,2023-12-16
"i’m super late but just got out of my showing and wanted to write my thoughts somewhere minor book spoilers ahead

 i disagree with the critiques that the ending was rushed a lot of part 3 in the book was introspection from snow which i think they did a good job of adapting we’re not gonna sit for an hour while he thinks and washes dishes 
 i do think sejanus’s storyline was underdeveloped and it showed the most in part 3 we didn’t really spend enough time with sejanus overall we never met ma or strabo plinth except for an approving nod from strabo we never really saw their fortune it was only alluded to that was a big plotline in the book the contrast between sejanus’s wealth and his dissatisfaction with the capitol vs snows poverty and dedication to it 
 why did they cut the part about strabo buying sejanus’s way into the peacekeaper corp as a way to avoid worse punishment they already set him up as willing to pay for his way out of anything they just dropped that plotline why why would sejanus join the corp on his own if he hated the capitol that was frustrating 
 why did they go with sejanus lol for the pronunciation instead of sejinus whatever enough about sejanus
 rachel zegler is a really good singer she really breathed life into the lyrics from the book which were mostly taken verbatim 
 dinklage is amazing as dean highbottom 
 lucky flickerman was equally amazing better than book lucky imo his coin toss introduction was cold
 definitely felt like they pulled some punches with the pg13 lack of blood especially at arachnes death 
 i could have done with a training montage of snowsej being indoctrinated maybe snow taking the officer test
 i pictured billy taupe being much taller and foreboding spruce was a more interesting character to look at in the rebel scenes which should not have been the case imo 
 district 12 looked amazing holy  that was totally missing from the original trilogy films the giant coal refineries the open quarries the hob it felt so expansive and lived in 
 capitol wide shots looks solid as well although again i wish we got to see sejanus’s apartment compared to the snow’s
 wish there was a beat before the epilogue sequence we just suddenly cut to snow with long hair again and need to assume time has passed 
 the arena scenes were very well done imo well paced and intense

overall i really enjoyed the adaptation and i think it has solid legs as a standalone film if you havent read the book though youd be missing out on some good character development that is hurried through in the movie probably my favorite hunger games film now",2023-12-18

"ive gotta say schwartzman is absolutely killing it this year he was easily my favorite part of this movie

i know this is probably a hot take because its exactly what killed the momentum for mockingjay but this probably should have been two movies i had a solid time with this movie but it is clearly too long and paced in a way that when the third act starts youre like oh were gonna keep going perhaps those that have read the book will feel differently but the actual hunger games finishing with an hour left in the movie threw me for a huge loop 

the hardest thing this movie has to do is get us from a sympathetic main character to a sociopathic dictator and i salute the effort but it definitely needed more time for the transition and theres just so many characters in each act that it felt like the speedrun was losing us a lot of fleshing out for the side characters theres classmates other tributes character actors and a lot of table setting before we even switch settings entirely the big performances like schwartzman and dinklage and davis doing franknfurter with those gloves are given their time to shine and everything else feels like the lite version of whats probably in the book 

the games aspect of this movie is also kind of insane just wrapping my head around the decision to still have the games in the same arena thats just been blown up is a lot obviously its a foreshadow for the idea of the arenas being unique having places to hide and camp out etc but for the actual story going on it didnt seem to be the best choice and theres lots of that kind of hinting at what the games will one day be but the actual game in this movie is pretty simple it just kind of took me by surprise that the game itself wasnt really the focal part of the movie 

i did enjoy the performances from snow and lucy i dont know if i totally buy their relationship and i know the ending is supposed to be a mystery that ends up driving snow kind of insane but they were great interesting choice to make this kind of a diegetic musical sometimes it worked sometimes it was really awkward for the first half of the movie none of the songs get any instrumentals which sometimes felt odd but zegler has such an incredible classic voice i wasnt complaining 

i also thought this movie did a pretty good job of highlighting just how little you have to think of another person to put them in this situation while i do think the violence was toned down even more than the predecessors and that was a bummer the ideas about propaganda celebrity fascism class etc are all still more or less intact and thats what this series is all about im not sure i ever really wondered why snow liked being rich and in control but the idea that he created the perfect celebrity and spent the next 60 years trying to do it again and when he does it causes his downfall is an interesting one 

anyways its solid and if youre a fan of the series theres lots of fun hints at whats to come as well as maybe some groaner lines but id imagine if youre getting dragged to this it might be a bit of a bore even for me who saw the original movies when they came out and very much enjoyed revisiting them for this one i found this to be too long and not all the time well utilized solid 610

"the movie failed to show snow as a sociopath the book makes it very clear how little snow cares about others the movie makes it seem like snow likes sejanes or anyone

focusing on the games is also a mistake part of the book that is interesting is snow not knowing if lucy grey is actually a nice girl or not 

the pacing felt rushed through the movie and things that i thought stood out in the books sejanus death the zoo death the snake pit with clemieetc could have been done better

if snow was a self serving sociopath all along they did an incredibly poor job of showing that in the first two thirds of the movie him comitting all of his vile actions in the final third to land on top comes off as out of character and unmotivated very poorly written which is a shame because the world building costuming cinematography and acting all deserved much better,2023-11-19

"i didnt read the book and disappointed that how exactly hunger games came to be and who was the people behind the first hunger games and what did it took for so many capitol people to actually accept children killing other children not explored and also disappointed that there are no better hints on exact relationship of lucy gray and katniss lol still a mystery there

but that said this is just like the hunger games in everyway in tone in directing in music same ones of course and all the new actors gave their best 


loved the movie its not bad for sure",2023-11-18
listen i didn’t hate this movie but once they went to part 3 and i realized i still had 30 minutes to go i was ready for it to be over,2023-11-28
"i didnt like it it didnt have the same vibe as the other movies the tributes were too keen and confident especially lucy gray and not the picture of an oppressed people 10 years in to a brutal occupation lucy was a little to perfect right out the gate compared to say katniss who started very green and had to build her confidence over time by surviving the games the singing at the reaping was a bit much also the production quality especially the lighting screamed harry potter

the ending was also incredibly anticlimactic you could feel the tension building with snow and lucy especially in the woods but then it just went poof 

imo this film was a parody of the hunger games trilogy it lacked all of the key elements that made it compelling

note hilarious that im being downvoted just for having an opinion on a movie this site is pathetic",2023-12-13
i haven’t read the book… but did anyone interpret a connection between lucy singing the song under the tree the mockingbirds  the katniss roots and the first movies about katniss everdeen,2023-11-18
"i saw it tonight and no surprise i loved it tom and rachel were amazing in their roles i was a bit put off by her accent but then i got used to it plus her singing is beautiful tom wow along with rocking a buzz cut hes a great actor he translated snows thoughts beautifully the rest of the cast was perfection particularly octavia and the one that played flickerman i chuckled at him doing the weather 
 
sejanuss hanging was brutal to say the least it was quite fast paced compared to the book however the actor screaming ma and it being echoed by the birds was hard to hear snow shooting at the mockingjays manically waschills to see him go from grief to pure anger left me in shock its great the movie made it clear he loved lucy it turned sour at the end but he did unfortunately theres no exception for someone who is as apathetic as him 

music was great sometimes i didnt even realize it was there cinematography wasnt as iconic as the other movies still it was cool toned and polished my one gripe is not hearing more of snow and lucys conversation about humanity it would have been cool but i dont think not having it affected the quality of the film i also sort of missed clem yet that last image of her being dragged off could sear itself in your mind",2023-11-19
"it was very good i liked it even more than the original movies the pace was slower for the third act but okay 

i think i liked it more than the originals because the problems that the tributes were facing were more touching and also the aspect of snow having his own interests for helping lucy",2023-11-19
i saw it today and i was not disappointed actually i thought it stuck very close to the books but some comments here are reminding me of some things they left out that would give much better context so yeah thats a disappointment but a very minor one the music was really awesome too,2023-11-19
"it’s a shame that they had to keep it pg13 there were many gruesome moments in the book

when reaper was assembling and paying tribute to the dead i lost it…so much pain and trauma distilled,2023-12-03
just read the book and then went to the movie after that and my guess is that he never meant sejanus as his third  but lucy and all their interaction after that is just in his head giving more sense to the three kills and why he is hounted by the hanging tree song because he killed her there as his third  to wipe out the last evidence  she seemed like she knew that the weapons are there so she maybe told him before ,2023-12-13

peter dinklage’s final speech is probably my favorite scene in the franchise it just recontextualizes everything so perfectly even to a layman who’s only seen every movie when they came out,2023-12-29
i’m honestly surprised it’s so well liked i could barely sit through it without cringing so hard lucy’s accent the overdramatic singingperforming i know it says ballad i was expecting singing but it was a lot and how slow moving the first hour and a half were made the movie hard to watch the dialogue didn’t feel as deep as the older movies and everything seemed surface level to me imo it was absolutely my least favorite out of all of the movies which is super disappointing,2024-02-23

yikes 

this movie is getting so much positivity it’s insane i enjoyed parts of it but man there was some corny stuff in this movie",2023-11-25
as someone who enjoyed the original films i thought this was pretty bad worst film ive seen in a while terrible pacing terrible acting no likable characters multiple undeveloped plotlines yikes  character motivations were nonexistent and nothing was believable it honestly felt like a biggerbudget filmschool project,2023-12-03
i really liked this on the quality level of 1 and 2 and imo much better than the split up mockingjay was really impressed by the acting and the great pacing and stakes of the first two acts obviously the third act changes things up and that’s where i can see some issues but i really enjoyed this even with that saw it in imax and thought it looked and sounded great really took advantage of the format,2023-11-18
"great popcorn movie 

i was genuinely surprised by parts 1 and 2 however part 3 was just awful and dragged

i read the first three but not this one but was the book like this this felt like it that tried condensing three books into one movie,2023-11-18
absolutely loved it i was slightly skeptical at first since i loved the original cast so much but the new cast was awesome and it was really interesting to get a more expansive look at the world of panem itself rather than only focusing on the characters it threw up a lot of interesting social commentary that felt a bit more in depth than the original trilogy cinematicly it was awesome and it felt a lot gritter in some aspects,2023-11-19
is this a prequel or sequel to the previous 3 movies,2023-11-20

can someone explain to me the snows scene with the dean i was kinda tired towards the end of the movie so i might have missed a few details was it kind of a assisted suicide by snow or did he drink that without knowing theres a poison in it if so what is in that vial why would a person drink it so nonchalantly snow found that vile in his best friends stash right,2023-11-26
i’ve only read the first book but i enjoyed the films particularly the first two this one i had a good time at the theater even tho it’s not great imo great to see director francis lawrence back at the helm and still killing it with his selection of shots and edits tom blyth will be a new prospering talent i’m sure but like some have said i just didn’t like how they rushed thru the final few scenes,2023-11-26
"book reader here and ive got to say i really wouldve enjoyed this movie a lot more had i not read the book but theres no world in which i wouldnt have read it so heres some opinions 

what i liked
 tom blyth was phenomenal in this even without the illumination of an internal monologue that we get in the books he managed to portray as well as he could snows inner emotions onto his expressions and pauses and minute mannerisms 

 the music and singing was well done and brought lucy grays upbringing and lyrics to life i thought rachel zegler was well casted even if i didnt like herwhoevers decision it was to make lucy seem more aggressiverebellious than she was in the book

 loved viola davis as dr gaul her performance was chilling brutal and gave me the same vibe as the character in the book i originally had imagined her as a wiry professorlooking doctor but loved the adaptation here   

 hunter was everything as tigris portrayed the loving and hardworking cousin very well and had the perfect amount of screen time to reflect her relationship with snow

what i disliked
 what i originally loved so much about the book is that yes this is a villain origin story but throughout so much of the book i was still rooting for coryo deeply understood his internal conflicts and the tension was high throughout the entire book because he was so conflicted with so many decisions we didnt get to see that at all in the movie particularly regarding sejanus in the book coryo vacillates between disgust with sejanus pitiful and naive outlook of the state of panem and what he could do to possibly change the order of things jealousy of his rise in power and status due to the influence of his father and the money they gained through the previous war and intense relief of companionship in his most difficult personal times in the book coryo truly cared for sejanus when they were peacekeepers and tried his very best to dissuade him from rebellious acts and even then after sejanus was actively and openly acting with treason coryo still hesitates and is extremely conflicted about sending the recording to dr gaul and even after he sends it hopes that it is just waylaid or that dr gaul wouldnt understand to play the recording i think the movie absolutely butchered their dynamic as well as sejanus portrayal in the movie many people are calling him a fake activist when actually in the books he is the only one openly defying the capitol during the games trying to help the best way he can with his position as a peacekeeper and genuinely not caring if he lives or dies in fact he hates that his father can get him out of situations unscathed in the book and iirc tried to  himself at least once 

 the whole point of the prequel is supposed to be illuminating how coryos perception of humanity and society and its interplay changes throughout his experiences i thought they shouldve emphasized way more the lessonsassignments he received from dr gaul particularly the 3 cs chaos control and contract and how in the end his love and need for control rises above all else and is the defining motive in which he acts throughout all of the rest of hunger games series i know they touched on it with the whole shoulder bandaging scene but it wasnt enough considering the huge conclusions that coryo made regarding society and how it shaped the future hunger games 

 why did they just  all the tension with the snake scene by revealing what would happen to the asian girl if she did not have any part in writing the assignment it just made her seem like a  teachers pet who willingly stuck her hand in a pit of snakes despite knowing the horrible consequences it kinda played into this asian stereotype which i hate  they couldve easily just explained it after she did it 

 i think they really dropped the ball in portraying how actually wellliked coryo was amongst his peers and how calculated it could be and how genuine it could be too in the book coryo actually presents their partner assignment to dr gaul as having been a group effort trying to cover asian girls  because he knows and understands so deeply social cues and how to present himself as a humble star student despite being very calculated at times but they also missed how he genuinely did like his classmates and get along with them simply because he grew up with them in the capitol he visited asian girl in the hospital he was truly shaken by their deaths and he struck up a genuine camaraderie with lysistrata jessups mentor which is why she was the one who suggested and ended up spending all her money to send jessup water and thwart him from killing lucy in the arena idk what the point was of making it seem like coryo aggressively demanded her to send water and made her look mad at him when she was out of the games when in the book she did it herself to help him because he was generally wellliked by his peers 

 overall the movie was good i think i just really loved the books many nuances and the constant warring internal conflict that made me really understand coryo as a person and future villain the main difference is that the movie made it very clear that coryo actively made decisions that propelled him into his villain future whereas in the book it was a combination of upbringing loss of status decisions that were constantly made either tentatively or in a moment of high pressure that led to unavoidable consequences and then internal justifying of said actions because of these unavoidable consequences and then finally the conscious conclusion of a need for control suzanne collins is superb at making me feel like wow if i were in this character shoes i might have acted the same even if i dont agree with what theyre doing in both coryo and katniss two completely opposite characters but in the movie i felt like i definitely would never have acted like coryo and thats my longwinded gripe about the movie 

if you made it all the way here thank you for coming to my ted talk",2023-12-03
"just found this discussion so i’m posting this pretty late it’s my favorite adaptation of the books the ballad of songbirds and snakes is my favorite book and this kept all of the major plot points while keeping the same theme pretty well i loved the pacing actually and the shots were amazing 

excellent and i mean excellent use of scores i think it was an incredible decision to use the same ending score from mockingjay pt 1 for the ending of the movie when snow looks at the statue to inspire that same feeling of dread in the audience also having a rainbow over a gray statue of woman after flickerman said that all rainbowscolors lead to gray was a wonderful decision

although i do definitely wish they kept some smaller things add in sejanus’s mother more because she had a decent part in the book she begs snow to save sejanus in the arena she sends him food and letters in district 12 calls him a second son and even funds his education at the end and yet snow thinks she’s uneducated lesser than the capitol’s citizens but lies to her face about being sejanus’s best friend 

tigris in a more heartbreaking aspect is implied in the books to have resorted to prostitution as a child to get food and money on the table for her family there’s this incredible line in the book that has always stuck with me and it was “because if she had done it she had done it for me”

and when you put that into context for the trilogy and what snow forced the victors to do it’s just heartbreaking 

i do think one of the worst decisions was to get rid of the capitol’s humanity the movie made the decision to act like sejanus was the only dissenter but snow’s generation was just as vital to the games as katniss’s generation was multiple people within the capitol besides tigris thought the games were vile people like lysistrata clemensia and the guysorry forgot his name who gave lucy gray the guitar from his club all of who were cut majorly from the movie",2023-12-04
the worldbuilding was actually very well handled—better than most prequels imo,2023-12-06
now i really want the background story on plutarch starting from when he was young i want a prequel about his rise to the planning of the 75th hunger games rebellion the same way we have a prequel for snow’s villain arc ughhh im so not over this movie,2023-12-07
"so snow says he killed three people but lucy only knows about two and gets mad at that point he’s killed
 the boy in the arena which i’m pretty sure she knows about
 the mayors daughter and her boyfriend which she knows about and is there for
 sejamus which she doesn’t know was directly him and then puts two and two together and gets mad

all up that’s four though  why didn’t they up the number to four instead of three in this conversation i just kept being like “hasn’t he killed more people”

what am i missing

overall i liked the first two parts but thought the third dragged a little 610 there’s definitely life breathed back into the franchise after what i felt were terrible movies in mockingjay part 1 and 2",2023-12-09
amazing movie it brough me to tears very loyal to the book and great casting,2023-12-11

"does anyone think   
josh andrés rivera  sejanus  


resembles  
merritt butrick  plays capt kirks son david in star trek wrath of khan     
  

the resemblance is uncanny  they  features the jawline their accent the way they deliver their lines  
i cannot unsee it  apparently they are unrelated but if so this is a major matrix glitch that will soon be updatederased from all our collective memories",2023-12-21
"i actually liked the movie more than i thought i would i had heard in general that the ending was hit or miss and that there was a lot of singing in the movie so i wasnt sure how i was going to like it

neither of those things in the end really bothered me the singing i thought was fine and i didnt think it was over done or annoying i thought the initial singing at the reaping was a little cringey but other than that i was fine with it


overall what i really liked was the history we get behind the games and i loved seeing an old school game play out lucy gray was such an interesting character and i really liked that we saw someone who wasnt so physically strong like katniss

viola davis was great in her role and so was peter dinklage all the acting was really top notch rachel zeglar did a great job except i did find her southern accent strange 

i also see a lot of people complaining about snows 180 at the end but i dont really think thats the case plus i was prepared as we know what he becomes so it didnt surprise me in the end what he did i wish we had more clarity on what happened to lucy gray but i think its fine also leaving it open ended",2023-12-26
good movie seemed to me snow really was going to run away with lucy gray at the end and had no intention of harming her until she ran away i take it from some of these comments that the book was not the same,2023-12-26
it’s a good movie i like it a lot tom and rachel did very good at their roles this is my 2nd favorite in the series 1st being catching fire  only problem i have is the 2nd half pacing is off a lot,2024-01-01
just saw it and it was very good  almost as good as the original imo,2024-01-05
"very random though i liked how you could tell the difference between katniss getting dolled up vs coming straight out the district 
they kept homegirls make up  247 despite every bit of wild  that was happening in this movie that immediately makes my brow sweat make up gone",2024-01-19
was zegler extremely bad most of her acting and accent shifting felt so unnatural it took me out of the movie,2024-02-19
as a fan of this franchise i was very disappointed by the acting and missing storyline seemed super corny and rushed,2024-02-24
"the first 20 minutes almost lost me because i felt they were playing it too seriously and melodramaticallylike calm down this is a franchise from a decade ago that isnt soo held in high esteem that we have to treat it like this afterwards the tones of the dialogue and whatnot evened out and it became engaging 

the names are still too much whenever a character was mentioned offscreen i had trouble who the  they were talking about until they came back especially with snows fellow students like who the  was the kid that died in the bombing i thought the presidents kid but that was snows friend so who was he idk 

zeglers character seemed silly and caricaturelike until eventually they had to make harder choices and also theres the idea that she is using snow the whole hunger game arc seemd so underdeveloped considering the other movies were all about the games

viola davis killed it the main guy was pretty good too not sure why the rebel in 12 didnt turn snow in but its fine overall i think i actually liked it more than some of the original 4 but i like villain origin stories especially when they are more complex than we want you to empathize with the villain",2023-11-19
"really shocked to see so many positive reactions was literally probably the worst movie i’ve ever seen in theaters walked out with 30 minutes left and was probably the 4th or 5th person to leave by that time 

just every aspect of the plot was insanely  absolutely ridiculous movie",2023-11-20
"disappointing movie first two acts are watchable  but i wasnt really invested in the outcome of the games like i was in the original the characters just arent good enough the main girl did not seem like a real person at all 

third act is a chore really quite boring with rushed and unsatisfying character development poor use of runtime with too many scenes of the girl singing and not enough story progression visually it wasnt much of a spectacle either 510",2023-11-19
rachel zegler was by far the worst part of the movie just unbearable and terrible acting people saying this is the best movie in the franchise are probably just book stans cuz this  was mid at best the last third of the movie was the best part and couldve used more fleshing out the games themselves were boring and the acting of all the tributes was  cringe terrible,2023-11-26
shocked at some of the comments this was the corniest movie i’ve seen in a minute the writing is bad bad,2023-12-09
i realize that this movie is by no means getting rave reviews but that was literally one of the worst movies ive ever seen the second movie ive considered walking out of the first being tenet when i couldnt hear a word biggest waste of two and a half hours ever,2023-11-18
"just a casual thg fan and i didn’t read the books but i have mixed feelings the performances from davis dinklage schwartzman he got a few chuckles out of me ngl were great is it just me or did zegler overact a bit at some parts i was afraid the song usage would be annoying not big on musicals but it was fine not that jarring the hanging tree was overused but it fit the theme so there’s that the score by newton howard was uninteresting otherwise sadly a big chunk of the movie actually bored me it felt like there was nothing at stake during the hunger games we knew lucy gray was going to win i think i liked the third act the most something was actually starting to happen and it felt like snow finally had some agency i also liked that lucy gray vanished and kind of became the myth she was telling snow about 

but i just…couldn’t get invested in snow’s character in the first place i usually eat up villain origin stories but he was so all over the place he was kind of bland and too sympathetic at the beginning if he was supposed to be arrogant and machiavellian they didn’t manage to capture that and it was pretty out of character for him to suddenly switch to talking about how he felt powerful while murdering someone and dressing like draco malfoy’s cousin i don’t know his whole descent into evil felt halfbaked i couldn’t buy it i’m sure it was executed better in the book i’m hearing he was quite a sociopath in it because you actually get to hear the character’s inner thoughts",2023-11-17
ok maybe this was better explained in the book but i cannot for the life of me understand the motivation behind snow selling out sejanus like whyyyyyy record that conversation with the jabberjays and send to dr gaul knowing there’s no way this man would survive that i know he wanted him to stop working with the rebels but it still seemed so random for him to just decide to turn his friend in and then to cry about it when it hit his friend hung for it later lol i know they’ve been hinting snow having a dark side despite the foreground herolove story of him and lucy gray but am i supposed to just accept that his dark side just came out in that moment causing him to sell out his friend without any real provocation,2023-11-18
"i do love post apocalyptical movies and well the original hunger games film went to this one sure it was darker some of i but also disney movie like with the singing yeah i like musicals so the songs weren’t bad she’s a gifted singer

the pacing though wow i got bored in this movie just long parts of it that was plain uninteresting and 2hrs 40m is way too long imo

to be honest district 12 is supposed to be horrible right little food and such but then they just stroll off to a beautiful lake house with plentiful of fish quite a paradise i don’t know why would anyone ever go back 

happy if people enjoyed it but i surely wasn’t able to


oh did he really say that he killed 3 in the movie i didn’t hear that i thought he just said killed he could’ve said he killed his friend as well right since his voice was on the recorder that would make it 3 but people make mistakes when stressed

anyhow no offense just my personal opinion",2023-11-19
"i’ve only ever seen the first movie and read none of the books i found this to be surprisingly compelling i give it one thumbs up

i appreciate how it truly does not shy away from the brutality of its world building and premise the hunger games seems to be about surviving in a totalitarian world if that’s what your movie is about make it what it is about and the hunger games certainly does the regime feels real in its violence and oppression which i think is important for its main themes 

i found snow to be super compelling throughout until the last 30ish minutes i thought the story did a great job constantly putting him in morally grey scenarios where his only options to survive or get ahead are the worst ones i loved the way they used his best friend to show how the naïveté of idealism clashes with the pragmatic reality of living in such a world the friend is only allowed to be idealistic because he has the privilege and protection of extraordinary wealth

the filmmaking overall was mediocre it was an odd mix of having a consistent baseline of “passable” rising to the occasion in the most important moments the arena the execution and hitting wild cornball low points at generally inconsequential times 

weirdest  musical i have ever seen",2023-11-22
its too much book for one movie but not enough book for two movies ,2023-11-26
"i mostly enjoyed the movie except for a few things sejanus was poorly cast his acting felt so flat compared to the character in the book rachel’s fake accent was bad and distracting  they should have either dropped it or cast an actress with a legitimate southern accent and the lack of internal monologue from the book made it seem like snow was mostly a decent person all along who randomly snapped in the forest when the book makes it clear that he was always a bit of a sociopath 

i went back and rewatched the original trilogy this week and those films were so much better in large part due to the acting i think you can’t beat jennifer lawrence",2023-11-30
probably the worst movie out of the series ,2023-12-13
it is faithful to the book,2023-11-17
"just finished the movie less than an hour ago i laughed at this movie a lot it was practically a musical i would have preferred if the movie ended after part 2 the third act made the hunger games completely inconsequential to the lucy grey character every redeemable character was incredibly  

as attempted critique of class tendencies a lot about the characters could have been way sharper all the pregames deaths were absolutely excellent what a movie to come out during these times the best part of the movie was that reaper dude covering the bodies with the flags i really thought he was gonna hold up the three fingers after that i would have loved if the rebel crew at the end was planning to do something more than just leave

solid 210 tbh my theater was full one person tried to clap at the end no one joined her lol i’m sure the book is better i would so rather watch or read something about resistance in the districts though",2023-11-18
"dont make me say it please dont make me say it

alright fine ill say it but im spoilertagging it

i didnt like rachel zegler in this especially her singing",2023-11-29
really really poor filmmaking all around just a disappointment in almost every way,2023-11-20
"i watched it with people who didn’t read the book and although we all enjoyed it there were soooo many gaps i had to to fill in for them after the movie its a difficult book to transfer to film so i think they did the best they could but it was unfortunate to have so many crucial things missing his deep hate for the jabberjays ma and her cooking the first kiss from the zoo

the lead actors were amazing and the sets were really well done i really want to give huge praise to the explosion scene it was a jump scare and just as intense as i pictured it in my head bravo for that

overall it was a great experience and had me entertained from start to finish and i will be watching again",2023-11-17
"so i really like the book series and i like the movie but i want to complain about part 2

i did not like the changes they made from the book having less of the tributes dead before the games start in the book 9 of them die before the games begin not including marcus i think in the movie they mention 4 of them die in the bombing plus brandy in the zoo the problem is solved by having a bloodbath where the number is whittle down to the original number circ and teslee both who survive to the snakes in the book are killed in this point

there is no need for this aside from having an action sequence in the movie in contrast to the worldview gaul is pushing where humanity is inherently evil in the book only a couple of tributes are actually killed by each other they mostly die of natural causes from neglect or interference from the capitol the snakes as well being the end of the games whereas in the book there is a whole different section where the final 5 duke it out

making coral the antagonist of the arena section is also a curious change when in the book i would say reaper fills that role while yes coral is responsible for the most kills in the book reaper is the final survivor hes the one who is the present threat in the main part of the arena hes the one whose mentor has a relationship with snow like clemensia is not in the movie once she is bitten while in the book there is a whole storyline with her recovery conflict and reconciliation with snow etc i get they had to cut things but the combination of cuts and changes they made specifically with the games part left me disappointed",2023-11-18

"can someone explain why did the professor  himself at the end of the film or was he just foolish enough to drink a substance that was clearly gonna be tampered by snow

the whole movie felt like it was produced by disney it felt cheap and rushed it’s so flat and kinda boring lucy gray is also kind of not so relatable she seemed out of herself like the feeling when you’re dissociating,2023-12-16
"i enjoyed it agree with pretty much everything here 

the movie could have used more tell than show because not everyone will notice the gears turning in snow’s head as he watches lucy gray’s reaping and so on the movie tried making it obvious snow is thinking but it will be missed what he was thinking and why he did anything he did

it’s not a comedy but i found myself laughing too many times for example i couldn’t stop laughing at zegler’s attempt at an accent sometimes just let a jersey girl be a jersey girl lucy gray not being from district 12 would have allowed it

i love zegler’s singing didn’t necessarily like some of the choices made for the songs in this movie but they work

the movie definitely got me wanting more stories from this universe again and they don’t necessarily need characters we already know",2023-11-17
lucy gray baird more like lucy slay baird because she was so good in this movie i think this is my favorite hunger games movie but i also view it as the most well written  nuanced emotionally,2023-11-19
"thought this movie was a fine like a solid 610

the acting is phenomenal allround and the world built for this movie was so interesting the postindustrial setting with the hacked together technology is spot on the capitol is also by far and away the most captivating place in the hunger games series and this movie just reinforces that 

the problems i have with this movie are unfortunately the same problems i have with the book the last third just kinda sucks the emergency brakes on the pacing right after the games just kills any momentum the movie had the story also just makes no sense at all and district 12 is not interesting enough to make up for it

it seems to be a common criticism that this movie should have been 2 and while i see why people say that the issue is that the second movie would be so boring thered have to be a ton of creative liberty taken there to have that movie be good at all",2023-11-21
"as a huge  hunger games fan this movie was garbage tbh 

they way overdid it with the singing from the protagonist kinda cringed at one point at all the singing and the third act was boring terribly paced and just totally out of place",2023-12-29

lucy grey character was pretty bad in this movie,2023-11-20
i really enjoyed the movie i haven’t read the book i did read the trilogy though and saw their movies but i love how different the hunger games are in this one compared to trilogy they didn’t care about their tributes but when snow is running the games there’s training food better transportation stylists it’s a whole event,2023-11-19
"we liked it but as with the whole franchise it could get a bit too languid and ‘thoughtful’ in places

i liked the ‘ancestors’ aspects caesar flickerman’s father possibly and catniss’ forebear character too

the technically basic hunger game itself set in the one location capital city still being reconstructed years after the uprising and the grinding poverty experienced by the district 12ers were nice touches",2023-11-20
i enjoyed it as i honestly enjoy most movies… but in the car ride home from the theater i couldn’t stop finding criticisms i thought snows transformation in the last 10 minutes of the film into the villain we all know in love from the trilogy was cheesy i didn’t know if it was the script or the actors performance but it read sooo corny to me although i loved his performance in the rest of the movie the ending left a sour taste in my mouth i also didn’t understand if lucy gray running away was premeditated or spontaneous it read spontaneous to me when she was in the forest but then the birds singing and the snake trap mads it seem like she planned this all along idk it didn’t capture the magic of the trilogy which to me are masterpieces in the ya dystopian genre although i was happy to just have more hunger games in my life,2023-11-25
"can i watch the new hunger games if i have snake phobia

the devolving relationship between snow and gray in chapter 3 was such a 180 for me how did it get from im willing to risk everything for your survival in chapter 2 and gonna runaway with you to i’m gonna  you because you might turn me in how did the tension in the cabin get that bad and what if he did unintentionally betray sejanus,2023-11-26
"i didnt read the book so i cant compare the movie to the bookbut i actually liked the movie 

it seems to have less focus on the hunger games and more focus on the relationship between lucy gray and snow

i know its a movie so the pov is neutral but i know the book has snows pov in itwhich includes his internal monologues so the movie kind of shows us his expressions but its hard to know what he is thinking because supposedly the way he presents himself and the internal monologues he has are contradictory",2023-11-26
my brother’s only prior experience with the franchise is the original novel which he didn’t like he said he wished there had been more stuff about the politics of panem and how the games were set up he’s wondering if this one will give him what he wants and if  have to see any of the films to catch up,2023-11-26
i really enjoyed the movie but they did clemensia so dirty with her character changes and the scenes they cut ,2023-12-01
"good film i thought however i would of liked it if snow got a bit more harmedbetrayed at the end by lucy

thought she was going to stab him in the back and leave him for dead or something ",2023-12-01
the actor playing snow looks like a young ryan gosling,2023-12-08
"i didnt necessarily love the book but the movie adapted the story fairly well in some ways it was better and in others it was worse as is the case with even the best adaptations i feel like reading the book helped me a lot because it kind of felt very fast paced and i dont think certain scenes wouldve landed the same way with me if i hadnt associated it with my initial feelings from the book that and i knew what to expect from part 3 whereas i can totally understand how some people felt it dragged on after the end of the games

while it improved the pacing and the bloat it got rid of a lot of elements i liked and carried over some of the narrative issues i didnt like from the book they kept the story beats but had to sacrifice so much character development with the side characters that they were barely featured in a relevant way it made me appreciate how dark the book got at times too because a lot of those parts were left out which i do feel was because of time constraints and not solely because it was pg13 since the runtime was already so long without them 


between arachnes death the arena bombing and clemensia being bitten these scenes felt a lot more pivotal in the book but in the movie they were reduced to its bare bones so i hope it still had impact for first time watchers",2023-12-09
"i have never really watched the hunger games before i knew just a little of the original about katniss and the other guy and somewhat remember snow i just remember an old white haired dude i also remember the stuff with the mockingjays overall i knew a bit about there being districts which were oppressed by the wealthy and the games were a show for the wealthy

so overall i had very limited knowledge of the series and characters in it going into this movie i think the movie did a great job explaining things i was able to understand why everything was going on just from the background details throughout

the movie was really good at conveying emotions you can really put yourself in the characters shoes and imagine having to make the choices they had to",2023-12-10
what was that small bottle that highbottom was drinking throughout the movie i’m abit confuse the third part was okay but other than that it was very good solid 810,2023-12-11
"i liked that the games arena was so rudimentary compared to what we see in the original filmsbooks but… it was so small wouldn’ be over in like 10 minutes under normal circumstances without debris in the middle and tunnels to escape through there were no places to hide it was just a flat open area how would sponsors be able to do anything why would any supplies even matter besides weapons it would just be a straight brawl until someone came out on top

edit maybe there weren’t sponsors in the previous games i might have misremembered there i thought there was a line of dialogue that implied there were if so it makes sense",2023-12-15

“there’s just too much great stuff…”

not one instance of “ it’s a musical now”

not one mention of “the disney song routines were g and r”

yeah right",2023-12-20
"i liked that snow falling in love with lucy is what drove him mad in the end and the true meaning of the games that the world or life is “an arena” and from snow love can turn us insane since the moment he met lucy grey he began changing he becomes selfish and cheats the games not for who he fell in love with but ultimately himself then in an attempt to get his life back he kills his friend and lucy abandons him driving snow insane essentially killing their relationship then after snow is entirely different compared to the beginning in the hunger games with katniss he is alone cold and manipulative he fears love and how it drove him mad thats why he became obsessive in destroying katniss by using love against her 

what i wonder is did lucy ever love him or did she genuinely use him to gain her freedom this is what i think haunted him even when he was old",2023-12-21
i’m not a bookreader but enjoyed the movies back when i was in high school i’m sorry but this movie did not hit for me relationships between characters didn’t feel earned enough by the time the plot really started kicking in i didn’t get lucy’s relationship to snow at all or why she sounded so different from everyone in the movie visually pretty good acting but i can tell the book is way way better the first part kinda soured the rest for me,2023-12-25

"pretty good cinematography and high production values throughout the acting was mostly decent except for rachel zegler who tried too hard to get the audience to like her but instead came across as overly desperate and rather annoying her singing was certainly nothing special

on that note there were also a surprising amount of songs and singing to the point where the film felt like a musical the trailers advertised the draw of the hunger games but that was actually only a third of the entire film also the film dragged on wayyyyy too long especially in the first third actfor casual fans such as myself all of the exposition and romantic setup at the expense of action scenes and the actual hunger games made the 2 hours and 40 minutes admittedly difficult to sit through

overall the hunger games the ballad of songbirds and snakes 2023 rating 410 good cinematography and high production values but the film dragged far too much  cutting out 3045 minutes in the first and final third acts would have made this a much easier watch way too much singing for a nonmusical",2023-11-26
fantastic movie  the story tone and production were great my only disappointment is the choice of the actors zegler performance was just bad her acting is too theatrical and lacks lots of technique also snow performance was very mediocre but not really his fault because the directors dis not know how to translate his dark side  a part from few false notes the rest was very well done,2023-11-20
i read the book and saw the movie and loved both i see so much hate for snow but honestly i feel bad for him i really feel that at so many points he has no good options and him betraying sejanus was awful but sejanus put him in a really compromising situation snow wanted to get back to take care of his family in the capitol so he needed to keep his nose clean as a peacekeeper and stay out of trouble obviously he becomes a terrible person by the end but i feel he was a villain that was made and not born and in the book he has no plan of killing lucy he does want to return to 12 and go on to his training once he learns he can get rid of the guns but i really didn’t think he was going to  her when she runs away from him that was his last straw imo he was already breaking down mentally from everything i think he could have turned out entirely different had his world not been so dark and survivalbased i really do feel bad for him and want to know if anyone else feels the same,2023-11-27

i think one of my favourite things about the movie is seeing how the hunger games and panem as a whole have changed how the tributes used to be treated like actual animals v the royal treatment they got in the recent hunger games was crazy to me also finding out how snow shifted and influenced the game in certain ways was insane right,2024-03-15
i think the ending with snow and lucy both trapped in there thoughts and both decided to  one another was rushed the entire book there is no reason she would think he was going to  her snow is a psychopath that part makes sense it just felt nonsensical why would she think that yes she is smart but there is nothing but snow helping her the entire time great book but i wish she would have altered the ending a bit,2024-03-23
"had hopes for the movie i love the hunger games but overall it was meh the first two acts were… not good 



 lucy gray’s introduction was so cringe it was hard to take the movie seriously after the bright  dress she never changed out of almost the whole movie… throwing a snake at a girl and then getting up on stage and singing no peacekeeper stopping her and bowing exactly like katniss did in hg2 … sigh so heavy handed from the director to add that move and for some reason wearing an obscene amount of makeup in the intro idk if it was the actresses’ acting or what but everything she did felt very overacted and ‘disney’ if that makes sense every  expression to the way she walked and talked was just awful  



 viola davis was fun as the villain but so heavy handed standing in her evil secret lab no one else works there plotting their deaths all she needed was a clawhook for a hand or an evil pet cat or something lol again just very cartoonishdisney like this is the villian zero subtlety listen i love disney but they have a certain formula they abide by and i thought this movie was going to be a little more adult  old man snow in the hunger games movies was the obvious villain but he had nuance to him he was so much scarier in his performance because it seemed real and again less overacted



  couldn’t tell you a thing about the other contenders would have been nice if there was a little more focus on them and the other mentors the other movies you knew who people were and therefore cared if they lived or died they literally say this in this movie  like  actually states that they need the audience to care about the kids to want to watch the games and then the movie proceeds to rush everything to do with them and therefore we don’t give af about them the irony



 the first half of the movie the lighting was far too dark couldn’t see a  thing half the time worse than that episode of game of thrones iykyk i get the games itself was only supposed to be one part of the movie but they were boring she hid in a hole the whole time 50 shots of young snow looking ‘horrified’pouting to the camera



  third act was far better than the previous two in my eyes maybe it was just the beautiful countryside and so i could finally see what the  was going on  the pacing was rushed again tho and i could honestly not even tell you what was going on with snows friend and lucy’ and their rebel plans and what not it was so boring



 lucy and young snow did not have great chemistry idk if it’s just her acting or his too but… no  
‘i value trust over everything even love’… sigh i know there are a lot of positive comments in here about this movie im genuinely not trying to by cynical just callin it as i see it and people were hailing this comment as great ‘subtle foreshadowing’… there’s zero subtle about it she’s legit spelling out exactly what happens just hamfisting it down the audiences throat the second she said it i groaned 
maybe im not the target audience for this because every single thing was has happened in this movie feels like it’s for 13 year olds


 hiding a snake under his moms scarf or whatever to bite him… sigh like a snake it going to just stay hidden under there idk just goofy honestly  
and there was not really enough built up in their relationship for this demise  i see snippets of sociopathic snow here and there but i wish they drove it home more how selfish he really is the one time they really needed to go for it in the movie and they didn’t but they over acted everything else lol 




 then he’s just pardoned and working in the lab with supervillian ok… just so rushed what was the point of him going out there for like a summer vacation then immediatly coming back lol ‘ you are a supervillian like me and let’s work together muahaha ‘ christ  



 ok positives because i’ve totally dumped on this movie lol i liked the twist with peter dinklage’s character i liked jason shwartzman as a flickerman relative that was great casting they actually look quite alike  i liked the time period and how the games were still new the contenders in a zoo like cage for people to gawk at technology like out of the 50s but also some high tech that vibe was solid   hunter schafer was fine wish she had more to do but she was a good choice



 overall 510 movie the pacing was not good the lightning was poor half the movie majority of the acting was not great and far too overacted and for a hunger game movie it was kind of boring  meh ",2024-03-27
what i would have liked to see was more closure with lucy gray and coryo snow i mean the movie is pretty clear about what happened but i still feel like i have questions why does lucy even decide to meet up with coryo at all he pretty much already reviled his evilness why does she decide to run away when theyre at the cabin and not before honestly seeing coryo alone made me feel bad for him do you think that if she hadnt run away from him he would have still killed her also that part is confusing if he actually killed her or did she get away i think that he wouldnt have the whole time watching them run away i was thinking i know that it wouldnt work out their escape but i really hope it does i would love to hear other peoples ideas about what i said,2024-04-05

"this should have been a 10 episode series everything felt rushed and weightless there is a lot happening and they dont feel dramatic and impactful i didnt care about the main girl who didnt have a life or personality other than singing also her acting was bare minimum lawrence put her heart in it in the first two films i didnt care about the tributes scary  bully ones didnt feel so and the ones we were supposed to root for didnt have enough screen time for us to care the whole conspiracy  rebellion thing in district 12 was also rushed so the betrayal didn’t work for me either the only thing that worked for me was snow great acting and him sticking to his values and sociopathy lol and walking a fine line between black n white was well executed

"would love some takes on this

i just got around to seeing the movie finally tonight 
i understand that snow is a narcissistic sociopath however hear me out 

he yelled out at one point to lucy gray that he “did everything for her” which is true i feel like my problem is with lucy gray and not with snow now… i know this is a hot take
snow killed the mayors daughter to protect lucy he knew that she hated lucy and would somehow drag her into the escape when yelling on them in my opinion when lucy ran into the room his first instinct was to protect her when her exboyfriend kept touching her on stage he protected her then bringing it back to the beginning of the film he asked is it was real and i believe he truly was in love with her my issue is i thought she understood everything he was doing was to protect her and that he loved her until he said “you wouldn’t tell thought would you” and she paused and was a terrible liar which was instant betrayal in his mind he believed she really was in love with him but i feel like i can’t see it from her point of view so i feel his actions are completely validated i love reading everyone’s take and interpretation so i would love your take on this",2023-12-06
"this book rekindled the spark that reading used to give me i devoured it in couple days and was very excited to see the movie yesterday evening it did not hold up to my expectations unfortunately   
it was the longest book of all hunger games one and it was not split into 2 movies like mockingjay i get that they had to cut a lot of characters and events out of the book but changing the personalities of people was too much snow was made way dumber than in the books and lucy gray was made into a hysterical mess in few scenes which were out of their characters spoiler like in the last scenes where she was yelling at him to tell her whos the 3rd person and in the cabin when she was the one who told him he can leave for the military training as they found the guns i saw the movie with my husband who has not read the book and he found the movie confusing he thought that the last scene was about lucy gray leaving the guns in the cabin to frame him a lot of things were too straightforward and on the other hand motives of characters were not true to the books and made no sense  
spoiler killing off presidents son dr gaul portrayed as a psycho it was too much for me to handle

my biggest problem with the movie versus the book is i didnt think they built up the relationships between the characters enough i also dont think the change of heart coriolanus had in the cabin towards the end was obvious enough my bf didnt read the book and he couldnt tell that coriolanus was changing his mind about running off with lucy gray after he found the guns it wasnt clear enough so when snow was bit by the snake to my bf it looked more like she turned on him first so he had a right to try and  her it seemed like that to me too and i read the book another blame the woman scene as she caused his mood to shift i didnt like that part at all it should have been made more obvious that he was going to turn on her way before he was bit by the snake,2023-12-12
so many inconsistencies in characterization and worst of all a complete fabrication of reality in so many scenes,2024-01-02
movie was going great up until the second half the final act of the movie especially the last 30 minutes ruined the film for me,2023-11-26
this should have been two parts,2023-11-20
cant remember the last time i saw such a brutal slog of a third act i just felt so tired by the end,2023-11-22
my misses forced me to go see this with her and all i can really say is what a terrible terrible film i don’t know how you can all watchimmerse yourself in these movies unless you are all majority 16yr old girls,2023-12-01
"another thought we never see the president

does this mean that either they don’t exist or the chief games maker is the president",2023-11-20
can someone without giving plot spoilersi know this is a spoilers allowed thread  explain the disconnect between the criticswho seem to be giving mixed to positive reviews and audiences who seem to be more uniformly positive,2023-11-22
is the movie gory i’ve read all the books except for tbosbas but i’ve only watched the first 2 movies gore bothers me quite a bit so i had to close my eyes in the first movie for the bloodbath and cato’s death but overall i found the movies less gory than they were described as by reviews and stuff a big group of my friends are going to see the ballad of songbirds and snakes but i’m not sure if i would be ok with it lots of reviews have said it’s much more close up and gory could anyone tell me how violent it is and about the worst bits  compare to the first 2 movies i don’t care if there’s spoilers,2023-11-29
havent read the book and i was so confused on act iii ,2023-12-01
"i read the original hunger games trilogy and was a diehard katniss fan i wore that braid and katnjss shirts to class everyday  but when this new book came out i just couldn’t get into it for some reason but after seeing the film and absolutely loving it i’ll give it a second chance

with that said what’s the deal with peter dinklage and his tie to lucy and sejanus snow brought him sejanus’ belongings because he knew what they were already or was responsible for those poison vials 

and him having sent lucy on the train with a warning about snow was there something more going on between him and the rebellion",2023-12-04
did snow  dean highbottom peter dinklage or did he overdose i’m confused on what the motive would’ve been for his death,2023-12-04
okay could someone explain what exactly the deal was with the guns and rebels at the bar like why would snow be hanged for being there he’s a peacekeeper it’s just job to shut stuff like that down was it just that sejanus could implicate him and mayfield the mayor’s daughter was she a rebel,2023-12-08
i really liked the songs there was only once or twice that i thought it was a bit much but most of the time i was there for it,2023-12-10
"this was the only book out of the series i didn’t read and i’m definitely going to read it we ended up getting free tickets to it so i didn’t have a chance to read before watching 

i didn’t understand why snow recorded sirjanus did he want to have him killed i guess i’m a little confused because snow’s character change felt a little rushed to me although my husband disagrees i just felt like the lines were blurred on his reasoning for a lot of things",2023-12-10
i liked it well enough but don’t see myself rewatching because of the female lead did not like the singing nor did i like her acting or accent it was all distracting i thought it was paced fine for the amount of content and actually the last act was my favorite the tension there was really good i’d give it a 710,2023-12-11
the fact that burn gorman got such a small role he is fantastic and keeps getting small parts  bring him back it was cool to not see him as the villain this time though,2023-12-11
woveys death was so sad getting covered in snakes disgusting,2023-12-18
woveys death was so sad getting covered in snakes disgusting,2023-12-18
someone pls explain like was snow actually planning to  lucy in the hut at all in the movie or he shot her just because she tried to poison him with snake bite him i really dont get it cause people say obviously the movie doesnt go in depth like the book doesnt,2023-12-20
i spotted two mistakes in the movie being the fact that haymitch was the first ever district 12 winner and that on the weather map of flickerman district 13 was no where to be seen even though it is right up north district 12 didnt verify the last one but im pretty sure,2023-12-20
i read the book days before seeing the movie and in both cases i felt disinterested once the hunger games was over  we know how snow is going to wind up and it just felt in both cases too long a road of getting there  overall i ultimately enjoyed both,2023-12-25
i finished this movie a bit confused what were snows motives would this movie had been better had i read the book,2023-12-25
"2 hours 30 mins holy 

btw is that actress are snow white in new movie   her performance fits in this movie",2023-12-26
does anyone understand how the guns got into the cabin that snow and lucy run to i don’t understand how or why they are there,2023-12-29
so does lucy gray eventually have a daughter and name her katniss or does she influence many rebels up north with her songs and one of those rebels has a daughter that they name katniss it is pretty clear there is some sort of direct link or at least influence also want to mention a songwriter with her voice would be very very influential and taylor swift style singing about ex boyfriend snow could really really amp up some punk hate for the capitol into those rebels many many regular women today are incredibly influenced by taylor swift,2024-01-01
"i thought it was good the first half of the movie id probably rate it a 9510 the breaking point was just the way it went from an action packed lean forward in bed movie to a very slow king dialogued film that had so many  things going on at once i rate it a solid 8 

very cool to see the transition of snow from good to evil as soon as he shaved his head from leaving the capital and becoming a peace keeper  he put on the eminem slim shady vibe what i’m confused on is why he had issues with the small teacher in the first place if he was honest and upfront with snow in the beginning couldn’t they have like intentionally made the games a  show so they’d be ended",2024-01-02
i genuinely enjoyed book because of its subtle hints and portrayal of snow movie was a bit disappointing it painted snow in a better light and at same time made him cruel for no reason what i mean is in the book it is clear that he is cruel but it’s done with purpose here purpose was absent also trust lucy and seajunus had for him was so deep and it was lost in the film overall it felt a bit rushed but watchable i genuinely loved actors and i think they did great job with what they had to work with i am aware that my view is biased because i loved book so much i don’t think any version of the film would have matched the actual book for me,2024-01-29
i got a good chuckle out of snow pulling his hands off the other girls stabbed throat and staring at them as if they should be covered in blood but there was none,2023-11-19
"something very jarring about seeing teens getting stabbed with pitchforks only for the blades to be as clean as a whistle 

i know these movies are supposed to be yapg13 but the sanitization is kinda  up in its own way",2023-11-17
i saw an interview with the director where he said that every film has started out as r and he has to dial back things like blood and the moment of the killings until he gets to a pg13 rating,2023-11-18
they cant show blood in pg13 movies  or at least not much of it,2023-11-18
they need to remake the whole hunger games maybe turn into a series on hbo it needs to be as dark and violent as the books,2023-11-18
i was heavily disappointed in arachnebrandys death it was such a shock in the book and i thought the bottle breaking and stabbing plus arachnes dying moments lacked the punch i was looking for i remember arachnes throat slit with a knife and i imagined brandy got a firing squad treatment but it was 1 shot to the abdomen and falls behind snow  censoring capitol brutality is so counter to their beliefs district citizens are as valuable as animals are and im not even getting into how i wished to see brandy hung or drug by horses i cant remember like marcus during arachnes funeral just to show how sick the capitol is,2023-11-22
"well the tributes in the first hunger games movie were generally healthy young people 

in this one we got tributes from more vulnerable backgrounds  theres a girl with tb a little girl with autism and someone who got rabies i think that just grounds things more in reality",2023-11-19
"ive been thinking about this how come the harry potter movies which were mostly 12apg13 were able to get away with so much blood in particular the sectumsempra scene was a bloodbath literallythats what arachnes death scene should have been like instead the end result was laughable and completely gutted of the impact it should have had the blood was essential to both the realism and the effect on snow because it triggers ptsd flashbacks for him in the book of for example his mothers bloody death id have preferred for it to be cut than what we got

harry potter also had georges bloody ear injury for another example and rons nasty and bloody splinching injury is censorship going backwards",2023-12-13
yes i thought the same,2023-11-28
"when the little girl says can we all go home now
that was super well acted and terribly heartbreaking",2023-11-21
enjoy the show,2023-11-22
the original hunger games were like snow wanted  entertainment these movies felt like entertainment the prequel was so sickening it was disgusting to watch the arena,2023-12-03
and throw in a man hanging from his wrists in the arena begging for a mercy killing the filmmakers really went for it,2023-12-14
the welcome voice was one of the more chilling aspects to the movie for me for sure,2023-11-28
"which i’m intimately familiar with so it hit hard

im sorry you had to deal with the wake of all that ",2023-11-20
i never seen hunger game before and was surprise this movie was so dark,2023-12-04
my girlfriend and i are both from the balkans and we laughed about it reminding us of our hometowns lol a little bit of dark humor there,2023-12-17
putting them in the cages makes people pitty them  lets instead dress them up and glamorize them and give them some training  turn it into a sporting event complete with prizes,2023-11-18

i was so excited lol,2023-11-19
yeah some people in the my theater chuckled at that,2023-11-29
really i found it nauseating even when i first read it in the books it feels on the nose and like such blatant fan service,2024-01-01
there is a reference to who katniss grandmother is so it’s connected ,2024-01-14
dr gaul more than likely staged it she’s a fascist and believes in control i like the detail of how she cuts off reaper’s super heroic moment that could possibly stir rebellion and she begins spewing antirebel propaganda,2023-11-18
oh for book readers a lot of us had theories that dr gaul had set it up to gain national “morale” against the districts for daring to attack capitol children y’know even though the capitol yearly trudges out 24 kids from the districts to their death,2023-11-17
"this was my thought immediately like obviously an inside thing by the game makers i thought it would have a bigger plot impact though it seems like no one cared much though which was weird

but the other argument is that the games were on the verge of dying out they clearly were and the rebels were doing one last thing to try to end the games",2023-11-18
for a second i thought the mentors were going to trapped in the game too and the whole thing was the real beginning of the game,2023-11-19
i thought it was alluded to that highbottom was involved at the end he seemed pretty torn up about the idea of the games no,2023-11-18
i thought it was a suicide bombing at first,2023-11-20
no one talks about the building outside of the arena it fell mysteriously explosive charges perhaps,2023-12-08
agree why would the rebels  so many of their own people,2023-12-29
for real his friend screaming for his mother haunting,2023-11-17
really sells the cold destitute for the district folks for sure,2023-11-17
thats a really powerful moment in the book  the chapter ends with the jabberjays screaming ma over and over again  ,2023-11-18
this was heartbreaking to read about in the book but was absolutely terrifying to view and hear on screen,2023-11-18
i wonder if this happens in all districts of this is a unique district 12 punishment,2023-11-17
wasnt that supposed to be in the original hunger games movie but got cut,2023-11-17
i was telling my wife that all those birds flying around repeating human screaming was indeed the most horrific part of the movie for me second only to woodys death which impacted me because she was the most innocent of them,2023-11-26
it’s both horrifying and fascinating i absolutely loved this detail,2023-11-26
i really like the idea where snow hates it when a tribute outsmart the capital by using things that arent designed to do it purpose like haymitch using the forcefield to win his hunger game and it turns out that snow had used the drones to save lucy,2023-11-17
“i’m just sending water” was one of the funniest lines in the film,2023-11-18
"this was one change from the book that i really liked in the book when the first drone fails to deliver the water the mentor complains until he gets a free drone as compensation then they tweak the drones to make them more accurate

in the movie the gamemakers are just like lol bad luck and they have to use the  drones for the rest of the game",2023-11-19

agreed and if we ever get another hg movie i would bet good money she will have a bigger role and we will witness at least part of her transformation into the tigris we saw in the last movie,2023-11-20
and she called him by his full name too whereas before it was always corio thought it was a nice touch,2023-11-25
yeah even in the books im not sure what suzanne planned for tigris to be but she wasnt clearly developed to show how she became against snow even after living in poverty together as children even the transition from her human self to her whiskered self i dont see an insight to why she would do that,2023-11-22
loved that condemnation of hers so little said yet so much,2023-11-25
i hadnt read the book so as soon as i saw lucy grays dress i thought theyd have a similar relationship to katniss and cinna and that theyd bond over their mutual love for fashion,2023-11-22

"i think he made the game like professional
sports he gave people to root for the same reason people root for say patrick mahomes they are rooting for a personality and not a piece of meat",2023-11-18
i think so that seemed to be tyrion’s plan that’s why he was so cruel to snow because snow was trying to save the games,2023-11-19
i mean i personally don’t think so even if it got no viewers i feel the leadership largely support the hunger games as a concept,2023-11-17
in the book it’s a class assignment where the ideas of sponsoring the tributes and letting citizens place bets on who will win were ideas multiple characters had,2023-11-24
can you explain the cabin scene  i literally don’t understand a single thing from that point and into the forrest it made zero sense,2023-11-17
he scared the poor girl away she was like hes got too much red flags im outta here ,2023-11-22
i thought the opposite i knew he wouldn’t shoot her and the switch came out of no where,2023-11-25
agreed that was a great scene that was one moment where the film went above generic hollywood filmmaking,2024-01-03
you must treat yourself to at least chapter 30 and the epilogue you’re into all the good stuff goosebumps,2024-01-04
"lets be real if he killed his best friend like that he wouldve killed her

  
throughout the movie he showed himself to be a traitorous person",2024-01-30
he didn’t want to but she egged him on tbh,2023-11-25
lots of pacing issues its mainly due to budget the audience is 1218 yr a major step down from the real movies throw away cast  this was a testing project for studios to see if there is any runway for more to the franchise like how they poked for star wars in the 80s holiday special and trash of that nature  the script was a burner its filler having over emotional tension and dialogue of im not made of sugar they didnt invest much in key players production wise  but it was a huge success money wise so expect to see a syndicated series on amazon or netflix soon and a maze runner blowout of this 46 more of the low budget burn out content,2023-12-21
not only kids but sick kids amputee kids short kids,2023-11-17
yeah you had the kid with one eye the kid with one arm the kid with down syndrome the one who had tb and could barely stand upright the one who got rabies and they were dirty and hungry  no fancy training outfits they were wearing their sunday best to fight in,2023-11-18
"there’s an inuniverse explanation for this too 

in the 74th hunger games it is a fullyfledged spectacle and there are career tributes who train their whole lives to volunteer when they turn 18 

in the 10th hunger games none of that exists everyone competing in the games is poor and hungry with no training and most likely not 18 yet",2023-11-28
"the little downs syndrome girl had me in tears as she reminded me so much of a girl i have art club with and shes the sweetest person 

i so didnt want her to die",2023-12-06
feel like there were multiple 35 year olds,2023-12-06
idk the main two lucy and snow looked pretty clearly early 20s imo,2023-12-09
"production design was great i dont remember what year these stories are meant to take place but definitely seemed like a 1950s60s cold war style in the broadcast reminiscent of the reallife golden age of television the capitol evokes that same era too maybe more soviet than america cmon look at that statue if you go back and look at hunger games or catching fire the capitol architecture has become much more fascistbrutalist

the architecture invokes the marshall plan era buildings of europe but with a mix of american sleekstreamlined for the capital furniture i quite like it since its rarely seen in scifi",2023-11-18
to your editting part i thought many decisions to maintain a pg13 rating couldve been better with regards to their hesitancy to show blood weapons being squeaky clean of blood and the character being stabbed in the neck with a bottle then cropping it super close yet showing no blood were weird choices to me,2023-11-18
"i actually liked the pacing of thr movie better than the book  the third act drags in the book until the last few chapters which fly by  im glad they shortened the part where he is in 12

and i noticed the sovietlooking stuff too  and when snow sneaks out of the peacekeepers base on the truck an iron gate shuts behind the truck  it reminded me a lot of a concentration camp",2023-11-19
"i dont think its that hes a sociopath its what he says at the end that the hunger games are to remind us all who we really are and that the world is just a big arena  
  
when he went in to save sejanus and ended up getting attacked then having to  it basically instilled a permanent survival mode that he didnt have before or rather not to the point of actually killing someone i see it more like a latent ptsd which lucy gray also has i still have one foot in the arena theyre both survivors now and not like in the romanticized sense but more like a state of brokenness  
  
so take that state and put it in a guy with ambition and privilege and proximity to power like snow and you get a tyrant",2023-11-28
i agree with most of your points but i think he did have a genuine love of his family at the time,2023-11-20
"as an architect i loved the set designurbanism involved

the capitol was mainly filmed in berlin so the roundabout that you see with the victory statue is at straussberger platz on karl marx allee formerly stalin allee it was an area of east berlin that was completely rebuilt in the 1940s50s in stalinist architecturesoviet classism albeit with cgi you also get a nice flashback in the beginning between the dark days and the closing stages of ww2 with the complete destruction of warsaw and devastation of berlin and budapest 

i do like however that despite the stalin allee was at the time the new postwar style the facades we see are tiredstill undergoing renovation and you have a sea of towers rising up behind them possibly alluding to the postwar economic boom in germany or just how the aesthetics have changed postdark days for something flashier which would later translate into clothing 60 years later also similar to how after the fall of communism berlin warsaw and moscow have embraced international style glass and steel towers in their city centers

we also see for a minute the berlin altes museum as the academy which is a glorious classical building which serves to remind us of the classical roman influence in the capitol and while not related to the buildings purpose as an art gallery this was were coryo began to navigate the cutthroatedness of capitol politics similar to roman politics 

the arena is the wroclaw formerly breslau centennial arena which was one of the first structures in 1913 to use reinforced concrete and despite being modern still serves to have some elements of decor and harken to a coliseum vs a modern day football stadium

the showdown with highbottom takes place in the monument to the battle of nations battle of leipzig and its interesting to note that this and the arena were both built in 1913 to commemorate the victory over napoleon in 1813

i could write an entire essay on the parallels i found between urban planning the power of architecture and how it is used in authoritarian societies but in short thank you for bringing this up as it allowed me to express why i loved this films set design",2024-01-07
unadulterated sociopaths dont have feelings for other people,2023-11-18
" speaking of snow i like how this story shows he is an unadulterated sociopath

well except they didnt until the end at which point its too late to give hintsforeshadowing because youre already at the end for the entire 212 out of 3 acts we are seeing a compassionate sincere honest snow up until when he sends the mockingjay recording which made no sense why not just tell the commandant if you are gonna betray sejanus  

i wish theyd shown him as an unadulterated sociopath perhaps they should have showed us his true nature which they did not that he was really stringing everyone along but then perhaps hes fallen in love and questioning his character so he has a true choice to be good or to be evil  and he apparently chooses evil",2023-12-21

in some shots i thought it was a deaged tucci truly a performance i also like that his haircostumes got slightly more polished as the games went on like he realized the opportunity and was going to take advantage of it,2023-11-19

he did well but i thought he couldve turned it up to 11  he kind of kept it at 8 or 9,2023-12-21
my biggest issue is that the story and characters were really compelling but i actually did want more especially in that third act,2023-11-17
"3rd act felt rushed and snow made a 180 very quickly

imo the biggest issue with both the movie and the book is that snow likely didnt do a 180 sociopathy isnt developed over time he was always a sociopath that cared only about himself and how people viewed him showing empathy or other emotions when no one was watching or when it didnt benefit him is a clear flaw in the story 

worth noting that sociopaths dont always know theyre sociopaths which was clearly the case here snow could think he was falling for lucy gray because that was key to manipulating her but as soon as their relationship was no longer for his benefit he would have stopped caring",2023-11-17
"i’ve never read the books so i can’t speak to it but in the film it didn’t seem to me snow did a 180 it was more that his nakedly selfinterested decisionmaking became more amoral and extreme as his situation became more desperate

the film did a good job of establishing the pathology snow developed being the son of a fallen once great family of the capitol it really informed and made sense of all his decisions and motivations why he’s desperate to win the plinth prize money why he so strongly identifies with fellow poor hungry displaced orphan lucy why he was willing to sell out his spoiled best friend whose life everything his should be and why he so quickly turned on lucy as the final loose end once he found the guns",2023-11-19
" hunger games prequels specifically haymitch abernathys

same theres 64 years between this and katnisss trilogy so much potential for further stories",2023-11-18
"haymitchs backstory definitely feels like the most interesting possibility for a future bookmovie  
 
especially considering how he won the 50th iteration of the games along with the circumstances around it it could also show how he ended up so despondent by the time katniss and peeta showed up how he ended up failing tributes for decades inadvertently sending them off to their deaths",2023-11-22
"3rd act felt rushed and snow made a 180 very quickly

that is a flaw that comes directly from the source material not that it justifies it but the books suffers a bit because of that",2023-11-19
"i thought it was extremely clear that he only acted in ways that seemed moral when there were incentives 

anytime there was nothing to hold him accountable he acted underhandedly",2023-11-25

" snow made a 180 very quickly

it was like a jekyllhyde transformation suddenly hes a completely unrecognizable character we have no idea what has happened  

if he was always that way and hiding his true nature the movie should have shown some clue some ambivalent moment we can look back on as significant there wasnt any if something changed him what  

and  is going on with the gun he used to  the mayors daughter in the floorboards instead of the fishing rod that lucy gray said was there  they werent even going to stop at the cabin lucy grey wanted them to keep going so its complete coincidence they stopped  

also  is a fullyfurnished unlocked unoccupied cabin doing in the middle of nowhere",2023-12-21
"specifically haymitch abernathys

mockingjay didnt need to be two parts i still stand by that pretty sure the director even admits this,2023-11-18

but some stories are still tough to fit in one movie and i think shows are maybe the best answer to that",2023-12-14
can you point out the people that were complaining about 2 parters and also complaining that this was 1 movie or are you just conflating the entire fan base to have all of the same opinions redditors like you comment this  in any subreddit im in but yet ive never seen a hypocritical redditor do exactly what youre claiming can you just imagine that there are 2 separate crowds in the same fanbase that would argue 2 separate ideas do you also believe americans all share the same views and are hypocritical just because were all in the same country come on youre arguing disingenuously just to target people that are complaining in general just say that,2023-11-22

i also loved flickerman his character was interesting because it provided comic relief for such a dark movie while somehow being some of the darkest parts once you listen to the content of his jokes",2023-11-17
"i absolutely loved how the movie handled snow’s character because it didn’t present him as a black and white villain he was shown as a child and then as an 18 year old young man from an important yet now disgraced family trying to earn their way back in the midst of the usual capitol corruption and slowly discovering his hunger for that goal that supersedes any connection or moral standing

this isn’t to make us love or justify what he became at the end but it’s also shows a realistic depiction of a young man who wasn’t just born a “villain” but gradually descended into the dark side we see him at

some seem to complain that he’s a “sociopath” and all his emotions are fake but that’s not necessarily the case we don’t have to define every villain as a “sociopath” or whatever label that comes with a set of fixed traits people can be quite complex one person may be a great father but a lying cheating murderous gangster one doesn’t justify the other of course

in this case snow was a complex character he felt love for the girl and he also felt love towards tigris and his family’s honor and image and he had aspirations of his own

when he was about to stay with lucy gray and spoke with tigris on the phone he was clearly conflicted between his goals towards his family name lifestyle and career goals vs his love life friendships and the whole package that comes with them and he had one foot in and one foot out on everything

in a way i feel lucy gray is also complex in her own way she did seem to have feelings for him but at the same time part of her couldn’t trust him and the other part wasn’t sure whether they’ll be able to live happily together even if she fully trusted him due to the differences in their outlook on life and capability to adapt she spoke about how the capitol isn’t for her and he spoke about how life in 12 or outside isn’t his thing either

so both of them had their own conflicting emotions wants and needs and ultimately one of them succumbed to the darker side and the other chose to be free and that’s what makes the story so amazing they were realistic characters who fell in love but were both too young too different and their youth and difference in upbringing and outlook on life made their ability to continue together to be impossible

sometimes people’s relationships fall apart not because they don’t love each other but because they love other things more and snow loved his life goals regardless of their cost and morality and she couldn’t live with that",2023-11-18
yea the movie doesnt show that snow is a sociopath well enough,2023-11-17
" i did love flickerman though

flickerman sr was definitely a highlight was very entertaining seeing him try to work the show out and sell it in contrast to his son who had it down pat",2023-11-17
i really agree with this comment theres a lot of comments below about wanting to split this into two movies and tbhi think that wouldnt have worked well i found the pacing of the book and movie to be pretty similar but as you mentioned the difference is how snows sociopathic traits translate and they do translate better in the book because we can see more of his internal monologue  interactions with ma,2023-11-17
yes i agree i saw the movie with my nonbook reader husband and he thought that snow was driven by greed for money and when i explained that snow is more driven by entitlement and jealousy he said that made a lot of sense harder to portray for sure but it makes a huge difference for the story being told,2023-11-17
"i agree cutting mrs plinth was something that could have greatly elevated some of the story beats here   
sejanus death didnt hit nearly as hard as in the book because of this  
  
it was still a bleak moment but it would have been way more of a gut punch if we had gotten just a few scenes of the coryo with mrs plinth",2023-11-22
"this is why i watch the movie before im about to listen to the audiobook because i knew theyre going to have to leave a lot out you cant really convince 15 hours into a 3hour film or two and a half hour film but i thought it was freaking amazing in my opinion i feel like the movie like wallet didnt translate the book better than the original movies i feel like this is the best movie out of all the hunger games movies

like as a movie i feel like it just has more of a movie type plot than the original hunger games did it really makes me kind of want to have a tv show that follows the hunger games as theyre being throughout the years and all the different characters we meet i think itd be really fun

but i understand what makes this series so good is how finished it is and the stories direction it took i feel like theyve done well",2023-11-19
coming to this late and i haven’t read the book but i got a lot of that internal struggle through blythes acting especially the third act i thought he got a lot of “internal monologue” through his eyes however they didn’t have enough of that in the first two acts of the movie if they had just given him more space to act and more quiet moments in general instead of rushing through the plot at first i think that would have all gotten through,2023-11-23
"i agree i enjoyed the movie as i am a huge fan of this series and it was honestly shot beautifully actors were great too but i just kept thinking like if i hadnt read the book before id be hella confused i feel like they did not flesh out parts of the story enough or delve into the intentions or implications of their actions i understand that we cannot have snows internal monologue in the movies but i wish there was some way to at least show some of it 

for me i also wish they didnt change the scene where clemensia gets bit by the snakes because it was so much more suspenseful and unsettling in the books as they didnt know what was happening until it was too late also they made it seem like she deserved it bc she lied but i remember in the books he was okay with her name on the proposal too since she was so upset about her classmates death and was horrified about what happened 

this is important bc it was almost another turning point in the book where snow really saw how cruel ruthless and unhinged dr gaul was in fact i wish they hadnt cut out the aftermath and how dr gaul continued to experiment on clemensia either bc it further showed how insane and how far she was willing to go with ease of course there were many reasons for snows descent into madness but personally i think his growing fear of dr gaul throughout the book had a substantial influence on his actions too just the overall horror of it all probably cemented the idea that he needed to land on top to protect himself making it easier to later justify his actions and thus the descent",2023-11-25
also a book reader haven’t watched the movie yet and i while i was reading i was concerned how they would translate this onto the screen the plot structure and progression with the games at the beginning of the story threw me off you would’ve thought that would be the climax and then with the rest of the book being more psychological and “lower” stakes it felt weird i’ll be honest i wasn’t as excited about the story compared with the original trilogy but it might also be my age talking,2023-11-17
right like ma calls him a second son gives him food and supports the funding for his university and snow just nods and calls himself sejanus’s best friend when he got him killed it’s insidious and a lot of people definitely would’ve been more angry because there’s so much more buildup to what a horrible person snow is by introducing ma and her actions,2023-12-04
the internal monologue part was why i hated they split 3 into two movies as so much of it was the main character wrestling with their sanity in their head that it just didnt translate well enough for 1 movie nevermind 2,2023-11-19
i was actually surprised at how faithful it was to the book but how good would it have been for this to have been a limited series i know people think tv shows are over done but you’re right the ma storyline and the mentor timeline should have been explored deeper but realistically they just couldn’t fit that in it would have also given them a chance to draw and flesh out the peacekeeper part overall i was pleasantly surprised by how much i liked this movie considering i thought the trailer was a bit cringe and low rotten tomatoes score but maybe that’s just because i’m a long time hunger games fan haha,2023-11-24
"how hypocritical his thoughts are and how he will in the same breath criticize someone and then do the same exact thing but of course for him it’s okay

examples

putting that aside i have to say my biggest criticism was the cut of ma i think she should’ve been included

shes in it briefly",2023-11-18
"as a nonbook reader i wish this had been 2 movies it would’ve given us more time to better understand characters relationships and motivations

i thought the actors were amazing and it’s a credit to the movie that i wish they had given us more time to “live” with these characters without snow’s internal monologue or at least a tool like a journal it made it hard to understand snow’s actions 

with 2 movies the first one ending with the games and the second one starting with district 12 maybe the screenwriters could’ve allow us to become more attached to the relationships feel snow’s betrayals more fully and make snow’s personality change less jarring",2023-12-03
is the book good ive been wanting to read it,2023-12-06
movie didnt really show it that well,2024-02-25
i couldve done without dinklages death scene something a little more subtle wouldve gone a longer way imo,2023-11-26
gotta disagree on dinklage haven’t read the book but it felt like such a one note character,2023-12-04
snow basically used all of lucy grey’s donations for that water bomb kamikaze,2023-12-11
"my favorite character because he was so absurdly oblivious and socially awkward for being a magician and weatherman he just accepts the games as part of life because hes too dimwitted to have an opinion on its morality hes not evil  just oblivious but he has a ton of great oneliners and i loved how schwartzman played it

tuberculosis on legs is simultaneously the films funniest and most wicked line",2023-11-20
"yeah i’m honestly thankful i read the book for this movie felt necessary in order to understand the actual depth behind each scene it was cool to see it all come to life and the chemistry was great between the two main characters but yeah it definitely did feel like my imagination while reading 
hopefully a rewatch will help also did not help i read the book a week prior lol so ofc im gonna compare it harshly",2023-11-18
gosh yes her accent was so distracting the entire time it was like all i could focus on,2023-11-28
so snow descended into madness  everyone on the thread or who has read the book is saying he was sociopath from the very beginning  and apparently the movie was hiding this from the audience,2023-12-21
i was picturing the broncos stadium the whole time was a bit disappointed to see the brutalist architecture and a really small arena,2023-11-24
" everything up through snow becoming a peacekeeper felt really long everything after felt really rushed snow descending into madness needed more time 

this wasnt really all that different from my experience with reading the book although i felt the pacing more in the book whereas the movie felt like a bullet train in comparison the adaptation for what they chose to focus on was really well done  i do wish they couldve kept more of the character moments like how jessups mentor sends in the water herself because she knows hes going to die and would rather coryo save his water instead he tells her to do it and there is no alliance the lack of coryos internal monologue really suffers due to how the movie never really takes much time to establish many character dynamics beyond the surface level",2023-12-09
they somewhat did through his sister when he tells her he liked the feeling killing the tribute gave him that was when the alarm bells started going off cause before that all his actions seem at least understandable even if u disagree even killing the tribute was understandable because you believe he does it so lucy will have one less person to worry about he did it out of love but then at the end you start to question that,2023-12-03
i loved snows sisters character she was clearly trying to steer him in the right direction she went through everything he went through as a child and still had lots of empathy as an adult and she was willing to go through the burdens of borderline poverty and homelessness if it meant not sacrificing her beliefsvalues she never once pressures snow to go all out to win the games it’s always snow who puts all the pressure on himself,2023-12-03
that was my thought and then hes like just use it in case you need to win,2023-11-19
yeah i thought that initially too lol,2023-11-20
"i didnt see it as aiding suicide  

although its kind of a terrible gift to give to a gladiator  the movie really had to work hard to find a way for her to be able to utilize that poison",2023-12-21
same here what a missed oportunity a quick closeup shot of his face would have been a nice final touch,2023-11-18
it would have been cool if like it flashes to him right before the the reaping of the 75th annual hunger games that would be really cool but i hope that theres going to be at least some other filler content or like a tv show or something to kind of bridge the gap because i would still love to see some more of this universe and this world and how this old hunger games story kind of grows throughout time,2023-11-19
people dont understand that this means youd have to pay the actor who played old snow even just for one shot by just using his voice they dont have to pay him,2024-01-03
it came off too strong when she got off the train but i felt like for the rest of the movie it settled and was fine i was very worried at first though,2023-11-17
her character isn’t really born or raised anywhere the covey are nomads who kind of just got stuck in 12 when the districts were formed,2023-11-17
she didn’t decide the accent suzanne collins always imagined her with an appalachian accent when she did readings a few years ago she gave lucy an appalachian accent,2023-11-17
lol yeah i dont think the accent was too bad but i dont really get why it was necessary,2023-11-17
i feel like such an outcast but i seriously disliked her performance she was so unlikeable to me i know she’s singing in the books but  that does not translate well into a film her musical theatre background had her acting feel incredibly over the top i felt absolutely nothing for her character it was rough imo,2023-11-17
could have been books kind of imply they are southern,2023-11-17
“my momma used to bathe me in buttermilk and rose petals”  between her first song and that line i was ready to give up on this movie it got significantly better as the accent waned,2023-12-10
ok i’m from texas and this was my biggest complaint about the movie i thought rachel was good at times but she very clearly does not have the natural southerncountrybluegrass persona,2023-11-18
"that has got to be one of the worst attempts at a southernappalachian accent in movie history like nic cage in con air bad just all over the place and way too heavy 

bless her heart",2023-11-19
i just wish she would have decided to use the accent or not sometimes it was present normally it wasn’t and it became really distracting when she would try to force it in,2023-11-22
"i actually imagined lucy gray as cockneysounding even though that makes no sense a bit like eliza doolittle in any case i imagined her with a thick accent and a lilting singsong voice so this really worked for me

district 12 is roughly supposed to be appalachia im no expert in us geography but it seems to incorporate several southern states

i also associate double barrel names like the covey have with the deep south",2023-11-18
her accent was so bad i hated it it was also gone some parts of the movie,2023-11-18
was rough felt like a forrest gump impersonation at points,2023-11-17
the southern accent is more carolina tennessee georgia alabama etc than texas,2023-12-17
do you think actors decide the accent they use in movies,2023-11-17
the dialogue to go with the country twang didn’t fit the fact that she’s a “kid”,2023-11-24
hated that adaption and translation terrible,2023-11-24
in the books everyone in district 12 has an appalachian accent,2023-12-07
i literally doublechecked the panem map afterwards to see if district 12 was in texas waaay too much…,2023-12-18
it made me really want to see her play her characters shakespearean namesake she would be an amazing volumnia,2023-11-18
"shes great but this was basically amanda waller but more unhinged

i think she gets handed the same type of roles but im not complaining because she always aces the assignment",2023-11-19
i felt like she was having a lot of fun really gave the character some life,2023-11-19
finally she isnt some leader of some nefarious government organization which i feel like its all she ever does,2023-11-19
she was having so much fun chew that scenery viola i am here for it,2023-11-25
viola is a powerhouse,2024-02-19
i never really read that snow hated katniss in fact he always seemed kind of fond of her what she did threatened the stability of panem and his rule so he had to  her or try but i never read him as hating her in fact at the end he helped her put an end to the whole thing and he was true to his word about being honest with her,2023-11-18
dude the book is great i personally liked the movie more they focus a lot on the music in the book and rachel zegler just killed it singing the songs that were in the book i had no idea how to interpret the music in my head but i feel like if i read the book again it would be elevated even more now that i can hear the music,2023-11-17
having katniss sing songs that hed first heard from lucy grey and the hanging tree which lucy grey wrote about a hanging he attended must have hit hard,2023-11-18
i read the book several times and didnt realize until i saw the trailer for the movie that snow looks like peeta  at least the way peeta was described in the books  thats why he hates katniss so much he thinks she is faking with peeta just like he ultimately thought lucy was faking with him,2023-11-18
"im going to listen to the book right now because everyones saying hes a sociopath and that like he hates katniss but like i see it the other way around that he likes katniss because i feel like if you really hated katniss he got it done so much more

but throughout the stories he was always trying to give katniss a chance by warning her trying to get her to help him corral panam and be that fearinducing thing that he was and i feel like if he really hated her he would not have done that

but like everything he did to people was also done to him ill see how i feel once i read the book and i kind of get a better understanding of him through the book rather than the movie which kind of biased me towards him rather than against him",2023-11-19
rachel added the bow in the book it was just a curtsy but she thought about making it a bow to match katniss it was a great addition,2023-11-20
my girl who didn’t read or see any of the books picked up that katniss reminded him of lucy gray too,2023-11-25
pretty sure that was obvious to all of us they did that part well and her talking about the origin of the name katniss,2023-11-19
i for sure thought we would see his older version just before his death or something,2023-11-17
the audio clip of sutherland saying its what you love most that destroy you felt really on the nose at the end,2023-11-18
yeah i thought we’d see older him overseeing the games or something,2023-11-18
kinda like rhaenyra’s face at the end of season 1 of house of the dragon,2023-11-17
"yeah i thgt seeing snow dying as coin was shot was a good
callback",2023-11-17
i was hoping the voiceover would say theres a real slim shady in all of us since he spent half the movie looking like an eminem stunt double,2023-12-23
was hoping for it,2023-11-20
same i came out of the theater three hours ago and i am still spiraling down every reddit discussion  wiki page on this movie  i don’t plan on stopping anytime soon,2023-11-22
exactly what i was thinking for being a hunger games movie this one felt pretty disturbing compared to the others but that’s the reality of the world of panem,2023-11-27
you ate this analysis this made so much sense,2023-11-22
personally i could agree but i don’t think she ever loved him,2023-12-20
im glad they didnt do that it wouldve come off as really weird fan service imo,2023-11-18
i binged the hunger games films before watching ballad tonight and i am 100 convinced that they used jennifer lawrences are you are you coming to the tree right before blending with rachel zegler singing the next verse at least once,2023-11-23
somehow  lucy gray returns,2023-11-20
" was it just me or when lucy grey was singing it was blended with jennifer lawrences voice i swear it sounded super similar

i thought the exact same thing",2023-11-19
i thought this for a second too but then i was like wait they showed katniss’s real mom…,2023-11-20
that would too similar to star wars,2023-12-20
there is a solid theory that she is president coin’s mother if it helps since there was some level of familiarity the two coin and snow seemed to have towards each other and it was never clear if it was just reputation recognition of a kindred spirit or if the characters had met  knew something about each other another theory was that she was coin herself something not true in the film series but was just as plausible for the same reasons in the books,2024-01-10
i dont think its out of the question that sejanus might have a bit of a crush on snow less so in the movie than in the book but its still there i wish they had leaned in to that a bit more especially since they cut the one  character from the book to be fair he was a really minor character,2023-11-19
you aren’t alone the way sejanus looked at him at times made me think is something going on here,2023-11-21
i thought the same  the districts seemed like a much nicer place to live in those days all in all,2023-11-25
i just realized that yes there was not the electric fence until snow was in power i wonder if snow implemented that knowing that district people would run like he tried to and wanted to stop any chance,2023-12-10
gotta give him credit though he ushered in 64 years of success at the games before that,2023-11-18
"agreed i went in having read about the rushed 3rd act but came out totally confused by the criticism 

snow was already a jaded selfish person at the beginning of the movie  losing his friend and lucy  well that destroyed what little empathy he had for others left in the end hes just a selfish bitter power hungry little social climber not far off from what he was at the beginning of the movie i dont think it was the movies job to transform him into the snow we know by the end of it even in the end he didnt seem evil just spiteful and greedy who knows what atrocities he has to commit in order to reach the presidency im fine with them not showing that part of his life though it was still a fitting end all in all",2023-11-17
the third act isnt very good in the book too  i was actually glad they rushed it in the movie because it really drags in the book,2023-11-18
as someone who read the book when it first came out i loved the third act not to say you’re claiming the “it wasn’t good” take is universal just offering a counter perspective,2023-11-19
i liked it a lot was fascinating watch the principle protagonist fall,2023-11-20
we had no insight on how the peacekeepers are living which wouldve been nice it was explained in the book and i thought billy taupe shouldve been a bit more antagonistic to snow primarily expressing snows jealously that lucy had feelings for someone else billy ultimately was just a  who was also a rebel and thats all we needed to know to side with snow billy and mayfairs deaths should have been more tragic and spruce and sejanus shouldve been more devastating we didnt even see how sejanus mom had taken in snow and treated him like her own son just for saving him from the arena,2023-11-22
"also studio care about box office number these days 
so even a good movie but underperformed in the  or straight up underperformed and rotten then clearly you can kiss goodbye to part 2",2023-12-02
i was hoping he would have to grab it to fight off some tributes as a funny katniss parallel,2023-11-24
that’s what i told my wife after this this was like the star wars prequels but actually well done,2023-11-19
i thought that its a much better way to show a villian origin story because its not they killed my dad so now im evil after being amazing through the entire piece  he starts out grey and ends up dark,2023-11-18
"anything at all happens 

rachel zegler so anyway here’s a song",2023-12-18
"snow was very different from anakin anakin is immature reckless and a psychotic mess by the time revenge of the sith starts he’s arguably mentally ill as he’s experiencing dreams that he fully believes will become reality just because of his mom’s death it was like a psychosis with anakin he created all his issues after his mom died

snow was just cold and calculated he experienced some hardship in his life but he turns that into relentless ambition to become powerful whereas anakin literally just loses his mind due to fear of losing his wife",2023-12-03
"well nothing could be worse than anakin so the bar is very low  

but there was no progression in snows character  
he was good then as suddenly as  ash in the evil dead he was bad",2023-12-21

on the contrary i was surprised by how little she seemed to sing tbh i was expecting to feel overwhelmed as im not into theatre kids vibes in movies avid hater of glee but the singing was far less than i thought it would be,2023-12-05
they turned hunger games into disney trashher whole role felt disconnected from the movie like another universe,2023-12-25
thought the same it made him look like slim shady and he turned way too quickly it’s like the quality and the pacing of the movie and his character were kept in his hair,2023-12-01
"i am late to the game but i listened to the audiobook and just saw the movie at least the songs were melodic in the movie in the audiobook they were the worst part of the book and i despised any time a song started because they went on forever and the narrator read the lyrics in this weird monotone choppedup pace the same way for every song

like even with a song like oh my darling clementine and the songs added nothing to the story 90 of the time",2023-12-19
if they ever make an eminem biopic they know who to call holy  he looked a lot like him when he had the blonde buzz cut it took me out of the movie sometimes lol,2024-01-06
"the fact he did it for all the people in the area and not just from his district and not only that used the countries own flag to give them dignity in death is so good 

very reminiscent of katnis giving rue a flower funeral and mourning her death 

viola davis whole humanity are ruthless animals fall flat here people are capable of extreme amounts of kindness even when it might not make sense 

i thought along side that moment with the guy covering them but the girl cutting the tied guy down after giving him a merciful death was also a really nice moment of giving a stranger dignity in death",2023-11-21
reaper arranging the bodies was something i was so glad they kept in the movie it added some unspoken background to who he was as a person in the book even though he didnt get much attention and the movie gives him even less,2023-12-09
its funny because even though book sejanus is supposed to be sympathetic and tragic i found him quite annoying i was like come on man you got to be smarter than that after every dumb decision he made basically begging to get himself killed,2023-11-17
"good write up of points

in regards to your sejanus character question  he was annoying but i felt like that was the point he was meant to be a bit of a naive eye roller going into the arena to mourn his friend that didn’t even like him but to me sang true to form 

i’m not sure if i was personalising his character and not to get political at all but his character rang very true to me  i know people like sejanus in real life i have family members that post ecowarrior tirades on facebook while they drive bmw’s and fly jets overseas the irony of the 1 who are educated enough to parrot the moral high ground whilst living a life of luxury

i know the writer has spoken before about her father serving in iraq and i can see a bit of that here as well i served in the military and the amount of people i’ve heard pour out their holierthanthou do gooder charity spiels that would absolutely melt if they were dropped in a middle eastern warzone is staggering every tom  and harry thinks they can solve and geopolitical issue from their dinner table but never even visit these places

i felt like this was represented really well by sejanus enlisting his heart was in the right place he wanted to help people but then when he got down to the nittygritty he was genuinely scared by the environment and died begging for his mummy

very aware my interpretation may be personal though",2023-11-17
there’s an episode of the tv series uncanny where they investigate a ghost sighting in a property that was formerly owned by a mining magnate the woman who saw the ghost thinks that he’s about eight years old but when the researchers look into deaths that took place in or near the property the youngest male they can find died at 14 they then speak to a historian who says that the average height of a 15 year old mining child at the time was four foot four so the tributes could have been around the age of 14 just malnourished and deformed from endless work in the dark,2023-11-22
tiktok is giving me a lot of  oh snow hes so hot but then the movie ends and hes evil,2023-11-18
that scene at the end of the game was great but it really  me off that they had used the sound of rope tightening as the sound of the snakes slithering on the ground and on the tributes i felt like it was a weird choice and it really took me out of an otherwise gripping scene,2023-12-24
the capitol prides itself on their diversity and inclusion when it comes to child sacrifice,2023-11-18

also did they not interrogate him at all why was he hung immediately without having the opportunity to throw snow under the bus,2023-11-18
"it was interesting to see the aesthetic and vibe because panem was advanced enough technologically to have an epic war in the dark days but many of the fancy tech that was in the original four was absent i didnt notice that until after we got out so i let it slide

but i really liked how they set up the games as a much more raw and barbaric games it makes sense that the districts wouldnt watch the games because who wants to watch your children killing other children and vice versa but the evolution of the games to the spectacle with stylists trackers and such from basically dumping 24 kids into a basic arena and telling them to slug it out was fascinating to see because it fit with the story

the games were on life support no pun intended because capitol citizens were getting bored with them because they were short  hence why none of the mentors prepared to be there longer than one day  and primitive with a bunch of teenagers grabbing weapons and swinging at each other id like to see the evolution of snow from gamemaker to president as i think it would involve him pushing the spectacle that the games became and responsible for increasing its ratings introducing betting etc

the circle would then be complete his father steals the drunken ramblings of casca and turns it into the games to get the credit and then corio steals ideas from others to enhance the games and raise his own profile",2023-11-20
yall cant complain nonstop when movies split the book in two and then also complain when they listen to you and keep it limited to just one,2023-11-17
as another comment mentioned i really don’t think we need more of these splitpart movies though i think this one would’ve been better suited as a miniseries part one would’ve been portraying snow as too sympathetic and as the clear hero while part two would veer too far the opposite direction when his characterisation is more layered than that and i think they did a decent job with him given the lack of an internal monologue you could get from the book however that might be more of a credit to tom blyth’s performance than the script,2023-11-17
i think make it one movie was the right call if they had split it into two films the first part would have ended with the end of the game that means the second film would suffer the same problem of the last two films of the original tetralogy did the hunger games film without the game its kinda bummer for the audiences who expect action from the series,2023-11-18
"the director said that he regretted doing two parts for mockingjay  that having a year long break doesnt work

i guess you could do a harry potter and the cursed child sort of thing where viewers needed to watch both parts on the same or different days",2023-11-18
yeah there were several times i felt the movie should’ve been more flushed out to explain something that seemed almost random followed by a lot more scenes than i thought would occur on a subject i say that as a nonbook reader but the husband of a bookie,2023-11-17
i didn’t mind it as one and i don’t think two parts would have been good for drawing in audiences when the prequel is a little more niche not many would buy tickets for prequel part 2 or an unsatisfying part 1 that you have to wait a year to be resolved,2023-11-23
i thought it was over when he got sent off to district 12,2023-12-06
i think the problem is that the book isnt long enough to separate it into three parts and youd either have to cut the games in half or add in a lot of filler to make two even movies out of it,2023-11-20
and risk of part 2 never happening movie studio care too much about box office numbers,2023-12-02
somehow i totally didn’t notice the lack of blood until people are pointing it out i guess i’m not a very observant movie viewer but it benefited me lol,2023-11-23
i dont really get the whole blood thing being stabbed in the neck by a bottle is pretty gnarly anyway  adding some blood to it wouldnt have elevated it that much higher in terms of scare factor it would have just made it more realistic,2023-11-19
my guess  so snow sent the recording to dr gaul who then shipped it back out to the general at 12   she had to have edited it so that snows voice wasnt on it just sejanus  dr gaul saw great value in snow and would have had his back,2023-11-17
i interpreted it as lucy not knowing that snow sent it in personally she knew about the jabberjays and stuff so she probably just thought that one of the ones they captured “made it back” to the capitol,2023-11-18
the third  was the kid in the arena when he was rescuing sirjanus wasn’ didn’t he  a second person when he killed the mayor’s daughter,2023-12-02
"the author wont write a book unless she has something to say and the director wont do another movie without the author

she has mentioned possibly doing a book from the point of view of a career tribute  that would work with her goal of teaching kids about the horrors of war  

id like for her to write another gregor the overlander book to get that series attention and get that series adapted it would have to be animated even with great cgi theres a problem that one of the main characters is a toddler through the entire series  that series is fantastic and dark it would run into ratings issues",2023-11-18
they covered everything that happened in the book so no,2023-11-18
the movie to me was absolutely fantastic i was anxious as  in my chair  because of the cinematography it felt like i was genuinely in the arena and in the woods when coriolanus was looking for lucy i was anxious at every moment at what was going to come next it was amazing  to see so many comments be like “ehhh it should’ve been two parts” or “it left much to be desired” is making me a little sad ,2023-11-22
i just got around to seeing it and i feel very similar to you i read some of the thoughts on the movie and it sometimes feels like people enjoy nothing less than perfection while i didnt read this book i did read the original three books and ill catch up with this one at some point but i found the film very enjoyable theres nothing wrong with some criticism but i feel like some people are really over dramatic about it,2023-12-04
one of my gripes is that the film should have shown more hints and nuances for audience to accept his change at the ending i didnt read the book and it felt a bit out of nowhere and sudden im not sure which was the problem script directing performance or maybe it was just a little bit of everything even though i really liked and enjoyed the film i cannot erase the thought it could have been better especially the third act,2023-11-18
curious while i agree with you its coriolanus who hesitated ive seen someone in this comment section argue it was lucy who was hesitant with the kiss,2023-11-25
"i agree i loved it i am not even particularly a fan of the franchise i like it but only watched the movies never read the books but i loved this one definitely my favorite while the other movies are entertaining in my opinion for me personally they stuck too much to the arenagame part understandably thats the whole point and only in the final movie we kind of see interesting things panem the war politics etc  


this movie is drastically different politics context interesting characters driven by ambition guilt delusion revenge in other words believable complexity a love story much more interesting and endearing that the rather lame ones in the trilogy full of conflict yet still pretty realistic we see more of the securitymilitary aspect and how it works from within and the main actor kills it  


i might rewatch it again i hope for a sequel",2023-11-23
such an average movie,2023-11-29
the books do a better job of explaining the turn snow is a sociopath that literally doesnt care about most people around him,2023-11-17
i felt the same way re the ending his change to manic didnt make sense how did he go from loving her to wanting to  her,2023-11-17
and this is why characters especially mentors suffered from lack of development because people just want action and games,2023-11-17
the games was the worst part of this movie to me lol,2023-11-18
if you felt like he wasnt a slimey  the entire movie then youve fallen for his spell,2023-11-25
yeah i agree i loved the movie up until the end of the games completely caught me off guard when i realized there was a third part that section felt very slow and then snow kind of just snaps out of nowhere i was expecting for something big to happen that would turn him more villainous but he just kind of decides to start acting that way,2023-12-03
the colors were meant to be dull because this is before the hunger games were a flashy spectacle and the tributes were dressed up and paraded around instead of treated like animals before the games it was meant to display all the changes snow brought in to keep the games going and getting people’s attention also it is set 10 years after the war the capitol is still rebuilding and torn down,2023-11-18
can you say more about the lack of visual craft i totally agree but i’m having a hard time pointing it out i just felt like there were so many surprises visually in catching fire and this movie felt a lot more like mockingjay and especially that cafeteria set that they were eating in at the academy it just looked like they threw some curtains up in a hallway,2023-11-25
" sejanus is really just a foil with more screen time than he deserved in this movie

yeah for the conscience of the movie he didnt really do anything  he volunteers to go to area 12 because snow was sentenced to 20 years there  then he gets money to the rebels and oh my theyve bought some guns with it also i thought he was the presidents son and couldnt be hanged hes just doing dumb things that are obviously going to be found out and hes too smart a person to be doing the things hes supposed to have done  

 snow’s character the 25 hours successfully turns a charismatic empathetic young man into a nowiconic literary villain    

he only became a villain in last 5 minutes of the movie with very little foreshadowing his premeditated betrayal of sejanus just comes off as confusing he doesnt act villainous before or after the betrayal",2023-12-21
"i liked it but i agree wholeheartedly that the accents were horrible and music was a bit rough sometimes lucy sounded british sometimes she sounded like forrest gump 

the music is a bit like the hobbit i understand it’s in the book and i like a faithful adaption but i just don’t think the songs translate

particularly the one where lucy was being wrapped in cgi snakes starts out okay like panicked humming and then she’s suddenly performing musical theatre to the camera with instrumental cringe worthy",2023-11-17
im flat out in an argument right now with my step daughter lol she doesnt like the fact i called the movie a musical i mean there was legit like 10 songs in this,2023-11-18
youve summed up most of my thoughts pretty well im not really into ya books or most blockbusters but my girlfriend is a big hunger games fan and while i think the film had lots of flaws i still ended up enjoying it quite a bit for some reason its not exactly great cinema but its not schlock and it feels like it has soul even if imperfectly executed,2023-11-27
when i got out of the movie i immediately googled who played sejanus because i was convinced that he had to be vincent donofrios son,2023-11-20
i thought the same thing even had a plotrelevant foot locker and his dynamic with snow sort of reminded me of pyle and joker,2023-11-19
"i think in this case part 1 would have been amazing because it would have ended with the games ending and that alone would have made a great movie i could have walked away after he was sent to the military and well i would have had questions i would have been content

but then when part 2 would be announced and id be like what the second movie just wouldnt be as good how could you justify just the district part of the movie i feel like if they could have done a part two where it starts with him out in district 12 she betrays him and then it goes back to the capital and him interacted with periodiclich again and killing him and then moving on to where he likes does his next year the hunger games and it ends right there that could have been interesting but you would have to add a lot the book it didnt actually have in the first place

its not a movie in one single movie this should have been done as like an hbo series and maybe start it up a longer running franchise that continues the journey of snow and all these various characters as well as even the rebels and how they get to the point of the hunger games and then maybe even doing a complete retelling of the original three books and have it be this mega tv show that kind of follows all of the hunger games and all of the ins and outs maybe it skips a good amount of time throughout but eventually comes up to where we are at the end of mockingjay and then maybe theres more to follow after that",2023-11-19
thank you i was thinking the same thing ,2023-12-03
totally agree the third act started to drag slightly for me i think because it felt like a huge chunk had been skipped but it was a really well done movie with very nuanced characters and storytelling,2023-11-25
"i read the first three books and enjoyed them about the same as the movies ie i didnt really like the third book or third movies much

i havent read this prequel book but i just saw the movie and i liked a lot about it eg it shows the origin of the games and even the early stages of the capital  but there was also quite a bit it got wrong like snows quick turn at the end all of the singing and often in silly ways and the bad pacing of the third act that was a bit murky and thrown together  like why would a rich guy like the game master just take drugs some guy he hates throws on the desk  thats just one example

it was better than i thought though and since i did generally enjoy the first books it has me interested in reading this prequel book but id still say at least the first two moves are better than this one  it did have good parts though",2024-02-20
"we need three more movies in this universe in this order

1 mags with appearances from lucy grey as she helps develop the resistance in district 13
2 haymitch with appearances from tigris to document her transformation into the cat lady
3 johanna mason or beetee with alma coin’s rise to power",2023-11-21
"i dont feel like you necessarily chose his personal gains but he chose what was more comfortable for him like imagine if you were suddenly enlisted in the military and then banished to like thailand or something and you have an option to help join the thailand people from like rebelling against america or run off with this random title you met or you could go home back to your family like nothing ever happened of course you would choose going back home to your family like nothing ever happened

i feel like if you really loved the girl he would have found a way to bring her back with him obviously people found their way into the capital if sejanus did i dont think she would have come with him but i feel like if he truly was a nicer person and he wasnt a selfish he would have offered her to come back with him but that never crossed his mind",2023-11-19
a movie of him just being a badass and getting his way would be awesome no holds barred no  given just a movie of what it’s like being a badass with full control homelander style,2023-11-19
i thought this was one of the worst such bad pacing and quite frankly it was pretty boring imo,2023-11-29
yup kind of odd but the mix reaction mostly came from top critics which yeah i was baffled by since i thought the movie was pretty good but maybe some of them were not engaged by it which is odd coming from them given how much leeway they give other films,2023-11-29
" dont understand the mixed reactions at all to me this was the best hunger games movie by a wide margin

agree  i found the earlier films formulaic and predictable and hated peeta as a hack actor  

 snows turn was pretty well communicated   

it was

ok but why does he turn then at the cabin  if he was going to betray her why would he wait till hed gone awol from base and was miles away from any settlement why go crazy at the cabin and what was that gun there they only stopped there bc he wanted to fish rather than press on so it was coincidence they stopped there anyway i wont even ask what a fully furnished unlocked unoccupied cabin is doing in the middle of nowhere did snow figure out that she was part of the rebels because the guns were there but she said fishing poles were there it was gunsonly no poles why did she tell him to look there if there were guns not fishing poles wait why would someone hide fishing poles under the floorboards in the first place  so many questions about that scene

and finally why would he betray her she wasnt a rebel she had nothing to do with the gun deal did she",2023-12-21
i agree with 99 of your random thoughts,2023-12-14
it doesnt come out of nowhere its just seems rushed as if the writers made him too likable and suddenly needed to find a reason to make him turn similar to daenerys in got s08e05,2023-12-20
katniss was mostly morally good but very survival based and with a ptsd peeta was more the person who was always great and sincere and gale the one most interested in rebellion and larger issues,2023-12-20
hard disagree on the series part don’t think it would’ve gotten as much interestattention as a series and risks people losing interest when things switch from movies to series,2023-11-17
agreed about the cinematography the shot from below looking up at snow holding his mothers scarf and his face slowly changing was great it reminded me of the scene in dexter where trinity played by john lithgow enters an elevator and when the door closes his  expression changes from the mask to his real self,2023-11-19
i’m with you on the mini series i kept trying to think of things to cut because it all get important but i was starting to get impatient towards the end of the second part,2023-12-04
hbo miniseries wouldve been fantastic them trying to hide the bloodgore to maintain some pgrating was such a cop out,2023-11-18
"i thought the acting was impressive but they were fighting for their life trying to get a good performance out of that abysmal dialogue 

viola davis in particular is a brilliant actor and even she struggled making gaul into something other than a pantomime disney villain like cruella deville meets ursula 

whoever wrote the dialogue and chose to just lift lines from the book verbatim and throw them in haphazardly needs to be publicly flogged",2023-11-22
rachel zeglers performance as lucy is truly one of the worst acting performances that i have ever seen in my entire life how anyone could think that was fantastic is absolutely beyond me,2023-11-19
the capitol is still recovering from the war in this movie theyre still rebuilding and the early hunger games being just raw brutality just keeps that feeling of war fresh in the books iirc the city isnt even completely clear of rubble yet most capitol citizens cant afford makeup and those who can would only use simple ones,2023-11-19
"he killed the three men

nitpick but one of them was a woman",2023-11-18
"i think it makes sense if you look at it from like being a teenager and its your first love and you know how you feel when someone that you thought you loved never loved you or you were never sure and youre kind of caught in your head and you just kind of mentally implode a little bit and you dont really give a  about anything i think thats what happened to snow at the very end there and thats what justifies his switch because its not really a switch hes still a decent person at this point hes not completely a psychopath but he realizes now especially after being in the games at one time that and the way he was raised during the war he has no family he had no moral guiding structure but to survive and so i think he miss associates killing and getting whats out of your way out of your way so you can continue trudging forward

and so he just develops like you know what they deserve to die its a thought we all have we watch movies and tv shows or reason people in real life that do really messed up evil things you just think well they should have died that can easily be miss done if you have the incorrect moral system or moral guidelines of what constitutes that endpoint

honestly its the same decision that katniss made at the end of mockingjay she decided to  i forget her name the lady that runs district 13 instead of killing snow because she realized what she would be allowing but also she did it because she killed her sister",2023-11-19
i know people complain about everything being too long nowadays but i truly feel like a three hour version of this movie would have fixed  lot of problems i had with the third act,2023-11-20
i still like the ending i feel like studios need to start making like a movie for the theatrical release that kind of is like what were watching now but then actually shoot an extra hour and a half of movie and then on like a dvd release or like on streaming theres like an extended cut so that you can come back and theres more explanation and its more expounded out because i definitely could see another like hour of this movie but i dont think i could sit in the theater for another hour for that movie but i could definitely do it at home,2023-11-19
i laughed at “i need a drinkget me a drink” lol,2023-11-19
"you never find out which is the point the film is largely from snows pov as its his story so we see lucy gray through snows eyes as you said there are times where it genuinely seems like she loves him  she did risk her freedom and life to save him in the arena after all  there are other times where it seems like its an act snow was absolutely in love with her which is what bore the quote its the things we love most that destroy us

the same ambiguity existed with the gun in the cabin would snow actually shoot her to eliminate a loose end the way its shot is it doesnt matter if he wouldve  the point is lucy believed he might and she was so close to freedom that she couldnt take any chances she had just survived the games and illegally running away north so at that point she was allin and snows demeanor made her think that if it wasnt right then he might decide down the road she was too much of a risk

since were looking at it through snows eyes we see lucy gray for the last time through his soul he thinks she was playing him but never really knows and part of him wants desperately to believe that she diddoes love him thats why i think that part stayed very true to the story

if youre asking do i think that lucy loved snow  i think she did have those feelings for him but she also knew that he was still a capitol citizen at his core and he had lied to her several times already so she knew she could never fully trust him so that was the genesis for her idea to run and snake trap the scarf",2023-11-20
its pretty clear she was teetering i think she assumed he was more sympathetic and human than he actually was and he slowly dropped his mask the situation with sejanus was the last straw,2023-11-25
agree i loved it as well i would have loved a bit more of blyth as snow,2023-11-20
just wanted to say i do the exact same thing when it comes to trailers i even get to the movie theaters late just to avoid previews and films have been so much more enjoyable even the bad ones,2024-01-15
"she figured he killed sejanus 

she also realized he was going to leave her without saying anything 

so if he killed his best friend and is willing to drop her easily how can she trust him",2023-11-17
"my interpretation

 obviously a theme hit at the end that people are in a “hunger game” every day could  eachother at any time

 i think as you said she was scared of him she suspects he killed his best friend and then he slips up that he killed someone else he hasn’t told her about if he kills all these people so easily why wouldn’t he  me

 she’s already feeling unsure but the scene in the cabin again my interpretation she feels directly threatened he finds the guns that link him to the murders and they both ponder out loud that it’s the only evidence which leaves lucy as the only loose end he asks if she would ever expose him and i believe she reads it as “because if you would then i’ll  you” she assures him she wouldn’t but makes the mental decision to leave grabs a knife to defend her self and makes up the story about going to look for food 

 my interpretation is you see snow consider killing her and going back to the capital because well he’s a psycho but he internally decides against it because he likes lucy and he thinks she likes him and shakes his head to go fishing 

 once he realises she has left he gets offendedfrustrated because he feels as if she’s betrayed him i think it leaves it open to the viewer whether he is right or not she could have just been using him the whole time and there’s subtle hints throughout kiss hesitation she alludes to missing her ex he asks her if her affection is “real” he then decides to definitely  her and return to power and wealth because love isn’t real ya da ya da ya da

 he obviously fails because she’s more capable than he gave her credit for i think he lies to his boss that he got bit by a snake and passed out as opposed to trying to escape que end of movie",2023-11-17
"they 100 explained it in the movie earlier in a short line about trust

she was clear that trust was the most important factor for her in life  when snow said he killed 3 people and hesitated she knew immediately he lied and she couldnt trust him he knew too it was over after that one way or another finding the gun was just the option that presented itself or maybe she even know it was there and she pushed him to find it as a way to escape",2023-11-18
"it was a tragedy she ran because of him turning in his best friend but she doesnt understand just how bad the situation was with the friends actions continuously putting him and others in danger and why it was basically necessary to ensure they both could survive  

he sacrifices almost everything so he can run off with her she bails out of fear he would turn on her eventually and it hardens him as he is left wondering if she ever loved him",2023-11-19
yes that whole scene  the forrest scene literally makes zero sense my wife and i can’t make it out,2023-11-17
i think the writing in this seriesthe books is incredibly nuanced for the yadystopia genre and that’s why it can actually make people consider real moral questions of war and peace,2023-11-18
i did think about israelpalestine in one of the early lines from viola davis something about children dying her character said was like exactly the same thing i’ve heard these past weeks,2023-11-25
i was the only person in my theater who laughed when flickerman called the coughing girl tuberculosis on legs,2023-11-17
i would definitely recommend doing audiobooks and just working the men when you can because theres some really good voice actors out there and they really make reading a lot more accessible if you have a busy or schedule cuz not all of us can just sit down and like look at a book all day,2023-11-19
i don’t read as much as i should but the book is an extremely fast and easy read,2024-01-10
snow always lands on top,2023-11-17
also thought it felt very adult  not quite like joker but a similar vein,2023-11-19
for your last point i think snow convinces lysistrata by telling her that jessup was a lost cause so thats why she agreed to send the water,2023-11-20
rabies is fatal if you don’t get vaccinated in a couple of weeks after being bitten he already was symptomatic so behind any help even painkillers soon it also causes horrific pain before torturous death it was a mercy to him to die fast,2023-12-20
after thoroughly thinking about this movie i think i agree with every one of your points i think lucy definitely crafted an act as soon as snow explained how it would help her in the games she took that and ran with it she is a performer after all,2023-11-25
"i feel like studios especially this age of streaming should focus less on two part movies but give us one part that kind of does the job thats really good and then have more that you can get on the dvd release of the movie or on a streaming release of the movie so that they can come back and kind of fill in the details they missed but while still giving us a concise wrap up of the story

because i would  for a star wars episode 9 that was more expanded out than what we got same as with this movie",2023-11-19
there’s no good place to split it if they did it right after lucy grey’s win the second movie would’ve never have been made i bet you i demand a 5 hour director’s cut,2023-11-17
"the director is the same as the director for catching fire and mockingjay and he said doing press for this movie that he considers splitting mockingjay up was a mistake

kind of ironic though because i feel like someone probably floated that idea for this movie and it was immediately dismissed since mockingjay alongside harry potter was one of the big examples of a finale hurting itself by doing that also assuming the studio didnt think this series still held enough power to have two successful box office outings or to commit to a second movie before seeing how the first one did 

that said yeah this should have been split up or mini seriesd

edit didnt mean to imply harry potter finales were bad i guess i mean people were getting really tired of the 2 part finale trend that hp kind of started and the general idea was that it was a trend rooted in greed companies who knew their cash cow was almost at an end and wanted one more year of box office or viewership from it harry potter 7 came out in the early 2010s breaking bad split its final season into two in 2013 and mockingjay was 2015 by then it felt derivative and unnecessary for mockingjay",2023-11-17
yes francis lawrence directed every hunger games movie but the first one and said that there was so much backlash to splitting mockingjay into two parts that he made a concerted effort not to do it with ballad,2023-11-17
i dont think splitting it into two is the right choice the first movie would make snow look like way too much of a hero which would leave the audience after the second movie wondering why they decided to butcher his character or whatever a miniseries probably would have been good though,2023-11-17
"this is the first thing i said walking out “i don’t normally like it when a they make a 2part movie but i really wish this one had been 2 parts”

i wanted more fleshing out of the tributes from each district and their mentors give me more of a human touch with each of them instead of them all turning into the “bad guy’ once the games started 

and i wanted to see a better transition of the distrust between coriolanus and lucy gray i felt that switch happened so fast also give me more time between them finding each other again walk me through the torment coriolanus experienced of being sent to district 12 being torn apart from his family searching for her not knowing if she was still alive instead they show her almost the very next scene 

this movie could have benefitted greatly from being a 2parter allinall i still enjoyed it and will recommend i just wanted more",2023-11-17
"i really feel like this movie should have been a two partner ending with the tenth hunger games and the second one being about the the aftermath 

that said people would have accused them of killing the book",2023-11-17
it really shoulda just been a miniseries,2023-11-17
i honestly would have been fine with this movie being 3 hours or 3 hours and 30 minutes i’ve seen the irishman killers of the flower moon and zack snyder’s justice league lol 3 hours is nothing to me at this point,2023-11-18
"theres no good end point for this sadly 

it wouldve made a killer season of television because then we wouldve got more character development within the capitol as well and at the very least have gotten more than a couple mentions for who some of the other tributes were there were plenty of impact moments that couldve been used to punctuate episodes too but alas they did the best with what they could without completely chopping up entire subplots in the novel",2023-12-09
it’s really goos,2023-11-19
"remember when shes singing that song near the end about lucy gray and snow asks if she is alive or dead or whatever   lucy gray says its a mystery like me 

  
and dean highbottom talks about how the uncertainty is the kind of thing that could drive a person mad

  
i think these are factors as to why snow becomes the person that he does  there is always the possibility that she is out there somewhere and she could bring him down and ruin everything with what she knows",2023-11-17
lacy gray is the same name as a ralph waldo emerson story where a girl disappears,2023-11-17
i really liked the film didnt make it clear whether she was alive or dead therefore the paranoid person like snow will forever wonder how she is and live trapped for the rest of his life with the anxiety of what will happen if she returns and tell everyone what he had done,2023-11-18
do you know why she fled from snow in the cabin  that whole scene literally made zero sense,2023-11-17
i don’t know much about rachel zegler’s resume but her acting style screams broadway to me,2023-11-17
"lucy gray isnt supposed to be from district 12 though its implied that shes just a traveler with the rest of the covey who knows where shes from

also even if her performance was a little more hammy i think thats the point you dont know if youre supposed to trust her values and shes a lot more of a showgirlsinger katniss is a subtle scared girl who doesnt want to be a hero or a symbol at all their performances arent really comparable at all to me because theyre meant to have different takeaways

this feels like a purposeful takedown on rachel zegler and i thought she was quite compelling",2023-11-18
nobody in 12 has an appalachian accent in the original trilogy though  in fact none of the districts demonstrate a distinctive accent and in a way it makes sense in tbosas the capitol accent is general american with hints of midatlantic by the time we meet katniss that accent has been broadcast into the districts for over 60 years leading to the homogenisation of regional accents as the districts start to sound like the capitol new trends arise in capitol speech similar to the emergence of received pronunciation as a courteducated accent in england in the 18th19th centuries until we end up with the midatlantic affectation sported by effie,2023-11-18
she’s the only reason i won’t be rewatching this movie it was painful sitting through a lot of her scenes everyone else did a fantastic job i wish they could go back and recast the songbird but obviously we can’t do that now jennifer lawrence truly did something special with katniss and i’m realizing now that i took that for granted i might go back and watch those original movies also my opinions of zegler’s acting have nothing to do with the million controversies surrounding her that i’m just learning about i could care less lol she just seems like a poor actress and it was giving “kerry washington mouth acting”,2023-11-19
well jennifer lawrence is actually from kentucky whereas zegler is a new yorker,2023-11-18
she sounded like the mom from young sheldon,2023-11-17
it was horrible bad,2023-12-25
sorry to break it to you but the snake was not an accident she was kind of angry,2023-11-24
i didnt think the ending was rushed  i thought the beginning was rushed,2023-11-18
i think it depends on the people who read the book,2023-11-17
best movie in the franchise but you stopped watching them after catching fire,2023-11-17
mockingjay part 2 is decent tbh part 1 is a literal filler in an anime manga,2023-11-17
this was a good movie but catching fire is still easily the best of the 5 best book too just an amazing setting with real world building and character development suspense and an awesome plot twist at the end,2023-11-18
my heart was pounding during the actual games i felt like i was in middle school again,2023-11-17
i loved it the melancholy feeling of knowing this was snows fall was perfect,2023-11-20
totes,2023-11-17
i definitely agree with you but i do think the hunger games movies are really good outside of this but this is definitely the best one like the production the the way it tugs are nostalgia it just does such a really good job and knocks it out of the park like the only big flies are maybe the the weirdness of the part 3 but thats more attributed to the story in the source materials and the actual movie itself so im not putting the movie to blame on that,2023-11-19
"yah i give this a slight edge over the original films cause i really liked rachel zeglerwhy do online people hate her no idea and well every other actor in this whereas in the originals i kinda disliked hysterical mode jennifer lawrence peeta actor and stiff liam hemsworth but thats just me

this one does seem to drag a little in the third act but the first 23rds are fantastic and gripping",2023-11-29

technically katniss’ grandmother is in it the young girl maud ivory from the covey,2023-11-18
i don’t think it’s that weird of a theory,2023-11-18
you sound like a bad friend for judging based on a legitimate question i’m sure a lot of viewers wondered the same thing when lucy made a reference to katniss,2023-11-19
im pretty sure it was peter dinklages character who said that the not knowing about lucy will become what drives him mad and its so true with death theres finality hes left with his mind wandering where is she now is she safe does she have a husband kids is she still singing was she shot dead i think and it could just be me but its as though lucy is the only semblance of humanity he has left especially as he will eventually become president so in a way the unknown of her will forever haunt him thats something he doesnt have control over,2023-11-19
i’m scrolling thru these comments two weeks later and also shocked she’s playing a mad scientist obsessed w fashion and snakes ffs incredible,2023-12-02
definitely the best of the series,2023-11-24

1 the hunger games

2 catching fire

3 ballad of songbirds and snakes

4 mockingjay part 1

5 mockingjay part 2",2023-11-20
seriously it was way too much and too over the top goofy,2023-11-26
"yeah act 3 felt like it should have been a second movie
instead we got a really long movie that felt squished at the end

i guess part of the problem is act12 weve already seen in the first two hunger games movies",2023-11-17
anything interesting they cut from the book,2023-11-17
i agree that a mini series would have been perfect 57 hours,2023-11-19
and she didn’t use his nickname,2023-11-19
she sounds like annie doing the texas accent in that one episode of community honestly it was very distracting,2023-12-23
i think he hated katniss too but in a different way it was his pent up rage towards lucy that flowed out as hatred towards katniss because katniss was remarkably similar in personality to lucy she obviously reminded him of her and used katniss participation in the games as a way to channel revenge towards lucy for betraying him,2023-11-20
"i really enjoyed reading your take on the central romance as portrayed in the movie and i think this is a good summary of the main themes and the opposing forces at work within the romance im pleased that you were able to get this much from just the movie version im assuming you havent read the book it shows that the film told its story successfully

x200b

close friend

slight quibble here sejanus was not really snows friend never mind a close one perhaps the movie didnt make that clear enough but i suppose he was from lucy grays and other peoples pov",2023-12-16
where would you rank it  third best hg movie for me,2023-11-20
"the descent happened too fast i thought when he told his sister he liked how it made him feel to  that tribute up until that point he is cold but not some cold blooded killer as the audience it’s easy to understand why he makes the choices he does til that point even killing the tribute was understandable if you believed he loved lucy but saying what he said after was a big turn and could’ve revealed some of his inner thoughts he was having since it’s not a book we don’t hear those thoughts so in a way i guess maybe that wasn’t too fast either

also even when he’s making suggestions on how to bring more views to the hunger games he seems very cold

when you realize lucy is the only thingperson at that point snow probably saw her more as a thing that can stop him from having full freedom from his crimes i thought it made sense he’d go a little made lucy was  always a rebel and never showed anywhere close to snows calculated cold side so when she was the one to bring up the elephant in the room i found it believable snow was gonna do something ",2023-12-03
"100 agree about the tone of the reaping ceremony it seemed too playful and high school musical the stakes of the games were completely absent and it stayed like that all movie snow and sejanus  seemed to care more about the morality of the games than any of the tributes

back to lucy even in the zoo cage she was still smiling and treating everything lightly i understand she was performing but there was no nuance in the characters emotion not even a quick flicker of fear or dread it was hard to connect with her to the point where i didnt care if she lived or died

her singing voice is beautiful though",2023-12-23
lucy singing that much took the fun out of everything for me and the way she acted in the movie was horrible i agree,2023-12-13
"the lack  internal monologues hurt the movie

not that i’d want a voiceover but there are inherent difficulties adapting books to movies",2023-11-18
" the fact that she was able to win the hunger games despite never once picking up a weapon

only because shes got a mentor on the outside cheating his  off to make sure she survives its not exactly portrayed as a matter of skill on her part",2023-11-18
" the fact that she was able to win the hunger games despite never once picking up a weapon

so shes not really a combatant and survives because her mentor is cheating on her behalf the hunger games are not some merit contest",2023-11-18
agreed zero clarity on snow’s motivations his descent into madness is extremely rapid and unexplained couldn’t stand rachel ziegler’s acting i had to hold back laughter in scenes that were supposed to be serious the script was so  cringe to me i like tom blyth as an actor and he obviously had to work with what he was given but  all of the other capitol kids were awful actors i know they were going for balance with seasoned actors but even their performances didn’t do it for me viola davis was way too goofy and idk why jason’s lines were so cringe to me it felt like they wanted him to be like cesar so bad but it wasn’t doing it for me it felt like a marvel movie,2023-11-18
he reminded me of stan from the music video when he got his haircut i couldnt take him seriously after that lol,2023-11-27
agreed her with no weapon and going after her other district 12 guy made her annoyingly unbelievably good peeta decided to train without katniss there were moments of real tension there katniss had to  someone it felt real this felt like the girl could do no wrong and yet nothing bad every happened to her nothing so gross,2023-12-19

agreed i seriously feel like i saw a different movie when i’m reading through everyone’s reactions there’s quite literally 0 character depth across the board i felt nothing for anyone i did like tom as an actor but his path into evilness was so incredibly rapid and unclear it was odd felt nothing for lucy and i know i can fully attribute that to rachel ,2023-11-17

"i’m curious did you read the books i’m not shading but trying to read your comment with the correct lens 

because i find it so interesting how you described snow as sociopathic during the movie specifically after he said the “powerful” thing to tigris i thought to myself how they were depicting snow as very sociopathic instead of what i thought of him as which is narcissistic and the two aren’t mutually exclusive but his internal monologue in the books really shows how his motivation for all his decisions is incredibly narcissistic and by removing that monologue in the film he seems devoid of emotion and thus sociopathic",2023-11-17
the book delves into the future of the games a bit more  mostly with snow  both with the betting and gifts but also snow noticing that people in the districts didnt even pay attention to it or even have a way to watch so the manditory watching and the prizes for the district that wins along with the victory tours are added for the 11th games that mags wins she does the first ever victors tour,2023-11-18
he lies constantly throughout the entire movie and always picks the terrible thing to do and justifies as having no choice,2023-11-20

opposite here overacted great voice tho,2023-11-19
"it was explored snows dad is the one who came up with the idea thats who was behind the first hunger games the doctor and the professor were both people also who responsible for creating it the doctor mad scientist lady she was the one whos been the game maker for the last 10 years the professor was the one who came up with the idea but never wanted his idea to come into fruition because it was just a joke

and what it took was kind of obvious so you got to see like the devastation they went through people were literally eating other people to survive during this war it was horrific loved ones were dying left and right when youre in that kind of position as a group of people you have a lot of hatred towards the other side of that battle and you become blind to like certain things so asking for 24 kids every single year honestly didnt seem that bad in that moment but after 10 years it started to die down people were disinterested the games are on the verge of dying out because people just were like this is kind of messed up to a point

but then this happens and the story happens and thats what reawakened this kind of love for it and they they buy humanizing these people it also dehumanize them because now theyre just spectacles theyre just like people on a movie screen theyre not actual people by celebritising these people they send to the hunger games thats basically dehumanizing them even though theyre acknowledging how human they actually are

originally they were all just throwing that arena we saw in an empty room coliseum style and they duked it out but then this happens and the arena is blown up and destroyed and it adds this new kind of interest to people rather than people just being thrown in arena and dying it adds this element of like story to it or people are hunting other people down and all that very similar to how moves and tvs are today for us were basically watching fake hunger games in a lot of tv shows out there

at the end of the day it all still is kind of  and illogical but this is the universe of a story thats a battery out for children theres not much logic to be had there

i thought the only realistic way this would actually happen with the actual humanity sees things morally when it comes to women and children in times of war would be if the kids had to volunteer to be in it and by volunteering you would basically become ultra rich and have food and youre starving before and then it kind of turns it around to where theyre not there because they have to be theyre there because they want a shot to not be in the life theyre living now like thats the only way you could justify an actual hunger games being realistic and thats not the case here its more of a punishment but its all meant to fit that original premise so theres no honestly any kind of way we would all understand on how you get to that point",2023-11-19
that part was what saved the movie for me the first parts was kinda boring and annoying but the acting from the male actor and the story progression in part 3 saved it,2023-11-28
nah i’m with ya this was such a miss,2023-12-25
"completely agree this movie was corny af felt very disney from lucy grays cringe worthy introduction and theatrical acting to viola davis cartoonish villain to the terrible pacing storyline…
the movie was somehow rushed and yet so long and boring at the same time

yeplol,2023-11-21
yes she obviously got some er work done though added some whiskers,2023-11-24
paranoia longterm trust issues growing fractures and misunderstandings in his relationship with lucy gray his perception that lucy gray had betrayed him at the end the pain of that loss and decision to harden his heart against love and that sort of vulnerability the absence of tigris positive influence while in district 12 an increasingly desperate family situation and increasing desperation a slippery  of killings that revealed to him what he was capable of and what he could get away with increasing cynicism following experiences in the arena and district 12 that revealed the chaos and aggression lying beneath the surface of humanity and above all dr gauls ultimately successful conversion of him to her hobbesian philosophy snow decided to commit to doing whatever it took to remain the victor in the arena of life,2023-12-01
he was bad the entire time he always did whatever benefited himself,2023-12-01
oh was that the third  he was talking about i thought it was the kid in the arena then the two people he shot,2023-12-20
i thought rachel was fine it was the writing that made it seem so over the top her character is not a realistic person which often happens with poor writing shes just one of those perfect charismatic characters her acting was fine,2023-12-03
true,2023-11-20
also i dont get how the katniss actually refers to the real katniss i thought he was worried about her after the fact when she gained attention not becuase of her name,2023-12-19
"mockingjay part 1 was definitely worse than this movie arguably mockingjay part 2 as well

i also don’t agree that the characters weren’t likable snow was actually a pretty conflicting character for me which made him interesting i understood what snows motivations were majority of times",2023-12-03
"i think that was the only scene i actively disliked it was way too over the top and unrealistic they could’ve left it at her putting the snake in that girls dress which was still a bit ridiculous given the weight of the scene just being picked for the hunger games plus why would any of the guards let her sing lol it’s like a military draft they ain’t got time for that

it was an otherwise fantastic movie though i felt the first singing scene should’ve come elsewhere though",2023-12-03
"this book was longer than the original trilogy the ballad osas was almost 600 pages long whereas the original trilogy had books that were 400 pages at most so this movie had a lot to cover francis lawrence said he regretted making mockingjay into a two parter and wanted to avoid doing it this time around

though i will say that this was one of the most faithful book to screen adaptations ive ever seen a few parts were missing though like sejanuss mother having a bigger role the capitol black market and the funeral for the dead mentors some parts did feel less nuanced as most of the book was coriolanuss internal monologue however i really did enjoy this movie and i think they did a wonderful job at what they were given it basically reignited my love for the franchise",2023-11-18

" the vial originally contained “morphling” a strong painkiller the hunger games version of morphine 

 the dean highbottom regularly took morphling to cope with the emotional pain the games caused him he was guilty over his role in the games’ creation and also didn’t enjoy watching kids die

thank  someone said it i’m losing my mind reading these comments did we all watch the same movie it was trashhhhh,2023-12-09
"i really wanted to walk out on the horrible dialogue very early like when the flag got ripped down and flickerman said the flag got ripped down i mean the exposition was horrible the only semiinteresting part was part 3 but overall still a big blegh from me

the real hunger games was us the viewers watching a multi million dollar movie where rich actors portray poverty and loss in such a morally bankrupt and pathetic way",2023-11-28
genuinely shocked about the comments on this thought it was the worst movie i’ve seen in a while death of cinema and all of that,2023-11-27
literally a giant boring slog with constant immersion breaking dialogue and nonsensical pacing and character decisions,2023-11-19
yeah genuinely felt the same i would have walked out,2023-12-28
i wanted to walk out very badly,2023-12-19

"snow spelled it out in the film sejanus was making him an accomplice in his treason by confiding the plot to him snow stated in the movie that he thought sejanus would get out of it  that his father would buy his way out as he always had in the past  but that snow would hang for it he didnt know what would happen to sejanus

also sejanus wasnt really snows true friend snows true loyalty is to himself first and the capitol second though lucy gray gets in the way somewhat snow had a lot of resentment towards sejanus even before he kept putting snows life and honour in danger and they made that clear in one of the first scenes of the movie when all the mentors were talking about sejanus behind his back",2023-11-18
they hang people for not just being involved in something but knowing someone who did something,2023-11-18
honestly snow’s motivations for anything are extremely unclear in the film i left the theatre feeling very unsatisfied and had a lot of questions,2023-11-18
i personally thought if it were three hours that third act couldve had more development and it wouldve helped with the pacing i know make it longer doesnt sound like it would make it less boring but if you truly fleshed out snows turn to evil it wouldnt have felt quite as outofnowhere which rendered everything kinda boring because it wasnt quite easy to follow if you hadnt read the book,2023-11-20
"i feel this lol this movie was so goofy and unserious imo i’m a huge fan so i was pretty disappointed i saw it with 12 friends who are also huge fans and we all left the theatre like 

i had to stop myself from laughing during serious scenes with rachel in them i walked in assuming we’d all clap and cheer at the end but the full theatre was dead silent the vibe was very much like “was that it”",2023-11-18
so overly expository just like every hollywood film the first film felt raw this one had flickerman state he pulled down the flag after we literally saw him pull down the flag ,2023-12-19
i mean the movie is literally called the ballad of songbirds and snakes lol i thought she was incredible,2023-11-29
"seriously hate to say this bc i thought the snow white backlash was insane but i did not like her at all in this she feels like a broadway actress shes talented but i cant buy for one second that shed be in that world perfect white teeth perfectly made up face really nice hair always so smiley immediately rebelled when she got called

jennifer lawrence made it feel raw she was shaking when she got reaped i believed her her hair was in a braid it all fit much better",2023-12-19
yeah she  the singing made no sense,2023-12-02
rachel was fine it was the writing rachel’s character was basically a insanely charismatic character who was still morally golden which is very hard to find in real life it seems almost like a fantasy to find a person like that especially given all the hardship she faced as a child her acting wasn’t the issue,2023-12-03
ok give some examples,2023-11-20
snow killed him he didn’t think anything of it because he thought it was sejanus’s morphling her  also he probably didn’t think snow had the guts to do him right then and there,2023-11-28
"completely agree i just left a review that said something similar actually it felt like a corny disney movie
and lucy did seem so out of pocket like an alien in this film idk if the actress was just overacting every single expression like she was acting on broadway but it did not translate well on film 
and the writing was  she did not seem to give af about the games at all zero emotion about being in the games and the added injustice of them purposely choosing her to  her over and zero ptsd and emotion when the games were over just la di da singing by the lake at summer camp very weird character and corny acting ",2024-03-27
totally agree and i wish they had spent more time adapting the source material maybe expanding it a bit i didnt really buy snows transformation in the book either but it was even less convincing in the film,2023-11-25
"how many snakes scenes there are

there are two big scary snake scenes featuring a lot of cgi snakes and also three brief scenes with a single snake in them",2023-11-25
"all the snakes are cgi and they appear only in few scenes but they are a very very important part of those scenes exclusively as a danger and threat take from that what you will  but i would say it will more than likely be a challenge for you even if your phobia is quite minor

under the spoiler ive outlined the scenes where snakes are visible that i can remember with an indication of when they occur light on details with as few spoilers as i can manage with brief idea of how bad each scene is

1 15 minutes in a snake is thrown at another character and we see it slither away relatively light on dangerthreat

2in the middle of the first part of the film there is a scene with an enormous number of snakes in a giant tank a character is forced into a dangerous situation and is attacked dangerthreat mostly through tension

3 the same tank is seen again in a later scene but not as closeup a character stands very close to it and touches it no threat

4 hundreds of thousands of snakes are shown in an extended intensely violent scene several closeup shots of attacks and deaths this is absolutely the worst scene but you will see it coming before it happens

5 a snake emerges by surprise in a forest and a character is bitten",2023-11-25
"lucy is the moral pillar throughout the movie she was never going to do anything that bad to anyone including him 

i thought snow was clearly power hungry from the start of the movie and it wasn’t necessary for lucy to push him over the top it was his whole life upbringing that led him down the path he went i thought the movie did a good job of showing that he’s very calculated the whole movie which included decisions to  and i understood why he chose  in all the scenes he did but it’s still at the end of the day a  also the scene when he said he liked how it made him feel when he killed the tribute was another clear sign snow was off regardless of what lucy’s rejection was gonna be",2023-12-03
iirc it was morphine or something similar he used it to numb himself as he couldnt cope with the horrors his own idea the hunger games created,2023-12-13
it was morphine but snow poisoned it at the end i think,2023-12-20
sponsors were part of snows pitch to improve the games viewership im fairly certain that before the events depicted in this movie the games were just as you describe which is why people stopped watching,2023-12-19
i think bc he only left bc he didn’t know where the gun was and so he couldn’t destroy the evidence so he left with lucy but then when he found the gun he realized he could destroy the evidence then and lucy was the only lose end as she told him  but then i think her leaving him after ‘all i did for you’ he quickly turned into a nice guy and figured if he can’t have her no one can well that’s at least what i think but hopefully someone who knows more will chime in,2023-12-20
" what i wonder is did lucy ever love him

thats a good question and i wonder too i think between them snow cared more for lucy than her for him i think lucy kind of had feelings for him because he was the only guy for her in the capitol and she needed him for her survival although since both are attractive and snow is kind to her she does fall for him however once the games are over i think lucy moves on her life back in d12 matters more to her whereas snow even after the games is concerned about lucy

so i think lucys feelings for him were fleeting and that is why she easily abandoned him she had a change of heart within a few minutes or hours even sure what she learned and guessed about snow was very serious stuff but the fact that it ended so abruplty for her without any communication proves my point

snow was more into lucy than she was into him but in the end after lucys escape even snow turns paranoid and starts hating her",2023-12-24
trust issues the 3rd  was sejanus— one of the few people who was close to him and if snow has capacity to do that to his best friend then what stops him from doing that to lucy she knew that so she ran,2024-01-16
100 watch them both of those movies are probably my favourite in the franchise it also helps to understand parallels between the new movie,2024-03-15
howw is this even remotely close to worst what movies have you seen,2023-11-30
full theatre for me too it got some chuckles but something about his lines were just not hitting love jason but the script overall was super cringe imo,2023-11-18
"i thought that was the point of the character that he had all these charming cute lines but that the delivery wasn’t there and that he wasn’t as debonaire and witty as he thought he was

he was one of the best parts of the movie,2023-11-18
she wasnt from district 12 the covey were nomads that got trapped there during the war theyre implied to be much more southern,2023-12-04
the book kinda spits all those game changes to you at the end with an essay to dr gaul along with the highbottom reveal i think the movie just needed to end by that point and didnt really have time for another exposition dump unfortunately,2023-12-04
lol coriolanus and tigris were cousins and lucy gray was 16,2023-11-20
"coriander

lol",2023-11-20
agreed on lucy gray i couldnt take her accentway of speaking felt so forced also that amount of makeup on day 3 of the hunger games nah,2023-12-19
ehh the editing was so bad there were multiple cuts i noticed where the actors expressions didnt match up and that bizarre shot of snow and zegler when she was behind bars and he wiped her face hunger games excelled and felt real bc i had a shakiness and almost doc like style this just felt poorly edited,2023-12-19
the cinematography was not good not sure why they chose to go with that low angle shot for half the movie,2023-12-28

tbh sejanus was a real albatross snow would have been better off never knowing him he was indirectly responsible for all three of the kills that set snow on his inexorable slippery  to villainy

i also felt bad for snow through much of the story of tbosas he is not excused from his ultimate decision to commit to becoming a ruthless dictator  however i feel i understand him to some extent the world was cruel to him other doors he might have gone through were closed in his face by the likes of dean highbottom having experienced the hobbesian state of nature at first hand during the war  the horror of witnessing humans scavenging human corpses in the streets like literal animals   he was already ripe for dr gauls ideological grooming his later experiences of conflict in the arena and in district 12  how scarcely controlled chaos is how close to the surface the killer in man  only reinforced those beliefs what he perceived as lucy grays betrayal only solidified his cynicism about humanity

snow never really left bomb time during his youth  that state of powerlessness of not knowing whether he would live or die its not surprising that he would prioritise security control and comfort in adulthood  even at the highest cost and gaul and snow were not entirely wrong to believe that the only choice in an endless war between the districts and the capitol was between being the victor and the defeated a peace treaty never seemed an option indeed if it werent for katniss impulsive decision to assassinate coin snows capitol would have become the defeated  subject to a similar brutal and punitive regime to the one they had employed against their enemies its interesting to consider what one would do to ensure they remained the victor

the war may not have been endless after all but it lasted snows entire lifetime and was the primary form that war took for 74 years  a controlled pseudowar with a set number of casualties staged within an arena ie the hunger games  not preferable to the state of real war that snow warned katniss about the sort that involves wholesale indiscriminate slaughter and collateral deaths such as those of snows mother and prim 

interesting questions to ponder",2023-11-28
are you a hunger games fan,2023-11-20
"she figured out he killed his best friend and was worried he would  her the conversation where she’s the last “loose end” to the murders

snow considers killing her but decides against it once he realises she has abandoned him i think he perceives this as she never loved him and it was all an act  then he decides to find and  her

by this time she’s already escaped",2023-11-17
she “knew” he was lying and she was the last loose end,2023-11-17
are you a fan of the series,2023-12-13
haha true dough,2023-12-20
" 1 we have no idea how hunger games even begun

we do though they explained it in this movie

 3 whats the origin and youth story of casca highbottom

what suggests there is a story there we got an explanation for why he was so bitter here

 4 why are people even accepting of children killing children what caused this devious notion to become ok with people

we also know that

 6 whats the origin and youth story of dr gaul

 7 whats the origin and story of founder heavensbee

 8 and plutarch heavensbee

 9 whats the origin story of younger alma coin

i dont really see any of those as needing further explanation

 10 how is katniss related to lucy gray

if shes a relation of one of the covey that would explain it but that doesnt seem like a needtoknow story either",2023-11-18
man not everything needs a spinoff,2023-11-19
i honestly want more details about the war causes and what make it so brutal and bitter that something like the hunger games was acceptable,2023-11-18
theres a fan theory that maude ivory lucy grays cousin is actually katnisss paternal grandmother as only the covey knew about the lake and the hanging tree song,2023-11-18
yes i feel like the whole point of a prequel is to give nods to the peoplestories we’ve already seen in the later movies i was so disappointed we didn’t get a tigris backstory her short presence and one line in mockingjay pt 2 is so powerful so i really thought we would be exploring her more,2023-11-18
"i hate two part movies but as everyone has already commented this movies pacing was  up  really feels like this script was rushed and did not undergo several draftsrewrites despite following source material

still to your point i preferred it as one movie  i absolutely hate two or even three part movies that you have to wait a year in between for  

looking at you mission impossible dune and others",2023-11-18
no she wasnt thats just a fan rumourtheory,2023-11-26
"thinking about this more i should have known this movie would be mediocre just on lucy grays intro alone it was goofy 
practically waltzing up to the stage without a care in the world you just got picked for the hunger games the snake was silly as if that’s her first thought to do  and then she gets up on stage ‘give me a minute boooooys’ and starts honkeytonk singing dear lord some highschool musical tv movie level acting and filmmaking 


the og movies and actors did such a good job of conveying the absolute fear desperation and disparity with the games jennifer lawrence’s character was out of her mind with shock her fear was palpable then that fear turned to anger great acting 
lucy gray was like an alien the whole movie just smiling in full dissociation in the whole time it was bizarre couldn’t relate to the character at all which is really not a good sign



after the games the ogs had so much ptsd to deal with and yet here comes lucy gray as if nothing happened back into honkeytonky mode  



just felt so childish ugh there was so much potential with this movie i’m so frustrated ",2024-03-27
his friend who got hanged he provided the recording,2023-11-21
yes its a prologue,2023-12-01
its the one that a person would actually say,2023-11-18
he says teeth i watched it with subs,2023-11-18
its teeth but perhaps it was said with that infliction on purpose by schwartzman as tongue in cheek,2023-11-20
"its not about the group knowing her position she wanted to  them using that water if she screamed out theres poison in it the group would have never  that water

she was banking on the fact that the group would drink the water before the sick girl did",2023-12-01
an actual good joke,2023-11-17
i thought it was pretty clearly implied lucy didn’t love snow because snow lied to her about killing 3 ppl and was acting sketchy when lucy brought up she’s the last loose end,2023-12-05
a little devil’s advocate for your devil’s advocate i have think of snow’s conversation with tigris about “remembering the tributes are human” he didn’t intend to fall for lucy in the first place he planned to manipulate her and the rest of the capitol into surviving for his own means the plinth prize lucy gray is smart she knows their connection is transactional snow has convinced himself he cares for her but his true nature is selfish ie phrases like “i did everything for you” are emotionally abusive so as an abuser archetype he believed his actions were valid and she saw through his bs,2023-12-08
he never yelled that in the books and he never kicked billy taupes  on the stage like in the movie i recommend to read the book as this movie is simply confusing,2023-12-09
"where she was yelling at him to tell her whos the 3rd person and in the cabin

she didnt yell once she said firmly dont lie to me

lucy gray doesnt come across as remotely hysterical in any of the final scenes she comes across as astute and fairly calm

x200b

dr gaul portrayed as a psycho

she is a psycho she tortures things for fun and plays russian roulette with her students lives in the book she speaks in riddles and rhymes a lot more than in the movie which definitely gives a craycray impression",2023-12-09
she doesn‘t die in the books shes with the other mentors later but had some kind of personality shift and turned partly to a snake has some scales etc otherwise to introduce the snakes and how they work without that scene snow wouldnt know to put the hankerchief in the coffin,2023-12-13
the hunger game itself was no flaccid i was actually really glad that it had plenty more story to tell i checked the time and was intrigued as to where else it had to go can’t imagine the people wishing it was a two parter tho lol,2023-11-24
the game maker isnt the president  we just never see him if i remember,2023-11-20
"the critics felt the movie was unnecessary and had bad pacing  some critiqued actors acting too  basically saying the movie is a cash grab and lacks any reason for existing which is   because its based on a book  it has a reason for existing because it shows snows motivation and recontextualizes a lot

audiences like it because it shows what happened to snow and why he hates katniss so much  its pretty faithful to the book and its not a cash grab because its based on a popular book that a lot liked and some loved  the reason critics have a problem with the pacing is because its like the book and its a snow movie  its called hunger games yes but literally the main character is snow like did they expect the entire movie to just be the hunger games

anyways they are wrong  but for what it is worth it did go up  64 percent fresh now and 91 user score  72 imdb on par with the hunger games  critics just dont like giving a better review for an old series that they didnt know the movie was based on a book",2023-11-22
it’s not a good movie there is fan service in it and it bashes you over the head with obvious analogies to real life issues,2023-11-25
it’s violent but not gory if you were fine with the first movie you should be fine with this one,2023-11-29
"im copying my comment from other post  
so in the books just like in the movie he brings the box with sejanus belongings to dean highbottom theres sejanus academy diploma some photos and morphilin for sejanus anxiety snow tells highbottom that he should take away the diploma so noone would think that rebel who was executed finished capitols academy coryo takes away the photos to give to sejanus parents and throws away morphilin to trash bin next to deans desk saying its no longer needed he knew dean highbottom will take it out of the trash so he poisoned it before in the epilogue of the book snow already has sores in his mouth because of the poison  
in the books lucy never said directly that dean warned her about coryo it was added in the movie  
i recommend the book every motive is explained way better",2023-12-09
he replaced the morphling with poison because he knew dean highbottom had a problem,2023-12-04
so in the books just like in the movie he brings the box with sejanus belongings to dean highbottom theres sejanus academy diploma some photos and morphilin for sejanus anxiety snow tells highbottom that he should take away the diploma so noone would think that rebel who was executed finished capitols academy coryo takes away the photos to give to sejanus parents and throws away morphilin to trash bin next to deans desk saying its no longer needed he knew dean highbottom will take it out of the trash so he poisoned it before in the epilogue of the book snow already has sores in his mouth because of the poison,2023-12-09
"yeah in the movie theres no explanation to anything and it  me off so bad i saw it last night with my husband after i finished reading the book he was super confused and when we were coming back from the cinema i had to tell him the whole story

spoiler in the books sejanus knew very well that he gives rebels the money for the guns as he was planning to run away with them to the north where there were rumors about people living outside of districts free of capitol snow was wary of sejanus as he was considered his closest friend even though coryo despised him for being from the district 2 it could give coryo hard time if sejanus was caught so when he noticed he was sneaking out of the concert he followed him he walked into the scene like in the movies but mayfield was not there yet guy with the gun was a brother of the girl who was imprisoned during the execution of arlo her lover when he saw coryo he was nervous so sejanus told him coryo is with him and he wont tell a soul lucy gray walked in and billy taupe said she is his girlfriend and she is running away with him mayfield was eavesdropping walked in  and coryo shot her as he was afraid that she will tell his father brother of the imprisoned girl shot billy taupe took the guns and that was it  
then coryo saw that that brother was caught by the peacekeepers and was afraid that the guns will be found soon as well guns that were used to  mayors daughter with his fingerprints he would be hanged for that",2023-12-09
this is funny because in the book theres loads more songs book spoiler ahead snow even sings at one of the funerals in the book,2023-12-13
the book is much better for the details i read it before seeing the film and have to say they missed out so much from it,2023-12-13
"personally i think the weird behavior of lucy gray in the hut represents the paranoia of snow so that wasnt what she actually said but a little reversed

from the original three we know that snow killed a lot of people out of paranoia so lucy gray was his first victim",2023-12-21
officially district 13 no longer exists in this time period because they struck a deal with the capitol that ended the open war they agreed to secede from the other districts and go underground literally in exchange for a ceasefire and concealment of their existence,2023-12-24
from what i think the guy that was responsible for hiding the guns was friends with lucy and knew about the safe house they were all somehow working together and we’re going to overthrow the district with the guns so since those two got hung there were no more loose ends besides lucy but also why wouldn’t lucy tell him about it bc once he lied to her about killing people and a few other mess ups she wanted out,2024-01-02
spoiler i fully agree the shift from him being good to almost killing lucy seemed so quick and i didnt quite understand it i have only read the beginning of the book but this makes me want to read it,2024-03-15
that irritated me so much,2023-12-14
i also looked for the blood and was like heyyyyy,2023-12-29
the one character that got stabbed in the neck with a broken bottle and its cropped so weirdly to avoid any instance of blood such an odd decision,2023-11-18
the lack of blood was probably my biggest issue with this movie  ridiculous and im someone that dislikes movie violence but when its there and important it should seem real,2023-11-18
i mean the time i nearly cut my finger off the know was completely clean all the blood kind of gets wiped off as you pull the blade out seemed realistic to me,2023-12-30
maybe they have less leeway with violence because the films are already so thematically dark,2023-11-19
in pg13 depictions of blood are allowed if it isnt too gratuitous,2023-11-29
hunger game of thrones,2023-11-18
check out battle royale its basically r rated hunger games,2023-11-22
she has downs not autism lol,2023-12-03
i thought cora’s group had killed her offscreen and was glad i didn’t have to watch it just twisted the knife with that last bit,2023-11-25
 that was so sad to me the fact that she has down syndrome makes her the most innocent one of the tributes it makes me sad just remembering her death swarmed by snakes,2023-11-26
it made me cry so much,2023-11-28
its just berlin ,2023-12-26
and even in the modern games theyre still in a zoo just a gilded one,2023-11-20
“dress them up” as a tribute to lucy gray’s love in fashion she might be the reason why snow made the capitol dress up in festive colors,2023-12-16
i know its following a book but that part of the movie was the most interesting to me i would have loved to see more of snow developing the games into what they are today the 3rd act was absolutely boring sorry not a book reader,2024-03-25
"there were multiple nostalgia baiting moments that annoyed me
surprised they didnt throw this is my favourite flower primrose in there too",2024-01-07
the pause after they said the name was so forced felt like a sitcom where the public goes crazy over a comment,2024-01-13
this 100,2024-01-03
i also got the nudge that gaul had the president’s son—the mentor—killed he did not just die at the exact moment reaper was making his speech the capitol citizens like the districts are just pawns in the games that can be killed to me it showed the beginning of game makers having ultimate control in panem which culminates in plutarch organizing the rebellion via the 75th games,2023-11-19
loved this moment she appeared on the screens so abruptly like some  big brother boogeyman,2023-11-25
i was just used to the hunger games having a gimmick for each arena games 75 being a clock for instance and thought that was this arena’s gimmick,2023-11-17
i remember thinking to myself in the moment watching how ironic her speech about the capital kids death was considering all the children she was currently in the process of killing definitely intentional,2023-11-25
could it not have been both maybe they simply allowed them and opening and an opportunity to do the rebling and then took advantage of that to spin it their way like they did in the rest of the series,2023-11-19
if there wasnt an explosion the presidents kid wouldnt have died and she wouldnt have reason to make the decision to have no winners and release the snakes which ultimately caused lucy gray to win,2023-12-06
i mean i think it could be read either way he explicitly says he has tried to stop the games before,2023-11-19
i also love that the real rebels just stood there silently accepting their death but serjanus truly was privileged and just couldnt handle what was happening i mean i would do the same but i loved the juxtaposition,2023-11-17
if i have a nitpick with the movie it’s that they didn’t flesh out his close relationship with his mom the way they did in the book ma plinth is not only a very sweet woman and doting mother she even sort of takes coryo under her wing and always gives him food she’s a big reason why the plinths even end up more or less adopting coryo at the end all of which just makes coryo’s betrayal of sejanus and his death that much more heartbreaking,2023-11-18
same i was petrified when he was screaming ma and i couldnt help but think of his mother bawling and sobbing so  the ground when she hears itflashback to the jabberjays of prim and annie screaming katniss and finnicks names as well in catching fire shudder,2023-11-20
i like that he was the one who screamed the rest were completely at peace or atleast brave he despite his good intentions he was “play activism” when it got real he was inconsolable till the very end crying out for his mother,2023-11-17
the audiobook narrator does a phenomenal job  it was very chilling and disturbing,2023-11-23
it briefly appears as one of the arena zones in catching fire  katniss and finick have to listen to it for a hour,2023-11-17
rules for thee but not for me,2023-11-18
"oh the drones the compact for the poison and dropping his handkerchief in with the snakes

he cheated throughout",2023-11-18
wheres haymitch story about his win is it in the book,2023-11-21
it doesn’t top tuberculosis with legs,2023-11-25
the cheat code of a water drone they should have showed a list of the prices when they explained the rules of the hunger games it was probably the cheapest discount hence why it was used most often in comparison to any other options available goofy broken drones turned out to the mvp to rescue lucy gray,2024-01-01
yet still more funny than most lame marvel disney joke,2023-12-02
thats called branding,2024-01-21
drones have freedom to customize the delivering experience  no refunds,2023-12-11
  ,2023-12-01
doordash is insulted by you not giving them some credit too haha,2024-01-01
its been a while since i saw the original movies so i completely forgot the connection between this tigris and that tiger lady character thank you for reminding me wow,2023-12-24
yes,2024-01-13
maybe she’s so repulsed by the humans around her seeing what humanity has descended into by forcing children to  eachother for entertainment and seeing it get more and more of a spectacle each year she wanted to distance herself from those humans she wanted to erase her own human identity and connection to them and transforming herself into a tiger through plastic surgery perhaps was an expression of that,2023-11-25
in the last hg movie she said snow turned her into that because she wasn’t pretty enough anymore,2023-12-17
oh my  i feel so silly that i never made this connection until now…,2023-12-20
tyrion and snow meet again,2023-11-27
he also took all the anger he felt for snows father out on snow the son  tyrion  “invented” the hunger games as a joke while  and snows father took it and turned it in as his own as a serious and real thing  tyrion hated the games and never supported them,2023-11-22
upvote for ‘tyrion’ lol,2023-12-04
if i didnt know better id think this was a game of thrones discussion,2023-12-12
"i guess it’s open to interpretation and mine was lucy makes a comment that the gun was the only evidence linking him to the murders of the mayors daughterthe boyfriend if he got rid of those lucy herself would be the only “loose end” stoping him from going back to his normal life

they then share the tense exchange where snow basically asks if he would ever to worry about her exposing him because if that was a risk he would have to  her to ensure her silence 

lucy reads this immediately and promises him he has nothing to worry about before grabbing a knife and making up some excuse to leave at this point she’s worried that snow has killed his best friend lied to her about it and will now  her with just as little remorse if it serves him

she leaves plants a snake trap in his mother’s momento and runs away 

i think this also opens some ambiguity as to whether she ever even loved him or if it was just convenient to cater to snow she hesitates on their first kiss alludes to missing her exboyfriend

from snow’s perspective you can see he thinks about killing her in the cabin or perhaps is just reflecting on his horrible actions before deciding against it and proceeds to go fish 

he then notices she has ran and takes personal offence to the betrayal  deciding to  her as she obviously didn’t love him anyway him asking if it was real earlier in the movie he obviously fails but leaves anyway telling his commanding officer he was attacked by a snake and passed out i guess",2023-11-17
"she catches him in a lie about killing three people she realizes he got his friend killed to get rid of loose ends that could endanger himself

she also knows about his officer school offer and that he was planning on leaving her to go back to the capital but the rifle or the rebel being found is an inevitable death sentence so his only choice is to flee

they get to the cabin and discover the rifles that were hidden there by the other rebel not lucy his dna on the rifle and lucy are the last loose ends that could get him killed you wont tell anyone  snow asking lucy in the cabin

lucy gets the  out of there asap because she thinks he is going to  her destroy the rifles and get back to the capital

the movie plays it off as a coin toss on wether he was going to  her or keep fleeing north with her before the snake attack 

imo him going into the forest after her with the rifle instead of leaving it in the boat is pretty clear indicator of his intentions the snake attack was just justification on what he wanted to do in the first place remember he loved the feeling of killing the tribute kid

he didnt want to help the rebels never backing up plinth when he calls out the brutality reform the system from within his convo with lucy about the capital being civilized or go north into the wild he only agreed when forced by the rifle evidence 

he loved plinth and lucy but he didnt want to sacrifice his own desires to keep them",2023-12-02
simply put i think lucy realized she couldn’t trust snow because he always acts in his own selfinterest over anything else,2023-11-20
this is funny to me because this was my reaction reading the book but i thought the movie handled his switch much better,2023-11-20
im with you on that understood most of the movie until then,2023-11-19
"so it started in the scene before snow accidentally revealed he killed three people the third being sejanus plinth whom he didnt directly  but his action of sending the recording lead to his death he then poorly lied about it which lucy noticed and lost trust in him remember that before she said trust was the most important thing to her

then they get to the cabin and when looking for a fishing rod he finds the gun he used to  the mayors daughter the gun was the reason they were running as earlier they caught a  suspect by finding his dna on a gun he can thus destroy the gun and be in the clear snow and lucy talk about this and the fact that she would still be a loose end she then leaves in such a way it seems like shes afraid of snow after the conversation snow then goes fishing so he probably wasnt planning on killing lucy at this point but lucy is nowhere to be found snow realizes she ran away looks for her gets caught in the trap she left to presumably slow him down and now feels super betrayed so he tries to  her and completes his transformation into the evil snow we know from the original movies another interesting tidbit is his cousin at the end says he looks just like his father calling back to earlier when she said the main thing she remembered about his dad was that all she saw in his eyes was hate",2023-11-25
yea i didn’t read the books my friend and i were completely confused right after they left the district and went into the forest almost as if something was missing in between,2023-11-20
"i read the book and didnt understand it while reading i thought i missed something and read the scene again not getting any wiser and finishing the book puzzled 

the movie did a slightly better job imo but its still so confusing and out of nowhere",2023-11-24
" can you explain the cabin scene  i literally don’t understand a single thing from that point and into the forrest it made zero sense

lucy gray talks to snow about how trust is the most important thing to her more important than love 

snow slips up and says that 3 people killed are more than enough for him his lie about having meant his old self as the third  is not a very good one we can assume that lucy did not believe him so now she doesnt trust him anymore if she ever loved him then thats irrelevant to her now 

when they see the gun in the cabin they come to the same conclusion get rid of it and hes a free man well unless lucy talks lucy is terrified at this point she thinks snow is gonna shoot her any second now so she makes up a very flimsy excuse and leaves",2024-01-07
put simply in literary device terms it’s a complete character and plot reversal the discovery of the guns changes every circumstance and all trust is broken just as it would be in the final moments in the arena i think it reveals so much about the snake side of lucy in that final chapter the push and pull between the genuine and playing against each other the movie did no justice to that cabin scene please treat yourself to chapter 30 at least this book is a masterpiece in character study,2024-01-04
i feel like in the book the inner dialog he has makes you feel more like he is capable of hurting her,2023-12-04
and a developmentally disabled kid jesus bringing her into the mix was a good choice but also heartbreaking at the end of the games not movie,2023-11-17
i liked the choice it really highlighted the difference between these games and the future games it wasn’t a spectacle at this point not much of one anyway it was just a slaughter at this point there wasn’t really any motivation to actually win the games beyond survival for the participants a lot of districts were probably straight up rigging the reaping to send the ill infirm and unwanted instead of healthy children wasn’t until things like the victors village and winning districts getting supplies that some of the districts actually tried to win,2023-12-03
i think part of it was to emphasize how freshly out of war they were how badly the districts were damaged from the war,2023-12-31
those were the changes snow brought in later to groom the tributes before the games so the capitol didn’t feel so repulsed watching them,2023-11-18
and they were all filthy never washing for days barely having any food or water,2023-11-19
i thought the one eyed and one armed kids were collateral damage from the explosion they didn’t come to the capital like that,2023-11-22
i mean thats part of it but iirc the careers are only districts 1 2 and 4 the other 9 at the time were all reaped with the occasional volunteer the 74th had young kids there at least in the novel,2023-11-28
the outfits of the capitol screamed 1940s1950s but the districts seemed 1920s1930s half shocked the luxury district didn’t have a flapper style female tribute,2023-11-27
the original trilogy was the same way,2023-11-19
i disagree it’s a spectrum you can care for other people or think you do yet still rationalize selfish behavior that hurts those same people,2023-11-18
literally just not what sociopath means its not even a real psychological term anymore and it wasnt a popular one in the first place,2023-11-23
"i dont know about sincere he lied to pretty much everyone about not benefitting from helping them he was also unnecessarily brutal when killing the tribute he could have left while he was on the ground without actually killing him also when beating lucy grays ex he pauses when the ex seems unable to respond then decides to keep going and hitting him harder and harder and before sejanus drags him away you can see lucy gray looking pretty horrified in the background i definitely saw him as malicious and conniving through the first 2 acts in addition to being self serving and a liar he seems to relish in violence when he feels he can justify it or has an excuse to do so

theres no way to edit on that recording device so by only playing part of the conversation to the jabberjay he has 1 edited out that sejanus was entrusting him with his plan and that he had previously encouraged sejanus to rebel 2 made it seem like the jabberjay just happened to pick up the snippet of conversation rather than being planted so that nobody would ever know that he betrayed his friend",2023-12-24
my husband and i were hitting each other at that loved it,2023-11-18
was cesar flickerman really that old in the hunger games though the difference between the two stories is basically 65 years he seemed younger than that in the movies but i dont know if the books mentioned an age,2023-11-19
thank you totally missed that love it,2023-11-19
ohhhh i missed that i was so aghast at him making dinner reservations as the tributes were being killed,2023-12-06
tuberculosis on legs,2023-11-25
perhaps my favorite part of the movie,2023-11-18
"in the german dub he said something along the lines of „wouldn’ be funny now if it turned out to be something really cute“ 
„hm not so cute“

found that really funny too",2023-12-17
give him his own movie,2023-11-17
instead of dvd commentaries  i would love a flickerman style commentary of the hungar games,2023-11-17
"his commentary when the snakes came down was everything

i wonder if its candy",2023-11-18
in the book he actually really  at being a host and didnt know what to say half the time so id say its intentional,2023-12-13
i was actually really glad that they streamlined the 3rd act because i thought it dragged in the book  at least until the last few chapters,2023-11-18
"eh i would say he did actually care about his family and did care about sejanus his family came before everything though if there was any obstacle he would act to remove it whether it be friends or lovers thats not to say that he didnt become selfinvolved afterwards but in this story he was definitely pursuing wealth and prestige for his family

of course he let his newfound status bring him further and further to deeper levels of depravity over the next 64 years but i do believe he had a conscience at this point but was using lucy as a crutch as his last grasp at morality without lucy he became a complete sociopath its much like the path of anakin becoming darth vader he didnt start out evil but it was a long journey towards that path",2023-11-18
i felt the same way in the book  and i think the adults in the book gaul highbottom can see that sociopathy in snow even before he becomes completely evil  highbottom wants to stop him before he can hurt people and gaul wants to nurture it and bring it to fruition,2023-11-18
"in the book you hear his thoughts and they are selfish and demeaning twards others throughout  even at the beginning his grandmother gives him a rose he  his finger and then talks about how he has to control himself to not freak out at his grandmother and tigress has to talk him down  he even thinks less of tigress when she tells him what shes had to do on occasion in order to keep him fed

hes livid after lucy sings the song at the interviews because its about another guy",2023-11-18
"why are you so convinced he’s a sociopath i don’t think he is and i don’t think that would be a very interesting characterization either he’s a conflicted person who cares a lot about the people close to him but also cares a lot about power and is taught to believe in fascist thinking which he believes is the right way to govern the world 

his character is interesting because he’s believable",2023-11-20
"showing empathy or other emotions when no one was watching or when it didnt benefit him is a clear flaw in the story 

but sociopathypsyche in general isnt that black and white is it i think that sociopaths still prolly can feel some empathy its not like having 0 of it is mandatory to being socio or is it",2023-11-19
"see everyones jumping that hes a sociopath but like he very much isnt one not everybody out there is a sociopath  wasnt a sociopath putin isnt a sociopath just because youre trained or group you were raised with a different like outlook on life doesnt necessarily make you a sociopath you still have emotions these people still had emotions 

what happens is you basically are just developing your own survival instincts thats all this is he has emotions in the original story you just never get to see them from this point of view because you only see that hard exterior but the personal attention he paid to katniss after that first hunger games that is from a place of emotion not from a place of being a sociopath

emotions can trigger very specific reactions in people but he didnt really do a 180 the entire movie he was throwing people under the bus to survive if anything i feel like that mess of circumstances brought him to that point of just having apathy if you lose everything youve ever loved why do you care about anyone else at that point why would you go out of your way to help people when youve already lost everything in your eyes thats not being a sociopath",2023-11-19
thats the thing for me that i dont get reading these comments as a nonbook reader i dont get the vibe at all that snow was a sociopath to me all of his actions except prolly killing the dean were acts that he had to do to survive the movie showed how conflicted he was committing these acts and how guilty he felt after that,2023-11-26
this is a perfect way to describe it his private tears over sejanus didnt make sense looking at the rest of his actions,2023-11-17
everybody is so pressed to label him a sociopath and don’t realize that experiences and choices can take anyone down a dark path till they’re capable of great evil i can’t speak for the book but that was the entire point of the movie and it was plainly stated in the closing dialogue,2023-12-17
"he was always a sociopath that cared only about himself and how people viewed him

they made that clear when he immediately disowned his pal at the start when speaking to the other students

all his friendships are purely ones of convenience",2023-11-22
this is exactly how i saw it too,2023-11-20
the original cut was about 3 hrs 40 mins so maybe if we all complain loudly and long enough lionsgate will do it,2023-11-23
i agree and this one i will say idk where you could possibly split this movie fairly shouldve been split just so we can understand snows actions better the film is truly moving at breakneck pace and i was exhausted after the hunger games ended,2023-11-22
i liked that it was two parts i don’t know why people now watching on streaming would disagree either,2023-12-20
"there was a much much stronger case for splitting mockingjay into two than there was for this movie that book was an actionpacked finale with a lot of stuff outside katniss’s pov to expand on this book is a lowkey oneoff character study with fairly relaxed pacing not building to any particular big climax 

i know in my bones that if they did split ballad in two this sub would’ve hated it and complained it wasn’t necessary",2023-11-18
id argue that one did require 2 parts because the book itself has totally different tones to it the first half is a political drama while the second half is an action movie,2023-11-26
if you go back to the mockingjay part 2 post it’s there ,2023-11-26
exactly i completely disagree with these takes snow was also breaking the rules sneaking to hang with the rebels but scolded sejanus when he was actually trying to help the people if snow wasn’t just being selfish he could have just told him he was on his own if he gets caught instead he secretly recorded him and gave him up,2023-12-24
when flickerman said to lucy “how wonderful that we get to watch your final performance” the whole theater let out a sad aww,2023-11-24
good point i have to say i found it very difficult to villainies him as much as i did with the book especially with the way he cries after sejanus is killed it’s like they weren’t even trying that hard to make us hate him haha,2023-11-24
"in this case snow was a complex character he felt love for the girl and he also felt love towards tigris and his family’s honor and image and he had aspirations of his own

i think its also quite clear that while he loves her he does so in a very selfish way and that love doesnt assuage his own biases and bigotries

look at the conversation where he talks about bringing her to the capitol with him snow seems genuinely confused and surprised at lg not wanting to do so and not sharing his views of the capitol being the only civilised place

snow doesnt understand why he cant have it all doesnt understand how a lowley district girl wouldnt jump at the chance to be capitol",2023-11-18
i don’t think he’s a sociopath at all he’s smart and somewhat manipulative but he has general moral quandaries and it takes him a while to become truly ruthless it’s not a matter of him being born “bad” at all,2023-11-18
agree with your take i felt so bad for snows cousin and grandma and how he had to fake being rich at the start and just trying to study so much just to win that plinth to make his family safe,2023-11-20
wowww beautifully said my friend,2023-11-25
thank you for beautifully putting all my thoughts into words,2023-12-17
"i just feel intense malice and hypocrisy from him all the way from the start not a gradual descent in any pace

the earliest pointer was the class scene when he said his classmates were wrong and sejanus was right we should treat the participants as human beings then proceeded to propose the sponsorship system you want them to be viewed as human beings but then you objectify them right away as betting targets that is extremely twisted",2023-12-13
love this breakdown,2023-12-25
i didn’t read the book but my partner did she despised snow at the end i walked out of the theater not feeling sympathy for snow but feeling like he did what he had to in order to survive i had a feeling that if i read the book and had him as the unreliable narrator that would have been a very different feeling,2023-11-17
i feel that was the compromise like they couldn’t follow or feel his descent if he was like that from the start  it sucks because it would be so nice if the traits were there but then people around him realize it and fear him later after being blinded by his charisma,2023-11-17
not having his inner monologue makes that harder  in the books you read his thoughts which are deranged and entitled from the start and have him justify all his actions and his feelings of superiority twards almost everyone in his life,2023-11-18
i haven’t read the book but it was pretty clear to me as the movie progressed that he’s a sociopath it was actually really wild watching him unravel and like being disappointed every time i thought i was rooting for him,2023-11-18
i havent read the book yet but my thought on exiting the theater was that it took george lucas 3 movies to do what this one did and not even half as well i still felt the bond between him and serjanus as a genuine friendship while i think the trivia about how mom is interesting i feel the point was made well enough without it but im definitely looking forward to reading the book now,2023-11-19
"i dont think its that hes a sociopath its what he says at the end that the hunger games are to remind us all who we really are and that the world is just a big arena

when he went in to save sejanus and ended up getting attacked then having to  it basically instilled a permanent survival mode that he didnt have before or rather not to the point of actually killing someone i see it more like a latent ptsd which lucy gray also has i still have one foot in the arena theyre both survivors now and not like in the romanticized sense but more like a state of brokenness

so take that state and put it in a guy with ambition and privilege and proximity to power like snow and you get a tyrant",2023-11-28
"how hypocritical his thoughts are and how he will in the same breath criticize someone and then do the same exact thing but of course for him it’s okay

maybe because hes not one",2023-11-18
theres a moment when he spits something at one of the mentors neck it was hilarious af ,2023-11-26
"i felt like lucky had more genuine moments that were more endearing like he was just a regular weather guy who had to comment on the games

caesar is like full commercialized fakeness that has been polished to the point you cant shake him hes a seasoned vet",2023-12-14
i actually didnt like him that much compared to caesar,2023-11-21
"id love a four hour directors cut to come out later

but i didnt want two movies id rather it was rushed than we got half a story",2023-11-18
thank you  i feel like the pacing was weird in the book too but people seem to be forgetting that  the third act drags until the last few chapters then its like someone slams the gas pedal down,2023-11-19
"aye id be against splitting an already long movie into two

you could make a limited tv series but youd lose a lot of the audience",2023-11-18
whos ma,2023-11-25
as someone who has read the book several times i actually thought the changes they made for the film made it better  they didnt make any massive changes but they streamlined things a bit  especially in part 3 which dragged in the book in my opinion  im glad they speed it up a bit,2023-11-18
this isnt really this specific movies fault its a very annoying very common film trope but i hate when people get poisoned and die immediately it would probably take a few minutes or maybe even hours to weeks depending on what the poison is i understand why that wouldnt translate well to film but it always breaks my suspension of disbelief,2023-12-24
"theres a lot we dont know about the character but i wouldnt call him onenote it was obvious that he lowkey struggled with his part in the games when hes introduced hes getting high on something to cope 

then he has this snapelike arc where he clearly hates snow because of his father and the audience is left to wonder what happened to make him feel this way which i thought dinklage played really well is he just petty and spiteful or is he a rebel who hates what coryo represents

the ultimate reveal was rushed but there a lot of interesting little hints in there as to what kind of person he is",2024-01-28
when he said what a lovely final performance for lucy i just went  it caught me so off guard he was great,2023-11-20
with you saying it felt like your imagination while reading are you saying that as a negative or positive critique of the movie not trying to sound rude i never read the book but want to know if it feeling exactly like what you imagined it would look like was a good or bad thing,2023-12-04
tigris is his cousin she’s also in mockingjay as one of the capital citizens who helps katniss’ squad reach snow the one that looks like a tiger and has whiskers and all that,2023-12-04
felt the same once i settled into the accent i didnt even notice it kinda found it charming,2023-11-17
which would have been when she was a very young child so the accent wouldve stuck,2023-11-18
that was definitely not an appalachian accent,2023-11-19
i think it’s to make it clear that she’s “other”  in the book it’s discussed that the covey are traveling musicians from the appalachian region who were accidentally wrangled in to district 12 during the war and have been unable to escape,2023-11-19
so she actually isnt from the appalachia region which is where district 12 is shes a traveling basically some sort of gypsy that was stuck for 10 years after the war because they locked down all the borders between districts when they started the hunger games so her origins are accent could be from when she was a kid and her family,2023-11-19
it also went in and out a lot i dont know if it was gray manipulating other characters or if it was just a continuity error,2023-11-18
i mean the dozen or so just songs throughout the movie essentially made this movie a semi musical,2023-11-17
ten years ago or so vanessa hudgens would have been cast as lucy i imagine,2023-11-18
not gonna lie her singing in the movie made it feel better than to read her singing lol,2023-11-17
i watched it with a friend who’d never seen her anything and she thought zegler was overacting compared to the snow actor and she said the expressions zegler made didn’t feel believable as in in real life situations people wouldn’t express themselves facially or verbally like that too “acting”,2023-11-18
her theatre kid mannerism stood out too much at times i get on stage you have to exaggerate your movements but on camera its too much,2023-11-25
i came to this thread expecting to see 1000 comments about how bad her acting was and how unlikeable she was she was the worst part of the movie for me ,2023-11-18
i was put off so amicable she was towards snow pretty much from the very beginning there was so much more relationship building between katniss and peeta with haymitch this time just felt so rushed,2023-11-18
"i wasnt a fan either our first introduction of her was so theatrical but now knowing the book context that shes an entertainer always pulled to the forefront makes it a bit more palatable but i still dont like how tonally dissonant it felt from the world overall 

same for the scenes in the third part of the movie when coryo is in a white shirt and theyre all heading to the lake it looked like something off of an instagram reel lool",2023-11-19
same it like such a character being played up from the very beginning even her  expressions while singing that song on tv while snow was getting up from the hospital bedit just made me cringe so bad,2023-11-18
yeah very one dimensional character with no depth or development,2023-11-24
youre the first person ive seen echoing my own thoughts on her she absolutely couldnt carry the movie and frankly dragged it down for me,2023-11-25
hard agree,2023-11-21
okay my thoughts exactly i think i would’ve liked the movie or more if her accent and singing weren’t so corny it didn’t feel like she was over the top,2023-11-24
"huh i loved her performance she was charming and innocent and fiesty and mysterious all at the same time

hated how open ended her part was in the third act though",2023-12-06
i muted it every time she’d start singing it was pretty unbearable,2023-12-21
did you have a personal dislike of zegler before you saw the movie,2023-11-22
the actual singing was good but the fact that she was singing in some of the situations she did was so so cringe i cant believe people liked it,2024-01-08
i was cringing for much of her onscreen time so youre not alone the accent just didnt look or feel right nor did the singing,2024-01-16
exactly  im from the south as well but her accent was jarring to me bc she didn’t fit it at all nor was she consistent w the accent throughout the movie,2023-12-06
she said she came from a traveling family so possibly from the deep south,2023-11-19
sometimes,2023-11-17
yeah lol there’s plenty of proof for this,2023-11-17
you sound like fun people to be around,2023-11-18
wow im not too familiar with coriolanus one of the few shakespeare plays that ive never seen so i hadnt considered the parallels between that coriolanusvolumnia and here  suzanne collins really kills it on the naming front,2023-11-26
pretty sure like the rest of the capital population their names come directly from ancient rome,2024-02-26
is this sarcasm because she technically is in this movie,2023-11-19
"yeah but i did he actually try to  katniss though like from katnisss perspective which the entire series is biased from it really feels like hes coming down  her but if you look at every other person whos truly wronged him he just went out and killed he went out of his way to try and direct her and focus her to do his bidding and as much as he wanted to keep her alive because she was so famous in the capital he could have easily orchestrated some kind of accident that led to her death

but the way he was so focused on her in the story definitely in my opinion to lose that there was something more emotional happening between him and katniss on his end then what actually we see from katnisss perspective i think in some way snow saw not only lucy gray within her but also himself within her",2023-11-19
snow hates threats to himself and his dictatorship and loves when he can use someone to prop up his own self worth and image in catching fire he demands that katniss performs conformity to panem and love for peeta so well that he himself believes it she failed and thus nothing he might elsewise find interesting or appealing with her matters her death serves him better,2023-12-04
i also feel like the movie may have been better than the book and i almost never say that  i actually liked some of the changes they made  ending the games with the snakes and lucy singing was amazing  in the books her win is kind of anticlimactic,2023-11-18
thats why i buy the book after watching movie adaptations lol my mind cant truly the appreciate characters because i cant imagine what they look like or sound like movies help as a visual aid,2023-11-22
they made her a disney character i hated every scene she was in,2023-12-25
i love that the author is the opposite of jkr  she doesnt answer questions about her world  lets her art stand on its own,2023-11-18
i haven’t read the book so no spoilers here but i thought it was super obvious a hint that katniss is related my guess was that she was actually lucy’s granddaughter,2023-11-18
very interesting,2023-11-20
lucy gray didn’t write the hanging tree about the hanging he attended that’s not possible she sings it before she knows snow killed three people when they’re in the field and she’s playing guitar,2023-11-19
this feels like a reach with no evidence in the books to support it he hates katniss because she is the face of the rebellion that threatens to topple the country he is the current president of ,2023-11-28
huge reach,2023-11-19
"absolutely not peeta in the books is described as blond wavy haired and blue eyed—but also stocky muscular and of medium height in the movie snow is tall rather lanky and not stocky in the slightest though he does have lean muscle 

they don’t look alike whatsoever",2023-11-30
daaamn,2023-11-20
it’s like a lovehate if i remember hate that she represents a revolution but probably likes that she reminds him of lucy but also hates bc lucy ran off on him,2023-11-19
im a sucker for stuff like that,2023-11-22
nah it was excellent brought the past and the presentfuture together seamlessly,2023-11-25
agreed that was pretty goofy,2023-11-18
yeah it was unnecessary it was cool in the trailer because it was ominous and made us wonder why but putting it at the end was very cheesy and literally a wink at the audience,2024-01-13
me rn ,2023-11-25
yeah it would have been real dumb i was pretty relieved they didnt go down that route im glad that prequel movies are now realizing that not everything needs to connect back to the main character from the original series,2023-11-18
the timeline wouldnt work either katniss wouldve been born much later this was the 10th games by katniss times it wouldve been the 70th something,2023-11-25
this whole movie was a really weird fan service,2023-12-09
the singing was bad enough,2023-12-25
lucy gray would be too old to be katniss’ mother but it is implied in the books that katniss is descended from the covey  likely a cousin a few generations removed to lucy gray,2023-11-24
i’d disagree the public hangings and heavy policing vs a looser grip tho i think the capitol was strict for about 40 yrs then loosened to where the electric fence didn’t work and katniss could hunt and sell things,2024-01-10
i would say less because i dont think he was in charge immediately on the 11th games,2024-01-13
nah it remaining the only untouched weapon in the arena is very symbolic imo,2023-11-24
i had a similar thought but fantastic beasts,2023-12-01
and then everyone applauds her with tears in their eyes,2023-12-20
i know it’s literally in the title,2023-11-21
"a longer slender slim shady 

for real he was snatched as  in that peacekeeper uniform",2023-11-25
facts,2023-11-23
all i kept seeing was draco malfoy the entire time ,2023-11-25
youve just described bollywood,2023-11-25
i think there is an argument to be made that he was suicidal even if he wasn’t aware of it he wanted to be punished and was disgusted by the callus life of luxury that surrounded him,2023-11-17
let me blabber off about my conspiracy with the rebels to my obviously capital loyalist bestie who has made it clear he harbors no sympathy,2023-11-18
agreed i didnt read the book but that sejanus was openly asking for a trouble the whole running time hes a good person i see it but the way he fights for justice was downright naiive and  i felt that snow could have avoided a lot of trouble if sejanus had not been his friend for example if you just watch the movie if sejanus wasnt there snow would never have gotten involved with the mayors daughter and her gang in the first place not to mention that poor tribute snow killed during the game,2023-11-18
"agreed i found book sejanus to be insane because he was basically attempting suicide by peacekeeper at every turn it really did make me sympathize with snow more because he was truly a menace that would sabotage himself and take others down with him sooner than later 

they toned him down in the movie but even then i think that was more so due to the fact they had to cut it out rather than them changing how his character behaves",2023-12-09
"exactly  hes too smart to be fooled or so naïve or so ineffective in his efforts  

so he joins the peacekeepers to be near his bro snow in district 12 of all places then promptly gives money to rebels which oh no they used to buy guns not money i had no idea",2023-12-21
"i havent seen the movie yet but my interpretation of him from the book is less that hes a hypocrite and more that hes trapped in a situation without any practical way of helping people he is willing to put himself in harms way possibly without thinking about the consequences possibly because of suicidal ideation for things he believes in but he is constantly berated and even punished for merely questioning the status quo he wants to help his tribute within the confines of the games by giving him food but marcus rejects him he sneaks into the arena to give marcus a bit of dignity in death and is coaxed back out based on the lie that  be able to help improve things in the future if he survives once he escapes his act is completely erased and hes punished by being drafted and sent away i dont know if this happens in the movie but in the book he talks to snow about possibly becoming a medic to improve things for peacekeepers and district 12 residents and is crushed when it seems that this is not a likely outcome

people seem to be making a lot of his final moments to put it in perspective one of the major themes of the book and movie is the social contract saving us from the state of nature perpetual war between everyone the book begins with a quote from hobbes who viewed the right to fight for your life as the only right that the state cant take away from you anyone can justifiably defend themselves we tend to think its brave when fictional characters are stoic in the face of death but i think to collins its a sign that the social contract is irrevocably broken sejanus is just a child isolated depressed and dealing with emotional trauma but hes given up fighting back because at every turn doing so has only made things worse he was never a rebel just someone who wished things could change i dont really think that were meant to judge him so harshly for being afraid to die",2023-11-17
honestly i think it would make perfect sense for her character to code switch in the various situations she finds herself in but i don’t know if zegler did that in purpose or not,2023-11-18
tbf it’s a weird  name had no idea what they were saying until they showed his army locker,2023-11-17
hugh janus,2023-11-20
i don’t recall them playing the recording during the hanging in the books i believe sejanus still believed snow was his friend and didn’t want to rat him out,2023-11-18
i mean the book is the same way first parts had room to breathe but then it becomes plot point after plot point ending in a very quick 180 from snow,2023-11-17
right i loved it being one movie i wanted more and more from this story it wouldve  having to wait for the closure it exceeded my expectations and i definitely need to get to the novel already,2023-11-18
mockingjay absolutely didn’t need two movies and this movie did both of these opinions are independent of each other believe it or not,2023-11-18
the real problem with lord of the rings was it was split up so much smh,2023-11-18
because even if they keep it to one single movie they should still have enough detail and not rush things it doesn’t have to be two movies,2023-11-17
no you absolutely can  context is a thing its not just a do it dont do it binary you have to also nail the execution,2023-11-22
have you ever thought that the moviesplitting crowd is not the same people as the 1 movie crowd unless you have proof that this commenter has complained about both ends then i would stand corrected,2023-11-22
they aren’t the same person dude not everyone is going to be happy for any decision the comments that always get upvoted and posted anytime anyone is unhappy with this sentiment perplex the  out of me,2023-11-26
different people mate,2023-11-18
people only complain when the movies are bad,2023-11-18
" i was just thinking about this dilemna  

like i was glad that they didnt split this book into two movies but at the same time i felt the run time kinda ruined the pacing

but yeah i think out of those two options  this was the better one",2023-11-19
ive been thinking about this i would love to see a series on the hunger games i want to know how things developed,2023-12-28
im curious what your husband thought  i personally liked the way they streamlined some of the things in the movie especially the third act  it drags pretty badly in the book until the last few chapters where it suddenly moves way too fast,2023-11-18
" it would have just made it more realistic

yesyou say that like its a bad thing the absence of blood drew me straight out of the movie and shattered the illusion that what were watching on screen is actually happening its immersionbreaking",2023-11-20
i questioned in the book if bringing him back after a summer in the districts wasnt always the plan  she saw something in him from the start and having him spend time in a district allowed him to get more game maker ideas,2023-11-18
this was my interpretation too it wasnt until he admitted he killed three people that she clued in he sent it himself,2023-11-18
ohhh true,2023-11-18
see this is what confused me i thought he killed the first guy in the games then billy and the mayors daughter then inadvertently sejanus,2023-12-15
in the 1st person book he is judging everyone around him and manipulating people and excusing his own actions constantly he also uses really possessive language about lucy  constantly says that she belongs to him  and is very very selfserving while convincing himself he’s doing the right thing that’s hard to translate to film,2023-11-18
i feel that all the hunger games books work better than the movies because collins has a lot of internal monologues when i saw the first four movies i remembered there being pages of katniss’s thoughts before she made decisions,2023-11-18
i’m not 100 sure that she would’ve followed through with kissing him but it appeared to me that she poked her head through the bars and he backed up a few inches,2023-11-26
agreed it was such an amazing come back for such a great series and yes i love how the movie didn’t stop when the game was over— we got to see so much more in this movie which was truly fascinating praying that the next movie we get focuses on haymitch  his games as well as tigris  how she started all her body modifications,2023-11-24
"that just isnt true at all and that word gets thrown around like confetti by people on the internet

snow feels fear guilt regret compassion moral disgust doubt affection and what he would call love during the course of the story he clearly cares for lucy gray his grandmother and his cousin and for various classmates that he genuinely considers friends he genuinely worries for clemensia after shes bitten by snakes for instance  he comes to regard the covey with affection yes he has some negative thoughts and feelings about these people as well but thats quite normal

his feelings about sejanus are conflicted his predominant feelings toward him are irritation and frustration but theres some affection and even pity mixed in with that

snows characterisation is wonderfully nuanced",2023-11-17
did he really ever turn tho at every point where he could have stopped with a little bit of violence he continued because he liked it and the power he felt,2023-11-19
"my partner had the same question so i just whipped out the book to reread it as background he didn’t find out he was moving to district 2 ten days beforehand like in the movie there was very little time between that promotion and him joining her when he agreed to join her he thought he was stuck in 12 and on borrowed time because the  weapons would be found eventually 

once he leaves he hates the outdoor the bugs and the mud and the jabberjays so he’s having a bad time and was just told he had an out then they get to the cabin where he finds the gun he realized if he destroys them there’s nothing connecting him to the murders and he’d be truly free except lucy grey who could snitch but he loves her and she loves him so she wouldn’t right except well if he scorned her maybe she would and he starts thinking about how she’s a “cold blooded killer” and “not an innocent lamb” which she proved in the arena mind you this is mere pages after he justified her killings and painted her as a good person so he decides no she’s too calculated a person then he realizes she’s been gone a while and goes to find her then realizes she ditched him because she figured out that the third person he killed was sejanus not his bs excuse of “his old self” then he sees the scarf gets bit by the snake and thinks she tried to poison him like when she threw the snake down mayfield’s dress in the reaping 

in essence though he’s trying to justify this to himself because he’s a narcissist he wants to leave 12 and is looking for an out and looking for an excuse to clear all the loose ends plus he is an extremely paranoid man nothing he thinks makes sense it could’ve just been a random snake not a planned  it ends up not even being poisonous but he thinks everyone and everything is out to get him it’s his main trait he judges people for things then does it himself but justifies it typical narcissistic behavior killing is bad when lucy did it in the arena but it’s necessary for him in that moment that thought process is not supposed to make sense",2023-11-17
he realized she knew the truth about him betraying sejanus and could ruin his life,2023-11-17
"i feel like him leaving her broke him i think he already viewed love and friendship with the exception of his family as transactional as we saw with sejanus so her leaving him felt like the most extreme betrayal possible 

that said i haven’t read the book so if i’m off the mark i’m sorry",2023-11-17
he was only leaving because he was sure he was going to be hung for killing the mayors daughter  two things happen when theyre on their way out first lucy grey figuring out that he killed sejenus and then him finding the guns which lead lucy to become distrustful  when she decides to get away it makes him crazy,2023-11-18
because his class interests never changed i thought this was the theme of the movie class interests trump everything,2023-11-18
"he was scared and afraid she was going to jeopardize his life and his safety when you hit that point you dont know what youre going to do until youre there some people dont hold up to their ends of their belief systems

he did like her he did love her thats why he didnt hunt after her thats why he just went home and left and forgot it all happening and if she betrayed him she betrayed him she was gone and out of his life

he flipped out like that because she betrayed him because after everything he did for her she showed him that he literally meant nothing to her thats a correct analysis from his perspective and the kind of person he is once she left and he kind of realized that she was just going to run away and potentially go back he realized that at this point in time theres no going back to fix his family name theres no going back to to get make sure his cousin is going to be alive the girl who literally survived through  with him she was going to jeopardize it all and so he went after her at first he went out with after her to try and find her and reason with her and he brought his gun just in case he had to put this to an end

but then whenever he was bit by the snake he understood what his decision must be in his eyes she has to die theres no other way around it shes jeopardizing his safety shes trying to attack him she had a knife and in his head hes just killed his best friend hes stuck out here in the middle of nowhere the girl he thought he loved never loved him she even tried to attack him

to me that seems like a proper conclusion somebody in his position would make",2023-11-19
it was like that in the book too though,2023-11-17
much like in the original trilogy the book is all from one persons pov snows  so we see everyone through his eyes and they dont get developed  in the original trilogy everyone is seen through katnisss eyes so they arent truly developed either,2023-11-18
not the presidents son the presidents son dies which is why the snakes are released hes the son of a wealthy district 2 man,2023-12-28
bruh the misty mountain song goes hard tho,2023-11-17
thats cool no internal monologue didnt bother me the third act could benefit from an extra 15 or so minutes but the entire movie feeling rushed nah and the accents are good,2023-11-18
"when they had the conversation by the lake this literally came up
and she explained that the capitol would never be her place",2023-11-19
"oh that stuff is easy to explain snow never planned on betraying lucy when he got to the cabin he states the reason for running away with her was due to the fact that the peacemakers would eventually find the gun somewhere in the district and trace it back to him with dna evidence so snow goes into the cabin then finds the literal  weapons which made him have to run from his desired life once snow finds the guns you can see him in real time realizing that there is no longer a reason to run away with lucy 

the reason lucy told him to look there is because there were originally only fishing poles in there in the movie she literally said when snow found the gun that billy must have known of this location and decided to stash the guns there billy and lucy were a part of the coveys together before their break up as evidenced by one of the covey kids missing billy when they went out with snow and lucy that one time thus it makes sense for billy to know this hidden location of the cabin as the best spot to hide weapons the guns were put there recently probably on the night of the  there was no way for lucy to know that the guns would be there literally the only person that knew was billy

finally snow didnt betray lucy not at first at least when he found the gun he happily said he could get rid of all the loose ends but then lucy outright called herself a loose end snow is concerned but asks lucy for reassurance that she wouldnt rat him out lucy responded yes to the question but then very suspiciously invents a reason to leave the cabin to get food snow knows the reasoning is bogus and points out numerous flaws in the lie but still allows lucy to head out showing that he hasnt planned on betrayal yet some time later snow finds out lucy isnt in the area anymore and goes out looking for her primarily due to the fact that she could actually be going to sell him out at this point snow still probably hasnt planned on killing lucy if he finds her however he finds the gift that he gave to lucy on the floor only to get bitten by a snake under it snow realizes lucy literally set up a trap to hurt him knowing hed try and pick up the scarf then get bit so he then starts yelling are you trying to  me lucy repeatedly this is when snow starts showing signs of active hostility against her and starts to fire the gun he brought with him snow betrayed lucy because he felt like he was the one betrayed lucy lied to him to run away and set up a trap designed to injure him to snow he got betrayed not the other way around thats why he attempts to  her after",2023-12-22
thats a good point i only posed that because it felt like certain emotional scenes didnt get the few more moments they needed to breath and resonate some more time would have helped but the movie was already a bit long but i definitely can see a series losing people too especially since theres way less competition at the movie theaters right now while a show is competing with all the other big streaming epic shows,2023-11-18
absolutely so many times i’ll finish a miniseriesseason of tv and ask myself “why couldn’t they have just trimmed the  and made it a movie”,2023-11-25
"i dont know i feel like this could have really held peoples attention because not only could you have done it from the perspective of snow but you also could have thrown in lucy grays perspective as well as some of the other various tributes and really made like part one like three or four episodes part two one or two episodes and part three like one episode

and then you really shown out the games and made it kind of more tense really they should make a tv show and try and get this guy and a bunch of other people that were in this movie to go in that show and do like through the years of the hunger games as they face all these different tributes and we kind of see the capital go from this 1960s 1950s era society to like what they are in the present day hunger games but at the same time you could definitely add in some of the rebel side of things because thats a big proponent we could see more on like district 13 as well as some of the other rebel groups acting within the capital and acting within the districts to kind of see how this war was built up over time",2023-11-19
different perspectives i suppose ive always loved her voice and im not on the hate train for her not to say that you are plus that ending scene she played the tension and determination to survive so well to me her im not made of sugar was exactly how id imagined it in the book and her rebellious ferocity when singing to the capital was great,2023-11-19
lol i thought she was fine i had no issues with her acting,2023-11-26
i like this analysis,2023-12-20
but he told her he was going to 2 for officer training and the next day she trusted him enough to meet him at the hanging tree and lead him to their secret hideaway  it would have made more sense for her to agree to meet him and then ghost,2023-11-19
"to add

it seems to me that lucy’s intent was never to  snow she set it up in a way so that he would think she’s trying to  him so he would not have to choose between herthe outdoor lifestyle and his capital lifefamilypower if he’s under the impression she wants him dead he has no reason to stay essentially she gives him an easy way out because she did love him this also gives her time to escape from him who is clearly unstable and no longer trustworthy 

the snake under the scarf assuming it wasn’t there by coincidence is also a test to see how he would react had he been calmer instead of trying to shoot her she may have considered staying or talking it out 

i think most likely it was both as even if snow failed her test which he did she wouldn’t resort to  again like snow does so easily snow is projecting his readiness to ",2023-11-21
"kinda what i gathered as well from the movie  boy did the third act not feel fleshed out enough though

i still think snow wouldnt have harmed her  after everything he went through for her i didnt buy that he would harm her  

oh well  movie wasnt perfect but again i got the general idea lol",2023-11-18
thats kinda what i gathered but it really wasnt fleshed out enough  i felt the third act really lacked substance  it didnt feel convincing to me as i still felt like snow wouldve done anything for her,2023-11-18
it makes sensethey just didnt need to hand hold the viewer through it he brings up that he killed a 3rd person and we can see her visibly frightened and start to worry whether he could just as easily  her too,2023-11-17
laughed so hard when he said that ,2023-11-19
my whole theater laughter hahaha,2023-11-25
this is a great idea i usually just throw a pod on but never thought to actually get back into books this way ,2023-11-19
i was very tempted to yell “winter is coming” after peter dinklages character’s interaction with snow,2023-11-18
"i agree if they cut it after the hunger games the second movies climax lucy running away would have fell flat in a second movie

i guess it had the same problem here but i think i preferred this to a second movie",2023-11-17
this the second half would have been a straight psychological romance drama it would have put a lot of people,2023-11-18
i feel like making a movie just about snow being a peacekeeper in 12 wouldve been too slow burn for audiences,2023-11-19
three part miniseries might have been the way to go but wouldnt make as much money,2023-11-17
i agree they need to release the theatrical length cut and then also do a five hour directors cut with a limited release and watchable on streaming,2023-11-18
make it 3hr with an intermission,2023-12-21
i havent read the ballad of songbirds and snakes but splitting the harry potter book up made sense most of the first half of the book are pretty much just ron harry and hermione having real character development without the distraction of other characters and it was tonally pretty different so i could see why they would split it and also it would be a crime to cut that stuff out,2023-11-17
that was a shame because if anything this movie deserves that twoparter treatment i heard the story presented in the novel was rather dense it benefited a lot more from splitting up compared to mockingjay especially the time snow served at the military that one needs a lot more fleshing out,2023-11-17
"mockingjay is such a boring  movies part 1 is full of action and explosion that theres no character development you dont care about this rebellion and characters because this movie didn’t give you time to care about them

part 2 is so full of character drama except the explosion at the end that people are bored because literally nothing happened it just katniss being told what to do until the end i think it could work as 1 long  movie tho by combining them you could get 1 movie that has plot chars development and action instead of soulles 2 parts",2023-11-17
i thought hp splitting the finale into two parts worked well,2023-11-17
"since mockingjay alongside harry potter was one of the big examples of a finale hurting itself by doing that

did it though i realize neither part of mockingjay made as much as catching fire but they combined to make a lot more than catching fire if they would have done one long mockingjay the budget would have been a lot higher than either part and i think would have resulted in a lot less profit they made a combined 14b ww on a combined 285m budget thats a great return

im also pretty sure that a lack of an actual hunger games in mockingjay was just as big of an issue from a box office perspective as splitting the movie up",2023-11-17
was harry potter a big example of a finale hurting itself because even with two movies the book was so eventful that both had to cut a ton and if i recall dh part 2 was very well received and financially successful even dh part 1 did well by regular movie standards if admittedly on the lowend for the hp franchise,2023-11-17
it also doesnt help that the part after they leave the capital isnt as engaging as the other  i cant imagine anyone wanting to see the snow goes to twelve and gets evil section by itself,2023-11-18
i don’t think the breaking bad comparison makes sense it’s like they were adapting a book or anything they just decided to market the last two half seasons as one big final seasons,2023-11-20
latecomer hot take bring back the intermission give us a little break then jump back in with part 3,2024-01-10
garry ross directed the first one,2023-11-23
it happens very quickly in the book too,2023-11-18
i think there wasnt enough for two parts maybe one and one and a half movie but it followed most of the points in the book,2023-11-18
all of that could have been included if it was just a better written movie i agree with everything i still liked it but it could have been better,2023-11-18
they should have filmed everything at the same time and have 2 parts released relatively close to each other they could have ended part 1 in the middle of the games during a tense moment so people who havent read the books have to come back to see who wins the trailers for part 2 could ruin this but i am a little sad part one was so rushed in this movie,2023-11-19
this movie wouldve been better as a 2 parter but the story doesnt lend itself to 2 parts unfortunately 3 acts cant split well youd have to stop halfway through the games although if they stayed true to the material ma taking in snow hunger games not extending footage for the sake of entertainment it might not have been so long and couldve been split better,2023-11-22
bruh that came out like 4 months ago,2023-11-17
"mission impossibles issues have nothing to do with it being a twoparter

yeah it deserves more than the middling box office it gets really unfortunate that it got jammed in between barbenheimer but aside from that i think of all the twoparters this year between fast x atsv and this mi is my least favorite because in narrative and editingwise they made some questionable choices and ironically songbirds and snakes needed that twoparter desperately because of how dense the story was",2023-11-17
how could the writers of this film anticipate the weak box office of dead reckoning one when both were in production at the same time and released the same year,2023-11-17
"	there is always the possibility that she is out there somewhere and she could bring him down and ruin everything with what she knows

i agree with what you said except this part not only would it be impossible for a modern day lucy gray to prove snow did anything it literally wouldn’t matter snow killed or had others  plenty of people openly and blatantly in the hunger games series even if lucy gray could prove it all it would lead to is snow looking around the room chuckling and saying “so guards  her” and that would be the end of it",2023-11-19
"wordsworth poem

",2023-11-17
interesting thanks for sharing,2023-11-17
but at a certain point snow gets so powerful nothing lucy could say would even matter,2023-11-25
because she was the last loose end tying snow to the  of the mayors daughter during that scene she realizes snow can’t be trusted and runs pretty much other comments here have described it better,2023-11-17
i would be interested in seeing her in a play i still think her best role was west side story,2023-11-17
"shes very new to working professionally  she scored three huge roles all requiring a triple threat in a very quick timeperiod right out of high school snow white hunger games and west side story

some of her acting seemed very theater which didnt work with the closeups  but it also fit her character who is a performer and who knows that before and during the games she has to perform",2023-11-18
i got little impressions she was an actress i figured she was some pop music girl or upcoming singer and given the role because of that for some fangirl thing or something shes a song and dance person  but hey one role is all i know her for and shes young it can change,2023-11-18
nailed it ,2023-11-28
i was kind of comparing them at one point until i had similar thoughts to you katniss never wanted to be in the limelight and jennifer lawrence brought out that  off girl who just wanted to be left alone lucy gray is a showgirl from the beginning,2023-11-25
"its a purposeful takedown in that i didnt find her performance effective for the character nor the big screen she emotes like its broadway like shes still in west side story which i thought she was very good in thats appropriate for when rachel gray is having her big theatrical flourishes but not so much when weve moved into subtler scenes and moments

agree to disagree but i dont have it out for her i just thought this was a misfire onto snow white",2023-11-18
it was so bad and i dont know her from anything,2023-12-25
why in the world would i pin bad accent work on a screenwriter the director can shoulder slight blame for not trying to sway the performance but 95 of it is on zegler,2023-11-18
agreed i felt like there was so little time with the tributes before the start of the games which really surprised mebut then i thought about the scale of the changes between this games and the time of katniss 74th games and it made sense  in this games there isnt a structure yet for any preliminaries it probably would have felt less rushed if we got to see more of the other reapings or other tribute interviews although that wouldnt have added much to the story and there wasnt time for it,2023-11-26
i read the book and i thought the third act made more sense in the movie than it did in the book,2023-11-18
to their credit the ones they havent seen are the weakest in the franchise,2023-11-17
i mean catching fire was easily the best of the first four,2023-11-18
mockingjay part 1 and 2 are pretty weak,2023-11-17
tbf with them catching fire was the peak and it all just kinda went down from there,2023-11-18
i decided to rewatch the original tetralogy before watching this but couldnt get myself to go through mockingjay part 1  2 i stopped when i finished catching fire first two still hold up pretty well,2023-11-18
"i mean i feel like calling it filler isn’t really a fair reading it’s the gradual escalation of rebellion within the world as well as katniss coming to grips with being the symbol of the mockingjay as well as showing the aftermath of catching fire and the impact on everyone 

if it was one movie i bet a million dollars the same people thinking this should have been a two parter would have similar complaints",2023-11-17
i and several other people ive met are part of the mockingjay part 1 was great but part 2 was mediocre club we just thought part 1 had some really great and tense scenes and sequences part 2 was straightforward and just forgettable,2023-11-17
well for one every time he leaves white roses for katniss to find after he destroyed something that was malicious,2023-11-21
that’s apparently just a fan theory,2023-11-18
"we saw katniss’s mom in original movies and she also would be too old to be her mother those movies are 64 years in future lucy also either dies or leaves district 12

they don’t look alike either",2023-12-20
it’s not really a legit question knowing the timeline this was 60 years in the past where katniss isn’t even a thought yet also the fact that we see katniss’s mom multiple times lol,2023-11-19
hmm really good point,2023-11-19
yep solid movie for sure and def good but still under the first two,2023-11-20
to add onto the other commenter they cut out ma which i think was a disservice his interactions with sejanus’s mother is something that very well captured how snow was very charismatic and polite on the outside but internally he looked down on everyone and had very toxic thoughts about those around him and zero respect,2023-11-17
"some of the tributes died before they entered the games through the bombing being shot in the zoo etc and they paraded their bodies around through the streets during the funerals of the deceased capitol kids a lot more died during the bombings to set an example to the districts one was hoisted on the back of a crane and a few were draped behind horses  


the tributes were treated like animals to the extent that they had a vet take care of their medical needs pregames

reaper eventually got rabies as well and him and lucy gray had a pretty long standoff to finish the games he wore the capitol flag as a cape",2023-11-17
"they included snow’s classmate getting bitten by the snake but cut the part where she started getting sick and growing scales

there was a black market in the capitol that was cut completely 

lucy grey’s band mates were barely in the movie despite being very important in the book

a lot of the actual mentoring was cut",2023-11-17
"the reaping happened really fast  they cut the damage that happened to clemencia after she got bit by the scales  they also cut the funerals for the capital kids who were killed in the bombing and in the zoo with the bodies of the tributes dragged behind

some tigress stuff",2023-11-18
they cut out a few pages of the characters churning butter i kid you not,2023-11-25
"the main 2 things are snow and lucy grays extreme charisma before the games and ma snow is constantly showboating and helping his classmates him and lucy before the games are always taking the cameras and playing it up hard because there are a few extra interviews and interactions between them in the book it builds up their romance a bit more hes so good that he convinces the rabies guys mentor to give up all her food after her tribute dies and manages to get lucy the guitar from a friend for her first interview in the movie he just seems to be some nobody at school when he was always the most interesting person in the room just like his tribute 

in the books sejanus is an even bigger pain in the  but snow is outwardly friendly towards him so hes stuck comforting the family when he goes into the arena this leads to being able to ask the mother ma for sweets and favors that he uses to bribe people like lucy gray at the beginning and the peacekeepers at the end it really sells his public friendship with sejanus up until he betrays him which impresses the capitol but really snow despises him 

i dont agree that clemmy needed more screentime after the snakes thing although the rainbow pus wouldve been cool to see the movie is too long as it is",2023-12-04
i dont get it why would tigris hate him she couldnt have known about coriolanus killing people in 12,2023-11-20
"something about the dress in the first movie makes me think when it catches fire it’s very similar to the colour patterns on lucy’s cinna must have had some insight either plutarch whispered in his ear or snow did i see the pattern of snow letting other people take credit for his work he plants the seed and watches it grow 

everything means something or none of it does",2023-11-20
" i really enjoyed reading your take on the central romance as portrayed in the movie and i think this is a good summary of the main themes and the opposing forces at work within the romance 

hey thanks a lot for the appreciation

 im pleased that you were able to get this much from just the movie version im assuming you havent read the book it shows that the film told its story successfully

yes i have not read the book although after the movie i am keen to and indeed the movie did its job well enough i feel

 slight quibble here sejanus was not really snows friend never mind a close one perhaps the movie didnt make that clear enough but i suppose he was from lucy grays and other peoples pov

yeah the movie did try to make it seem close snow risks his life to enter the arena and save sejanus they also seem to be bonding initially in their time in d12 but i guess you are right a guy like snow he wouldnt have any close friends now",2023-12-17
me personally i have it just under catching fire and about on par with the first hg i enjoyed it more than both mj movies,2023-11-20
"snow and lucy were also a perfect duo oncamera in the books they hammed it up every time they were on screen snow was supposed to be super charismatic and outwardly friendly towards everyone like the most interesting person in any room but he was just some guy in the movie 

we didnt need an extra hour of runtime for his internal monolog but they couldve showed us him looking for cameras or an audience before doing anything good the only reason he jumps in to try and help the girl who got stabbed at the zoo in the books is because he wants to be seen as the first person to help her on camera i feel like we were robbed of a really fun performance we shouldnt have needed darth vader music to tell you he was being evil i figured the movie wouldve actually benefitted from being able to show instead of tell unlike the book",2023-12-04
thank you,2023-11-17
lucy gray is literally a traveling performer rachel being overthetop at times like a broadway performer makes sense no,2023-11-23
i read the books and considered snow to be a sociopathnarcissist hes been told how good the snow family is all his life while dealing with running out of money which isnt really touched upon in the movie,2023-11-17
i have not read the books i guess i was more describing the snow in the original series i had more to say about this version of snow but i didnt want to go on too long basically i was just expecting snows superpower to be like he is so good at not considering rebels people that he understands what the games are and how they should run better than anyone because he cuts out all emotion this version of snow was more trying to  two birds hah with one stone he was exploiting them because he thought it would help them and also help him its just a long way to go from falling in love with a tribute to spending the next 60 years killing them off i thought hed start closer to that kind of sociopath you cant disagree with because theyre the smartest person in the room,2023-11-17
the people in these comments arguing that he was deciding nah he was slippery the whole time,2023-11-25
and he had many many opportunities to either run away from or stand up to the capitol and all it stands for and every time he had to choose it or someone else he chose it,2023-11-20
yes sorry lol,2023-12-29
yep i’m surprised people were so adamant it happened too fast snow was cold and calculating the whole film the only conflicting part is that as the audience seeing snows childhood context makes us or at least made me somewhat sympathize with him trying to regain power in order to help his family who is on the brink of eviction,2023-12-03
i see i thought the dean was ready to die lol and kinda acknowledged how  up the games is and felt guilty about his contribution to it then snow came in and the dean sees how this guy just became so much more powerful and he is gonna make the game even more despicable and there’s nothing that he can do about it so he committed suicide hahah how wrong i was lol,2023-11-26
ahhhh that all happened so quickly i think i mixed it up  thank you,2023-12-10
 you’re so right i to was confused and forgot he didn’t  the guy haha,2023-12-20
"yea i believe i saw all 4 and read the original trilogy although i did not read this new book

maybe it’s just fond memories but everything felt much more realistic and less just kinda obviously dumb in those jennifer lawrence was a legit top tier actress and not someone really forcing an cartoon sounding accent",2023-11-20
couldn’t have said it better myself,2023-12-09
"well yeah but in the original trilogy the hunger games themselves were incredibly entertaining and you were still on the edge of your seat wondering if both katniss and peeta would make it and what it would take for them both to survive their whole willtheywon’tthey relationship added an interesting layer too in tboss personally i didn’t feel the chemistry between the leads and the opponents were so overthetop  onedimensional that i never had any doubt lucy gray would win i get that the early hunger games were supposed to lack flair but man was it boring and then when they finished and you looked at the time and realized there was still an hour or so to go it felt kind of meaningless i don’t know it just didn’t hit the same 

i didn’t downvote you by the way dunno who did",2023-11-19
yes sejanus told snow the plot but didn’t snow literally come up to sejanus and ask what he was doing before telling him to stop sejanus wasn’t even trying to involve snow but snow kept being nosy trying to follow him and get information if he wanted to stay out of it he could have easily done so lol,2023-11-18
i get that but who would know that snow new about senajus except for snow himself and the only reason snow even knew anything is because he was going out of his way to be nosy and find out what senajus was doing because senajus was definitely trying to keep snow out of it it’s like snow went looking for trouble found it got mad that he found it so his resolution was to get the “trouble” killed for existing lol like snow literally could’ve just minded his business,2023-11-19
definitely a confusing character i was also really confused by why highbottom hated snow so much the ending reveal that highbottom actually hated and wanted to stop the games and his resentment towards snow because his father proposed the games felt so out of left field it was like in harry potter them trying to convince us that snape was a good guy and trying to help all along lol,2023-11-18
her singing with the  theatrical grin on her face to the cameras when she had the snakes all over her made me bust out aughing it was so cringe,2023-11-26
"ive seen comments calling it fantastic and im amazed at that tbh it was cringe at times and the low camera angle they chose for many scenes was jarring

also they escaped into the hole into another room but when jessup got rabid they literally just walked up and out of the hole",2023-12-28
the movie was going to have songs in it its literally in the title ballad also she didnt sing as much as she did in the book they took a lot of songs out,2023-11-18
"ok that’s the title but she get slapped by capital guards goes “just a minute boys” and then breaks out into song 

makes zero sense why would a capital guard use unnecessary force to keep someone in line and then let them sing a song 

the lucy actor was probably given singing time in her contract or something",2023-12-02
that doesnt mean that i enjoyed her singing they shouldve gone with someone else,2023-11-29
yeah i think you’re right and i was mistaken i just thought for some reason that they had mentioned sponsorships being a thing in previous games,2023-12-19
"interesting i like your take on that maybe after snow killed the mayor’s daughter is when she started losing feelings and thought of a way to escape after 

also the entire movie seems like her actions like her singing felt more rehearsed might be why years later the games are more performance based  being likeable as if she had already planned for it",2023-12-24
i enjoyed him i was just shocked no one was laughing in my theater ,2023-11-18
her accent didnt sound like that either than it sounds like a high school drama kid impersonating someone from the south east,2023-12-04
"i dont have an issue with him i just think he is not fit for this specific role the writers also did him wrong in the book there is so much more depth to him but in the movie he sounds and act like a simple decent guy 

peter dinklage owned it though",2023-11-20
yes but the dialogue pacing acting from the leads the trying to humanise a villan becuase he was betrayed by his lover made the whole thing absolutely boring and the plot never even helped us grasp why he was a villan either it felt like a waste of time,2023-11-20
wasn’t his voice in the recording which the whole town including lucy heard,2023-11-21
"rachel zegler played that scene very emotional and lucy gray in the books just silently figured out what the 3rd person is so it wouldnt provoke coryo for me that part of the scene was yelling lol

as for dr gaul i shouldve specified that she was portrayed as a psycho doing random psycho things because she was angry fe scene where she realeses the snakes in the books she was mysterious but never lost her cool like in the movies and always had hidden purpouse of doing certain things",2023-12-09
…she turns into a snake,2023-12-20
ah many thanks,2023-11-20
"okay that makes more sense thanks for the clarification

i liked the movie pretty well overall but it seemed apparent they were trying to do too much in too little time by then end",2023-12-09
theres another scene that confused me when that guy was hanging on a rock by his arms and rope and the girl mercy killed him with a knife slamming his neck im like  did she miss or intentionally not  him she cuts him down after the  shot yet 0 blood on him while hes descending but in reality hed be gushing after a hit that hard made me go from hes dead to oh i guess not to oh  he is dead,2024-01-17
he even looks down at his hands as he’s being pulled away and looks repulsed but it’s funny because there’s no blood on them,2023-11-29
that scene looked so unprofessional and cheap production wise i couldnt believe my eyes,2023-11-28
pg13 no blood,2023-11-18
ah yes we cannot downplay the severity of fictional events,2023-11-19
very curious about the insistence on blood from dead children it takes little to nothing away from the plot,2023-11-24
i was too busy wincing from every mutilation to notice the lack of blood so i really dont think not having it makes it any more suitable for,2024-01-14
yeah thats why i said not much of it  people are acting like the first movies were really bloody and they werent  there was a little but its not like blood was gushing out of every wound like it would have been in real life,2023-11-29
hey,2023-11-21
ive seen it and i liked it,2023-11-22
in the book she hides the whole time probably scared and having no idea what’s going on ,2023-11-27
it confused me tbh cause that’s exactly what i thought happened too right after it cut away i could have sworn there was a buzzer and the host saying “only x number left”,2023-11-25
more of a circus in the modern games expected to perform like trained animals,2023-11-20
"reading the book i felt the same way the first time  reading it a second time the third act is fantastic

id love another book with the first games that snow is the gamemaker for  maybe following one of the early career tributes",2024-03-25
lol great point “and let’s not forget my second flower buttercup it reminds me of a cat in many ways” ,2024-01-07
i think she just simply withheld the information until it could be used to gain,2023-11-22
i had a similar feeling either he was dead the whole time and she delayed news to fit her agenda better or she straight up pulled the plug to fulfill her narrative when needed,2023-11-25
but the game maker of the first movie is killed by the president,2023-11-25
this is the arena for the first ten games there was no gimmick they literally just threw 24 kids into the middle and made them fight it out gladiator style  lucy gray even points out there is nowhere to hide and snow counters that the explosions have opened up the walls and tunnels to contestants for the first time  before 10 the games got boring for the capital and were largely ignored in the districts after the reaping  the gamemakers recognize this which is why they got the older students to be mentorsa focus group  what would reignite interest in the games,2023-11-17
this is so true i can actually hear snows thought process when serjanus bought his way to be assigned in the 12,2023-11-17
he wasnt priveleged he was a kid he had a right to be fearful of death it doesnt make him lesser,2023-11-18
in the book spruce was already dead by the time of the execution but both sejanus and lil are both screaming i thought it was interesting to have sejanus be the only one visibly upset,2023-11-23
cant stop calling him vaganus,2023-11-25
i dont disagree but it is already a 25 hour movie,2023-11-18
they really skimmed over how coriolanus manipulated his way into the plinth scholarship they didn’t really touch on how scathing he was internally to sejanus and how he  up to his wealthy parents to be able to be the plinth heir,2023-11-19
now that you mention it putting that in the movie would have given more context to why they sponsored his tuition to the university at the end i was under the initial impression that they were blackmailed to sponsor snow because they just didnt seem to build the relationship between him and his parents for the audience all we saw of sejanus parents was them silently thanking snow for saving him in the arena,2023-11-19
yes what he did to that poor woman is vile,2023-11-18
idk i think it was his upbringing and his cozy silver spoon that didn’t prepare him for the reality outside the capitol i still think he was making an effort for change i don’t think it took away from his intentions at all,2023-11-17
he definitely wasn’t playing at activism  he was ready to be a martyr for the cause at every turn and was a key player in trying to break the rebel out of jail before he was discovered maybe the movie didn’t portray it as well but in the books he was born and raised in district two before his dad fell into a  ton of money during the war and moved them to the capitol,2023-11-19
" he despite his good intentions he was “play activism” when it got real he was inconsolable till the very end crying out for his mother

are we really gonna say that someone who died for his actions was a play activist just because he was terrified of death",2024-01-07
i think everyone would react differently you never know until its you could say we wouldnt react the way he did but until the noose is around our neck theres no way to know for sure at least sejanus had a conscience,2023-12-12
it isnt that play activism lots of people are scared yet still do good and risk their lives the screaming really shows the cruelness of their society than a reflection on himself from the movie he is portrayed as a regular person and not some elite who was taught to be scheming so he never directly utilized his familys power effectively and probably wouldnt be able to anyways,2023-12-21
and its the sounds of their loved ones screaming,2023-11-18
i can’t tell you how many times i’ve heard my mom say this during the pandemic and i’ve really grown to loathe this phrase but it rings loudly,2023-11-20
my personal belief is that the movie portrays snow learning to become the ideal machiavellian statesman and that statement is absolutely in line with that the person that rises to the top is above the law but no one else is,2023-12-05
i meanshould anything really be offlimits in a fight to the death  maybe the snakes but i think the drones and the rat poison was just being smart,2023-11-19
well i dont think the drones count as cheating but using their limitations in a good way,2023-11-20
oh right the poison the poison for lucy the poison chosen especially to  lucys opponents lucys poison that poison,2023-12-27
what does the hankerchief even do to the snake tank,2023-12-03
theres a really well done fan film of haymitchs hunger games and victory,2023-11-25
there’s mentions of it in the first or second book,2023-11-21
its detailed in a chapter in catching fire,2023-11-28
i burst out laughing at that my wife was not as amused as i was though,2024-01-03
theirs never got there since they left no tip,2024-01-01
doesn’t she have a line in mockingjay where she mentions that snow forced the surgeries onto her,2023-12-11
,2023-12-08
"yup it’s to show that you never know if snow would’ve actually killed lucy the point was she thought he would maybe not that day maybe not tomorrow

but she was a loose end that he could turn on at any point and she knew it she also knew that by staying with him she was entirely dependent on him not deciding to eliminate the loose end so in her mind she was safer by just running  presumably north as they were headed

the book and movie purposely leave it open if she survived it’s assumed she’s dead by the time katniss comes around for the 74th games or is in such deep hiding that she never is coming back

but it worked perfectly because snow was about control having control over others so they can’t betray you like most had done to him he couldn’t control lucy and she realized he’d try long before he realized she’d leave because of it

so in the end it’s the thing he loved the most that destroyed him",2023-11-18
"i think you have a really good point i definitely saw that as well however i saw lucy being authentic and true to herself in the movie she mentions that nothing is more important to her than trust not even love this sort of foreshadows everything that snow is about to do and ultimately betraying her trust she brings up living a peaceful life together with snow however  snow was hesitant and stated that he will always belong with the capitol 

once snow mentioned “killing three people” lucy immediately questioned him he played it off and im sure she saw right through him again she trust is above all else for her and it’s obvious there’s no trust between the two of them",2023-11-18
"i feel like both the book and movie didnt do a good enough job showing that everything snow had ever done had been for himself lucy gray realized that and left because she knew snow murdering her would have been the best thing for him

i think small differences in the movie could have made a big difference for example after all the tributes had been killed by the snakes snow immediately declaring himself the winning and cheering for himself would have much better highlighted his sociopathy and that he only cared about himself i feel like it was also a mistake to show him feeling remorse over the getting senjanus plinth executed sociopaths can fake empathy or love but as soon as its not beneficial for them anymore they would stop faking it two relatively small changes that i think would have dramatically changed how viewers perceived snow",2023-11-17
"i don’t think lucy was simply “catering” to snow as she seemed genuinely happy when she first saw him in district twelve i just think her attraction to him was almost a mix of stockholm syndrome and suspension bridge effect she was under a lot of stress during the hunger games and he ended up being a source of support for her despite him being a capital citizen of course i agree that she was probably just trying to use him as much as he was using her in the beginning but that definitely changed by the end i think the feelings she developed for him were real and vice versa just that as she finally was able to return to her normal life and calm down she began to see the red flags that hadn’t been obvious before his duplicity and quickness to resort to violence was useful and even endearing to her when she was in a constant state of “fight for my life” but it eventually became clear that this wasn’t just a product of the situation they were in but who he was

but otherwise i think you’re spot on",2023-11-25
i love that the snake was under the scarf like a trap that had been laid all along also i read it but i could be wrong in saying that he didnt actually imagine shooting her in the book i truly believe if shed stayed with him hed get tired of her quirks and get rid of her,2023-11-19
she was a romantic he wasnt he was about the job and glory she was right to run as it wasnt looking to be good with the two game makers looking to make their own moves their relationship was pretty much doomed,2023-11-22
the book is even more ambiguous about whether lucy set the snake as a trap or not by that point in the book coriolanus realizes that lucy grey is the only thing still linking him to the murders and he begins to convince himself of how harmfuldeadly she really is as a way to justify killing her he tells himself that she killed people in the arena and that she has been an evil killer this whole time he interprets the snake as a trap that she deliberately set for him but when he goes into town to get the snake bite treated he’s told that snakes tend to come out after it rains possibly suggesting that the snake was really just a coincidence and that coriolanus might have been paranoid,2023-11-28
"as someone who just read the book yesterday and watched the movie today youre missing a key point she discusses earlier trust is key trust is more important to her than love

he has done questionable things but hes a good person in her eyes she can trust him because those things were out of desperation and out of love however he lies to her she sees right through it and its not a  lie she figures out the only person he could have possibly killed was sejanus his best friend his brother and lied to her about it breaking her trust

so now she starts seeing him for what he is and shes pretty guarded she still loves him the snake not being venomous could go either love or that shes not really a killer at heart but she cant trust him and as she says if she cant trust someone shell dissappear from their life as if they were dead",2023-11-22
"a detail i liked was when he meets her for the first time alone in 12 and goes to kiss her she hesitates again and he says youre safe with me but his hands are literally around her throat she definitely used and feared him the whole time even if there was feeling

and so what if there was i dont blame her for being attached to the only support she had during a horrible time but she was too smart to be all in",2023-11-27
i havent read the books either so thank you for that explanation but i had another question why the sudden change in the first place like that response by lucy except me when snow said there are no loose ends was so passive aggressive and accusatory if she didnt make that comment there would be no tension afterwards no so why the sudden change in her character,2023-11-17
"this is the only thing i dont like about the scene in the movie that he decides against it 

in the book it was pretty clear to me that he had made up his mind to  her basically from the moment he saw the guns he lies to himself internally because hes a narcissist and needs to justify his actions but everything he does supports that he was going to  her it shows that he never loved her and everything he has ever done has ultimately been for himself

i love this because it shows how good narcissists are at deceiving themselves and others that they are a good person but in the end they will do what is best for them and them only despite our better judgment as readers we rooted for coriolanus and the book flips that on its head at the end and shows how you were deceived reminding you that this is the same man katniss fought in the og trilogy",2023-11-29
"ah that also connects to when she asks who the third person he killed was and snow says his old self and then we see her reaction to that

even if she really did love him he is no longer the same and she realizes what he has become  he has become mad 

this may be grasping at straws but when he asks his cousin i dont know her name ive never really watched the series she says he looks just like his father earlier in the movie she says his father always had hate in his eyes if she is saying he looks like his father the new hatred in his eyes is probably what caused that",2023-12-10
but if she never loved him why tell him shes running away and wait for him to join her why not just run away to the cabin and never show him it,2023-11-19
im a little confused why snow would  the mayors daughter if he was gonna rat on sejanus anyway,2023-11-19
"also she probably put it together earlier when she asked him who the third person he killed was that he had sold out his friend that was probably already changing her opinion of him and she slowly realized more and more that he might be dangerous culminating in the scene in the cabin where she tested him a little bit and saw in his eyes that there was a chance he might  her to serve his own interests

personally i didn’t feel like snow could have actually gone through with killing her at that point they could have made him a little more ruthless to make it feel like he might actually do it but i think that’s what they were going for",2023-12-15
"three is enough for me

  
thats when lucy knew the snow she loved was gone",2023-12-23
"im sorry to drop in here late but the snaketrap is still confusing me was it meant to  him or was it just meant to delay him did the snakebite turn him crazy in that scene or was it the chaos caused by his actions that got back to him 


also why is she still there in the woods if she decided to run off after she left he had time to drop of the weapons and she didnt get further what is that saying was she really 100 sure in her decision if she stayed that close by 


or maybe the snakebite made him crazy and lucy wasnt even there when he shoot but this still confuses me like ",2024-03-06
read the  book,2023-11-26
yeah thank you he wasn’t gonna  her until she betrays him,2023-11-25
this is pretty much how my wife saw this part of the movie she had to explain it to me lol,2023-11-20
"why would he  her  why would  so concerned about being found out werent there 2 other witnesses to his shooting the mayors daughter  

hes risked everything to escape the base and flee north with her couldnt he have killed her at any time before that if he actually is evil contrary to all evidence   he was escaping with her why did he care who knows what he diddidnt do since he was now outside of panems grasp no  

i thought that she planted the guns there but couldnt figure out why

also i didnt understand why he purposely betrayed his friend with the recorded mockingjay that recording was just for the mockingjay rit presumably he threw away the recorder bc it wasnt useful after hed programmed the mockingjay so why did he betray his best friend that was the only way to stop him  why didnt he  his friend if hes a sociopath why  him so circuitously by planting that evidence so he was bad even back then",2023-12-21
"as someone who never read the book i got the opposite effect watching it 

i felt like snow was the one who pulled away during that first time they were going to kiss also i never thought he wanted to  her at all in the cabin he came off as more surprised of  why would you even think something like that i love you never even crossed his mind 

he then goes to fish and the woman he loves leaves his moms special item and has a snake under it to bite him

so to me as someone who never read the book it came off as she was the one in the wrong  in terms of the relationship between them  and i understood why he felt betrayed he was about to give up everything for her 

again the book might have touched on this and made more sense but i never read it just how it comes off as someone watching the movie 

also why would she be worried he killed his best friend i didnt sense anything in the movie to make her remotely think about that scenario

thanks",2024-01-31
he didnt  lucy gray,2023-11-26
she really hit hard for me as someone who has workers with downs syndrome children and adults,2023-11-18
youd think even the capitol civilians would be like alright thats a bit much,2023-11-18
i was so grateful they found a way for her to die without actually having to see,2023-11-18
also didnt they  that kid twice i swear that one group ran after her earlier in the film and then she appeared again later,2023-11-18
don’t forget that by the time the original movie takes place some of the districts are in the business of sending “career tributes” who train their whole lives to volunteer for the hunger games at 17 so you have to account for that the winner’s districts get food and other rewards for their winning so there’s incentive to send the best,2023-11-21
i knew they wouldnt shoot a violent death scene with her,2023-12-04
it was really sad especially seeing her wandering around the arena throughout the games i will say that i burst out laughing at the way the snakes slammed into her something about the animation felt impulsively slapstick to me,2023-11-23
"for sure knowing now that they can be rigged like with lucy gray the sick and the disabled would be the first to go or people who don’t conform 

i think they said reaper killed a peacekeeper",2023-12-03
i think you are right they even mention some of these tributes were 2 when the war happen sejanus argues how is it ethical to punish people who were children during the war,2023-12-31
"i wouldnt be surprised if the games timeline for the press tour was extended just a little bit each games this movie really made it feel like it was only a handful of days from the reaping to the victor it was clear that the games had never gone on for longer than an afternoon for the first nine and given that the arena appear to just be thunderdome but bigger it makes sense  

by the time of katnisss era each pair of tributes is collected by their own train has teams of stylists and coaches and extensive interviews not to mention the size of the arenas become enourmous with the games makers having complete control of the environment",2023-11-21
they were literally kept in a zoo to your point,2023-11-20
except for lucy gray who was perfectly clean until literal bombs were going off around her,2023-12-05
"it absolutely was not it was certainly tamed down compared to the books and what it could have been but they had characters bleed when they got stabbed 

this film had a girl bleed out from a bottle to the neck without a single drop of blood",2023-11-23
"you can care for other people or think you do yet still rationalize selfish behavior that hurts those same people

arent most people guilty of that though to varying degrees

i guess im just really over the trend of armchair diagnosing loads of peoplecharacters with sociopathypsychopathy on the internet

unadulterated means complete and pure so snow being an unadulterated sociopath would suggest that he has no capacity for empathy or love and is the worst kind of sociopath who could exist which just isnt true

its pretty clear to me that the story suzanne collins was telling was how snows traumatic experiencescircumstances at a formative age alongside some poor choices shaped him to become who he was yes his innate traits play a part but things could have turned out differently for him  especially if he wasnt essentially a piece in dr gauls games",2023-11-18
katniss mentions in the first book that hes been hosting for over 40 years magic capitol age reversal maybe,2023-11-19
"as you were meant to be

 and in 12 it looks like that low pressure front is moving through

brief pause as two children brutally  one another

  bringing with some much needed rain  moving on",2024-04-04
lady in front of me gasped at this,2023-11-26
"this is why id say hes a narcissist rather than a sociopath hes capable of feeling for others but not at the expense of himself or his desires i think this is more obvious in the book especially because i think in it its clear he was 100 going to  lucy gray after he found the guns unlike in the movie where it appears he considers it but ultimately rejects the idea until the snake trap

in the book he went with her because he thought he had no other choice but as soon as he finds the guns and realizes all he has to do is  her and he can get what he always wanted he turns on her",2023-11-29
i think he cared more about his familys name and status than he actually cared about them  any people he cared about were usually ones who could help him in some way and so thats why he took an interest in them  im not even sure if hes capable of truly unselfish love  i love that its kind of ambiguous though  the book was the same way and i appreciate that,2023-11-18
the comparison between anakin and snow really got me thinking its pretty parallel throughout the first two parts of the movie both grew up poor felt outcasted by their background formed an overachieving mindset that made them isolated get denied higher achievement master rank money for school start to break away from traditional values to save girl  for the first time not really for anakin but had the same effect descend further into madness  best friend and try and  lover anakin actually does but disappearance similar enough go full bad and become pupil to bad guy its not too far fetched to say snows story was lightly inspired by the anakins or maybe thats just the usual good to bad pipeline,2023-12-06
this i particularly like your vader reference it gave a weighted sadness to all his actions knowing he would become the villain,2023-11-20
agreed and modern psychology has it wrong when they teach that you cant become a sociopath many people do there is a growing and progression of evil inside all of us if we are not careful,2024-01-01
wait really im about to start the book right now,2023-11-19
i prefer to think that it was his last shed of morality before the final descent into the snow we know,2023-11-18
yeah i see differently it shows that he was doing whatever he could to survive and he was willing to throw anyone under the bus this happens a lot in real life with normal everyday people you make the call not everyone is able to make those correct calls but he did do everything in his power to try and persuade his friend not to do this and but because it threatened him directly he did something about it,2023-11-19
"looking at the rest of his actions

tbf in the begging he was still volunteering to let his grandma eat his only food also trying desperately to save the girls live that was stabbed with a bottle",2024-03-15
yeah director cut would be nice and would likely fix some people pacing issues though i thought what they included in the theatrical cut was pretty good and dance sense as general audiences can’t sit for a 3 hour plus film,2023-11-29
at no point in my comment did i argue that you said mockingjay should’ve been two parts,2023-11-18
different people have different opinions,2023-12-20
"yeah these too i love how the movie while a fictional story seems to draw so many parallels with real life difference in cultures and social classes and it does so without being too preachy or on the nose

for example one could be from the middle east and the other is born in or immigrated to a western country and they fall in love and one of them acts as if himher being the one in the western country means the other person has to be all over them because they have the “best standard of living” that the other person “must aspire to” and should be “grateful” for 

i also love how snow began to not only genuinely love her but he was also questioning the idea that she’d have real feelings for him when he asked “is this real” and it makes sense he’s a mentor who’s making her popular why wouldn’t she pretend to care for him but then she saved his life and he loved her more but eventually he’s at this crossroads where he’s stuck between “she has to love me because i’m the best option she’ll ever get and i have to be her hero and savior” without considering the possibility that she might not want what he has to offer vs “well yeah maybe she loves me and i love her genuinely but how will i reconcile my love life with my standards of living and life goals”

i just love this movie",2023-11-18
"look at the conversation where he talks about bringing her to the capitol with him snow seems genuinely confused and surprised at lg not wanting to do so and not sharing his views of the capitol being the only civilised place

i didnt understand in that way if we think about it he grew up in the capitol and consumed a lot of propaganda about how the capitol was the peak of civilization while the districts were a bunch of savages he doesnt really understood why someone would choose to live in a poor grey place while they have the choice to live in somewhere better",2023-12-15
i wouldnt even say he acted truly ruthless if he truly was ruthless he would have shot lucy in the cabin but he didnt it was only after he fell into her trap and felt like she betrayed him that he just lost it,2023-11-18
"yeah exactly i’m surprised how many people immediately attach that label to any villain just because someone is a villain doesn’t mean they’re the way they are because of mental illness some people just have terrible moral codes to live by they still have empathy and love for those they deem “their own” but that doesn’t justify it

they aren’t incapable of feeling emotion and empathy they’re just selective of whom to give it to because their own selfish interests or moral codedogma is above all",2023-11-18
yeah that would refute part of the point of the movie if he was born bad lucy grey made the point that we turn to the dark side because of choices,2023-11-23
yeah there were numerous people he seemed to genuinely care for idk how some people apparently walked away from the movie thinking he was a stonecold manipulator who was faking all of his relationships in pursuit of his own goals or whatever,2023-12-15
much appreciated my friend,2023-11-25
you’re most certainly welcome glad to hear ,2023-12-17
"that’s because it wasn’t just descent from going into the games or falling in love and being heartbroken from lucy gray but rather the ingrained teachings of being in the capitol he was born and raised there his parents both died in the dark days a rebellion of the districts which capitol propaganda knew  well how to brainwash everyone to see as evil

his family’s wealth and power all went away because of that and he grew up trying to earn any opportunity to take that power and wealth back of course he isn’t gonna look at the districts with respect he views them as instruments for his success",2023-12-13
thank you ,2023-12-25
"but feeling like he did what he had to in order to survive

to some extent that is the truth not killing highbottom though that was just cold revenge by that point hes truly crossed over to the dark side",2023-11-18
"yeah i havent read the book yet i have a big backlog of novels to go through but the movie was great if a narrative can you make you feel empathy for the villain then it did something right as not everything is black and white snow betrayed everybody in order to provide support for his family if he didnt betray sejanus he wouldve been hanged just the same 

sejanuss wealth and status didnt prevent his demise so what chance did snow have just being associated with him as much as snow might like some parts of district 12 the capitol is the only home hes really ever known allowing a rebellion against his home would be betraying his family which was a line he just could not cross its possible that had snow spent the entire 20 years in district 12 he mightve found humility and care for the people in all the districts but he chose to isolate himself within the capitol away from the peasants",2023-11-18
yea the payoffs of the ending are a lot dirtier with added context from snow more compelling imho,2023-11-17
yes this i never read the book but the reviews i read of people who did makes it seem like snow was this awful awful which yes the movie translates to a certain degree person but i felt like his actions were validjustified like if i was put in his place i would do the same if i had read the book i would def feel differently though,2023-11-29
see i felt like the people around him did see it from the beginning  at least gaul and highbottom did  gaul tries to nurture his sociopathy and highbottom tries to bring him down so he cant hurt people,2023-11-18
wasn’t this originally meant to be a tv series,2023-11-29
sejanuss mother,2023-11-25
tbf snow literally talks about how strong the poison is when we are first introduced to it and this movie isnt based irl even the fastest killing poison we have could  in minutes cyanide,2023-12-24
"i also like the difference between he and caesar  who is presumably his son based on the dinner reservation with a high chair easter egg

caesar has a huge personality and while very vain about his appearance does seem to actually want to help the tributes get sponsors unlike lucky who sees the participants as lesser humans who can be discarded for the capitol’s entertainment

by the 74th games when katniss and peeta won the games were more about a spectacle than punishment spending all that money on banquets parties stylists etc was the evolution of the games from punishment for rebellion to “a pageant of honor and sacrifice”

if you only knew that growing up and weren’t alive during the dark days you’d never know that the games used to be dump 24 district kids in a zoo until it was time to fight then throw them in an arena with no food source and tell them to make it quick now it’s a huge event that engulfs capitol for weeks so you need a big personality host to run it  hence caesar

but lucky doesn’t even see the tributes as people whereas caesar takes his time and asks them questions to show their best selves so they can get help in the arena when rue says not to count her out caesar responds in a caring and genuine tone he “wouldn’t in a million years” lucky would make some awkward socially oblivious comment about how young and small she was",2023-11-20
ohh honestly not too familiar with the hunger games franchise i’m a casual i only watched the movies i didn’t read anything,2023-12-04
yeah that was so far from appalachian accent lol maybe alabama a weird texas not appalachian,2023-12-14
my brother and i were cackling at the accent especially when none of the other district 12 people in the older movies had deep southern accents,2024-02-23
i come from those roots and the banjo aspect and some of the songs resonate the ones that are older and not bluegrass but the dancing was far too ballroom and the display was like a mix of the sound of music and cold mountain meh they could’ve brought flat footing into it at least,2023-11-19
"wait the hunger games series is set in the us
edit please stop replying to me enough people have already",2023-11-19
but then the mayors daughter had a drawl and no one else did and by the time katniss and peeta are born some 50 years later nobody has the drawl either it was odd,2023-11-19
rachel is a better actress and singer imo no shade to hudgens though,2023-11-18
i had to deal with the audio book singing was terrible in that,2023-11-17
"oh the singing in the audio book  so bad   

i loved her performances  they did such a good job with the folksy songwriting",2023-11-18
i always imagined her with a country bumpkin type voice glad the movies fixed that for me,2023-11-18
yeah i really disliked reading all the song lyrics in the books,2023-11-19
i literally skipped all the song lyrics in the book i actually really liked the songs in the movie i thought i would really not like them for some reason maybe bc i was so over them in the books,2023-11-25
lucy gray has a similar energy in the book she is a performer and puts on a show for both snow at least to begin with and the capitol audience,2023-11-19
i thought her character was acting too though  like she was good at playing and kind of flirting with the crowd  so i think it worked,2023-11-19
couldnt agree more it like a stage audition for eponine in les mis,2023-12-29
yes agreed i enjoy watching musicals and plays and i totally agree you over exaggerate on stage but on camera unless it’s supposed to be a musical it’s just not the same smh,2023-12-01
i cringed everytime she broke out into a song im not sure if its the film direction or if its just her presence but it was almost unbearable to watch her sing and they made it a focus at least 5 times in the movie  i read the book but i skipped over those songs because they dont do anything for me lucy gray in the book was sooooo much more charming than the movie unfortunately,2023-11-22
lucy gray and katniss are very different personalities lucy gray is a people person and katniss is very much not one  lucy gray has been making her living and surviving by charming others since she was a young girl,2023-11-19
the book was just as rushed yeah youre not given much of a reason to care about snow or lucy gray at all in the book nor believe their relationship is ever real given how clear it is from the start that snow is extremely selfish at all times,2024-02-17
great point our first introduction was so over the top with lucy grabbing the microphone and belting lyrics it just didnt land for me im not into musicals but i loved her presence in the book though i cant pin why any singing just didnt work for me ,2023-11-22
that’s a choice from the books  she’s an entertainer and is constantly shown to be putting on a show for the cameras for people at the zoo etc it also serves to make coryo doubt her feelings  does she really like him or is it just another act,2023-11-19
lucy gray is a performer through and through both on and off the stage,2023-11-19
she fell a little hard into theater acting at times which didnt work with closeups,2023-11-18
yeah… i didn’t feel anything for her she was honestly kinda boring as a character very tropey,2023-11-28
guy who played snow carried that movie with his acting for sure,2023-11-28
dont get me wrong rachel has an amazing voice and i love musicalssinging in movies a star is born la la land mamma mia greatest showman etc i get that her role in the book is this way but to me on camera it just felt so out of place i feel like on stage her mannerisms  expressions and theatrics wouldve worked so well but for whatever reason in the film it just felt weird to me i know i am in the minority of the fanbase tho,2023-12-06
i knew nothing about her until afterwards i went with a big group where about half of us didn’t know who she was and all just weren’t huge fans of her in the film i feel like everyone is saying negative critics are just biased because they don’t like rachel personally but it could just actually be because they didn’t like her performance in the film,2023-11-22
i knew about her controversy but accepted her opinion i just dont think she was the right role maybe singing in movies is just jarring to me and i wanted to like rachel i think lucy gray is so charming in the books with her interactions with capitol children but something in this movie felt off for me unfortunately maybe it was too much of a focus on musical performance which happened at least 5 times,2023-11-22
i feel like if the director had an issue with it they have the final say,2023-11-18
its my favourite of his plays so when i first read the hunger games i was pleasantly surprised to see it referenced to see the prequel playing with shakespeares plot beats was even better,2023-11-26
"you know it wasnt sarcasm but you kind of have a point shes just a game maker shes not like in charge of the government though but she is in charge of like a department within the government so youre right yo what the  

you know were going to just say that with sarcasm and im just going to move on but that is hilarious i cannot believe she still hasnt left her role but she killed it in this one i love her and all her movies but she really killed this one",2023-11-19
i just wish wed gotten another fifteen minutes in the first part  we needed a little more of the reaping and introduction to the tributes,2023-11-18
"yeah the books have her hide the snakes in her dress i believe and then sic them on people 

x200b

then it just ends and im like wha",2023-12-24
this isn’t christina vs britt calm down,2023-11-19
" lucy’s grandaughter 

i’ve heard this theory before but it’s really never been plausible to me lol we would’ve known if lucy gray  snow ever slept together for that happen or even if she did with someone else it’s likely she never came back to 12 too dangerous for her",2023-11-18
i actually think its more likely that katniss is lucys cousin maudes granddaughter due to maude loving katniss plants so much and this theory is backed up by katniss dad being a singer and knowing about the lake and cabin,2023-11-28
its the one before that  he was at two hangings,2023-11-19
she writes it about the first hanging  the one where the accused is said to have murdered 3 but denies it and where his lovewife is distraught saying hes innocent,2023-11-26
how so,2023-11-19
blonde wavy hair and blue eyesbut ok,2023-12-01
"yeah i think at first hes like wow shes really smart for doing that because shes just like me find an exploit in order to survive but he also realizes what he became and how he took over and basically became president of panam by doing an acting the way shes acting and with her being this face of the rebel army he has to do something in order to stop her but instead of just outright trying to  her he decides to try and manipulate her into seeing the way that and things that he saw and by leveraging the people around her to try and get her to not be a rebel

but if you was truly a sociopath and he was truly cutthroat and he didnt have any feelings for her and didnt have any kind of empathy towards her situation i feel like he would have just went out and killed her family or did something to her that would truly point the message that she needs to stop in line in order for people not to go into unrest or just take her out of the picture and bury her under the next years tributes

yeah she could have been a martyr but theres smart ways to do this to where she wouldnt be a martyr and snow seems like a very cunning person so my only conclusion is that he felt some sort of empathy for her and her situation and she reminded him of people hes known in his past and he took it easy on her instead of doing it the easier way that is the exploit which allows some random girl to become the face of an entire evolution and literally be the one who helps bring down a century old dictatorship essentially",2023-11-19
it was also like loud loud it spooked me ngl,2023-11-18
well said,2023-11-19
related could mean grandchild or great grandchild too but either way i’m glad they didn’t do that franchises don’t need to all be about one family and the bad guy doesn’t always have to be related to the main character,2023-12-08
yes katniss was in the 74th and 75th quarter quell games,2023-11-26
when is this implied in the books i havent read ballad but i dont recall it from the original series,2023-11-26
yeah i know,2023-11-24
ah didn’t even notice that  amazing,2023-11-25
"i expected there to be songs but not sooo many  songs going on for so long and weirdly despite the fact that rachel zegler is such a good singer i preferred jennifer lawrences singing over hers because when katniss did it it felt real and emotional rather than theatrical and overwrought 

by the third lucy gray performance i was like okay yall are clearly trying to sell a soundtrack here and im not buying it",2024-01-28
agree the line between him trying to get outrebel vs couldnt live with himself was very thin,2023-11-17
i do not think that after going in to honor marcus’s body that he cared about getting out alive he had no friends at all being from district 2 snow was his “friend” but that was mostly one sided…,2023-11-17
he acted suicidal multiple times starting with going into the arena  he did that because he wanted to die  then he didnt care about being careful in 12 because he didnt care if he did die he wanted to leave but he would rather be dead than staying in his position,2023-11-18
"yeah even if his intentions were good he was way too reckless and even inconsiderate of how his actions would affect other ppl 

obviously i won’t go to the wall sympathizing with snow since snow has him killed but sejanus was definitely not being a good friend when he started joining up with the rebels snow specifically explained why that would put him in danger too and lo and behold it ends up putting snow in danger up until that point sejanus was pretty likeable because he’s just  but he’s not bad at all he ultimately stands against the capital but he’s just way too dumb to understand how to fight back in an effective way",2023-12-03
"interesting write up and some great points i definitely can see what you mean by him being innocent incarnate rather than actively a hypocrite 

they sorta touch on the point in the movie when he starts colluding with the rebels snow confronts him and states that if he’s caught snow will hang but sejanus can just call his dad for a bail out like he always does his heart is in the right place but he can’t change his place of privilege

hope you don’t mind the spoiler but yes they do the same in the movie he professes his intention to become a medic to “make a difference” and becomes quickly dissatisfied when he’s stuck as infantry then seeking out the rebels",2023-11-17
really nice analysis,2023-12-20
i think it was on purpose she used that accent in her performances to get people to relate to and vibe with her she wanted to come across as relatable but when  hit the fan she drops it throughout different sections of the movie,2023-11-21
i read the book but still kept hearing sir janus hahaha,2023-11-17
"that was the real name of the roman leader of praetorian guard lucius sejanus who later betrayed his emperor tiberius caesar but was exposed and killed

that’s the only time i have heard the name other than the real history first in i  claudius but i knew it would end badly for him as soon as i heard the name

the real historical figure lived in almost the exact same time as jesus christ as well",2023-11-19
seriously why do we need two names that end with “”,2023-12-20
"sejanus is a roman name like at least half in the film sejanus was famous pretorian prefect who practically ruled rome when emperor tiberius in his old age chose to hang out in capri sejanus also had an affair with widow of tiberius’s son maybe even while the son drusus was alive she was also a member of the julioclaudian dynasty 

sejanus became very close to becoming emperor potentially himself but tiberius got rid of him quite elegantly in the end by a letter to the senate tiberius was succeed by his grandnewphew caligula however caligula also killed tiberius’s grandson who was meant to rule with him",2023-12-20
okay thank  im not thr only one lol,2023-11-19
yes it is but considering they showed it on his locker as you say i dont see how you can misspell it ,2023-11-17
its not a 180 snow is a pos in the books,2023-11-17
i agree  the third part of the book felt like it dragged until the last few chapters  then someone slammed the gas pedal down and i was left wondering what just happened  i was actually kind of glad they sped up the third act in the book for a bit,2023-11-18
how is it 180 we see snow act in self interest every step of the way it’s just that in the first half of the movie his self interests align with lucy’s,2023-12-25
"copying this from my other comment

there was a much much stronger case for splitting mockingjay into two than there was for this movie that book was an actionpacked finale with a lot of stuff outside katniss’s pov to expand on this book is a lowkey oneoff character study with fairly relaxed pacing not building to any particular big climax there’s also zero good place to split the story anyway

i know in my bones that if they did split ballad in two this sub would’ve hated it and complained it wasn’t necessary",2023-11-19
i rewatched them all with my partner before going to this movie last night and i forgot why i didnt like these movies so much the first 15 hours of mockingjay part i is just them going out and shooting propaganda films like 4 times so much couldve been condensed in part i  part ii,2023-11-18
zip it,2023-11-25
no i was agreeing with you i think i just worded it badly what i mean is from a childs perspective and i was a child when the first one came out and i saw it in the cinema the blood didnt make it that more scary the scariest death i remember was glimmers and that had no blood if they dont include blood as to not make it as scary from a childs perspective then imo it makes little difference it just makes it less immersive and realistic from a more mature audience perspective also i dont understand why they cut the blood out anyway as the first film definitely had blood in the arena,2023-11-20
the other rebel shot billy,2023-12-16
"all the words he uses for lucy gray are incredibly possessive he views her as belonging to him from the moment she is assigned to him he does care for his grandmother and tigris but he is incredibly dismissive of every single one of his classmates the moment they aren’t useful to him he acts like he’s worried about clemencia but also avoids checking in on her and pretends she doesn’t exist basically and worries more about how it will blowback on him than he does about her 

he’s very selfish and narcissistic throughout the book",2023-11-17
"he loves his family but foremost as an idea not to say he hates his grandmothercousin but when his cousin implies she had to  for food he is disgusted he also seems to have tossed her aside by the time of the main series 

he clearly cares for lucy gray

hes pretty incelish with her and it started as a way to help himself also its implied she used him as well 

he genuinely worries for clemensia after shes bitten by snakes

he never visits her or informs anyone about it or tells her parents he cares in the same way people were posting black squares a few years ago",2023-11-17
"i feel very surprised by how many people say snow turning into a villan was out of nowhere

the first scene of the movie it was him and his sister running through a battlefield to find some food and seeing a man commit cannibalism he then arrives at home to finds out his father was killed by a person from the district those who are said to have started the war

he then goes to college having to hide the fact his family is bankrupt otherwise he wouldnt be accept in his social circle

and when he finally have the chance to turn his life around he gets  and sent to be a anonymous peacekeeper in the district oh and he also is betrayed by the person who he helped and fell in love

the sense of me before everyone the hatred for the district people the way he only make good actions if they reward him its all there since the beginning even when he snitched his friend he did it because that rebel plan would give no benefit for him 

this movie had one of the best character studies i have ever seen",2023-12-15
big agree i thought it was perfectly shown the conflict,2023-11-20
"i agree that in the book he does display a wide range of emotions and does have a believable internal world my issue was that the entire time including after finishing i physically refused to believe that this man was snow 

by the end he was still an idiot had little to no charm or people skills and spent most of the time internally whining about his lot in life i just dont believe that this idiot suddenly at some point in his life becomes a completely different person capable of becoming the snow in the original trilogy",2023-11-23
"he masterfully manipulates everyone he comes into contact with he only does things for his gain in the book you get to hear how the reason he comforted his dying classmate was to look good for the camerashad he never been banished for cheating he wouldn’t have ever gone to 12 to be with lucy gray maybe he would have found a way to bring her to him but it probably would’ve been against her will and she’d be unhappy in which he’d promptly dispose of her 

he was going to leave for 2 without ever mentioning it to lucy gray the second he had a chance to get close to the capital he was going to take it


plus goodbye lucy gray we hardly knew you” is not what someone says about someone they truly loved

he loved her for what she could provide to him and what she represented the fact that he contemplates breaking it off with her when he has to walk to the far side of town on a hot day to see her shows he isn’t actually in love with her

he is very good at justifying his dark nature in his head but lucy gray had done nothing to indicate she was gong to attack him she was literally hiding he could’ve walked away right there but he hunted her down he even found the irony of them having their own private hunger games funny if lucy gray has stayed in the lake house and not clocked on to what he was thinking he would’ve shot her point blank in the head before she had a chance to move",2023-11-28
"  snows characterisation is wonderfully nuanced  

in the book  

in the movie its pretty monotone as the hero the honest trustworthy good guy  then he does a 180 becomes jack nicholson in the shining  thats cheap and dishonest scriptwriting",2023-12-21
"sociopaths can have emotions theyre just not generally in relation to other people fear regret doubt etc are all perfectly normal for someone antisocial personality disorder which is the actual mental health disorder sociopaths and psychopaths both fall into they can also exhibit signs of outward facing emotion when the would benefit that person they can even believe they have those emotions themselves for example snow could believe he loves lucy gray because expressing that emotion makes it easier to manipulate and use her but as soon as that emotion isnt beneficial to oneself anymore that emotion would be gone because it was never real 

i always took his reaction to clemensia to be based on shock and fear and his remorse for killing the tribute to be for show to manipulate others

id argue times when snow doesnt do this for example when he tries to convince dr gaul to save lucy gray after he had already won or when he cries after he gets plinth executed are flaws with the story rather showing snows actual character",2023-11-17
plus the way he treated tigris,2023-12-02
great explanation that was definitely the part of the book that i missed snows inner monologue the most,2023-11-17
"wow this explains a lot i couldnt understand thanks

even if the studio would have brought martin scorsese to direct this it would be very very difficult to do justice to the second paragraph of your explanation narration could have been used to fill in the blanks but it would have felt like it was being spoonfed to the audience i dont think there was a right answer to translate it to screen properly and the actual result is the best they could do",2023-11-18
"this is really great explanation 

i think if the director flash backing snow’s experiences and what he really thinks of things around him the last time he was asked what’s the game for him it would make his characteristic easier for audiences to understand",2023-11-17
"i do think all of this ís in the movie just through  expressions and stuff as someone who read the book i knew what to look for so i feel like i was able to see all the thoughts going through his head i think there are a lot of subtleties in the movie that would be fun to discover for people whove read the book or people who are rewatching the movie like with fight club when you rewatch it you notice the clues 

for example when sejanus asks him why he was send to 12 he didnt tell him about the poison but did about the snakes which makes him look good which is obviously a specific choice during the whole movie hes lying and telling only the specific things he knows will have people like him",2023-11-20
this is a great explanation the movie definitely fell short im explaining his motives thank you,2023-11-17
"yeah i think the origin of that is what he saw trying to survive in the capital right whenever he found out his dad dies he saw people eating other people doing he had to eat from the trash and at that point i think in his little child like mine he realized its all about him and himself and no one else except for maybe his cousin that was with him

hes definitely a narcissist like in and out and everything he does is for him",2023-11-19
in the books does one of the shots hit lucy,2023-11-20
fully agree people do things without thinking them through or being entirely consistent it’s honestly so nice to see a character who fully embodies that reality,2023-11-26
he never offered it was when she offered to run away,2023-11-19
"but it wasnt realistic at all someone else in the thread said it already she acts like shes in broadway clearly playing a part instead of actually acting like how people would react in certain situations 

i didnt know that there was a hate train for her haha i looked up the reasons for why she is hated and they all sound a bit ridiculous to me i just dont think she can act",2023-11-20
i think if he didn’t drop that he is responsible for sejanus dying she would have been fine it was the straw that broke the camels back,2023-11-19
"because with the guns still missing he was afraid of being caught  he even told her this that he had no choice but to run now as the guns could appear at any time while he did love her and did want to run away with her it was obvious to both that the situation had tipped his decision between being with her and going to officer training in district 2 and that being with her had kind of been his second choice he wanted to return to the capitol eventually and have her with him  he says this to her the first day at the lake so she knows this but she did believe he wanted to come with her both because he loved her but also because he needed to run 

as soon as they found the guns in the house and after finding out he had lied and betrayed sejanus lucy was afraid now he had the guns there was no more evidence of the murdersother than her while he loved her she knew that the capitol is where he wanted to be and after finding out he had no problem getting sejanus killed to save himself she believed he could do the same to her

whether he was actually going to do that or not is not totally clear  you could see the thought in his mind about having hold of the guns i personally think he considered it for a moment but wasnt going to do it until she ran and he thought she would betray him i do think he wanted to dump the guns and go to district 2 and depending on how that conversation with her went it could have ended up that way anyway  he was quite paranoid and pretty obsessed with having control",2023-11-20
" after everything he went through for her i didnt buy that he would harm her

um like what exactly what did he do that is purely for lucy gray he cheated in the games because he wanted that prize lucy gray surviving is just a bonus his main goal is to win its all about winning

maybe it could be argued that him choosing to be a peacekeeper in 12 instead of 8 was because of lucy gray but at that point he has lost his chance at wealth so he probably thought lucy gray is all he had but then when the moment came that he had a chance to pursue his ambition again guess whos in the way of that happening yes lucy gray

what did he go through for her exactly if anything lucy gray got into trouble because of him and him throwing lucy gray under the bus to return to that capitol life was very much in character",2023-11-19
third act had issues i’m pretty sure everyone involved in this movie or saw it would agree so you’re statement isn’t off,2023-11-18
i agree straight up he risked everything for her already so it didn’t make sense he would just shoot her then,2023-11-20
good luck getting back into books ,2023-12-02
whats up with peter obsession with snows,2023-11-18
"the funny thing is after splitting the book into 2 movies they still cut so much 

like you said part 1 is pretty much about ron harry and hermione but its also about harry learning more and more about dumbledore and how he is just a flawed wizard not this amazing headteacher harry always though the movie didnt even bother explaining it more

but least it isnt as insulting as half blood prince that cut nearly all of voldemorts backstory lol",2023-11-17
i agree and understand you for thinking the last two movies are boring it should’ve been one movie but people telling katniss what to do is exactly the point it shows how the whole war something bigger than her and she played just a small part in the whole scheme of things she starts of the rebellion by becoming a symbol for it but after that many factors take place and she finds out how she isn’t prepared for some of the things that happen,2023-11-17
i feel like you got it backwards part 1 was all about the character developmentrebellionlack of action part 2 was the one with all the shoehorned action scenes,2023-11-17
i disliked the mockingjay movies so much even the book wasn’t as good tbh i feel like the writing was just better in the first hunger games and catching fire books,2023-11-17
mockingjay book has some pretty serious issues all across it the movies made all of the issues worse and didnt add anything to fix them i get why they broke it into 2 but it doesnt help that each part just isnt that good and they needed to back off  i can see why people wanted to make this 2 but it doesnt have a natural break point and act 3 of this movie isnt compelling enough to be its own thing,2023-11-18
i rewatched them before seeing that movie last night i think between part i  ii there was 6 individual scenes were theyre shooting propaganda films it was all so repetitive,2023-11-18
"at worst certain people felt that part 1 was boring and i do think that part 2 should have used its single film focus to extend itself a bit to tie up all the loose ends and add in some connective tissue plus more scenes with the other characters 

but it was still overall a success its breaking dawn and divergent and the hobbit that really showed the horrific consequences of doing the splitting up plus mockingjay was in the middle and although not horrific it was still very stretched out and didnt fully earn this choice",2023-11-18
thanks my wife told me this and she got it wrong i guess lol,2023-11-17
" but at a certain point snow gets so powerful nothing lucy could say would even matter

i mean didnt snow talk about how fragile the system multiple times in the series maybe lucy gray reappearing and telling stories from the olden days wouldnt matter in the slightest but maybe it would get the stone rolling sure its unlikely but snow is exactly the kind of character to stress about that at night",2024-01-07
she’s fairly just getting started in movies she’s been doing school theater for good chunk of her life,2023-11-20
well seeing how this is her third film and once again a third box office failure by the looks of it meanwhile snow white isnt even finished and that could be the final nail in the coffin of her career so the stage could be her final destination once it is all said and done,2023-11-18
"alright fair enough i feel like ive seen a lot of weird criticism for her when the character feels like more of a minicelebritysinger like how traveling bands tend to be and shes not really supposed to be like katniss 10 

but i think thats why her performance worked for me i thought all the performances were great just the story was missing context",2023-11-18
yes she was performing for the back of the room the whole time you could see her acting in every scene,2023-11-22
have you read the book,2023-12-25
i want the 3 hour and 40 minute version that they originally showed to test audiences,2023-11-26
i just watched the movie today and it was so intense and good wait why do you think the third act made more sense in the movies i haven’t read the book yet,2023-11-19
i always thought theyre the best ones,2023-11-22
no credit for that just a happy accident if mockingjay 1  2 were as great as catching fire theyd look extra foolish for this comment sadly they kind of ,2024-01-28
"i rewatched them this week and it was unfortunate that with all the screentime between part i  ii they really didnt buildup coins development very well all of her heelturn appears off camera until the roundtable where she introduces hunger games 20

considering they dedicated so much time to showing the propaganda filming they shouldve prioritized some of coins character development beyond just exposition from the boggs also rip to philip seymour hoffman it was sad seeing his scenes cut out due to his passing ",2023-11-18
i just watched both parts for the first time this week and i agree part 1 was really interesting to me but part 2 was meh,2023-11-17
i saw part 1 in the theater and liked it way more than i thought i would,2023-11-18
the police brutality scenes in part 1 were chilling,2023-11-20
yeah im really fond of p1 p2 has good stuff but eh,2023-11-24
do you really expect the casual viewer who hasn’t seen the original hunger games since they came out in theaters to understand the timeline and remember what katniss’ mom looks like,2023-11-21
reaper also drags the bodies into a line with every killed tribute,2023-11-18
yeah i thought we would get more of clemmie after she was bitten also i thought they might put in more of how he realllllly hates mockingjays because they developed outside of capitol control just to have another tie in to the og movies it was interesting that they were able to cut out a lot of the bird studies and dr kay by just having dr gaul explain the jabberjays directly to snow,2023-11-17
wasn’ the black market interactions where we learn why the game maker hates his dad i could be misremembering how’d they show that,2023-11-17
how much of the book was spent on lucy and snow actually being together in district 12 it felt like in the movie they got maybe what 10 minutes after running away together,2023-11-17
her earlier comment about his father was that you could see the hate in his eyes  while she doesnt know what happened in 12 she can tell that something about him has changed to be more similar to his father,2023-11-26
idk she hates him but will accept his help for their living quarters and food also he only killed the mayors daughter who was gojng to rat all of them out and who got lucy in the reaping so no big loss there lol,2023-11-20
"snow risks his life to enter the arena and save sejanus

because dr gaul forced himbribed him with the plinth prize which is snows only chance of securing his familys future thats in the movie theres no way in  that snow would do that of his own accord

they also seem to be bonding initially in their time in d12

yeah  they do in the book as well but thats because snow was homesick to the point of being suicidal so he was just happy to see anyone from home",2023-12-17
agree  def better than mockingjay 1 and 2  i kinda agree  catching fire was a high for the series  i would say too response seems to be same at first hunger games also minus the critics though it still got a tomato,2023-11-20
understandable for sure  its definitely a good addition imo,2023-11-24
she was great for the singing parts i don’t think she’s a good dramatic actress for serious parts,2023-11-23
"honestly i think there’s more layers to the idea that he was exploiting lucy to help her and also himself if you look at it from the idea that he’s a narcissist it’s easy to draw the conclusion that he wants to be liked and perceived well in fact his internal monologue proves as much he wants to be the best in the room and by gaining lucy’s trust and eventual love he gets his ego fed so he wants to keep her going because of that he wants to be loved 

eventually he realizes she figured how he killed sejanus and he instantly flips partially for reasons i outlined in a different comment and partly because that love stopped so she has no use to him anymore 

it’s less about keeping lucy alive because he likes her and more about keeping her alive because she likes him",2023-11-17
but theres a difference between being extremely selfish and being a sociopathic homicidal maniac and we never get to see tgat transition,2024-03-09
not gonna lie it would have been better if he chose to  himself also hows the dean that  to drink from a vital that could have been tampered by snow who hates him,2023-11-27
no problem ,2023-12-10
i thought tom blythe was really good but to each his own  i thought the movie was good not great but good i dont know many who didnt at least enjoy the movie but i will say its mismarketed  its a snow movie  not a hunger games movie  sorry you didnt like it,2023-11-20
"100 she also felt real biggest point her hair was in a braid there is no woman who would wear their hair down in the hunger games im sorry you can find twine or something 

jennifer lawrence felt real she was terrified when her name was called rachels character had this astonishing confidence out of nowhere that made the whole film lose tension",2023-12-19
they made the games more entertaining in this movie than in the tbosas book lol most of the book was the tributes hiding in tunnels,2023-11-19
"i read the book and even my  thought that whole time i was thinking stay out of his business lol but the relationship was transactional to snow like most of his relationships especially in the books to not spoil it too much i’m just gonna be vague snow is poor sejanus’s family is rich from the war he stands to possibly benefit by toleratingnot being outwardly mean to sejanus

and benefit he did…",2023-11-18
snow explained it even if he genuinely knew nothing about sejanus’s plot if it’s discovered he would be hung just because he’s a friend of sejanus he’s pleading with sejanus one last time but sejanus is an idealistic rich kid,2023-11-20
oof that scene was rough also love how she called herself mysterious and sang a song about herself low key giving pick me,2023-12-01
i’m aware of that  i just didn’t like how theatrical it felt just not my taste,2023-11-18
"she was slapped by the mayor for putting the snake down his daughter’s dress the peacekeepers always kinda liked lucy gray and the covey as they are seen enjoying their performances at the hob later in the film

all of the songs are in the book in fact the film cut several out",2023-12-03
"t she get slapped by capital guards goes “just a minute boys” and then breaks out into song  
  
makes zero sense why would a capital guard u

she put a snake down the mayors daughters dress after she said sing your way out of this one lucy gray",2023-12-04
now that i agree with,2023-12-04
i agree that they did make him sympathetic and moreso in the movie  i think they did this for casual audiences  but tom blythe did say he played snow that the audience would fall in love with him and i think mission accomplished    could also be another reason why you didnt like,2023-11-20
it worked for me  tigris even says he can be good  he had a choice and he chose that side of him that was a manipulator and a cheater  we see glimpses of it but because lucy left whelpit explains so much why he believes he is in the right,2023-11-20
yeah i guess they “edited” it out when they played it back or maybe assumed someone else recorded it,2023-11-21
yes which is weird because they specifically made him not talk during the recording in the books so that wouldnt be an issue,2023-12-04
"rachel zegler played that scene very emotional and lucy gray in the books just silently figured out what the 3rd person is so it wouldnt provoke coryo for me that part of the scene was yelling lol

well they obviously changed it slightly to accommodate filmonly viewers and make it more obvious where lucy grays head was at in the book we dont know for sure whats going on with lucy gray in these scenes because snow is perhaps wilfully obtuse about the signs of her suspicion and lost in his own thoughts she is certainly very firm about pressing on the third person in the book and asks him about it three times she also had an ominous line about there being enough ghosts between them already which was cut from the film

i dont agree that zeglers acting was very emotional in these scenes or that it included any yelling agree to disagree",2023-12-10
"but why most women see plenty of blood every month

the most disturbingly violent scene in the series is still peeta throttling katniss to the verge of death complete with purple skin bulging eyes and veins but there was no blood so i guess it was fine for kids of any age eyeroll",2023-11-18
i don’t think so because i remember the first hunger games being pretty bloody even if it was for a split second… maybe the shaky cam helped keep the rating down,2023-11-24
it was already enough for me to see innocent kids  each other i dont think its neccessary to show more violence than this i thought it was more effective cause it made audiences imagine it and it worked really well for me,2023-11-18
local man discovers that fiction reflects reality,2023-11-20
but it takes an enormous amount away from the realism the gravity of the violence and audience immersion,2023-11-24
 you have been summoned,2023-11-22
there was i swear there was a buzz then,2023-11-28
or quickly gave the order to  him right before she gave the speech,2023-12-04
im pretty sure that thats what she did in the book,2023-12-21
he has less power than gaul,2023-11-29
i really really enjoyed seeing what the primitive early games looked like clearly the games were originally supposed to last a couple hours at most referenced by the fact lucretius had to change his dinner reservations,2023-11-18
this is what i don’t get how does dr gaul have a job she’s had 10 years to work on the games and is currently at ‘round arena weapons in the middle go’ how has she not been fired,2023-11-25
my question to this tho was if nobody is watching why run them like what is the point there are so many easier ways to enforce control,2024-01-08
do they have a voiceover or anything of his internal dialogue i enjoyed the book and am excited to see this when i can get a babysitter but am a bit worried about how theyre gonna deal with so much of the book being his thoughts,2023-11-29
"wasnt he didnt snow allude to his dad buying him out of trouble multiple times 

part of the problem is they were casting a 28yearold as someone who was supposedly 17",2023-11-18
he was essentially the son of a powerful raytheon ceo,2023-11-25
he was privileged even his initial punishment was bought being sent to 2 to train to be a peacekeeper he then bought his way to be in 12 with snow because he thought snow was his friend,2023-11-25
maybe if they didn’t have lucy singing every 2 seconds we could have had that backstory,2023-12-13
would have made an amazing hbo show,2023-11-19
honestly ik it’s becoming a trend but this movie definitely could have warranted a 2 parter,2023-11-28
but they could have done a miniseries like what they did with it make a part one and two to flesh it out a bit more i love all of the visuals and casting is not bad at all but it makes me sad that they changed a lot lepidus and pluribus not a big part of the plot necessarily but the stuff that they say and do in the books have been rewritten or removed completely,2024-02-14
i’ve seen the irishman killers of the flower moon and zack snyder’s justice league a 3 hour movie is child’s play at this point,2023-11-18
i agree what made the book so compelling to me was snow’s inner monologue you read how manipulative and fake he can be when it comes to getting people to like him or achieving what he wants dean highbottom and dr gaul to an extent is pretty much the only person who sees through the “golden boy” act he’s got going on even his friendship with sejanus only really happened because he never outright bullied nor antagonized sejanus while they were growing up at school but his inner monologue shows that he’s very much disgusted by the fact that sejanus and his family are from the districts and even though the snows have fallen on hard times he still views them as aristocracy far above most people in the capitol and very much above the people in the districts,2023-11-19
exactly the friends i watched the movie with who didn’t read the book were also a bit confused at that especially since the movie explicitly shows that the plinths basically bankrolled the snows back into wealth apart from simply just sponsoring his university tuition makes a lot more sense when you read the book and see that ma plinth really ended up viewing snow as a second son since he was sejanus’ best friend he even has a short interaction with strabo plinth where he expects to be rewarded for saving sejanus in the arena though nothing comes out of it only for strabo plinth’s generosity to later appear after sejanus’ death heartbreaking that the plinths basically bankrolled the boy who got their son killed,2023-11-19
why the  are you in this thread if you didn’t wanna be spoiled this is an official discussion of the movie and spoilers are gonna be unmarked because of it,2023-12-11
it didn’t but still it’s the fact he was so far detached he thought it was mostly just a stern warning and slap on wrist when it was a serious consequence and no one could save him reality set in  compared to the others where they knew the consequences he was even in doing the right thing expected a safety blanket ,2023-11-17
he wasnt brought up with a silver spoon  he grew up in 2 but then his family made money in the war weapons or something so his parents moved to the capital thinking it would be a better opportunity for him  but he still considered himself district,2023-11-18
i mean more the movie compared to the book and how they portrayed it  example snow with out narration is more sympathetic compared to his inner feelings,2023-11-19
the rat poison is the biggest act of cheating i would say because she basically got given a weapon right at the start,2023-11-19
its more that it wasnt his fight to the death it was hers but he was still attacking kids with drones,2024-03-15
the snakes trust you if they know your scent there was a time he used his handkerchief on her tears so he slipped it in so the snakes were familiar with this scent,2023-12-06
bunch of zero tippers but you know logically a billion dollar company should properly pay their workers and not put that on the backs of consumers,2024-01-01
no she chose the surgeries to be trendy snow turned on her after she went too far on the surgeries and she became rejected by the high society like people who get failed plastic surgeries get shunned by hollywood,2023-12-20
"id like to think that olivia rodrigos song for the movie is a hint as to whether lucy survived or not or if her memory still haunts him 

oh you think im gone cause i left  
… but im in the trees im in the breeze  
my footsteps on the ground  
youll see my face in every place  
but you cant catch me now  
through wading grass the months will pass  
youll feel it all around  
im here im there im everywhere",2023-11-22
snow spent the entire movie telling lucy to run so in the end she did exactly that,2023-11-28
as someone who’s never read the books and only watched the original movie once or twice long ago is lucy not connected to katniss because she made up that word for those plants or was that just a common word,2023-12-10
"but what was it that made her change her mind from running away to the north with him  finding the guns  or had she already planned to abandon him  and if so why did she meet up with him at the hanging tree in the first place  

logically it was in the cabin that she changed  so finding the guns  but what were the guns doing there anyway  the conspirators coincidentally hid them there after the shooting at the very cabin they found shelter in  oh and by the way what is that fully furnished and unoccupied cabin doing out there way way out from settled area",2023-12-21
himself,2023-12-31
she also was upset when he told her he was going to district 2 but couldnt now that the mayors daughter had been shot she said something like so you were just going to leave me here and not tell me,2023-11-23
"yeah  that was definitely a turning point  i guess that was when she realized he was untrustworthy 

but again why is he untrustworthy he can be lying to her about sejanus and still be trustworthy  why is he fleeing everything to be with her if hes not sincere he killed the mayors daughter after all he has a good reason to flee now  when he returns he sneaks back in secretly presumably without them knowing he fled",2023-12-21
of course he had remorse for getting sejanus murdered  he was a very conflicted character  thats why he was interesting  especially in the book  but the remorse wasnt enough  he had goodness in him  like lucy grey said he chose to  it out  until the very end  he could have gone either way  he was never faking it in his feelings for lucy or sejanus his feelings just werent enough to overcome his craving for success and power,2023-11-17
i didnt read the book but this was my interpretation as well i suppose there are two possible ways people could understand it i walked away thinking lucy has realised snow’s true colours not that she had ever done anything as a way of using him,2023-11-17
"cheering after lucy won not feeling remorse over gettjng his best friend killed i dont know why this has so many upvotes because it just would have made snow into a saturday morning cartoon villain and not make any sense he already showed he was capable of showing affection to his family and friends so hes not a sociopath 

he obviously loved them but his  for power and being a geneal  makes him a way more interesting character",2023-11-22
"so like thats the wrong take snow isnt a sociopath yet in the story what makes him a sociopath is that moment

you got to look at it like seajanis he is what snow is but without the murdering theyre both people who grew up in wealth and luxury to a certain extent

while seajanus had monetary wealth he became spoiled that way while snow was spoiled in the fact that he was from the capital he was taught from a young age that he had to do whatever it took to survive he saw a guy chopping off the body parts of other people

him and his family had to eat garbage the districts even killed his family at this point in time this little boy doesnt think anything wrong with the games he doesnt think anything wrong with the way the world is except for these people literally took everything he had away from him and now hes a poor nobody whos struggling to get by

him meeting lucy gray whats the first hiccup and his entire life at this point hes just trying to do whatever he can do to get his parents some money but he kind of falls in love with her but its more of like a i forgot the name of the word if its stockholm syndrome

but he falls in love with her and she utilizes him to do whatever it takes to survive she plays the role up so she can live but at the same time she realizes that hes offering an olive branch of help and is willing to work with him to get the job done

but all of her kindness to him is kind of fostering in this false sense that shes into him and that shes there and so he sacrifices everything he has to make sure this girl lives and at the end of the day hes ready to give everything away to go with her

so he goes but then he give hes given the offer to go home early to be with his family who he remembers with that phone call that oh wait these are the people i should be fighting for this girl that was with me my entire childhood who was also struggling while i was struggling

and so he decides to leave but before he can even talk to her about it all that stuff goes down but he told her that he could that she could trust him and he really meant it in that moment and she had him hooked so he was really willing to run away and he was willing to give out the rest he had to her

but he had already lost so much throughout this entire ordeal and now he had an opportunity to go home and he was seriously considering going home but he realized the right decision at the end of the day was to follow the path for the woman he loves however when he ask that question to her to know if she was going to be a problem she was already spooked and so her running away he was freaking out that she was going to go tell on him and it was triggering his like survival instinct

so then he goes after her thinking he might have to  her if shes really serious but then he gets bit by the snake and he realizes that she really betrayed him she did not like him she did not love him and she is afraid of him and so in his survival mode hes like you know what let me  her so that i can continue to survive cuz he realizes how horrific the capital is

and in that moment is when he truly becomes the presidents know we know today where he learned that even though hes given everything to people no ones ever going to do the same for him because he did try ill be at very weakly to help the people in his life not make choices that would get them all killed and at the end of the day they still did that and so he wrongly comes to that conclusion

that is why snow is the man who he was because he realized that no ones going to come save you no ones going to come help you you got a finagle the system to for you to survive and he truly starts believing the capital  he doesnt buy into the games being just to keep the people in place he realizes that in order to prevent people from killing him and in order to be the one who is still alive you have to be cutthroat and ruthless

its honestly an amazing parallel to real life and like how the actual society is like you have to be ruthless in reality obviously not to that degree in order to make it which shouldnt be the way but its how it is and you can either vote to play with that system or make your own

and it honestly shows why snow how he treats katniss later on in the actual series of why he was kind of mean to her but he was very kindly mean to her and it adds a whole nother layer to him he wasnt just a really mean person and its why katniss never killed him its why katniss killed the woman from district 13 instead because she knew he was going to get what he was due but she also recognized what a survivor looks like

katniss kind of understood him more than anything and this is also why snow was so nice to katniss even though he did things in the background he never truly killed or harmed her family he was actually very nice in his way of acting and his threat making and everything he did he was trying to help maneuver her to find that ruthless path

and at the end katniss made similar decisions to him she was equivalently a selfcentered and she buried all of that selfishness under peeta even as the series ended she buried that under peter she realized that she did not deserve to be in this world because snow is literally katniss like theyre very similar people they just both made different choices

to wind it up cuz i elaborated way too much on this he is an associate path he is just a normal human being but hes eternally trapped in this fightorflight kind of mentality because of how he was raised he was brought up through war everyone was against him he had to claw his way up you have to be ruthless to do that its not about being a sociopath he truly felt emotions when he killed these people but like any other animal out there you have to realize that yes its going to hurt but you have to just do it or else youre never going to survive",2023-11-19
" snow immediately declaring himself the winning and cheering for himself would have much better highlighted his sociopathy and that he only cared about himself

that would have been cartoonishly evil and honestly i feel like the movie i didnt read the book showed he definitely had an internal struggle that wouldnt make sense for him to actually do what you suggested at the time",2023-11-20
snow is not a sociopath hes a flawed human being who went down a dark path he had conflicting emotions and certainly did not only care for himself,2023-11-23
yeah hes a narcissist its subtle but thats what narcissism is sometimes,2023-11-17
"from reading your comment it seems that movie snow is quite a different take on the character

i would go as far as to say that in the beginning of the movie he had several noble qualities  willing to miss out on meals to feed his family seemed genuinely sorry about the tributes had real friendships offered to share the spotlight with his project partner

i think in the cabin lucy misunderstood his confusion for maliciousness he might have decided to  her later on but if he was about to i dont think it was decided in that moment",2023-11-19
he was also pretty prone to laughter in the main series and in this he was pretty much perma brooding,2023-11-19
i didnt take it as he was a sociopath all along  i took it as he was against the capital but after being left in the districts to fend for himself he felt like he was superior to all those captive people and clawed his way out with the cunning hed learn from the capital  and so he slowly became a different more selfish version of himself in a way he wasnt before  his heart was genuinely in the right place early in the story,2023-11-22
sociapaths are a lot more complicated than that my friend i used to be friends with one in the book he is a lot more straightforward because you hear how he talks to himself in his head i think the movie actually did a pretty good job at showing them outwardly and not internally,2023-11-28
" snow had ever done had been for himself 

if thats the case this was a fundamentally dishonest movie the entire course of the movie we the audience know snow is the good guy all evidence is that hes a good guy for the actor to relentless portray snow as conscientiousempathetic and for them to pull the rug out at the very end is just cheap and inept",2023-12-21
"i dont understand how both the book and the movie can fail in showing us who snow really is wouldnt that point to you being wrong or in disagreement with what was shown 

mind you i didnt read the book but i find the ending where snow talks with gaul pretty weak whereas everything before that was consistent in regards to his character

when he asks for lucy to be freed i saw it as him thinking of himself first and foremost not wanting people to ask themselves why shes surviving and follow the trail up to him

but there is also a part of him that cares he isnt just a sociopath although he chose to become one in the end",2023-11-29
"is it ever stated that he is a sociopath his attachments to hsi family friend plinth and lucy are all pretty clear he doesnt need a mental defect to explain the horrible things he does to them 

like lucy says people aint so bad its what the world does to them snow is a war orphan who grew up avoiding cannibals and going to a school at a fascist factory he puts himself and his family above everything including starving to feed his grandma when he doesnt need to",2023-12-02
if both the book and the movie didn’t portray something maybe that wasn’t the author’screators’ intent i think they should have made him a little more ruthless at times to better sell his fall into darkness at the end but they were clearly trying to show him as a genuinely caring person who struggled with good and evil until he finally gave into evil,2023-12-15
i read into it so differentlyas did my friend and husband independently we viewed it more as a trauma response after being brought into the games he looked up to his mom loved his mom and was like her he did everything early for the family when he said he felt powerful he was concerned and upset that he could be like his dad if he were a sociopath he would have no reason to express that or tell tigris anything about his feelings after the trauma of killing someone and then feeling like he had to do more and more desperate measures to protect his family he became more like his dad and gave into primal nature and in the end comes out like his father his old self comes out a few times where he feels remorse even later on with sejanus hes all alone but still criesbut in the end his new self prevails its not a mistake its a transformation coming from ptsd,2023-12-31
yessss this is my opinion their life values also didnt seem to align he wanted moneysuccess and she just wanted a simple covey life,2023-12-06
"i didn’t miss it it’s in my comment “at this point she’s worried that snow killed his best friend and lied to her about it”

also didn’t feel the need to highlight the trust theme she looks into the camera at one point and declares “trust is more important to me than love if you lie i’m gone”

don’t really think it’s a subtle theme only found in the novel it’s pretty overt in the film",2023-11-22
"i guess it goes back to the complexity of the two characters and the interpretation of whether she actually liked him or not

seen it play out in other films but he finds the guns and she can see his almost excitement  that he could go back to his old life because his biggest worry of guilt was never found 

she then points out that she is also a link to the horrible things he’s done even if he didn’t  her he was basically suggesting he would abandon her to go back to the capital this combines with her slight annoyance when snow reveals that he actually had a posting order to the officer school that he didn’t tell her about

imo she tries a power play by reminding him he can’t abandon her because she knows what he’s done as you said it’s a bit childishpassive aggressive but don’t forget they are meant to be a teenage couple lol she quickly realised her mistake in that her life wouldn’t keep him in 12 because he could just  her

it’s the snake eating it’s own tale then because she makes the first move assuming he had already decided to  her but it seems he decided against it when he went fishing at this point he does decide to  her because he thinks the whole thing has been a ruse

edit i didn’t read the book either anyone feel free to correct me",2023-11-17
it wasnt sudden she figured he killed sejanus and that he was ready to leave the district,2023-11-17
ahhhh this comment makes me want to read the book now the movie did a good job at showing that but im sure the book did even better,2023-12-06
"if you’ll notice when she first said she was running she didn’t even ask him to come

just before their interaction at the cabin he admits to killing someone and not telling her which makes him a liar her pet peeve",2023-11-19
she was going to rat on snow as well he would have hanged,2023-11-19
pass,2023-11-26
it was a way to advance himself and send attention away from himself he found the culprits he’s a hero now for the capitol in their eyes they catch the alleged perps  perps get hung case closed he’s safe and promoted more money more power the two women are safe in nice house and nice meals and clothes,2023-12-26
 you are right fixed,2023-11-26
when it was clear she didnt even understand what was going on,2023-11-18
my sister has downs and it broke my heart,2023-12-11

in the book you get to see some capitol civilians not sejanus talk about it tigris at one point says to snow something like “how could a good person support the games” also there is a part in the book where they are discussing the low viewership of the games in the class and lysistrata says that decent people don’t like to watch people sufferdie of course these individuals are still upholding the status quo by not rebelling and they are holding on to their privilege still at heart they know this  is  up,2023-11-23
i guess you forgot about when a trump official said “womp womp” in regards to a child with down’s syndrome being separated from their mother at the border and trump supporters didn’t get upset by it at all,2023-11-29
have you heard of iyad halak i lost hope for humans after seeing people justify his killing,2023-11-20
" youd think even the capitol civilians would be like alright thats a bit much

there was a point where it felt like the games were going to end when the large kid buried the fallen tributes under the flag the future of the games was already on a razors edge by that point thats why they announced the death of the presidents son right at that moment to stoke resentment against the districtsrebels and make them forget about this heartbreaking gesture they just witnessed",2024-01-07
i just think they didnt find her they never show her dying,2023-11-18
"the book actually ends with snow making suggestions to gaul to gamify the games even more to make them more appealing to the districts 
 
the book shows how most in the districts didnt bother to watch the games at all as they were justifiably repulsed by it and they didnt benefit from it snow proposed that the games be mandatory viewing from then on 
he also proposed the idea that the district with the winning tribute would receive more rations for the year that they win along with a designated victors village area in each district for the winners  
 
this would eventually lead to capitoladjacent districts like 1 and 2 having citizens intentionally volunteer and win repeatedly due to their increased wealth and resources",2023-11-22
snow basically turned cockfighting into wwe,2024-01-02
to be fair its kind of the same in the book snow notices often how she cares a lot for her appearance,2023-12-09
"i am right there with you i feel like everyones jumping on this when shes doing a really good job of trying to humanize him we are all just several instances of heartbreak before we turn into snow same with like i think her main emphasis is that like katniss and snow were so similar theyre both selfish people who only have their survival and their family survival at heart

katniss even kills the leader of the rebel army just to get back at her for killing her sister theyre both very selfish selfcentered people the difference is katniss instead of you know put people beneath her for her own actions has people throwing themselves under her to bolster her survival

while snow put people under him for him to survive and thrive they have very similar stories that are almost mirror like but just calling him a sociopath you know doesnt really justify that in my opinion if anyones truly a sociopath its the lady who runs district 13 and throws children under the bus just to save and take power of everyone

im going to listen to the book now and then once i finish that ill have a better understanding but i really think that like while snow is a very evil person hes very similar to a lot of politicians out there and a lot of people out there who put themselves in their own success over everyone else like it it feels almost normal to me but i feel like every death that he made in this story had a justified reason behind it whether or not that reasoning was justified in my opinion most of that came out of some form of emotion",2023-11-19
i saw another comment somewhere that mentioned this part of the book its just been a while since ive read them they mentioned something about probably plastic surgeries and all that jazz to keep him looking young,2023-11-19
"ing for over 40 years

well plus he is a magician so maybe he discovered some sort of magical age reversing pill or something magicians are good at pulling tricks",2024-01-01
i dont understand the multiple comments saying they made the wrong decision to show snow showing remorse because sociopaths dont feel remorse so rather than realizing snow isnt a sociopath but rather a conflicted individual who went the wrong way theyre saying the story was written wrong people are trying to twist the narrative to suit their own conclusions,2023-12-07
100,2023-11-29
i mean his grandmother also cared more about the familys name and status and even tigris cared about that caring about the snow name and status and the things it stood for before the war was instilled in him by his family,2023-11-19
"i appreciate when a character is given some depth rather than just painted as irredeemably evil or a mary sue while snow had his baggage i liked seeing another side to him people might say hes nothing but a sociopath but everybody has some shades of grey in them snow had a chance to grow true empathy like sejanus but was too worried about losing everything he had worked for 

i cant wait to read the novel version but i really hope well get more stories in this universe as i would like to see haymitchs games or even the first hunger games or itd be cool to see what the other continents are like in this world would it be similar to the 1984 novels political landscape do other countries have their own hunger games jokingly imagine squid games is just the asian version",2023-11-19
"i think he cared more about his familys name and status

yea he was disgusted when tigris implied she had to  for food 

collins also choosing tigris to be his cousin a character we see hate snow in book 3 of the series is most likely on purpose to show that he didnt really fully care about her",2023-11-20
"it’s a common albeit classic template called the hero’s journey  there are going to be variations to the stages or even aversions but star wars helped popularize the narrative device the point is really that most villains are not onedimensional and did not get to their position or perspective by default but rather were pushed or manipulated most villains had feelings attachments desires and needs 

take away those things and you’re left with the corrupted being within very few people are born wanting to be evil but many are forced into that path especially if they have no guidance or direction otherwise think of any of your favorite villains or antagonists and consider how they became that way can you relate or empathize with their background or do you feel it does not justify their actions that’s what i feel makes a good villain take into account star wars again you mentioned anakin’s rise and eventual downfall yet he became a hero once again the audience identifies with him

but consider someone like the joker or cletus kasady who were evil from the beginning for the most part anyhow sure their gory adventures might be fun but there’s no substance they commit violence for the  of it not due to some misinformedmisinterpreted perspective their actions hold no purpose except to cause chaos and destruction they’re one dimensional and they become quite boring due to the repetitiveness and lack of motivation 

snow was wrong for continuing the hunger games and for his hatred of the districts but at least we have knowledge of how he became this way it doesn’t justify him being a bigot but doesn’t put him completely at fault either change some things around and he might’ve been a hero",2023-12-06
but there’s zero display of conflict for him you don’t see him weighing whether to send the jay or anything he sees sejanus with the rebels and then at his first opportunity he records him and immediately sends it off i think spending just five minutes holding the caged jay overnight and seeing him really consider the bird would have made a big impact,2023-11-19
thats exactly what i meant,2023-12-15
well i think by the end he decides that the world is cruel and he will be cruel as well when he puts on the joker jacket,2023-11-18
i thought the whole point of this story bookmovie was that snow was someone whose family was devastated by the war and he was trying to get his pride and prestige back and increasingly rubs up against his conscience to do it if he was just born bad per say the story wouldnt be the same at all,2023-11-18
that is why i viewed it more like recognizing his own self rather than descending to the dark side he has been there all along i see your point but i somehow does not feel any good from snow,2023-12-13
shooting mayfair too  in the book i seem to remember it was more like an accident  in the movie it was straightup cold blood,2023-11-18
totally agree i think up until the last scene in the cabin with lucy gray is when i started to change my mind a little on his motivations i can’t come up with any excuses for him killing highbottom,2023-11-19
"snow betrayed everybody in order to provide support for his family

or to save his own   depends on how you look at it",2023-11-18
with highbottom it seemed to me more like he was taking out his anger at his father on him,2023-11-18
highbottom was as negligent and morally irresponsible as gaul in his own way goading and humiliating a deprived desperate ambitious and fiercely intelligent youth at every opportunity was never going to end well i dont think highbottom had some grand plan he was just mean,2023-11-23
"one of the quotes that opens tbosas novel

i thought of the promise of virtues which he had displayed on the opening of his existence and the subsequent blight of all kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which his protectors had manifested towards him  mary shelley frankenstein

if snow shows no promise of virtues to begin with then the entire premise of the novel fails

gaul and highbottom were both malign influences in their own way and loathing and scorn fits their treatment of snow well perhaps if snow had had some authority figureselders in his impressionable youth who had tried to appeal to his better nature or offered him a path of hope he might have turned out differently",2023-11-25
i’m imagining they could have done it like penn badgely in you where we get his internal monologue throughout with him just fully embracing the sociopathy at the end,2023-11-18
" highbottom tries to bring him down so he cant hurt people

eh i just got the impression he was just upset with him because his dad",2023-11-18
thats true i didnt consider how advanced they are i think i mistakenly assumed it was just rat poison because they showed a dying rat while he was putting it in the compact,2023-12-24
yeah you just reminded me how great caesar was he was like one of the most genuine people in the capitol like on first appearance youd think oh man look at this total vain pos but he genuinely seemed to care about the tributes more than most people in the capitol,2023-11-20
what you said of caesar might be true or it could be all a snow similar to what snow was trying it helps him and ratings to be see likable in the capitol and it’s more interesting the better interviews he gets from people it doesn’t actually help any of the tributes to help them all,2023-12-20
it’s a very minor role all you know is that she’s had a ton of body modifications and used to be close with snow when they were younger but he used her like he uses everyone else so she went into hiding to help the rebels,2023-12-04
i had the same reaction then she said she wasnt from district 12 the peacekeepers rounded them up and placed them with district 12,2024-02-24
is it the covey dancing or district 12 because if it’s 12 that wouldn’t be appalachianstyle dance it’d be 12’s tradition not really sure what you mean by the display lol,2023-11-19
yup i think the lore is that the capitol is in the rocky mountains so the other districts are somewhere around there,2023-11-19
i assumed it was the us but i had doubts until now if you ever watch the film again during his weather report  flickerman is standing in front of a tvmap that greatly resembles southern and eastern usa,2023-11-23
in the 4th book they mention something about how the land used to be called north america  id always wondered but it was interesting finally having confirmation ive been trying to reimagine my brain map of the districts and the train ride,2023-12-01
yes panem is in a postapocalyptic north america this is stated explicitly in songbirds and snakes when snow is on the train to district twelve he sees the ruins of cities and says “before panem when this place was called  america” as well as by katniss after a series of conflicts including nuclear and ecological disasters including rising sea levels due to climate change they have maps of panem you can look at and see how the districts and their industries line up with the states district 12 covers appalachia and is coal mining dictrict 7 is the pacific northwest and does lumber district 10 is texasnorthern mexico and does livestock etc,2023-12-20
"yup there are a handful of different fanmade maps of what panem is presumed to look like

unfortunately my googlefu could not seem to pull up the map from the catching fire film that we see for maybe a second before the peacekeeper on a train shuts the door to the camera remotely the most recent film i think retcons this a bit as 12 is supposed to be the most easternfacing district but its still fairly accurate

the areas just outside of the boundaries are wildlands openish at first from the war through the 10th annual games by katnisss time they are more heavily reinforced boundaries to keep the wildlife out and really to keep the people in the parts further out are presumably uninhabitable due to a combination of nuclear fallout and flooded due to rising sea levels from climate change parts of the west coast east coast and the entirety of the state of florida are straight up gone in the universe of panem",2023-12-20
"well the actual character should all have really strong southern accents and they should be like really really thick accents if theyre truly were located where theyre located at because all the coal mines in that region are located directly where you would have a strong southern accent even the author suzanne collins stated she wanted her character to have a really strong southern accent

specifically in appalachian accent

however i dont think that was translated well in the original series and it is a flaw of the story but the characters arent written with accents either i think its just an oversight and it does you know kind of make you questions a little bit but at the end of the day it doesnt really matter",2023-11-19
eh my dad and his family are from nc alive were born 1920s1970s and none of them have a super strong accent i think it just depends on the person katniss did have a bit of an accent in the movies though it’s just not as corny as rachel’s was lol,2023-11-19
i will never understand what santino fontana has against the hunger games or lucy grey i love audiobooks and he nearly ruined it for me,2023-11-20
"huh friend and i are both “brown”  stop thinking everything is about color and assuming others’ online maybe it’s her acting and that’s it

edit weird that your comment history is only that comment is this your alt rachel",2023-12-11
dude me and my girlfriend couldnt stop laughing the singing was so cringe,2023-11-27
i didn’t like her from that first moment where she’s singing on the floor of the stage in front of everyone it was weird,2023-11-28
just because it’s played up in the book doesn’t mean it’s not bad acting,2023-11-24
considering twitter has spent months badmouthing her because she said her snow white isn’t spending the movie looking for a prince to rescue her and spent a week complaining she wasn’t full caucasian and so they should cancel her like they did halle bailey it’s not farfetched to think she’s getting hate for no reason,2023-11-22
but those performances are in the book  they even composed music to accompany the lyrics that suzanne collins wrote probably with no melody in mind,2023-11-22
my favorite story is about how robert pattinson didn’t want to practice accent with a coach for devil all the time and he just came on set and decided to do… that… and the director didn’t intervene,2023-11-18
100 agree just a bit longer maybe some more character building with them in the cage,2023-11-18
he doesnt look like peeta at all,2023-11-26
"it’s in ballad i don’t think the covey are mentioned at all in the original trilogy i haven’t read the book since it came out but there were hints that her father had very close ties  the big one is that katniss’ father used to take her to that same cabin near the lake their songs being passed down to  her from her father picking of the katniss bulbs i know there was a fan theory that maude ivory lucy’s cousin  the little girl in the movie is her grandmother either way it’s not stated outright but there’s enough there to make us think the author wanted us to make the connection imo

edit i looked up the theories and i forgot the covey even have the same house as katniss’ family in the books the maude ivory speculation comes from a few lines specifically mi knowing a tune after hearing it just once an ability katniss also mentions she has she’d also be the correct age and her age is specifically mentioned in the book",2023-11-26
i do wonder if he ever could have killed someone in some ways i think he is similar to peeta both district born people disgusted by the opulence they eventually get exposed with but peeta was way more willing for acts of rebellion within the confines of the system like donating food to 11 in catching fire he is also more willing to ,2023-11-17
his character changed in ways that made no sense to me between parts 2 and 3 and it was pretty disappointing,2023-11-18
dont mind at all i actually just finished the book and im excited to see the movie when i get a chance hopefully next week,2023-11-17
no it was just poor acting,2023-12-12
because almost all the names use by people in the capital and the privileged districts are roman and the romans had a lot of names that ended like that,2024-02-26
my comment is from a month ago brother i haven’t thought about this movie since,2023-12-21
it’s a 2h38m movie i’ll forgive someone for not remember the spelling of a name on a locker,2023-11-18
yeah it felt pretty clear to me in the book that the only reason snow seemed like a good guy in the first half is because helping out lucy gray also benefitted his ambitions he might’ve gone with lucy gray at the end if he had no other options but the moment returning to the capitol was an option there was no real chance in the world he’d pass that up any idea to the contrary was just wishful thinking on our part none of his actions at the end felt rushed or out of character at all for me,2023-11-17
books  movie in the movie he was a lot more sympathetic which made his turn all the more jarring,2023-11-28
"i think the issue was making it into a film anyway the book  the pacing was bad to start with and it was way too long i agree they couldnt have split it but having it as one film didnt work either 

i dont think she should have bothered writing the book nor should they have bothered making the film",2023-11-22
oh sorry misread your comment agree with what youre saying,2023-11-20
"no not all of the words

this passage seems pretty selfless to me

an overwhelming flush of love ran through him at her reminder that he was not alone in this tragedy they were back in the arena fighting for survival just the two of them against the world he felt a bittersweet pang at the thought of her watching him die but gratitude that she would survive he was the only one left who could place her at the murders she hadnt touched the weapons whatever happened to him there was comfort in knowing she would live on for the both of them pp 4789

another selfless moment

he checked the mail and found a box from pluribus loaded with packets of strings for assorted musical instruments and a kind note saying there was no charge  he put them in his locker happy at the thought of how happy the covey would be when it was safe enough to see them again p 467

i could find many other examples

im not saying that snow is a standup guy but there are many times in the book when he genuinely thinks of and feels for others",2023-11-17
"being selfish and narcissistic is not the same thing as being a sociopath he does have a conscience its just that his conscience got buried a true sociopath doesnt care if they dont have family to protect they dont have loved ones they wont even have conflictions over people

does he have some sociopathic tendencies yes but he makes a lot of very human decisions that a lot of people today also would make",2023-11-19
"all the words he uses for lucy gray are incredibly possessive he views her as belonging to him from the moment she is assigned to him

to be fair to snow he has reasonable grounds to be jealous and insecure when it comes to lucy gray

1 she is very flirtatious she says herself i flirt with anybody
2 its strongly implied in the book  less so in the film but there are still the lyrics about spreading kisses like honey and living by her charms  that lucy gray has a history of prostituting herself to survive sure snow is understandably not thrilled about this but he proceeds with the relationship anyway i dare say that snow shows more tolerance in this regard than the vast majority of men would particularly 18yrolds that would be a dealbreaker for most guys
3 lucy gray has an exboyfriend poking around and seemingly trying to get back together with her and she fails to wholly reassure snow on the matter

snow is possessive but id say that a lot of it is down to his insecurity in the relationship and strong desire for romantic and  exclusivity iirr he doesnt get possessive when it comes to the covey with whom lucy gray spends most of her time meanwhile there is absolutely noone else for snow but lucy gray and there never has been so the relationship is not exactly equal in that sense

even so lucy gray says to him youre mine and im yours its written in the stars this is an intense lifeordeath teenage romance so the language of belonging and destiny and such is par for the course

i also think that the text strongly supports a psychoanalyticfreudian interpretation of snows possessive attitude what we might call his anxious attachment style is pretty clearly rooted in the childhood trauma of losing his mother in the war snow explicitly associates her with lucy gray in the book as she was  also a beautiful appearanceconscious woman who used to sing to him he gives lucy gray two items that belonged to his mother including his most precious possession ie the silver compact and lucy gray brings out a vulnerable soft side of him that he otherwise only lets out when alone in the dark with the compact

i really wish they had shown the emotional significance of the compact in the movie that was the most detrimental omission to me it really gets to the heart of the traumatised child of war at the core of snows being",2023-11-23
" had little to no charm or people skills

well have to agree to disagree he charmed the pants off the covey especially lucy gray obviously and maude ivory even adopting their idiom to please them sweets to the sweet and such all his military bunkmates seemed to like him he keeps up a beneficial relationship with pluribus bell he had enough tact and people skills to fool the plinths including sejanus himself into thinking he was actually their sons close friend hes friends with many of his classmates and allegedly even has a reputation as a player",2023-11-23
"thanks for the info doctor

it seems that you read the book selectively interpreting snows thoughts and feelings so that they would fit your predetermined diagnosis and ignoring the parts that you were unable to make fit i dont understand why some readers seem to want snow to be less complex and interesting than he is

below is just one example when snow is clearly overcome by genuine emotion and compassion for lucy gray yes he fleetingly thinks of himself here but his predominant concern is clearly her welfare he ignores the rulesguard to be there for her he even puts aside his own concerns to focus on her because it all paled in comparison to her situation

x200b

coriolanus had a terrible image of her lying dead under a swarm of rats it wiped away the last few shreds of resistance he had and despair engulfed him for her for himself for the both of them “oh lucy gray i’m so sorry i’m so sorry about all of this” “it’s not your fault” she said “you must hate me you should i would hate me” he said “i don’t hate you the hunger games weren’t your idea” she replied “but i’m participating in them i’m helping them happen” his head dropped in shame “i should be like sejanus and at least try to quit” “no don’t please don’t don’t leave me to go through this alone” she took a step toward him and almost fainted her hands caught the bars and she slid down to the ground ignoring the guard’s warning he impulsively stepped over the rock and crouched down across the bars from her “are you all right” she nodded but she didn’t look all right he’d wanted to tell her about the scare with the snakes and clemensia’s brush with death he’d hoped to ask her advice but it all paled in comparison to her situation  
  
  
  
you matter to me” he insisted the capitol may not value her but he did hadn’t he just poured his heart out to her “time to go mr snow” the peacekeeper called “you matter to me lucy gray” he repeated",2023-11-17
"id argue times when snow doesnt do this for example when he tries to convince dr gaul to save lucy gray after he had already won or when he cries after he gets plinth executed are flaws with the story rather showing snows actual character

lol what you do realize that snow is a fictional character right there is no actual character whatever the story tells us it is his character ergo hes not a sociopath at least not in this movie",2024-01-13
we don’t know her fate is intentionally ambiguous,2023-11-20
has the concept of an opinion ever crossed your mind,2023-11-18
"lucy is portrayed as a performer i thought the movie did a pretty good job at showing how she puts on an act  to get what she wants

 when she is in a situation she cant perform her way out of she looks appropriately scared like in the arena

it fits her character as for why she should act how everyone else would im not sure what you mean people all act different theres no set reaction they should all give 

is serjanus reaction more appropriate than the stoick acting of the other rebels during the hanging since its human nature to value ones life over others",2023-11-24
i be looking for explanations like this from professional movie critics and still don’t get it you laid it out perfectly bravo,2023-11-20
i don’t think she knew the guns were there  she didn’t even want to stop at the cabin  that was his idea,2023-11-22
"i’ve only seen the movie last night but i do feel he genuinely cared for lucy and that he does do a lot for her through the games that wasn’t about just “winning” the prize at least

for starters sejanus says in the beginning that that there was no prize this year and given that it was his father who paid for it i think he has the best insight to this even if everyone still talked about the prize

secondly highbottom also explicitly tells coriolanus that he would do everything he could to make sure he never won a cent of that prize that was more or less the story telling us that even in the face of not getting something he wants he is still willing to risk everything to save her by putting his handkerchief with his father’s initials in the snake tank

it gets mixed a lot because of how often his selfish gains overlap with helping lucy but i think it’s less interesting to make it so he never really cared about her as much as people want to say he was “just a sociopath” he made every decision with purpose he ultimately was selfish in his actions but they weren’t “easy” due to not caring about people i agree that betraying lucy was in line with his character but because he wanted the capital more than he wanted a life with her not because he only cared about the capital and nothing for her",2023-11-23
"he cheated in the games because he wanted that prize lucy gray surviving is just a bonus

its the other way around and snow knew there was a good chance that his cheating would be found out and so the prize would be forfeit and his future ruined but at least lucy gray would survive in fact in the movie highbottom tells snow that he will do everything in his power to make sure he doesnt get a dime even if he wins and asks snow if he still cares whether lucy gray survives now turns out he did

his impulsive decision to slip in the handkerchief was directly inspired by a graphic and haunting vision of her being killed by the snakes

with a sharp pang coriolanus had a vision of lucy gray in their final meeting clutching his hand as he promised her they could win but there was no way he could protect her from the creatures in this tank p 283 uk edition  
  
what had he done what on earth had he done his heart raced as he blindly turned down one street and then another trying to make sense of his actions   hed done it so they would not bite her lucy gray as they had clemensia so they would not  her because he cared about her because he cared about her or because he wanted her to win the hunger games so that he could secure the plinth prize p 283

snow secondguesses himself and tries to rationalise his actions but its clear to me that his first thought is the true one its especially clear when he dreams of her that night

he crawled into bed where he dreamed of lucy gray being hunted by the rainbow snakes he awoke with a start trembling  you have got to hold yourself together he told himself the games cant last much longer p 292

our dreams reveal the true desires and fears in our hearts safe from the rationalisation and control of the conscious mind and snow dreams of lucy gray often

and all of this is reinforced by the earlier scene of their final meeting before the games

coriolanus felt something inside him unravel as he saw her helplessness and felt his own he reached for her oh lucy gray  
  
  
  
ill be a wreck tomorrow when i told you that you mattered to me i didnt mean as my tribute i meant as you you lucy gray baird as a person as my friend as my what was the word for it sweetheart girlfriend he could not claim more than a crush and that might be onesided but what could he possibly have to lose by admitting that shed gotten to him i felt jealous after your ballad because i wanted you to be thinking about me not someone from your past its  i know but youre the most incredible girl ive ever met really extraordinary in every way and i tears welled in his own eyes but he blinked them away he had to stay strong for them both and i dont want to lose you i refuse to lose you  
  
  
  
she was his girl she had saved his life and he had to do everything he could to save hers this is just before he gives her the compact  its my most precious possession i want you to have it in the arena for good luck  go on he urged her take me with you take it pp 189192

i dont care what anyone says thats some intense and heartfelt romantic  and he could have given her literally anything to store the rat poison but he chose to give her his most precious possession  the symbol of his dead mother  as a grand romantic gesture he had it baaaad for her",2023-11-23
why would he continue supporting her through the games when highbottom told him directly that he wasnt getting the prize though on top of that he was hesitant to answer to both gaol and highbottom the first time around when they asked why he wanted to win the games his affection for lucy gray drove him by the end to care more about her surviving than him winning the prize,2023-12-06

i think mockingjay the book suffers from being all from katnisss point of view  there were interesting things happening elsewhere but katniss is just kind of stuck in 13 most of the time moping around,2023-11-18
i think if mockingjay came out in 2023 they would’ve just made a movie that was 3 hours long plus 515 minutes on top that probably would’ve been seen as too much in 2015 but longass movies have been making a real comeback lately i think that approach would’ve been the best way to handle it,2023-11-18

what was cut,2023-12-19
i would expect them to remember that a woman around snows age in the original films would be way too old to be the mom of a teenager,2024-02-26
 yes there are so many pages of pure hatred for those birds,2023-11-19
they just have him outright say i used to be your dads best friend like veeeeery early on,2023-11-17
i think the bartender tells him that,2023-11-18
oh they cut a decent bit of that he doesn’t actually meet up with her for weeks because of various circumstances  instead here it’s in like two seconds sejanus goes with him too to her house in the seam and you get cute interactions of snow bringing maude ivory treats that ma had sent them,2023-11-17
there is more in the book  he goes to see her perform and they get to spend the afternoon together a couple of times  however theres also a lot of boring filler stuff about his peacekeeper training and stuff  i was actually glad they condensed the third act because it really drags in the book,2023-11-18
"they’re a proper couple they spend all weekends together and with sejanus and the covey


actually their first kiss is the day before the games and i’m front of the cameras",2023-11-19
oh that makes sense,2023-11-26
"but snow kills highbottom for no reason tigris fear is less about the things he has done and more about what hes going to do
she doesnt even hate him then yet that comes after this movie ends",2023-11-25
"interesting though i do think the movie codes him as very likeable but maybe thats inference on my part since hes the protagonist

curious what you think about a thought i had the movie leaves lucys disappearance a mystery the obvious idea is that she dipped because theyre just on different sides but it does say she never resurfaces do you think its possible viola was watching snow and had her taken to bring him back idk why but their final scene together felt almost like a man behind the curtain moment with how confident she was hed be back",2023-11-17
yeah i think thats why i got confused when watching the movie like why would you drink that lollll youve been hating on snows family guts and desire for power and getting to the top for all your life why the  would you consume anything they offer you,2023-11-27
as someone who hadnt read the book i did read the og hg trilogy back 10 years ago i didnt expect this to be a true hunger games movie but i felt like the movie had everything it was tense dramatic slightly depressing had beautiful moments some rather hysterical moments thanks jason schwarzman and the music was lovely overall just a good movie even if it maybe couldve been better the final third of the movie probably translates better in book form than as a movie but it was still good,2023-11-20
oh that’s unfortunate  i’m way past my ya phase but i still kind of want to read the book now because people are saying snow has many conflicting trains of thoughts for example about lucy and i looove villain protagonists i’m sad the movie didn’t entirely do him justice,2023-11-19
i mean the whole reason sejanus is even there is because if snows  excuse to get him out of the arena,2023-11-25
oh i guess that makes sense it can be a bit distracting i suppose though i didnt really mind it,2023-11-18
yeah completely forced garbage to get her singing,2023-12-04
yeah its maybe becuase  i just didnt care about snow like at alland lucy wasnt that interesting either  lowkey the only thing i liked was the singing parts,2023-11-20
im not saying it makes sense  im saying that the pg13 rating is the reason blood isnt shown  it was the same in all of the original movies too,2023-11-18
thats the mpa for ya guardians of the galaxy vol 3 showed a guy with his face ripped off and that was fine for 13yearolds but a single  on screen  instant r rating,2023-11-19
especially fiction as important as the 5th hunger games sequel,2023-11-24
so its not the beginning of the game makers having ultimate control in panem more like the end of it,2023-11-30
"theres some implications about the first ten games being just boring  peacekeepers having to threaten the kids to fight the games being over in hours kids dying of thirst

so the bombing and the gifts made the games far more interesting",2023-11-18
its weird they were called the hunger games i always read that as a reference to the kids having to survive for daysweeks without food,2023-12-08
she holds high status in the government that’s why,2023-11-25
it’s also implied that casca highbottom had a part in stalling any progress to make the hunger games more interesting,2023-12-02
yeah she just has an animal lab but doesn’t seem to be working on the games as a nonbook reader i didn’t under how she had the budget for such an elaborate lab especially if she  as a game maker,2023-12-03
"if you really want to know there isn’t any internal monologue which i think was completely the right thing to do
i honestly really like how you can see the difference between the book and movie because of this because you get to see the perspective of snow from everyone else’s eyes it was also fun because after reading the book you know what he’s thinking in the movie in certain scenes",2023-12-02
i don’t think the movie explained his character well if i remember from the book he used to live in district 2 and dad made money off of the war so much that they were able to move to the capitol and be upper class there which is character resented,2023-11-18
when snow said they were just like 1719 in the movie i was taken aback  i thought they were all supposed to be portrayed as mid twenties,2023-11-28
"seriously he was 28 lol he didnt look 28

yes his dad did help him one time but he was punished as a peacekeper in district 12",2023-11-18
i havent seen the movie yet just finished the book but if you think serjanus was privileged then they did not do a good job of portraying his character in the movie he hated the capitol he was from district 2 and always considered himself aligned with the districts even though he was given tons of money he knew it was blood money he hated his father made money off district deaths and the war,2023-12-10
who is 28,2023-12-17
it doesnt matter he found himself in a position that went against his morals,2023-11-25
that doesnt make him privileged he didnt ask for the privileges he didnt ask to participate in this twisted game you can hardly blame him,2023-11-25
so glad to know i’m not the only one who thought that could’ve had more character development if this girl would just shut up for a minute,2023-12-27
"i agree and disagree 

it could use the extra time but im against splitting movies especially since its a prequel",2023-11-28
apples and oranges,2023-11-18
in the book you get to hear how the reason he comforted his dying classmate was to look good for the cameras,2023-11-23
ooh ill have to read this then those are the bits i was wanting to see more of i was so confused at the end of the movie when he was given the scholarship  why would they be so generous to him there was also the implication that he stood to inherit their fortune which makes much more sense in light of the context now,2023-11-19
i thought it was communicated well through the onetwo punch with the picture and the fact that he was the one who got sejanus killed like the reward for his actions was there imo,2023-12-01
i am not a clever man honestly just wanted a quick reddit review comparing it in quality to the rest of the series missed the  thread title,2023-12-12
to be fair in his whole life his dad did always recuse him or friends,2023-11-17
"beautifully worded 

i love how this movie dealt with realistic depictions of human beings in different roles they weren’t shown as saints and devils they were realistic complex young people who are conflicted about so many things and having their own struggles fears contradictions and things that they love and other things that they love more which make them give up on what they love a bit less

not to mention the massive impact of upbringing family values government propaganda and manipulation and personal responsereaction to those elements around them no one is fully selfless nor should they be but there were degrees of how someone is willing to bend rules or justify certain means for their own ends 

yes sejanus’ fear doesn’t take away anything from his concern and activism and this isn’t anything against him but he was brought up rich and always got himself into trouble and had his family’s wealth and power to shield him he’s always been sheltered from the consequences others’ faced and he didn’t take advantage of that in a malicious way

but when you’re not used to something and reality suddenly sets in your survival instinct speaks louder than the composure and determination you wanted so much to think that you’ve had

as someone from iraq people where i’m from including children who grew up during the war and its aftermath with all the ongoing explosions have become quite desensitized to the sound of bombings or the news of somebody’s death or kidnapping that it all became just another daily occurrence at the time 

you could be an avid activist from a western country who genuinely cares but you actually go and live there and you might not be able to withstand the fear of actually being there it doesn’t mean you were fake it just means living through it is nothing like watching videos of it 

and it also doesn’t mean the people from there have become heartless savages or violent people no they’re very much human beings capable of the most passionate love empathy fear joy and all kinds of human emotions it’s just that they got used to seeing this terror on daily basis to the point where it became the norm they don’t think it’s ok they don’t accept it they just understand that they can’t do anything about it and that it’s common to the point where the struggles of the people of the capitol are so small compared to what they faced 

i love them for depicting these details so realistically here",2023-11-18
his daddy always bought him out of trouble before,2023-11-18
he grew up in 2 so wealthy they were able to buy their way into the capital,2023-11-18
i also think it goes to show how new the games are and how many loopholes could happen lol like in modern hunger games they have to get out of their old clothes and use skin tight clothes to show they can’t bring anything or try to cheat like how the hunger games have improved over the years and i thought that was cool lol,2023-12-16
not one you could use in a blood bath type fight though,2023-11-22
i felt better about it in the book she gathered the rat poison herself snow just gave her his mothers compact as a token of his affection and vaguely hinted that should could put something cough cough wink wink in it she went about gathering the rat poison in it herself still cheating sure but not as extreme,2023-12-28
it technically only led to 2 kills the only beneficial one was of the lumberjack who obviously was a strong fighter but the tuberculosis girl was never a threat at all so really it wasnt majorly impactful depending on how great the lumberjack may have been i think it was a matter of time before lumberjack would have turned on the red headed psycho girl so eventually it could have been lucy gray vs lumberjack and snakes would have won that battle anyway,2024-01-01
can someone think on the companies please yeesh,2024-01-01
"i think that the song just represents the icon of resistance that lucy has become on panem  it doesnt matter the ending her icon prevails

so no clues on what happens to her",2023-12-15
"im here im there im everywhere

im roy kent",2024-03-15
they are connected since katniss knows the hanging tree song which lucy wrote i think its theorised that katniss was descended from the covey,2023-12-20
"it wasn’t a word lucy made up it was another word for the root but i can’t remember if it was a word from like lucy’s family or just common i’m leaning on wanting to say it was common 

i just see it’s been over a week with no answer so figured i’d give the best answer i could",2023-12-19
"the cabin was already there as we see the outside of it when they go swimming

i think the change started to happen when snow accidentally revealed he had killed 3 people rather then 2 and lied to her about the third she knew she couldn’t trust him then",2023-12-22
she said above all even love she values trust he lied to her about the third person he killed and then she realised she couldn’t trust him not to  her as she was a loose end for him to ever get back home someone in this thread also mentioned he always kept telling her to ‘run’ in the film and in the end that’s what she did,2024-01-17
he was sad about getting sejanus murdered but also justified it to himself that he didnt know that hed be hung he was doing it to protect sejanus,2023-11-18
"i feel like on the other side the people in his life just kept letting him down 

sejanu seemed even more selfish and his entitled upbringing  gave him little to no other thoughts about the actions of his consequences snow probably figured his parents could just buy him out of trouble like they have his entire life and so far they have",2023-11-18
the internal tussle was nicely alluded to by his cousins remarks about his eyes and then at the end saying he looked just like father,2023-11-19
i loved the conflictedness,2023-11-20
agree it is more obvious in the book it was always about reclaiming is name and title and position as a snow,2023-11-18
yes this is the right answer i do think there could have been a better job fleshing this out in the movie but this is what the story is going for not that he’s devoid of emotion and a sociopath,2023-11-26
which is the whole point collins conveys anyone can be led to evil it’s not that snows a unique sociopath or something,2023-11-29
"i just dont buy that they only way to stop sejanus was to  him and to  him by informing on him  

plus if hes gonna be an informer he can just tell the commandant right there  he doesnt have to go thru the rigamarole of prepping a mockingjay and sending it all the way to gaul just go that mean captainguy who loves hanging traitors done",2023-12-21
100,2023-12-31
love this explanation but this sounds literally like anakin sky walker he did care about his own padme and obi wan but succumbed to the dark side,2023-12-21
"definitely agree there are different ways to interpret and rereading my comment  i don’t side with the camp that lucy was manipulating him the whole movie 

i feel like there’s tells indicating both that she was working him and that she’s just a genuine person who loves hard the whole film as you said  leaves it open to interpretation

i could see it being her tricking him the whole time or she’s truthful and the second her trust breaks she fears him and leaves",2023-11-17
its very ambiguous in the book as well  i actually thought it made a little more sense in the movie  the third part of the book kind of drags and then in the last few chapters its like someone slams the gas pedal down,2023-11-18
that’s what i thought too because of the fact that she knows he lied and has killed three people and she puts trust above everything,2023-11-21
interesting maybe that’s why he was so mad about katnis faking her love for peta at first,2023-11-23
"while reading this i thought about the scene where crassus tells snow he wont be getting the money and says something along the lines of “now we’ll see whether you really want her to win” i think this somewhat proves that snow loved her

also the line at the end where he says he realized what you love most is what destroys you is also proof she destroyed him and made him into what he became",2023-12-10
the issue with this is that sociopaths don’t develop sociopathy it’s innate in who they are from birth,2023-11-19
your post was simultaneously informative and well thought out while being completely incomprehensible,2024-02-03
i read the book maybe he was a sociopath that only cared for himself,2024-01-03
from the very beginning of the movie where he is looking for his shirt i knew something was clearly off and letting his classmate get bitten was another major sign he really could have saved her before she put her hand in,2023-12-21
i don’t feel so sure that he would have killed her at all if lucy had just played it cool he’s only driven to that after she betrays him,2023-11-24
it’s cause he wasn’t rich yet in this book “broke people should never laugh”,2024-01-06
yeah but they didnt get it it seems trust is the main factor there he breaks her trust if someone is lost in that scene i felt like reminding them about the trust scene is like step number 1 lol,2023-11-22
i think you explained it well  its ambiguous in the book too but the book is entirely from snows point of view but we know he is an unreliable narrators so you are left wondering about lucys true intentions,2023-11-18
then dont comment  you seem to know nothing at all,2023-11-26
part of me wonders why no one volunteered for her,2023-11-19
when shes asking if they all can go home now  i think her casting is perfect to make us the audience hate the capitol even more than we already did,2023-11-26
true the capitol’s rhetoric throughout this movie reminded me a lot of the rhetoric from the israel government lately but you didn’t hear that from me,2023-11-19
all i could think about during the movie was how the world is turning a blind eye on palestinian children right now but will watch this movie and be horrified,2023-11-24
this i was saying to my dad and then my friend how pertinent the message of dehumanising ppl makes humans so dangerous and terrifying was,2023-12-06
war is brutal and humans convince themselves they need to fight and  like you said humans justify alot i always say this when im playing poker poker players lie to themselves more than lie to anyone else which is unbelievably true in poker but also in life being self aware and have a basic understanding of the facts or the truth appears to be more rare than it should be humans dance with ideas and convince themselves of various lies its real wild its almost as if humans have an addiction to fantasy or an addiction to having a confirmation bias that they are always right even when evidence proves them wrong like an egotistical operationdisease i think we saw this development in snow very much too snow always ends up on top he declared right before poisoning that midget dude you know what i mean,2024-01-01
"they never show her dying because they were desperate to hide as much violence as possible to maintain some pgrating another issue i had with this movie 

but i swear they ran after her and then flickerman announces her death i must be misremembering but i was surprised when she was still alive like 34 way through the hunger games",2023-11-18
snow even says in the first movie give them a spark of hope and you can control them,2023-11-29
" katniss even kills the leader of the rebel army just to get back at her for killing her sister

katniss killed coin because she realized coin would be no better than snow not because she wanted to “get back at her” lol",2023-11-19
tigris snows cousin also appear in mockingjay and was described as looking very animalesque exoticlike so definitely plastic surgery is something future capitol indulge in,2023-12-24
the two men have different first names which suggests a generational gap,2024-01-05
tigris had her limits though and i did notice that they were starting to hint at that towards the end she’s much colder towards him at the end than she was in the beginning i think it sets the stage for her later in the series reminder to anyone rusty a much older tigris works with katniss in mockingjay as one of the rebels against the capitol,2023-11-19
i don’t agree that we don’t see conflict i think blythe’s performance was actually really well done in the small subtle reactions of the character even when he was playing the recording there was very clear to me struggle internally even if not a lot of time passed,2023-11-25
let me introduce you to how a comment section works,2023-11-19
yeap life itself is the hunger games i think thats the main theme of the movie,2023-11-23
thats not how i saw it yes he left the cabin with the gun but he headed towards the boats thinking lucy would be waiting for him there to escape together when he realized she was gone he started getting suspicious and searching for her however it was only when he got bit by the snake which lucy set up that he went berserk thinking she betrayed him,2023-11-27
indeed he wasn’t “born bad” like most people aren’t born bad he’s just a product of his own circumstances and ultimately his own choices accordingly,2023-11-18
"no in the book someone else was going to shoot her and was blocked so snow shot her instead it was completely deliberate in both cases

however iirr they actually had mayfair explicitly tell the rebels that she would get them all hanged in the film so snow had an even stronger motive",2023-11-18
shooting mayfair is a poor example imo she was credibly threatening to have them all hanged,2023-11-25
i mean highbottom was intentionally and actively trying to ruin his life and his family with poverty it’s not hard to believe at that point when he’s already killed three people that he’d  his enemy too especially if you can justify it with highbottom being someone who was addicted to drugs and had nothing to live for hated his life and his role in the games etc,2023-11-24
whenever he had a choice he made the selfish choice,2023-11-18
this is the answer see what ultimately happens to tigris in mockingjay at some point between the two moviesbooks he gets rid of her when shes no longer useful,2023-11-29
it was his own  that was evident in the books,2023-11-18
absolutely   but i think he knew snows father was a cold and violent man and he saw the potential for coriolanus to be the same way  it was interesting that they added that line that highbottom says to lucy  im glad you survived him,2023-11-18
"i think it absolutely was but the ending scene makes it a little bit more muddy i think he held a huge grudge against his father because of what he did when they were both in school and i think he was taking it out on coryo much more than was proportionate he seemed to have a personal vendetta against somebody who never did anything to him 

and i think his guilt over having been the one to come up with the games was eating him alive and it was spilling over into his anger against the snows",2023-11-19
"i dont think he was mean at all he certainly seems mean in the beginning but he accurately pegged snow as being as much of a monster as his father and was trying to stop him from getting more power and influence 

lets not forget that hes headmaster of the academy and might be more familiar with coryo than we know its possible hed already seen some of his essays and known exactly how little coryo cared about the people from the districts",2023-11-26
the book is 100 from snows point of view so you get his internal monologue and it makes more sense,2023-11-18
"actually i just looked it up it was rat poison apparently lol but i suppose they could have some very potent rat poison in their time 

i just finished the movie minutes ago makes me wanna go watch the trilogy again since i barely remember them",2023-12-24
definitely could be i believe the books actually say that caesar does have a soft spot for the tributes and it’s genuine or very strongly alludes to,2023-12-21
how far in the future are we what’s going on in the rest of the world,2023-11-19
"as someone who currently lives in north carolina and has a lot of friends who grew up in the appalachian region which is strictly just the western third of north carolina they have really strong country accents 

i also have family from west virginia and i grew up here and yeah",2023-11-19
it was atrocious,2023-11-20
the movies called the ballad of songbirds and snakes what were you expecting exactly,2023-11-30
i understand that but to automatically attribute every criticism of the movie or her acting to the person having a personal basis towards rachel is silly the movie can be criticized purely based on what made it fall short,2023-11-24
just because it was in the books doesn’t mean it translated well on film,2023-11-24
i know it is i said the performances were jarring and i dont think rachel had the same charm as her book counterpart,2023-11-23
they both have blonde curls and blue eyes,2023-11-26
what ways didn’t make sense,2023-11-19
we are discussing the book,2023-11-28
"no they are talking about the book

i mean the book is the same way first parts had room to breathe but then it becomes plot point after plot point ending in a very quick 180 from snow",2023-11-26
boo,2023-11-26
i thought this movie was better than any of the others except the original,2023-11-29
no worries  i didnt word it the best lol,2023-11-21
not to mention sounding kinda possessive when talking about love is the case for most teenagers in their first real relationship,2023-11-19
shhh its easier for people to just dismiss him as a sociopath than to confront the hard truth that regular normal people can come to do great evil through circumstances that push them that way,2023-11-28
"yeah the interesting part is he does have all the good things in him but he wants power and prestige more it takes the plot of the book to teach him that he really does want to  the good part in him because his ambition is in reach

when hes failing he thinks hes been killing himself trying to live up to his family name and the flashy things he wants but losing isnt actually that bad he does like lucy the covey the simplicity but it isnt perfect he has biases and discomforts he would need to work through he could if he tried 

but the chance at officer school and attention from gaul rekindles the hunger and he chooses to pursue that instead",2023-11-27
a  who knew things no less,2023-11-25
"the audience would have turned out in droves to see it regardless especially if it was the finale and yeah im sure they could have fit mockingjay into 3 hours just truncate the first film into 7080 mins perhaps then the second into the next 100 mins im sure theres a fanedit out there that does this

i feel like even beyond them not wanting to make a long movie they just didnt want to either not include stuff from the book or just cash in on this trend that would make them loads more money",2023-11-18
i think if you havent read it the movie wont make as much sense it could also be that this plot just wasnt for you lucy gray is meant to be a performer and the story isnt action heavy like the original moviebooks,2023-12-25
"that’s one change i didn’t love how highbottom’s “contacts” say she disappeared her fate much more ambiguous in the book and it’s meant to be

she sings a song about someone with the same name lucy grey it’s actually a poem from ralph waldo emerson and in the poem that lucy grey’s fate is also ambiguous if you remember snow ask her if she thinks the lucy grey in the song survived and she does we’re never supposed to know if she gets away or dies 

personally i don’t think gaul took her or was involved with lucy greg’s fate but it is sort of man behind the curtain because gaul did orchestrate this whole thing a bit she asked snow how his summer was and said she wanted him to experience the real world and wasn’t going to “let you sit around doing nothing taking care of your curls” or something to that effect she was always going to bring snow back that’s how she knew he was coming back",2023-11-17
agree  im thinking of what could have made the movie better than its hard to because it is based on a bookbut for some more kissing lol for others more motivational explanation to what happened in the snow change and lucy gray and overall more connections to the first hunger games movie but all of these have a reason for not being in the movie,2023-11-20
i know it’s hard to include multiple songs in a movie without making it come across as musicallike but i think it was mostly because rachel has such a heavy musical theater background it just stuck out she does have an amazing voice though,2023-11-18
why are you so mad ,2023-12-04
she is covey they all sing it made sense for the character anyone else yeah okay a bit weird but it fit well,2023-12-04
"sorry it didnt catch you  i was fully invested and i havent spoken to many who didnt at least enjoy it  i know some who were defintely invested in snow because they thought hes   like i see so many talking about the shirtless scenes and why they did this when snow is evil 

i liked it but hey the good news is since its a prequel you can always skip it  i do think they will make something again down the line one day",2023-11-20
not really there’s plenty of blood and wounds in the first one,2023-11-23
yeah i know you were i was just saying it makes no sense,2023-11-18
unless its asteroid city somehow,2023-11-29
i was more so talking about the through line of goul beginning the capitolcontrolled games and plutarch ending the games both being the head game maker no not everyone in 75 years will fit the bill lol,2023-12-13
im not sure but maybe it was because they were starved prior to the games snow had to bring lucy gray food in the zoo,2023-12-24
she was war minister,2023-12-14
ahhhh internal monologue because theres not two people duh i feel dumb word im stoked thanks for the insight buddy,2023-12-03
yeah i agree i just remember snow saying something along the lines of blah blah i got my problems but your dad will just buy you out of trouble as usual or something along those lines,2023-11-18
in the books his dad did more than make money his dad was a weapons manufacturer and sided with the capitol over his own district to supply them guns in the war he was rewarded by being able to move to the capitol with his family and became one of the richest men this also ties back to the snow family since they were also weapon manufacturers but in the destroyed 13th district,2023-11-25
i mean they described that exactly in the movie pretty well,2023-11-19
the movie did a horrible job of character development specifically sejanus,2023-11-22
he was the presidents son in the movie,2023-11-25
he doesnt look 28 but he also doesnt look 17 snows actor was also 28 btw,2023-11-18
you dont have to ask for privilege to be privileged tf like being born a rich kid is a privilege,2023-11-25
some movies need to be split up into two parts so being against it is pretty ,2024-02-21
how so the person who replied to me said that the movie was already 25 hours implying that they couldn’t really squeeze stuff from the book in without making the runtime longer to which i said that a long runtime isn’t really a problem and cited movies to prove my point i wouldn’t have minded at all if tbosas were a 3 hr 30 min movie lol,2023-11-19
what page number is that,2023-11-29
yes his relationship with the plinths is more fleshed out in the book too since ma plinth ends up seeing him as a sort of “second son” since he’s sejanus’ best friend she even cooks and packs him food too he has a short interaction with strabo plinth but you get the vibe that strabo wishes his son would be more like snow which is basically why the plinths essentially adopt snow and his family in all but name after sejanus’ death the plinth fortune is a big reason why snow is able to enter university and why he’s so wealthy by the time we see him in katniss’ era,2023-11-20
movie discussions are not the place to find quick reviews if you don’t wanna get spoiled my guy movie discussions are a thing because we specifically want to discuss spoilers and things that happened in the movie check rottentomatoes or imdb next time,2023-12-12
that is a good detailed response i think he was just unprepared to die,2023-11-18
that is a good detailed response i think he was just unprepared to die,2023-11-18
sure but a weapons a weapon she eventually got the opportunity to use it you cant exactly use a land mine on a whim either but im pretty sure people would consider that a weapon if you came into the arena with it,2023-11-26
it’s a common name that district names their kids after plants a lot,2023-12-22
i moreso saw it as he sent the jabberjay to protect himself and hoped that maybe sejanus father would buy him out of trouble as is always the case,2023-11-20
yeah im surprised by a lot of comments in this thread saying snow was a straight up sociopath he warned sejanus multiple times that if he continued cooperating with the rebels both of them would get caught he even said out loud that sejanus might get bailed out by his rich dad but he would 100 get hanged im sorry but if my best friend was doing dangerous  and got me involved despite me warning him multiple times i would turn my back on him as well,2023-11-18
yep  and from his perspective he thought lucy let him down and betrayed him too,2023-11-18
i noticed this too right when she said that i thought back to when she said his father always had hate in his eyes,2023-12-10
yeah i loved it too people here are hating on it because its not what the books showed i guess i cant really have a say in it because ive never read the books and havent even watched the series just watched the original movie a long time ago but if it just started out with snow being evil from the get go it would have been much worse a large majority of the emotion would have been ripped away,2023-12-10
this was not conveyed at all in the movie until the very last scene it was all about the money and taking care of his family really spoiled his evilness and made his cousins turn at the end make zero sense,2023-11-21
i think in the book he comes to think she was playing him the whole time  but we know hes an unreliable narrator so we arent really sure in the end if she was or not,2023-11-18
i think the whole point of the laying lap scene next to the lake where she talks about trust is to go for the as soon as trust breaks she leaves interpretation,2023-12-17
"yeah they didnt have the scene where lucy says trust is more important to her than love for no reason

i think it was the scene where he said he killed three people that was the turning point for her you could tell she felt instantly betrayed because of how she begged him to tell her who it was

and when he says he killed his old self she realizes what he has become also if she was in love with him that version of him that she fell in love with is now gone killed

edit they did have the scene for some reason i typed didnt",2023-12-10
he became even madder when he couldn’t break peta and they both really fell in love,2023-12-09
"exactly so hes not a sociopath never once did the author say he was a sociopath shes just trying to show how anybody can become the monster that snow is the only true sociopath and all of the hunger games is the leader of district 13

no very much so has emotions and he has a conscience its just at a certain point as a human you reorganize your moral structure to wear your conscience doesnt work the same as everyone else",2023-11-19
wait i thought this was debunked,2023-11-24
the curses of the age of voice to text i think i even went back through and read through this and tried my best to make it seem comprehensible,2024-02-03
,2024-01-06
lol that’s unfortunate to hear one dimensional characters are boring,2024-02-03
i feel like that was entirely on her she lied for no reason and with no warning even though snow literally just helped her out,2023-12-24
i can see that too,2023-11-24
"i don’t think op’s confusion was due to not remembering a scene that played like 10 minutes before the one in question

you think op was like “what’s lucy’s deal it’s almost like she values trust or something” they obviously watched the film lol

it’s much more likely op was confused by lucy making the decision to run internally and that not being visually communicated to the audienceher true agenda being left open for interpretation the whole film",2023-11-22
check the sub you’re in  go back to eating paste,2023-11-26
i wonder if at this point in time they wasn’t a thing like i can see volunteering becoming popular when the games offered more prestigewealthpublicity but maybe for the first bunch of years it wasn’t allowed,2023-11-19
they probably didnt have volunteers then  there was no prestige for winning the games,2023-11-19
keep in mind that we dont know how a society like panem views people with disabilities,2023-11-25
a month late but the original hunger games book katniss talks about how no one really ever volunteers outside of the careers districts even when the kids are really young or disabled in katniss game theres a boy with a club foot no one volunteers for him as well as rue who is only 12,2023-12-28
the number of disabled tributes fits in with the reaping of lucy grey  there was no benefit in having someone that can win enter the games so many of the districts sent kids who they could live without because why not send the kid who would be taxing on your community poor wovy or the kid who is a problem instead of someone good  the mayors were doing the choosing,2023-11-26
that made me cry,2023-11-28
"i highly doubt it was intentional given that it’s an american blockbuster but they actually had a few good lines that felt directly relevant to the situation in gaza today

the part where they were talking about how “the fact that they lost a war 10 years ago doesn’t give you the right to treat them however you want now most of them were children or not alive yet during the war” felt very on the nose",2023-11-22
i got that too it has to be unintentional since the movie was written before americans started paying attention to palestine furthermore i think if the situation in gaza had already been talked about when the movie was written they probably would have shied away from those lines out of fear of being “political” and alienating zionist fans and industry executives,2023-11-29
yup very striking similarities,2023-11-20
ive been thinking this for weeks,2023-11-26
did everyone do that,2023-11-27
i beg you red some history on israel’s aggressions on the palestinians that mounts back to 1948 w the bamba gives a lot of context to this socalled “conflict”,2023-12-01
she got swamped by the snakes after they broke out of the big snake chamber,2023-11-18
they didn’t really hide that much violence though it was all just weirdly totally bloodless i haven’t watched the originals in a while but this seemed much more gruesome than i remembered those being but they kept the pg13 rating by just not having anyone bleed when they get speared with a trident,2023-11-20
exactly because she wanted her gone if prim hadnt died katniss wouldnt have done that,2023-11-19
ur right true,2024-01-05
"	she’s much colder towards him at the end than she was at the beginning

the line that sealed it at the very end was when she told him “you look just like your father” when earlier in the movie she mentions all she remembers about him is a deep look of hate",2023-11-19
yeah he spends a lot of time staring at the bird before he sends it to gaul the movie was far too long for that to be anything but a deliberate choice,2023-11-26
it seemed more harsh in the movie to me but at the same time it really showed how he had totally gone into full selfish survival mode  he was ready to mow down anyone who got in his way,2023-11-18
tbf most people would make the selfish choice to save their own life,2023-11-18
since she was a stylist on the games at one point i could see that storyline being explored if they ever do a film on the second quarter quell games,2024-01-10
"monsters are largely made not born his treatment of snow is directly responsible for much of snow’s progression into a worse and worse person and that’s just what we see on screen

he may have had somewhat good intentions by demeaning snow although i think vindictiveness was likely the primary motivation but those intentions helped pave snow’s road to  for him",2023-11-26
same problem i had with the hunger games movie the book was mostly in katniss head but they didnt show any of that,2023-11-18
hahaha i saw it in theatres with my mom then immediately went to her house and started watching the first movie definitely worth it with the new info on the capitol,2023-12-24
unspecified time in the future after climate change and nuclear wars i do not recall the outside world ever really being mentioned other than district 13,2023-11-19
"in this future there’s nuclear wars rising sea levels etc it’s assumed that the capitol usurped or replaced the us government there’s no mention of the rest of the world panem has a population of 19m people it’s assumed that the districts are surviving settlements from nuclear wars and that the capitol took over them an interesting note is that the capitol is located in colorado where the presidential bunker is situated 

it’s assumed other countries are either completely isolated or destroyed each other for example canada mexico and the us are all merged as panem 

the hunger games begin after district 13 rebels against the capitol dictatorship d13 controls nuclear weaponsenergy for 23 years the capitols resources were cut off from the districts which explains why some capitol residents were so poor d13 threatened mutual destruction with nuclear weapons so the capitol cedes them as an independent state this is also why snows family is broke most of their assets were invested in d13 weaponry",2023-11-20
"this movie the 10th games is about 220 years from future from today it’s not known exactly when the war happened and districts formed but we saw the civil war in the beginning when snow was a child

katniss goes to the 74th and 75th games",2023-12-20
"i like to imagine that the rest of the world has actually ticked on as usual and has completely severed all ties with the us because it went off the deep end after a civil war and now forces its children to engage in gladiatorial combat once a year

not as a “murica bad” thing more because the mental image of the rest of the world saying “we don’t talk to those freaks over there” is funny to me",2024-01-01
ballads can be entertaining and noncringey the act of singing isnt cringe but the way she overacted in certain scenes were,2023-12-01
she can do no right in the internets eyes  why would i not be suspicious that someone complaining about her on the internet is caught up in that nonsense  especially when online culture is adamant about not being a contrarian when someone is collectively hated,2023-11-25
because the prince is only in two scenes in the animated film  staring at her from afar then kissing and marrying her in the final scene are people arguing for the romance storyline not aware that that’s all it is in the 1937 version back when women were waiting around for a husband to give them a life that they couldn’t have solo  he’s probably in this story just as minimally and the film could exist without the prince  you don’t know what the new version is and it seems you don’t even know what the old version was,2023-12-21
probably a hundred million people have blonde curls and blue eyes they dont even remotely have the same face shape or bone structure,2023-11-26
the regression from revolutionary in the capital to nonviolent reformist in the districts felt like plot armor,2023-11-19
which is the whole point of the movie,2023-12-20
i really dont give a  dude,2023-11-18
yeah i’ve often wondered how i’d go about adapting it all into one movie i feel like you’d have to cut out a lot of the stuff about katniss’s ptsd and you’d have to make peeta’s rescue take place off screen like it did in the book it stings because i liked that stuff,2023-11-18
it makes sense it was just done bad the accent was bad the songs were bad it all seemed forced the rest was decent,2023-12-25
"i thought the connections to the og movies was perfect amount didnt feel like too many or too few

x200b

i wouldve wanted snows turn to evil to be a bit more gradual but i mean it wasnt like poorly done or anything it was still really well done but it couldve been great but other than that the movie as a whole was pretty great overall",2023-11-20
yeah i get what you mean for me i didnt really mind it since lucy gray is supposed to be a performer so i can look past the theater kid energy but i do get why that can be a hit or miss with people,2023-11-19
paid 50 to watch 25 hours of garbage,2023-12-04
 i mean im  and sure he was attractive but i came for a good film not shirtless men  maybe im dead inside but it done nothing for me like i wanted more hunger games and more action,2023-11-20
"haha i didn’t even mean to correct you or notice but your revelation makes it so funny

glad i could help though",2023-12-03
its very telling of snow who basically has no money and only his name left to him to snow serjanus has money  so automatically all of serjanus problems or moral conflicts are irrelevant simply because he has money to buy his way out even though serjanus genuinely wanted to make a difference,2023-11-19
thank you for sharing i couldn’t remember i wonder if they removed to avoid controversy of weapons  guns opinions,2023-11-25
yeah they just kind of told you he is mad and you should believe him for that no driving force behind it,2023-11-22
it is not really a privilege more like corruption he wasnt born into privilege his father got lucky then pretended he was capitol and tried to force his son into his way of thinking,2023-11-26
i don’t think the hunger games has the same pull as a scorsese movie,2023-11-19
i mean realistically it only wouldve taken an extra 510 minutes of footage to set up that relationship,2023-11-25
pg13 movies wont ever be 3 hours long general audience wont be bother to see a movie that long,2023-11-20
no idea i listened to the audiobook but i think that event happens near the end of part 1,2023-11-29
that is indeed true to put it shortly he wasn’t prepared to die i don’t think anyone ever truly is but it’s just that the district people are just way more used to this consequence than he probably ever was,2023-11-18
yeah or at least thats what he says  cant truly know what his intentions were,2024-01-03
this is what i took from it too because prior to this on a few occasions he was warning sejanus of the consequences of nonconformity,2024-01-08
"all of yall empathizing with a manipulative and selfish character is beyond me 

that dangerous  was a noble attempt at wanting to help oppressed and impoverished people 

yall know snow is a murderous sociopath right",2023-12-13
now i havent read the book this was based on but this is absolutely my read with snow in this movie lucy gray pretty much spells it out for us near the end of the film when she says everyone is inherently born good its just the world and the circumstances surrounding a person that turns them evil he warned sejanus multiple times that he was playing revolutionary with safety nets a luxury that he doesnt have what the  else was he gonna do at that point also with lucy gray i believe he was genuine with his feelings and really wanted to elope with her at the end of the movie but they ended up betraying each other he didnt intentionally set out to be a sociopath its just that the world made him that way,2024-01-06
"how by running away

im sorry but thats basically complete narcissism its not like she could actually go back to the authorities to rat him out she would be hanged too 

he just couldnt accept that she wanted to leave him and would rather  her than accept that reality",2023-11-20
an odd change i thought they made was having the song “the hanging tree” just be an existing song lucy gray was singing to herself rather than one she actually wrote herself as was the reveal in the book that she wrote it about snow himself telling him the “you” she spoke of to meet her at the hanging tree where “they strung up a man” sejanus “they say who murdered three” also snow though lucy gray didn’t know that when she wrote it the reason hearing the song again at the end somocked him having been it now being sung with that context,2024-01-10
agree didnt notice it but because i read the book i understood a few lines about being presidnt of panem or how he was rich and had position would have made the difference,2023-11-22
i never read the book but the movie definitely choooss to show he started good all the way until things got out of hand,2023-12-02
i just finished the book yesterday i got the feeling that he was trying to excuse his desire to murderleave her behind so he fixated on her taking advantage of her when that just wasnt the case,2023-12-28
in the book though i remember feeling she  him over i need to reread i guess,2023-12-31
they did have the scene of lucy saying trust us more important,2023-12-11
oooh yes,2023-12-09
wouldnt say one dimensional was a great book read it ,2024-02-03
it is the life and death that heavily should weigh even if someone is lying to get a better grade and favor shouldnt mean letting them get seriously hurt or killed snow could have stopped her before she put her hand in and come clean i dont think snow wanted to help her because it is another foreshadowing how he will sacrifice another person in order to gain power and attention he knew she would be caught and aided her in her fatal tragedy,2023-12-24
"she states clearly trust for me is everything stronger than love if i could no longer trust you youd be dead to me

if someone watches that scene and gets confused what happens im gonna assume they have forgotten the trust scenedidnt pay too much attention at it because otherwise theres little room for confusion

im just used to people forgetting key things unless they have a reminder immediately in the scene ",2023-11-22
i guess but also wasn’t katniss the first volunteer for her district if my sister had disabilities and was that young i wanna say i’d volunteer,2023-11-19
yes in the book the victor and their district getting money food and a house is a new idea introduced by snow in the epilogue specifically to encourage volunteers for future games and pit the districts against one another,2023-12-20
"true while out of universe the reason there are less disabled or main characters who become disabled after the first movie but don’t is because it would be a hindrance in the filming 

but in universe i don’t find it hard to believe that they  undesirables",2023-11-25
i dont think the mayors were supposed to be choosing just that the mayors daughter got her dad to rig the district 12 reaping so that lucy would be picked but i dont think thats necessarily the norm,2023-11-28
yeah that line hit hard for me,2023-11-28
the difference being that hamas actually restarted a war on oct 7 and that israel has done more for palestine and palestinians than hamas ever has,2023-11-28
"israel’s aggressions on the palestinians that mounts back to 1948

you mean when israel defended itself because all the surrounding arab nations joined together to launch an attack the day they declared independence and became a nation",2024-01-12
it was heartbreaking she thought she was going home but no just death by snakes,2023-11-19
i noticed she called him by his full name and not by coryo by her last scene,2023-11-23
i mean i dont know if i could shoot someone like he did and i hope im never put in such a position but i dont think shooting someone who is credibly threatening to have you your lover and three other people executed for something you didnt even do is really that unreasonable,2023-11-18
it really reinforces dr gauls message to snow dr gaul believed everyone was  when it came down to it and snow ends up believing her because thats what he did when his neck was on the line,2023-12-18
in the movie didnt lucy say she was going up north to escape the capitol so im assuming up north means canada and that she was trying to get out of panem completely,2023-11-22
you could have said the first hunger games happen in 30 years and it wouldnt surprise me,2024-01-07
have you read the book rachel actually toned down lucy gray significantly from how she was written originally,2023-12-01
all i’m saying is i just didn’t like the movie and i didn’t know anything about rachel’s controversy beforehand ’,2023-11-25
the book does not describe their bone structures,2023-11-26
"i feel like he was never that revolutionary he was always a non violent anti violence observer at no point in the movie has he ever expressed being ok with violence of anyone 

he was opposed to capitol violence but is also opposed to rebel violence",2023-11-19
if it means no president snow on loop and them constantly talking about peeta then id be fine with shortening peeta related material the ptsd i think could fit in one film showing the impact throughout maybe amp up the ending since mockingjays climax plus its end is fairly uneventful and low key,2023-11-18
"
okay  thats just personal preference i thought she was a standout and i loved everything about it i think it was good you can think it was bad its subjective",2023-12-25
why did you pay 50 ,2023-12-04
ok that makes more sense then  like i had said it isnt a hg movie  its a snow movie  so it makes sense why you wouldnt like it    that makes a lot more sense because people who read the book loved it and a lot of casual fans were rooting for snow not realizing he was the actual bad snow lol  it honestly only works if you are invested in the actor character  so makes sense,2023-11-20
" even though serjanus genuinely wanted to make a difference

i think this is also up to debate as well did he really want to make a difference or was he just suicidal with guilt what does dying in the arena accomplish after his mentee who hated him dies look at his reaction to the rebels having guns did he ever want to make change or did he want to alleviate his guilt",2023-11-19
"it’s more of snow having to fight claw and be perfect to move a step forward meanwhile richie rich can just break rules left and right while daddy buys him out 

anyone that’s faced hunger and the pressure snow was constantly under would feel the same",2023-11-19
"yup and ive read a lot of weird interpretations as to his motivations a lot of which result in him not being seen as a sympathetic character which is pretty upsetting to read like for example hes just a privileged kid who thinks hes free of all consequences for his actions or ideas almost in a way suggesting he deserved an incredible betrayal costing him everything lol 

hes deeply conflicted and isolated as he feels like a stranger among his peers but would also be a stranger among his district 2 peers as well i assume he received most of his worldview mostly from his ma who by all accounts seems to be a prototypical good person thats my understanding anyway i think hes an idealist and courageous i dont think his actions and thoughts were purposeless or done without thought he is arguably the most important character in the book in my eyes and to see him barely get screen time left me thinking people who see the movie cant possibly understand snows psyche other than at a very surface level of snow bad  


ive seen a lot of people come away from the movie like snow is doing what he has to in order to survive but hes choosing to do so without much remorse after a short consideration he really shouldnt be seen as much more than a true evil  obviously this is all imo",2023-11-22
" yeah they just kind of told you he is mad and you should believe him for that no driving force behind it

i just watched the movie didnt read the book honestly i think the movie did a pretty good job establishing his feelings and motivations its made clear from the beginning that hes an outcast among his supposed peers because hes from district 2 not the capitol he straight up spells it out that he got assigned to his old friend because they want to show him that he can no longer be any kind of friend to anyone of district 2 ever again to show him that he doesnt belong there anymore 

then you get his genuine care for his friend in like 2 or 3 scenes i dont know i dont think you need to see more to understand why hes vehemently antihunger games and anticapitol do you",2024-01-07
"by any definition sejanus enjoys societal and financial privilege over the people in the districts during the events of the moviebooks everyone in the capitol does doesnt matter that he at one point wasnt privileged

privilege however is neither good nor bad in and of itself if you use your privilege for bad then you are a bad person if you use your privilege for good then you are a good person sejanus routinely uses his privilege for good so he is a good person who is also privileged",2023-11-29
yeah hunger games is more interesting,2023-11-19
hunger games probably makes more money than typical scorsese movie,2023-12-17
king kong 2005 was pg13 and 3 hours long lots of people went to see that all three lotr movies are each 3 hours long and were all pgpg13 the return of the king was literally nearly 3 and a half hours long,2023-11-20
yes the district are used to dealing with it regularly like beatings and executions poor guy wasnt ready to handle the consequences,2023-11-18
the fact that snow turned out to be a murderous sociopath later on in his life has no bearing on his actions in this specific film none of what he did in this film would be considered sociopathic except for killing highbottom in the end in fact i would wager that most people would do exactly what he did if they were in his position faced with those circumstances,2023-12-13
he was 100 a sociopath from the very beginning of the movie and you are completely correct,2023-11-22
"i mean the book was also a slow burn into the decent of evil 

sure he justified a lot of actions with if i do this it will
help me too but that doesn’t make someone bad",2024-01-11
i mean the book is from snows point of view  he ended up feeling like she played him but its debatable whether she actually did or not  we only have his pov to judge from,2023-12-31
i bet what you mean but given how far the gamemaster was willing to go in the first place he could’ve easily got himself injured or killed too i don’t think being scared in a scary situation is a red flag however what is kinda concerning to me is the fact that he was even able to write that paper in the first place after having someone die in his arms earlier that day i think one of the background characters even commented on that too,2023-12-24
im sure youd love to say that yes how many people are willing to actually die for a kid that isnt their sibling heck even a sibling,2023-11-21
in the first book katniss mentions greasy sae has a mentally disabled granddaughter who the residents of district 12 treat as some sort of pet and toss her scraps and things so likely they don’t go out of their way for them but view them as pretty harmless but district 12 is the most neglected district so i can’t say how they’re viewed anywhere else in panem,2023-11-26
"they werent supposed to but obviously were able to maybe some of them rigged the reaping to send the disabled kids just to be able to justify their own participation in the horrors for themselves im invisibly disabled and have experienced how some people shift how they value me in mere seconds after finding out 

eugenics runs deep in our culture and the leap isnt far from babies with disabling syndromes shouldnt be born to if two of the kids has to die it should be those who would have shorter lifespan expectancies anyway just look at the millions poured into geneticsprevention research compared to how little is spent on life quality research and practical support for disabled folks",2023-12-04
"you cant be serious right the country that purposefully keeps gazans on the brink of starvation and controls their electricity water and movement  

you in the hunger games the rebels actually restarted the war when they bombed the arena and the capitol has done more for the districts than the rebels ever have",2023-11-29
 same i staerted crying the actress did such a good job,2023-12-29
agreed and it was all happening so fast i think he panicked,2023-11-19
"completely agree and when you consider the setting that these people are incredibly oppressed by the capital and only have each other to rely on a snitch is a threat to everyone technically

it was cold how he smoothly picked up the gun and pulled the trigger sure but the killing itself was selfdefense tbh",2023-11-19
literally like his actions were super understandable and valid,2023-11-29
canada and mexico are also included as parts of panem but it could be that the far northern parts of north america like northern quebec are uninhabited,2023-11-23
agree with ufunnyunfunny and ive read the book,2024-02-17
same situation for me i don’t have twitter or tik tok didn’t know a single thing about her beforehand didn’t know of any controversy absolutely did not like her performance,2023-11-28
fair enough  you might not have twitter  her name was trending for days and thats when i realized shes being unfairly targeted  your criticism being unrelated is a relief,2023-11-25
that last sentence is the perfect way to say what felt like plot armor lol,2023-11-19
ok,2023-11-18
movie and food cad currency btw,2023-12-04
"he was so divorced from the realities of the world he was living in due to the money his father had and while he tried to make things better for those around him he never comprehended what any of it really meant

he wasnt resolute enough to stand with the rebels because he never thought he could ever be at risk because all of his prior incidents in his life were fixed by someone else his fathers money or in the area coriolanus intervening 

he was lulled into a false sense of security to not be careful to not be fearful and he died because of it",2023-11-20
hmm between the poor snow who manipulated gaslit used and threw away people  some of whom genuinely cared for him  for his own ends versus the privileged kid who genuinely wants to help people in probably the most idealistic and frustratingly naive way ill take serjanus anyday thank you,2023-11-20
really you’re going to criticize serjanus who could have lived a life of luxury and instead chose to give it all up and his life he gained nothing by his choices,2023-11-23
"just watched the movie didn’t read the book but i did read the og trilogy and saw those movies as well 

my gf who didn’t read any of the books but has seen all the movies and i both came to the same conclusion basically that snow chose a comfortable life over lucysejanus and his actions in the later half reflected that i definitely didn’t get that he did what he had to do to survive 

if anything i think the weirdest part of the movie to me was the lucysnow romance it felt very forced especially on her end",2023-11-24
as to your last paragraph people are coming away from the movie with the same attitude as coryo then he justifies everything he has done by telling himself he had to do it to survive but it’s just an excuse and he becomes more and more immune to guilt,2023-11-22
i thought the intro of all the students handled this well maybe its a bit more muddled later in the movie but i think coriolanus motivations are much more muddled towards the end in the movie than sejanus,2023-12-17
from the book they go into his family history that his family profited off the war by selling weapons or something which is the only reason they got to move to the capitol so he had this new fancy life but at the expense of the old district his was from which was literally killing his friends,2024-01-07
thank you explaining this people forget that privelege doesnt make you a bad person this is why some people get triggered by the phrase white privelege because they think you assumed you lived a life a of luxury by virtue of your skin colourit doesnt btw like your life may of been awful because of your low income but you dont have the added boon of race holding you back too,2023-12-07
yes that makes a lot of sense agree with you,2023-11-29
but less prestigious,2023-11-19
maybe a decade ago,2023-12-17
exceptions that proves the rule theres a reason 2 hours is the industry standard theres already some complaints about the movie being too long,2023-11-21
"i hear you im coming from a perspective of someone who read the book which has a front row seat to his narcissism and sociopathy so that gave me a different insight into the film adaption and acting choices through lots of internal dialogue 

trust me he is an entitled murderous sociopath 

it saddens to me to think most people would do what he did what a shame humanity would really be in that case",2023-12-13
eh if he was a sociopath at the beginning i dont think hed have worked so hard to try to feed and keep a roof over his familys head and let his grandma eat his only food when he was starving same with stuff like letting his gf take credit for his hunger games ideas he even willingly gave her the bullet points,2024-03-15
your thinking is weird weird,2023-12-02
it didnt come across to me that he was scared of the game master but i can see how some people might empathize with that,2023-12-26
especially if you’re in a situation where you knew your family basically relied on you to survive,2023-11-21
there are a lot of people who say theyd  for their kids if anyone ever assaulted them the majority of parents whove had their childrens lives turned upside down dont actually end up murdering the perpetrator all those school shooters the worst theyll undergo will be in prison people do say stuff like this often but real life is complicated and not everyone acts on their feeling slile they think they would,2023-11-22
the reapings are definitely rigged at least by katniss’ time she mentions in the books that the children of victors seem to get picked far too often for it to be chance,2023-12-05
why is israel obliged to provide electricity and water to gaza their hamas government should be providing those things,2023-12-05
"yeah it really seems like the districts are relatively isolated settlements just enough to provide for the capitols needs in whatever industry and very actively kept from growing beyond their mission d12 only does coal so if they ever  the only food tech and anything else can be cut off from far away 

also lines up with how 12 is entirely destroyed in book 3 they arent firebombing a whole state just a small city and surrounding area",2023-11-27
yeah it’s so annoying how if you critique the movie or her performance everyone just assumes it’s bc of a personal bias like cmon just accept that the movie had some flaws irrelevant to rachel as a person,2023-12-01
 this is so pathetic,2023-11-29
"i’m really not sure how that is plot armour plot armour to me is when there is a plot contrivance to prevent a characters death 

but that isn’ he was and is a privileged pacifist who managed to avoid negative consequences because of his wealth but in the end he couldn’t be saved by said wealth

there was no regression like you suggested he remained consistent",2023-11-19
well i mean thats on you ,2023-12-04
he was an idiot perhaps a noble idiot but it is what it ishe has no one to blame but himself really,2023-11-23
" if anything i think the weirdest part of the movie to me was the lucysnow romance it felt very forced especially on her end

tigris did say that shes all alone and she would want a friendly face young snow is not only friendly but also kind of handsome so that latter part probably helped might be that lucy only felt grateful for his help and confused that feeling with love",2024-01-07
meh,2023-11-20
i didn’t read the book and i agreethe movie made it pretty clear that he was leaning towards the side of the capitol i thought that the rebels would have killed lucy and he would turn on sejanus just from the way his character was developed,2023-12-24
someone can be a toxic manipulative selfish person without being a sociopath or a psychopath people throw around those two diagnoses too easily i don’t think snow was either of those things he was a cunning narcissist if anything sejanus was also very selfish and entitled even though he was one of the ‘good guys’,2024-01-06
snow is always more than a sociopath which is why katiness didn’t  him and listens to him,2023-12-09
what about the shooting of the mayors daughter,2023-12-02
dying to take revenge is different to dying to protect someone it is nowhere near the same thing,2023-11-22
of course if you have one kid you probably have others  it wouldnt be fair to them to spend the rest of your life in prison,2024-02-14
how do you expect hamas or palestinians to build infrastructure when not only does israel control the flow of goods in and out of gaza but they  bomb the infrastructure when its built ,2023-12-06
the “to me” in my original comment is probably the piece you’re missing,2023-11-19
" he was an idiot perhaps a noble idiot but it is what it ishe has no one to blame but himself really

and yet he would have been fine if his friend his selfdeclared brother didnt betray him 

he didnt die because he was naive because he was privileged or because he was an idiot he died because he thought he had a friend and that friend was snow",2024-01-07
 i like hunger games way more than scorsese but it’s not the same thing,2023-11-20
thats fair,2024-01-06
its not the same thing but it probably occurs at the same rate,2023-11-23
funny you talk about the water system when the reason gaza barely has any clean water is because instead of using money to desalinate hamas dug out water pipes to build tunnels and rockets they actually showcase themselves doing it in some of their own propaganda videos ,2023-12-23
why is there a blockade again,2023-12-06
yeah hunger games is more engaging,2023-11-20
"they were dug up from abandoned israeli settlements
watching videos with no context can be super confusing totally understand why you’re spreading misinformation it happens to the best of us and apparently the worst of us zionists too 

this video has subtitles hope it helps 
thinking for yourself and doing your own research is far more empowering than consuming whatever the elite owned main stream media bird feeds you not a single hostage has said a damaging word about the resistance i have heard them express fear of being killed by the iof i find it interesting that people choose to ignore victim testimonies and refuse to acknowledge the fact that the iof is responsible for many deaths on october 7th but yeah……let’s keep talking about the water lines it’s not like palestinians are denied the ability to do a single thing without israel’s permission if they can’t make minor infrastructure repairs in their homes without permission how could they be able to build an entire water system the real question is why the  is israel outside of their official borders and why are they occupying and controlling land that isn’t theirs please stop speaking before critical thinking go research how they obtained control of gazas water system in the first place it’s not bc the palestinians chose they did under necessity 90 of the drinking water before oct7th wasn’t even drinkable

sooo if u were in the movie you’d be part of the capitol nice,2023-12-13
i don’t control what other people think lol,2023-11-20
"so he asks a question and all you do is to just frame him   
im just going to assume that youre a person who hasnt given the whole situation a second thought and is just shouting what everyone else is shouting   
the situation in gaza is not a black and white decision   
it is war and the facts inside gaza are hard to track and retrace   
the fact is hamas is to blame for the suffering in gaza and the only chance for palestine to flourish is with the destruction of hamas",2023-12-27
well you’re clearly uneducated and uninformed with that opinion please do thorough research on the situation before commenting your take is very ignorant it’s not much of a war when one side is bombing the  out of the other killing 1000s of civilians who have no real army to fight back seems pretty one sided to me don’t you think hamas is the only line of defence they have from an occupying force trying to control their freedom really shows how much you know have u been to gaza have u seen how israelis treat people who are ‘other’ i have my mother had rocks thrown at her by them don’t talk to me about what u don’t know ,2023-12-28
"ah yes tells me im uneducated and uninformed without giving any source   


onesided you do realize hamas is actively shootings rockets at israel   
palestine were giving multiple chances for their own land but decided to go against it hamas do see their people as martyr as people who do need to die for their religion for the total annihilation of the jews  


ah you mean how they treated the hamas chef in their hospitals how they are giving work to people in a warzone building infrastructure  


netanjahu has to go but stop pretending that israel is to blame for everything since the founding of the state they have been seen as the enemy by all the surrounding countries those days are over israel will end this once and for all",2023-12-28
source lol u asking for sources tells me everything about u im not here to educate u all u have to do is read a flipping book about it follow journalists on the ground in gaza u idiot lil hamas rockets in the grand scheme of things is nothing i’d shoot rockets at assholes trying to keep me prisoner in my own land too  israel there is no hamas in west bank n they’re still killing palestinians treating them as second class citizens n stealing their  homes u fool israel can burn in  along with you i can literally see u struggling for money trying to borrow n u live in germany how tf am i not surprised that someone in ex  land supports a nation going full holocaust again u being broke is ur karma lol,2023-12-28
