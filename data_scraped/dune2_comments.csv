Feyd looking impressed and sexually aroused every time Paul stabbed or shouted at somebody had me howling great character,2024-03-01
Paul stomping his foot in front of the Emperor to kiss the ring was like a gunshot in the theater.,2024-03-01
The worm ride scenes were absolutely incredible.  This whole movie was just stunning.  I also would do whatever Florence Pugh told me to do.,2024-03-01

"Can we talk about how fucking wild Paul taking Florence Pugh as his bride right in FRONT of Chani was?? I swear everyone in my screening gasped at the audacity of that, it was so funny",2024-03-01
That movie was made to be seen in a theater. Unbelievable,2024-03-01
"Say what you will about the movie. But Denis did an amazing job of getting casual fans on board for Dune. Not a 1:1 adaptation, cuts needed to be made, but seeing my parents excited for this movie sparks a certain unexplainable joy in me. God bless you Denis.",2024-03-01
"How exactly did Paul kill Feyd-Rautha at the end, did he pull the dagger that he was stuck with out and flip it around on Feyd? It was all pretty bang-bang for me

Also idk if anyone noticed but that sequence was basically foreshadowed when Paul and Gurney were sparring in Part 1",2024-03-01
"Minor detail, but I loved the reflections of Arrakis on the underside of the emperor's ship as it was landing.


Also the nukes with the raining debris. This film did such a good job of expressing the scale of massive objects.",2024-03-01
"One of my favorite scenes was Paul using the voice against the Reverend Mother and the cut to Feyd-Rautha looking like ""Damn, bro""",2024-03-01
"The scenes of the Harkonnens on Giedi Prime are the best portrayal of a futuristic, “alien” world I’ve ever seen due to how distinct and unlike reality they are. 

The way the planet is lit so harshly, yet has a “black sun” that saps the colour from everything, reducing the world to a diegetic greyscale, the complete lack of flora and fauna, the completely smooth and hairless inhabitants, and the horrifically beautiful black “fireworks” that are unlike anything I’ve ever seen all worked so perfectly to create this unimaginably alien and inhuman environment. 

Absolutely astounding.",2024-03-01
The scenes on Giedi Prime were absolute genius. So creative but also so seamless. Just incredible.,2024-03-01
"Also every time there was a worm present on screen, or someone gave a long ass speech in the Fremen language, or Christopher Walken blinked slowly, I was kicking my feet and giggling. Like I'm so happy to be alive and seeing this shit on the big screen guys.",2024-03-01
Lady Jessica getting increasingly more dripped out almost every time she’s onscreen was awesome,2024-03-01
"Someone freeze me in time and then thaw me out when Dune 3 drops

Edit.
Dune not dine xd

Edit edit. SPOILER WARNING

>!The last few lines of the movie are some of the best of all time. When Paul looks at Stilgar and tells him to ""Lead them to paradise"" and you see the Freman boarding the ships to attack the Great Houses, you realize the gravity of what is about to happen to the rest of the universe. Paul has become what he swore to Chani he'd never be, someone other than his true self and he prays he's right that she will come back to him. And when Jessica and Alia have a convo and Alia asks what's happening, Jessica says ""Your brother attacks the great houses. The Holy War begins"", you feel helpless because you know Paul has unleashed something that even he cannot stop now.!<

Watching it a second time, I picked up on more of the dialog between the characters and some small lines hit so much different. Let's hope I win the PB and throw all the money at DV so he makes this ASAP.

Lisan al-Gaib!",2024-03-01
"Stilgar is the greatest hype man since Paul Bettany in A Knight’s Tale. 

It’s a shame Denis Villeneuve will never release a “My Duke Cut” of Dune with all of Thufir Hawat‘s scenes that were left out of the movie.",2024-03-01
"One of my favorite details in this film is in Giedi Prime, in the day it is drenched in white and the fireworks are black and in the night, the fireworks are white. 

That's a brilliant visual idea and I love how the fireworks are like blots of ink.",2024-03-01

"Some differences from the novel's ending, for those curious:

Jessica >!gives birth to Paul's sister Alia, who is a two year old holding adult conversations. Alia possesses the consciousness of all Bene Gesserit Reverend Mothers, past and present. She is captured by the Sardaukar, brought before the!< Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, >!and assassinates him with the Gob Jabbar (poison needle). She is depicted in a brief scene as an adult by Anya Taylor Joy in the second film.!< 

Thufir Hawat >!survives the initial attack on the Atriedes during Pt 1, is captured by the Harkonnnens and becomes the replacement mentat to the Baron. He is fed poison in his food, along with an antidote to keep him effectively captive. He is instructed by the Emperor to assassinate Paul with a poison needle, and in the crucial moment reveals this treachery and sacrifices himself to the withdrawal from the antidote, dying. !<

The Spacing Guild navigators who depend on Spice to operate and predict safe paths through the universe >!are threatened with the destruction of all Spice on Arrakis. They are compelled to communicate with the other navigators of the fuedal houses hovering over Arrakis, waiting to pillage it, and compel them to stand down and depart.!<

The Bene Gesserit >!have their royal breeding conspiracy publicly exposed by Paul and Jessica, and their leader denied her power by Paul's near omniscience.!<

Chani >!has a son with Paul, who they name Leto. He is killed in a firefight with the Sardaukar. She supports Paul / Muad'Dib in his plan to strategically marry the Emperor's daughter, Princess Irulan. Paul publicly affirms her status as his royal concubine ( the same position Jessica occupied with Leto ).!<

Fayd Ratha >!tries to poison Paul during their duel, get shanked in the brain.!<

The Emperor is forced to not only concede his thrown and his daughter, but >!his shares in the spice trade to Paul, and control of Caladan to Gurney Halleck, Arrakis to Stilgar.!<

Overall I think it's a great adaptation, faithful to the spirit of the book, and streamlines the perhaps overly dense plot to make it more accessible.",2024-03-01

"Paul : “Will you please listen? I’m not the Mahdi.”    
Stilgar: “He’s The Mahdi”

Every time he says Lisan-al-gaib or he’s The One whenever paul did something, everyone in the theatre was bursting to laughter. Especially the line when he says “*The Mahdi is too humble to say that he’s the Mahdi. Which means he’s the Mahdi*”. Javier Bardem fully embraced the role",2024-03-01
The scene where Paul walks in and tells everyone to “shut the fuck up im HIM” was fucking awesome,2024-03-01
Even at 2.5 hours I would’ve done another hour.,2024-03-01

When you’re cool with just being mouse Jesus but everyone and their mother and unborn sister want you to be space Christ.,2024-03-01
"The inverse of the, “mentor”, archetype was really fucking cool in this movie  
  
I think traditionally, Brolin and Bardem are supposed to be wise sages for young paul but Dune turns that character archetype on its head.  
  
Gurney is so bloodthirsty and ready for revenge he pushes Paul into war IMMEDIATELY after having just reunited and Stilgar though wise enough to guide Paul early on, becomes so engrossed in his fanaticism to him it’s almost blinded him in a way and he’s become this dangerously religious zealot  
  
Not to mention Paul’s mother who at times feels like is filling her own agenda. It just feels like maybe these people aren’t the best role models for Paul and Chani is the only one who notices that. I love how complex these characters are!",2024-03-01

"Timothée went from an absolutely suave young man in the first act to a completely believable figurehead of religious fanatics.

Visually there was some incredibly inventive use of color palettes (or absence thereof) and it was an absolute treat.

Zimmer left a lot of his extended ideas for this film: he really enabled the music to transport us to a new soundscape.

I can’t wait to go again.",2024-03-01
Incredible to see Timothée Chalamet become a legit superstar right before your eyes.,2024-03-01
"Paul’s first worm ride was insane in IMAX.  Felt like a virtual roller coaster at times.  One of the most transporting scenes I have seen in theaters.  It is funny, they gave away a good portion of the scene in the first trailer and it didn’t at all take away from the scene in context.",2024-03-01

I was extremely impressed! Austin Butler stole the show! I had a realization that Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem shared a couple frames since No Country for Old Men but they were fighting together instead of against another and I thought it was extremely wholesome! Soundtrack was amazing! I’ve never been in an IMAX that shook so much!,2024-03-01
"Changing Chani’s characterization to represent a moral opposition to Paul’s increasingly fatalistic decisions was such a great call, and worked doubly in providing actual character depth for her and externalizing the “to be or not to be” conflict that in the book is entirely inside Paul’s head",2024-03-01
"They made the right decision not have child Alia running around and stabbing people, as I feel there would’ve been no way that would have transferred to screen without looking ridiculous",2024-03-01
"The battle outside Arrakeen was done so incredibly well. The sheer size of the emperor’s ship, the explosion of the shield wall, and the sandworms.. immense. I am not upset about the lack of Alia running around the battlefield - it would have felt out of place. 

Huge round of applause for Chalamet and his performance as Paul. The subtle way he changes his face, his delivery of lines, even the way he stands as his prescience grows was so well done. Austin Butler crushed it as Feyd too. 

Have a good feeling about Messiah getting greenlit pretty quickly after this one and the Dune story turning into a trilogy.",2024-03-01
"Still massively processing, and my eyes sting from 6 hours straight of IMAX, but the one conclusion I have so far is that once they are all out, for me, watching the Dune movie trilogy back-to-back will be the first true equivalent in experience to watching the LOTR trilogy back-to-back. Possibly the highest praise I could ever give to a movie series, honestly... 

Just so absolutely sucked into the world and story here, in a similarly epic, all-absorbing spectacle sort of way. 

Oh, and I’m seriously regretting having doubts about Austin Butler in this film. Man f'ing killed it. To the point of almost stealing the show.",2024-03-01
"I feel like in Part 1 Denis adapted Dune, but in Part 2 he reinvented it. The book is one of my favourites, but I think it will be hard to go back without the experience of the movie affecting the way I read it. Villeneuve's take on the characters resonated with me in a way that the originals never did.",2024-03-01

When Paul stomped the ground in front of the Emperor I was hoping he would creake a massive crack in the floor as an homage to Lynch's ending in 1984.,2024-03-01
"Timothée Chalamet’s screen presence is absolutely astonishing in this movie, especially in the third act of the movie, that “SILENCE” voice was bloody loud in the IMAX theatre, my seat was shaking. And scene where he is addressing the Fremen and declares himself as Lisan-al-Gaib. Absolute chills. He  nailed it as Paul Muad'Dib Atreides",2024-03-01
"I spent 5 years in a job in the Mojave Desert, about half of that time was outdoors exposed to the elements.  I enjoyed the respect they gave to the desert.   We had those small delicate mice also.   You would be in awe of them and strangely disturbed because you realize you couldn't survive 2 to 3 days in that environment but they survive.  

I like the natural lighting, or at least the appearance of that.  The beauty I remember from nighttime or mornings.  Part of my heart will be always be there.",2024-03-01
"""There is no one in this room, who can stand against me.""

The best scene of the year for me and it resonates on two levels:
1. The audience doesn’t realise the character had it in him to be capable of this uprising; and
2. The audience doesn’t realise the actor is capable of such a performance.

As a result, we are taken aback on two levels. Great casting, great acting, and great writing!",2024-03-02

"Timothee Chalamet and Austin Butler stole every scene they were in. The whole Geidi Prime sequence is still stuck in my head, with the black and white fireworks
Rebecca Ferguson was scary as fuck - Her talking to unborn Alia, was so eerie. 

You could feel the whole theatre vibrate with the sound when Paul said 'Silence' and even when the sardaukar encounter the worms

Brilliant film and experience over all - 11/10 ; will watch it again when I get the chance to",2024-03-01
"Anyone here feel the 3rd Act, battle, etc could have used another 10+ minutes to feel more earned?

Edit: 20 minutes",2024-03-01
"Really enjoyed it, exceeded expectations.  I think its a definite ""you need to have seen part 1"", but its shocking how well this movie packs information in without feeling too rushed.

As a big fan of the books, I actually think how Chani is treated was inspired.  That will be reevaluated if/when we get Messiah.  However, I think in general the changes made by Villenueve show a real understanding of the material.",2024-03-01
"One of the best cinematic experiences I’ve ever had, genuinely in awe. It’s hard to put into words how good that was, as a book reader though I will say that I kinda do wish they had included my favourite bit.  

Was quite looking for to the ‘spice orgy’ and how he would pull of the almost DMT like trip with infinite visions and molecules and atoms breaking down. Not the end of the world though it would have been hard to pull off.  ",2024-03-01
"That shot of the Fremen riding atop the sandworm while bearing the standard of House Atreides might be my favourite from the entire thing.


Dune Part Two was nothing short of a religious experience.",2024-03-02
"Please go see this in IMAX. The entire thing was incredibly immersive.

Also, they made all of the right choices when it comes to diverging from the book, specifically with Paul’s sister. My wife and I kept joking before seeing the movie about the spice baby. Glad it was handled well.",2024-03-01
"This shit fucking rocks. I went into this with really high expectations and it somehow blew them away. I can't wait to see it again. 

I think the thing that makes this special is that you can engage with this on any level and still have an incredible time. If you don't give a shit about Dune, you can basically just tune out the story and let the sound and the visuals wash over you and You're gonna have a good time. If you want to engage with the story, you're going to be thoroughly entertained. If you want to dive into the characters and explore their motivations and allegiances, there is a ton to unpack. If you want to dig into the world building and the political scheming, there is plenty to find there. If you want to look at the themes of faith and power and corruption, you will be deeply rewarded. If you want to apply those themes to real world events, there is a lot of commentary to read into. 

Most movies demand that you meet them on their level to fully experience and this is the rare movie that is happy to accommodate you wherever you are. I cannot say enough good things about this. Just one of the greatest experiences I've ever had in a theater",2024-03-01

"One thing that I liked that the top-rated comments haven't already said much about is the costume design. Whoever was making Irulan and the Bene Gesserit's costumes was having a lot of fun, and the contrast between Irulan and Chani's outfits does half the work in characterising the two. The Harkonnen aesthetic vs the Fremen aesthetic was excellent as well.",2024-03-02

"I saw it at the Lincoln Square IMAX just a few hours ago. It was an absolutely awesome experience. There’s so much to talk about, but one of the smaller things I enjoyed was how certain scenes in Part One are recontextualized. 

In the opening to Part One we get Chani’s voiceover with some shots of the same, the Fremen in the rock alcove, shooting the spice harvester. And then these things actually happen in Part Two. So for 2.5 years we’ve been watching it as just an exposition things, which it is, but now we know we were also getting a glimpse into the future.",2024-03-01
"My favorite working director made one of my favorite books ever and he absolutely knocked it out of the fucking park. That's instantly a top 5 all timer for me. The visual work was incredible, the sound design was incredible, the costume work blew my fucking mind. I legitimately think Frank Herbert would have loved it. The small changes it made really captured the themes and message perfectly.

He gives here the whole ""I'll always love you for forever"", and immediately turns around and is like ""Okay sure, I'll marry Florence Pugh.""

The absolute combination of rage and heartbreak in her final scene was beautifully acted.",2024-03-01
"Dune 2 is a movie for the theater unlike any I’ve seen in a looooong time. I walked out absolutely stunned - from the opening scene of Paul speaking to Alia, to the scenes on Giedi Prime. Wow. 

Ratha dueling the Atreides prisoner and the duel at the end are two INCREDIBLE fight scenes. So impressed by the choreography. And Javier Bardem’s performance as Stilgar stole the show for me!",2024-03-01
"It’s a stunning spectacle and the finest possible adaption of frank herberts art, even with the changes. Just incredible. It will certainly be nominated for best picture, but it should be more than just a token acknowledgment. This should get actual consideration. I genuinely cannot think of one issue I had with it. I was worried messiah Paul would be too big for chalamet but he was literally Herbert’s Paul incarnate. Butler was actually in some ways MORE sadistic than the book feyd. I’m so excited to see more of Pugh as irulan and Anya as alia. I think lord of the rings is the last time I’ve been this excited about a fantasy world, and I’m absolutely a book fan so I’m not new to it. Just amazing stuff. See it and see it again.",2024-03-01
I mean Jesus fucking Christ what a movie. Nobody does it like Villeneuve,2024-03-01
"It’s obviously not as fleshed out as in the books as the movie seems to condense 2 years into less than 9 months… but Stigar’s plunge into religious fanaticism (while providing some fun moments of levity in the movie) is meant to be tragic. Especially since he helps lead a literal holy war in Paul’s name.

One of my favorite passages from the end of the Dune book:

> In that instant, Paul saw how Stilgar had been transformed from the Fremen naib to a creature of the Lisan al-Gaib, a receptacle for awe and obedience. It was a lessening of the man, and Paul felt the ghost-wind of the jihad in it. I have seen a friend become a worshipper, he thought.",2024-03-01
"The detail that blew my fucking mind was this: near the end, when Paul is using his Space Binoculars to check out the enemy positions, he switches magnification a few times, and the sound effect is a weird squishy sound. That's because in the book, the binoculars use ""oil lenses"" (presumably oil can self-form into a more perfect lens than glass can?). Also, I just re-read the book last week, and I think that not a single change in the adaptation was a misstep.",2024-03-01

"Absolutely loved how unflinching violent Paul’s powergrab was.  The Fremen/Atreides assault of Arakeen is basically the same as the Harkonnen assault in Part I.  Like in the novel, the atrocities, at least in Part I, are kind of underplayed and implied, and the cost of Paul’s rise is explored in later novels.  This film makes it much more explicit, in a great way, and seems like it can be explored in further films. Can’t wait to see it again

"That one scene where Jessica spots the Fremen group peeking at her from around a corner, and she starts speaking (internally) to her daughter about how she's going to convert the non-believers, first though fear?

I'm genuinely not sure I've ever seen anything like Rebecca Ferguson's acting in that scene, it was fucking astonishing. It was just like a full 60 seconds of her staring straight into camera with a more-or-less neutral expression that barely changed and yet there was still a visceral shift in her that went from friendly to fucking terrifying. What the *fuck*, man, how did she do that?!",2024-03-01

"I loved it. MVP of the film was Austin Butler as Feyd-Rautha. Such a sick performance. Wish the movie was longer so we could have got even more of him. As a huge fan of the book, I think Denis did it complete justice and I'm with with the changes. I think he handled the Alia stuff really well, and having Paul be the one to kill the Baron was the more emotionally resonating decision. God damn is the movie beautiful.",2024-03-01

"what villenueve did with chani's character is one of the most substantial book-movie changes i've ever seen.

one of the few faults, or just gripes I had with the book series was the way Herbert wrote Chani, and generally any of the women, besides a handful of the BG. to me, it never really felt as if Chani was an entire character; moreso Paul's partner and mother to his children, but not Chani, Desert Spring. after the events of Part 1 (in the book), the spotlight is largely only given to her when child bearing is the topic of conversation and by the end of it, she's basically reduced to a vessel for Paul's children. the lack of interest, or maybe just inability to effectively fit in a plot line or provide depth of her own, on Herbert's part, made her quite the forgettable character in the books.

denis, however, completely flips this on its head. the amount of agency Chani is given (displays) in Part 2 renders her practically a different character from her counterpart. contrary to the 'yes woman' I view her as in the book, she is the stand in for the ideological opposition towards Paul's mission, and in a broader sense, the Bene Gesserit as an institution. chani is the pillar left standing. The way denis positions her as the grounding figure for paul; her existence is what tethers him to the world. without her, what ties does Paul truly have left to humanity, specifically his humanity?

I can't think of a better way to have ended the film. I view the final scene as a representation of forging one's own path. Creating one's own 'way', directly in spite of what the world around you believes the true 'way' to be. I'm leaving Part 2 with a lot of thoughts and feelings but I can say with certainty what I'm most excited for is Chani's journey in Part 3. Her path has diverged and Villeneuve is free to forge her a new one.",2024-03-03
"Thoroughly enjoyed this. The ending circumstances left me bewildered.

Paul now has the entire Fremen behind him and all of Arakis' resources. He has the emperor hostage and his daughter hostage (heir apparent) who has sworn herself to him. He is heir to house Atredies resources, has Harkonen blood and proof that the emperor massacred his family. Not to mention control of the spice fields.

My point being why wouldn't the greater houses accept his ascendency when he has every card in his favour.",2024-03-01

"I loved this movie so much and agree with all the praise, but did anyone get thrown by a part near at the start of the third act?

After the north freman place was destroyed, everyone is going south. Paul says he doesn't want to go, has the vision that he needs to drink the water of life, but then still tells Chani that she should go without him. 

Then theyre all riding on sandworms, Paul looks over at Chani and then the overhead shot shows Pauls worm splitting off from the others. The next scene is him taking the water of life...then Chani shows up in a Thopter? 
It just felt kinda disjointed...or maybe I blacked out and missed something.",2024-03-01
"I haven’t read the books- so forgive me for just going by the film content, but I felt that the reveal of Paul’s Harkonnen lineage wasn’t impactful to the film’s story at all? 

He drank the worm piss, realised Rebecca Ferguson was a Harkonnen, but didn’t really have an identity crisis or conflict about what he was doing- he just affirmed his identity as an Atreides and killed Stellan Skarsgård stone cold. What was the point of the reveal?",2024-03-01

"Saw it a second time today after seeing it last Sunday, here are some things I noticed my second time around:

- after Paul drinks the water of life and is explaining that he sees a path to victory, there is a half second cut to Paul’s knife in Feyd. A small nod to the fact that Paul is already foreseeing exactly how he’s going to win 

- Paul’s method of winning the fight against feyd was a nod to the first film when he trains with Gurney “look down my lord, you would’ve joined me in death” 

- there’s a moment early on when chani says “Arrakis is so beautiful when the sun is low” and Paul stops and stares at her for a second. That’s because he has heard her say that in one of his dreams before. She says it in the very beginning of the first Dune and then it cuts to Paul waking up. 

- another thing I noticed on second watch is how much Feyd respects Paul. There are multiple shots of Feyd examining Paul and Austin Butler does such a good job of having these faces of admiration and respect. Even when he says “he’s bluffing” at one moment towards the end, he has this sly smile on his face like “yea this mf is a formidable opponent”",2024-03-03
"this movie could easily have been an hour longer, how they cut it down to 2:45 amazes me.",2024-03-01
This is a staggering sequel. Every element from world building to action was dialed way *way* up. Might my favorite universe to grace cinema since The Lord of the Rings.,2024-03-01

"""Lead them to paradise"" is one of the coldest lines ever.",2024-03-03
"One little thing I loved about this movie was the nice subversion with Rabban. He's this big, hulking guy who -- just through visual language -- we associate with ""badass."" Yet he tucks tail and runs. *Twice*. He's forced to be submissive. And then when he finally does decide to fight, *he* thinks he's a badass, but then gets killed in, like, three seconds flat.

Just on a level outside of the film itself, I think that's part of why I like Dave Bautista so much compared to his wrestler-turned-actor contemporaries, because you can see there's not a single drop of ego on screen. He's able to separate himself from a character in a way that allows his character to *lose*, to be weak, to be truly vulnerable and pathetic. If, for instance, the Rock had had his hands on these movies, Rabban *would* be the badass who never loses and we'd be subjected to a 15-minute fight scene between him and Josh Brolin at the end, and there'd *never* be a moment like Rabban having to kiss Feyd's boot.

I just absolutely loved this movie, and so much has been said about it not just in this thread and elsewhere that I agree with, but the Bautista element is just something I wanted to take a moment to appreciate. Where the Rock makes me groan, Bautista makes me sit up and pay attention, and I look forward to seeing his work with Villeneuve (and others!) continue to evolve.",2024-03-04

Really loved that we spent time with both Paul and Feyd for a little development of their respective situations in the beginning. I feel like a general audience shouldn’t have much trouble figuring out what’s going on (the first movie often felt like newbies might get lost by comparison).

And it seemed like a perfect setup for future installments! I hope that happens. I love the Dune world and story and really would be happy to see it get appreciated as this generations next big sci-fi franchise.",2024-03-01
I think I haven't moved or breathed in the last 30-45 minutes.,2024-03-01
"It’s been awhile since I’ve read Dune but I feel like Villeneuve’s take on Jessica’s character is more explicitly villainous - which I really, really liked.

I remember when Part One came out reading criticism for how Jessica was portrayed - many thought she cried too much in her scenes when the Reverend Mother was putting Paul through to Gom Jabbar test and that she should be more stoic and in control. But I thought the pay off of that relationship in the final scene, from Jessica cringing and cowering like a kicked dog to smugly staring her domineering/tyrannical mentor down, who acknowledges her as a Reverend Mother on equal footing, was very satisfying. It recontextualized Jessica’s actions, from changing the sex of her fetus with Duke Leto against her organization’s plans onwards, to be about power grabbing and upwardly moving through ranks of the Bene Gesserit.",2024-03-02
"Literally just got out of the cinema for a duel screening of Dune, part 1 and 2. Still gathering my thoughts, but here are my main takeaways:

As someone who has not read the books (not yet, at least), both movies are super dense, but in very different ways. The first movie is very information heavy, it does most of it's job through set up and great atmosphere. It very much fulfils it's role as a part one, because it is setting the ground work for the future story.

This movie is dense because it is super fast paced, whether or not that is good or bad? I'll need to watch it again, I was too caught up in the awe of it all. It felt like this movie had a lot more to cover after the way part one ended. There is only one real place I could see the movie ending if they wanted to cut it short, but even then, that wouldn't feel satisfying as a viewer. As I said, part one is basically build up to part two, doing this would make some of the decisions in part one not feel like they are properly paid off.

In the end that meant this movie was fast, way faster than the first one, it does not waste time getting to story beats, and once it hits gas it's full speed until the end. Also, there is a lot more action and fight scenes in this one, which probably adds to the fast pacing.

All in all, I liked this movie a lot. I will see it at least once more, and maybe finally pick up the books. Not sure I like it more than part one yet, but I'll see.",2024-03-01
"One thing I loved about this movie is the Fremen having different cultures based on their geological location. I feel it’s so rare in Si-Fi for alien planets to have that, they’re all homogeneous in their beliefs and cultures. Having Paul convert the northerners first because the south is already fundamentalist is just so interesting and believable. James Cameron is doing something similar with Avatar and I love it there too.",2024-03-01

The last scene was truly poignant (so many were). What in the first thing the Fremen do after finally liberating their planet? They literally rush to ships.

"Why did Paul say “Begun, the dune wars have” at the end there? Weird phrasing.",2024-03-01
"People are raving about this but I kind of liked Part 1 more. The fall of House Atriedes had a sense of emotion and tragedy that I felt was missing from this one. Some segments were weirdly edited too, the whole Paul drinking the Holy Water felt rather rushed. 

The final fight also ends rather quickly after having been built up the entire film. Sardukar dying offscreen like disposable thugs also felt a bit underwhelming after seeing how awesome they were in Part 1 which made Duncan Idaho's last stand that much more badass.

I liked the exploration of religious fanaticism but maybe the ending could've taken some more time for the weight of Paul's actions to be fully felt. I think the movie would've benefitted from cutting some of the scenes of him 'becoming' Fremen and letting the finale breathe for a bit longer.",2024-03-01
"Just realized the massive irony of Denis Villeneuve having to doctor strange his way through the infinite multiverse of potential fuckups he could have made since beginning to storyboard this film at the age of 13, all to find the one possible future where he made Dune –industry cliché of the unmakeable movie– to standards of near-universal acclaim.

Edit: Some further thoughts, but oh my god Timothee Chalamet was so good. I thought, as many others did that he was a bit too cold in the first film, but when he actually takes up the mantle as Lisan al' Giab it was very chilling and ominous. I also can't believe Chalamet and Zendaya actually had chemistry in this. The romance in the book was just there, so I didn't expect much from the movie, but they actually made me care and makes what happens in Messiah more impactful.",2024-03-01

"Aside from everything that's been said, one thing I really loved as a fan of military tactics history and of war movies is two things:



* They made an effort to make different sides have completely different ways of fighting, choreography-wise. The Sardaukar and to a lesser extent the Harkonnens are disciplined soldiers fighting in formations, with strong footing and all, kind of like Roman legionaries. The Fremen on the other hand, like Duncan said in the first movie, fight like animals in the less pejorative way possible: very agile, jumping everywhere, hiding in the sand, and discarding formations for very aggressive charges and vicious brutality in pitched battles. And overall both tactics, disciplined formations and subversive tactics are definitely worth each other in a pitched battle,as shown in history (Battle of Teutobourg comes to mind), with a good leader and proper tactics the barbarian hordes can definitely kick the Empire's ass. Which leads us to...



* The tactics overall kind of made sense, especially in the final battle. Sending the nukes to show that you have them, in addition to using the debris as some kind of artillery barrage to break up the Sardaukar formation and discipline, as well as leaving littered debris to hinder their ability to regroup and form a line, forcing then to a head-on charge in which they were disadvantaged (not to mention the psychological impact of that and of the fucking huge sand worms charging at them). I still think the Sardaukar should have tried forming a line instead of charging head-on against the Fremen fundamentalists, but eh, it wouldn't be a Hollywood movie without two armies charging straight at each others.",2024-03-03
"Young Paul/Cult Paul is a Bruce/Batman-like character, there's enough of a distinction between the two that one actor can excel at being Batman but not as Bruce and vice versa. Like the Batman franchise the Dune adaptations suffer the same issue with both MacLachlan and Newman being heavily slanted toward being better old-Pauls than young Pauls. I had the same reservations going into the first Dune film, and pretty much 2/3rds of part 2, that Chalamet was/is a great young Paul but had serious doubts whether he could pull off old/cult Paul.

The cave scene removed any any all lingering doubts. *""I am Paul Muad'dib Atreides, Duke of Arrakis, the hand of God be my witness, I am the Voice of the Outer World, I will lead you to PARADISE.""* The transformation post Water of Life is just phenomenal, that he was able to maintain a clear commanding and authoritative presence throughout that entire scene, most of which involved jabbering a fictional language (and without it coming off as tacky), was just a sight to behold having seen it twice. Being able to pull that off I'm convinced Chalamet can literally play anything.",2024-03-03
Denis villeneuve is the greatest Canadian director of all time,2024-03-01
"Some of the images they cut in this film will forever be cemented in my mind along with the sci-fi greats - for me it's the Harkonnens ascending the cliff in a line, Chani teaching Paul to sand walk in step, and the sandworms towering over the Sardukar in the final battle.",2024-03-01

" “You of all people should know there are no sides""

I feel like that quote is super emblematic of the movie as a whole. I'm only vaguely familiar with Dune lore, so it's interesting to see this story isn't a pure tale of good vs. evil.

Same for the shot of Stilgard leading the battle with the Atreides banner at his back. To me it felt like Paul succeeded at ""corrupting"" the Fremen to his own cause.",2024-03-06
"Just watched it again and it's still as good as the first time around. I even noticed a couple of things I didn't before.

I dont know how or why but I completely missed Feyd's cannibal ""pets"" the first time around. It made the Harkonens seem even more gross.

After Paul drinks the Water of Life there's a quick image of someone being stabbed and I could tell it was from the duel at the end. I didn't even remember seeing that before.

When Feyd heard ""May thy knife chip and shatter"" he repeated it like it was the coolest thing ever and he was gonna steal it after dealing with Paul. I found that pretty funny.

Also, Paul kept looking at Chani while he was fighting Feyd. It was like he wanted to check if she still cared about him even though he JUST demanded another girl marry him in front of her, God and everybody else.

""He stabbed me, Chani! Aren't you worried about me, baby? Don't you still love me?"" Shit was so diabolocal it became funny.

"All in all, an excellent film.  I've been a Dune ""fan"" since a relative first giving me the book as a kid in the 80s.  I've read all the Frank novels several times over, at different points in my life.  This film, although deviating in a few points, was somehow *closer* to what a imagine when reading them.  It was mostly all very good with Ferguson's performance the highlight for me.  It's a horribly beautiful movie that really drives home Herbert's main themes -- I like to think he would have approved.",2024-03-01
"My favorite little bits were the Barron lying helpless on the stairs as the nuke goes off, everyone surrounding the emperor staring at the door while he lays alone staring longingly at the throne with this sense of maybe if he could just get the strength pull himself to the top then he could wield all the power he’s always wanted but he is so close but has completely failed and now will die pathetically. All of that was conveyed in like 2 seconds based in how the shots were composed. Just truly masterful. 
 The other thing was the ambush scene when Dave Bautista flies out with his troops to try to deal with the Freman himself and shit just goes from confident to unsteady, to silent horror, to just everything being so fucked up and total terror. Reminds me of the loot cart sequence from GoT, one of the last great scenes though it had its problems. They took our perspective away from the protagonists and put it with the antagonists and just showed how absolutely horrifying it would be to be on the other end of everything we have been rooting for this entire time. We feel horror watching the fear and suffering of the bad guys but also exhilaration at just the sheer power beheld by the people we are rooting for.",2024-03-02

"Just finished watching it:

**Positives**:

- Loved, LOVED the Geidi Prime scenes. Just absolutely beautiful and so unique with the black sun and the blot ink fireworks. Reminded me of Metropolis mixed with Alien. Such great cinematography. I got chills when the Bene Gesserit walked into the light and their robes turned from black to white. Gorgeous. 
- Timothee Chalamet really impressed me here. Especially in the final hour when he became a much more ominous and disturbing character, and you almost felt uneasy about what he was saying and doing. The switch from charming young prince to a messiah-like figure was very believable, and it was a pleasant surprise because I had doubts that he could pull it off.
- Rebecca Ferguson. Everything about her. Her acting, her costumes, everything. The absolute highlight of the movie, and such a disturbing, almost villainous performance. Her space burkas were awesome.
- Really enjoyed the special effects. And the worm riding scenes were very well done and exhilarating. 
- Whoever designed Florence Pugh's outfits deserves an award. The costuming in this movie in general was fantastic. 

**Negatives**

- Christopher Walken was too old to play the Emperor. He had no presence and felt out of place. Wasn't believable as a villain at all. Maybe Walken 20 years ago could have played it, but the Emperor should have been played by someone in their 50s or 60s. He looked like a janitor.
- I feel like there was a bit too many scenes with the Fremen. It was great but the movie could have diverted to some attention to other plot points. Would have liked to see more of semi-evil Messiah Paul because he played that part SO well.

Overall, a 9.5/10. I really enjoyed it. It is substantially better than the first movie in almost every way except that it's missing Oscar Isaac eye candy.",2024-03-05

"**I was a friend of Jamis**

No matter what the legacy of this movie series is, Denis Velleneuve has brought Arrakis to life in a way that feels real. I’ll always admire him for that. 
 Saw this at the fan first event at Lincoln Square. Amazing experience. It’s so visually stunning. Excellent use of imax screen as well. I thought I was *so over* giant cgi monster/ships/battles but turns out it’s still possible to do that right. I thought there was some excellent acting. Javier Bardem had a standout role as Stilgar especially once the evangelist angle got turned up to 11. 

Sadly there are some rough parts that feel like entire plots/scenes were left on the cutting room floor. Honestly wouldn’t be surprised if there was a 4 hour cut out there somewhere.

I don’t want to play the “I didn’t like the changes from the book” card because I truthfully only finished reading the book (after years of trying) because I was excited for the movies. But still I do think some of the punch of the book was not felt here and that’s a shame. 

Denis there’s still time to film the “I was a friend of Jamis” scene and make that the conclusion of Part 1 in a special 2 part Blu-Ray…

So excited to watch this tomorrow in 70mm IMAX. I’m willing to bet it will be the theater event of 2024 for me.",2024-03-01

I called Anya playing Alia since it was confirmed she had a role after the premiere. Still a nice moment when she shows up!

I genuinely could’ve done without the many cuts to the fetus in the womb….i respect Denis’ vision. It’s bold, not many directors would’ve done that u think. But….also creepy as FUCK. 

I seriously hope we get a Bene Gesserit voice off between Jessica and Paul next movie because damn it’s still scary as fuck. 

Get you a hype man like Stilgar was for Paul, damn with as much hyping as Javier was doing no wonder Paul went from 0 to 100 like he did. But that definitely will come back to haunt him in a future movie….

I do wish Irulan got more to do, Florence got like 6 minutes of screen time and I wish she got a little more but Iunderstand they had a shit load of stuff to cover here and she’s not in the novel much anyway.

"I’m 41. There are few things that make me feel like a kid again. I saw Dune 2 in imax last night. Have felt that childlike sense of awe and discovery you get when you encounter something new and thrilling. I thought the film was close to over shortly after the 2/3 mark. But that last 1/3 was like its own film. And then I think about how many different scenes we got. And how the story was told slowly and thoughtfully. And right when you think you know what scene will come next, it surprises you. 

People have compared it to Empire Strikes Back. Other than them both being the second in the series, I am not sure I see the parallels. I feel this film was more focused on one planet and slow storytelling. But it was one of the most beautiful (if not THE most beautiful) things I’ve ever seen and heard on the big screen. It makes you look at other films and say hey they’re kinda being lazy huh? The amount of genius and manpower poured into each frame. Gotta hand it to the teams and Denis.",2024-03-07

"In the book, Gurney is adamant about wanting to fight Feyd-Rautha in place of Paul. To the point where he tells Paul something akin to, ""you promised me Harkonnen blood!"" But Paul denies Gurney the opportunity to get his vengeance, and takes Feyd-Rautha himself. He even goes so far as to tell Gurney something like, ""you've had your share of Harkonnen blood!"". 

And I remember feeling bad for Gurney, because it seemed like something he really needed, and his character was denied that closure. But in the movie, I could not wipe the smile off my face when he killed Rabban, giving his character some much needed closure. 

The one thing I don't feel the movie really captured about Gurney's character from the book, is how much of a *legend* he is. Everyone knows Gurney Halleck, friends and foes alike. So, when my wife noted how easily he seemed to take out Rabban, I almost told her, ""He's Gurney Motherfucker Halleck! Of course he whipped his ass!""",2024-03-03

If I had to critique anything, it would be Christopher Walken - he didn't bring much to the role at all, and didn't display the gravitas of Shaddam at any point. It was just Christoper Walken in space. 

I also don't think it was Bautista's best performance; he was outclassed by everyone he shared scenes with. Functional, but nothing to write home about.

The love story and kiss between Paul and Chani was amazing. You’re rooting for them the entire movie. 

The bizarro, facsist Harkonnens in grayscale was nuts. 

Stilgar, the ultimate hype man.

"I'm just here to give an odd sort of praise.

I am having a really rough time with anxiety and panic attacks right now. They come and go through my life, haven't really been a problem for several years, but right now is a bad time for it.

Anyway, it just so happens that one of my main triggers is getting even a slight sense of vertigo from vast, wide open spaces in real-life, or from seeing them on big movie screens. I'm so sensitive to this that I'm having to keep my shit together just thinking about it and writing this at home the next day.

Because of my anxiety I had a horrible time with this movie. I was having a panic attack nearly the whole time. Literally could not stop fidgeting and squirming in my seat, closing my eyes for a lot of parts, and grabbing my girlfriend's hand/leg. It took a lot of determination for me to stay in the theatre and I hope I wasn't too disruptive to other people watching. (Fortunately our theatre wasn't that full.)

But I made it to the end and I walked out of that theatre, yes incredibly relieved it was over, but also hyped as hell. I still loved this movie despite having probably the worst filmgoing experience of my life watching it, by no fault of the film itself whatsoever. I was texting my buddies in the parking lot like LISAN AL GAIB afterwards and I'm still hyped about it now.

That, to me, is a testament to how compelling this movie and Frank Herbert's story are.",2024-03-04

I nearly walked out when Paul started ranting about how much he hates sand because it's coarse and gets everywhere.,2024-03-01
"I just finished watching Dune Part 2 for the second time. After watching it the first time I was slightly conflicted. There were 3 major changes to the film compared to the book:
1. The time jump doesn't happen
2. Alia is not born
3. Chani and her relationship with Paul is not as strong at the end.

The first two changes I completely understand. It's extremely to difficult to put a two year old, all knowing, child into a film. However, the relationship between Paul and Chani is critical to Dune Messiah (Part 3).

Their relationship at the end of Part 2 was completely different compared to the end of Dune, the book. The only way to justify having them end like that in Part 2 is to have a Part 3.

Part 3 needs to start with the Crusade across the universe. Then show Paul and Chani reconcile and fall deeply in love. Followed by a time jump 20 (17?)* years later. After the time jump we see the events of Dune Messiah.

Dune Part 2 became significantly better with that in mind. I wasn't watching Part 2 thinking that I was seeing the end to Dune; I watched it thinking it was the middle of the story. The bridge between Part 1 and 3.

If Denis and the cast and crew can stick the landing with Part 3 (which I absolutely believe they will) I think it will be held in high regard. Similar to the Return of the King.

i didnt know it could get better than dune 1... jesus. this is one of the best movies released in recent years. 10/10 rewatch. stilgar is hilarious... LISAN AL GAIB!!,2024-03-09
"Just got back home super late on a Sunday before work and that was worth it for sure. Beautiful visuals. That shot very close to the start where the Harkonnen troops were dropping out of their ship in silhouette was unreal, very ominous feeling. 

Ferguson was terrifying, Chalamet was pretty good. Bardem was great, though some of the comedy moments with him were a bit forced feeling. But holy shit did Austin Butler kill it…I didn’t even know he was in this. He was fantastic! That maniac laughing in the gladiator scene was so different to his Band of Planes character haha. 10/10 for him.

I felt that it could have possibly been a bit better paced for Paul after he drinks the spicy preworkout. Maybe just ten minutes of him blending his reluctant saviour angst with his purpose of being a savior, but instead he is pretty sad a lot, vows his love to Chani, and then takes a sharp left on his worm and drinks it and storms into the temple and is immediately this really brutal religious leader dude. Just felt a little transition between these two personalities could have been more subtle…but perhaps that would have been a bit tropey, it was certainly hard hitting.

Great film and an evening well spent. I want to read the books now. 

I was wearing a light grey hoodie fresh out the wash and dropped a Twirl bite on it during the trailers as I was reclining my seat and didn’t realise for 2.5 hours. Went out at the end with a huge melted chocolate stain on my stomach. Cool.

It seems that each generation has one great trilogy that defines the art of film for that place in time. My generation had Lord of the Rings, and my father's had Star Wars. Now through the brilliant vision of Denis Villeneuve, we have the Dune saga.

"The opening was great and the music was so good. All the acting was very very good, Paul especially. Didn’t expect TC to have that commanding of a voice. That SILENCE got my theatre like ‘😳😳’.  But gets a little ermmm, dry at points. Overall I liked it a lot. I thought Feyd was kinda overhyped, I saw some posts on here saying he was the ‘best villain of the ‘20s’, shit like that. And he didn’t do much, it was a great performance and the character was very cool but the character doesn’t do a whole lot. 

What I didn’t like was my theatre experience. Don’t go to the theatre much anymore and today reminded me why. The dude behind me was sniffling loudly every 10-15 seconds, almost right in my ear it was so annoying. This one guy in front kept getting up to change seats, was friggin weird.

"What a fucking spectacular film, holy Christ on a cake. Surpassed the first on every level, but especially with the writing and acting. This movie had so much more emotional weight, personality, texture, and _soul_ compared to most of the first, which in hindsight feels like 2.5 hours of beautifully shot exposition. 

This movie brilliantly took the building blocks set up by the first and then set them in thrilling motion, often upending them in harrowing, tantalizing fashion. The near 3-hour runtime went by in a blur, and more or less every scene evoked a sense of awe. This is what I wanted from a Dune movie by Villeneuve and I'm so happy I got it. Kudos to everyone involved for helping Denis fulfill his dream and tell this story how he wanted to.

More thoughts:

- I thought Timothee Chalamet was fine in the first movie, but he really was fucking _impressive_ this time around. I have no doubt that the Paul material in Part 2 was the real litmus test for casting him. His transformation from a reluctant, humble outsider (nevertheless hardened by the events of the first film) into a fearsome, fanatical warrior was enthralling. My favorite scene in the movie may well be the moment where he declares himself the messiah before the fundamentalists. It felt like a large-scale cult initiation, made all the more disturbing by how much his own mother was reveling in it.

- Javier Bardem as Stilgar was the highlight of the movie. Hilarious and soulful in equal measure. He was such a dour character in the first film so I'm so glad he was given more to do here, and that the writing incorporated more of Bardem's natural charisma into the role.

- Rebecca Ferguson was already my favorite performance from part 1, but she was _SO GOOD_ here. Fantastically creepy as the Reverend Mother. In the first film we were told more than shown that she was a Bene Gesserit, so it was thrilling seeing her in full cult-priestess mode this movie.

- It's no surprise that the visuals of this movie were again fucking stunning, but Part 2 in particular made great use of gigantic crowd shots that filled and dotted the screen like a pointillist painting. The world of Part 2 felt a lot more alive and populous compared to the drab sparseness of Part 1, and lent a lot more scale and gravity to the story. My favorite crowd shots were 1) the Harkonnen gladiator fight and 2) the aerial shot of Paul making his way through the crowd of Fremen in the south.

- So this is what it took to get Austin Butler to finally stop behaving like Elvis. What a magnificent performance he gave here. I found it interesting that he just chose to go with Stellan Skarsgard's accent for the voice, but it worked. I'm sure his role on Once Upon a Time in Hollywood prepped him well for playing another sadistic psycho. Dude has amazing range.

- Zendaya also got to show off her incredible acting talent throughout this movie, and the betrayal Chani felt as Paul got deeper and deeper into his messiah role was beautifully, heartbreakingly portrayed. The most emotionally impactful moment in the movie for me was when Paul told her after the duel that he will always love her. At first it sounds like a simple reassurance, but you realize it's more of a preemptive apology when he then asks for the Princess' hand in marriage in front of all the Fremen. Jawdropper. Love that the movie ended on a shot of her too.

- Speaking of the Princess, I thought Florence Pugh was pretty underused in this movie. I haven't read the books but I assume she'll have more to do in the Dune Messiah film if they're covering Paul's conflict with the Houses. Seems to be Villeneuve's casting pattern: introducing major actors in one movie and then giving them more of a chance to act in the next. Loved her costumes throughout the movie though, they looked gorgeously ornate and regal in a way that still felt consistent with Villeneuve's sleek, minimalistic aesthetic.

- The Feyd-Rautha gladiator fight, shot in infrared, was fucking _rad_. Loved everything about it, from the transition to black and white to the triangular arena to the ocean of people in the crowd. 

- The final duel between Paul and Feyd-Rautha was even better. I thought the fight between Paul and Jamis at the end of Part 1 was a tad anticlimactic and not as visceral, but this one was fucking outstanding. And after two movies of bloodless PG-13 violence, I'm glad Villeneuve let them bleed a bit and leaned into the brutality in the final fight. Certainly made it feel more climactic.

- Josh Brolin was so, so great in this! Similar to Bardem, he was a bit stiff in the first movie but he really got to let loose this time around, and the Gurney character was given more emotional range and depth. The Drax vs. Thanos rematch at the end was over a lot faster than one would normally expect.

- Imagine if after Brolin explained that ""destroy the whole planet"" was a figure of speech, he said ""half the planet, maybe"". I'm glad I didn't write this movie.

- I haven't read the books so the twist about Jessica being Harkonnen's daughter was a real shocker. Didn't seem to have too much bearing on the wider story though, but on a character level you could say Paul and Jessica unwittingly emulated the Harkonnens by becoming increasingly ruthless throughout the movie.

- I'm watching Game of Thrones for the first time right now and I found loads of parallels in this movie. (Of course, GRRM was more than likely inspired by Herbert.) Everything with Paul and the Fremen felt exactly like Jon and the wildings, but with a shade of the Daenerys ""Mhysa"" worship thrown in. Paul, like Jon, was even (GOT spoilers) >!given a plot twist about his true lineage.!< And Stilgar, like Melisandre, was cheering on Paul's messiah status the entire time. Feyd-Rautha reminded me of Ramsay Bolton, even down to >!he and Paul (""Jon"") getting a final duel!<, though this one was more morally grey. (The duel scene of course echoed the famous trials by combat in GOT.) And Chani, like Ygritte, >!becomes disillusioned with Paul for straying from the indigenous people's best interests.!< Even the Bene Gesserit scheming to seduce Feyd-Rautha into their control felt like what the Tyrells were trying to initially accomplish with Joffrey, himself a psycho.

- Watching GOT also helped me settle into the pace of this movie very quickly, since I'm already used to both the medieval palace intrigue and the pleasures of watching such a lore-heavy story build out in serialized format. I could immediately feel within the opening moments of the film how much more interesting it was now that we're familiar with the characters/settings and get to watch them get expanded upon and given more texture. The writing definitely helped too - the script of this film was a lot stronger, wittier, and expressive compared to the fairly stilted dialogue from the first. Which is odd given that the great Eric Roth had a hand in the first but not the second.",2024-03-18

"I know it was envisioned as a two partner but it should have been a trilogy. Just like the books first one is setting the scene. Dune. Second one is Paul learning to live within the society. Muad'dib. Last one is him rising to take over his adopted people and use them.  The prophet. 

Would never work because the second would be so slow and more political intrigue then people might be happy with but fuck it. 

The whole moment between Paul deciding to go south and taking the water of life felt like it cut 20 minutes of the film and the ending felt rushed. 

Could easily have ended up the harkonnens coming in and slowly gaining control back from the fremen and forcing Paul's hand to go south. Nice bad guys win kind of ending. The third film would have been him slowly accepting his need to change how he operates and slowly become what he didn't want to become. With power corrupting him slowly and finally ending in the big battle and eventual win. 


I do like they made chani a more interesting and believable character. Kind of combined her with the stilgar of the books.  Not sure how that will impact the story going forward if they decide to make another movie.",2024-03-02

"Wow.

Action sci-fi is back.

A lot of people are drawing comparisons to LoTR but this even surpasses those movies. I would put it more in the realm of Alien or Planet of the Apes, but with heavy influence from classic war epics. The world-building is a challenge for some if they have not read the books, but the movies do a lot to catch people up.There are numerous scenes where I found myself smiling ear to ear. The first time Paul rides the worm is one of my favorite scenes in theatres in a long time. Also, that harvester ambush scene was incredibly well-played. On top of those are the battles and that arena scene with Feyd-Rautha, the epic sci-fi spectacles we have not seen in a long time.

I want to add the whole scene around the water of life extraction, was really interesting. That woman who played the worm tamer(?) is such a great addition. It could have been glossed over, but the pacing felt special. It felt like something out of a Kurosawa movie, this sacred ritual, that in other hands would have fell flat.

Performances are great. Austin Butler may have been my favorite here, but Bardiem carries your passion for Paul and has you cheering him on. Chalamet is really expanding here, and it’s great to see. Fergeson actually brought me back to her role in Doctor Sleep with how unsettling she can be. Pugh, Seydoux, Brolin; they don’t have massive roles but their impact is felt. I would say my only critique would be Zendaya, she has some scenes where it feels a bit off, mainly the intense scenes. I just think everyone else around her is nailing it and she is trying to catch up.

It’s not a perfect film, it does have its faults. There are some issues with the pacing and a bit repetition but that’s to be expected given the source material and just how dense this world is. I want to add that I have read the books a few times, so that may fill some points subconsciously as I watch the movie.

Seeing the non-book fans and what they have been thinking has been interesting.",2024-03-04

"Spectacular!

Need to see it again asap. The book nerd in me was distracted by some of the changes, but more often than not it made more sense in the movie. Replacing Gurney’s assassination with an attack on Tabr as the catalyst for Paul taking the final step makes a lot more sense as the thing that pushes him over the edge. 

Same with how the Baron dies – did I want to see Alia? Sure, but realistically how would a two year old assassin work tonally here?

- And did Lady Jessica basically secede and go wifey bc they didn’t tell her she was Harkonnen’s daughter? 

 - And why wouldn’t the great families accept Paul’s rise to power since the whole reason they killed Leto was bc the Atreides were posing too much of a popularity threat? And it was said that the great houses wouldn’t stand for the emperor genociding one of them? So Paul does as expected of a kid whose very popular and almost getting there family was coup-ed, and they don’t accept his fair play at the throne? ",2024-03-09

2 hours and 45 minutes go by real quick. 

I thought the adaptation was fantastic. The visuals are stunning and much better than part 1. The score is fantastic. The dialogue could have been slightly better. The movie could have benefited from an extra 15-20 minutes honestly. Gurney and Rabaans fight was underwhelming. The weight of Pauls decisions could have held more depth if you have a bit more time to process them. Specifically the throne room scene, Pauls choice to drink the water of life, and just a bit more of Paul and Chani together would have been great. 

My only big issue with the movie, I wanted more Paul and Chani. Love that spans space and time but can be destroyed by mere petty revenge and personal/political greed. Zimmers score for them was moving. It wasnt given enough depth. It feels more like teenagers fighting instead of rebels and lovers that can lose everything in a war of destiny. They could have delved a bit deeper into their relationship. 

With that said multiple moments in the movie i found myself grinning from ear to ear. One of the best experiences ive had in a movie theater in a long time. Overall great film. Ultimately, my only complaint is that i wanted more!

"I really liked how much attention was paid to the nuances, with the Harkonnens especially. The intro from the Harkonnen patrol's perspective, the conscripts terrified and nervous and vomiting in the dropship, Rabban and Feyd-Rautha having major character arcs (I love Rabban as an overcompensating bully who's a coward at heart), the constant fear of all of the Baron's servants. Feyd-Rautha is a complete sociopath, but it goes to great lengths to get across how he and his ascendancy to power are more like Paul than he'd like to admit. 

ALSO, Feyd-Rautha is a really great multifaceted character with some redeeming qualities, even if they don't ultimately make him any less evil. He's a sociopath who seems to actually respect (if not empathize with) his opponents and is a more effective villain for it. During his downfall he actually seems quite taken back/impressed that Muad'dib is even more ambitious and ruthless than he is, he's not even really all that mad!

plus, I really love the commentary on messianic figures/religion, Stilgar's progression from someone so desperate to believe in anything that it's played for laughs, to full-blown fanatic, is great",2024-03-02

By the time I walked into the theatre, i had seen the most thrilling cinematic moments from this movie hundreds of times. Every time I opened my phone, or watched sports on TV for the last two weeks, I was treated to visual delights that should have been experienced for the first time in the theatre. It completely sapped the energy from the film. It’s not the first time you’ve done this, either. I had the same complaint about ‘The Batman’. You could have promoted this movie without spoiling the ‘worms’ sequence.

"Having seen it Sunday it's easily been on my mind all week. Those three hours flew by and I can't wait to see it again now tomorrow. With a bit more time to process some of the real standout moments for me were Paul and Chani sandwalking together and the whole Fremen war with the Harkonnen mining operation, coming off of Helldivers 2 these scenes were incredible and felt so Starship coded they were terrific.

Paul ascending as Maud'Dib in a crowd of thousands, challenging their warriors to no rival. I thought was captured perfectly, possibly will be the most memorable scene in adapted media for a long time.",2024-03-01
"I really enjoyed it. It was amazing to see in IMAX.

Jessica going Darth Sidious made for some great scenes especially the ones when she's using the Voice. 

Everything on Geidi Prime was captivating. Those ink blot fireworks were so cool. Also you can just imagine the Harkonens got some nasty mutated animals and monsters they probably display in the gladiator games. I can't forget that weird spider-person from the first movie. 

During the Geidi Prime segment, I'll admit I kept expecting Thufir to show up especially after it was revealed the prisoner hadn't been dosed. Was expecting some big reveal of Thufir emerging from the shadows to stand beside the Baron, but nothing. :/

I liked how Gurney got to confront and kill Rabban. Speaking of Gurney (as just a fun character) him being a mentor so bloodthirsty, is just a fun twist on the classics mentor trope with Gurney being one pushing for revenge, violence, immediate action, etc. Brolin killed it. 

As well as Paul being the one to call the baron grandfather and killing him worked rather well here. Timothee killed it as Paul. His rallying speech to the Fremen, his fight with Feyd, his closing scene/line about letting the fremen lead the other houses to paradise I thought just expressed so much. 

During the final battle scenes, I liked how Denis had us with the Emperor and crew. So we didn't get to see any of the fighting, we were just locked in with the others, who had no idea what was happening until the doors opened. 

It's been awhile since I read the book, so I can't remember how vivid the visions were shown/described, but I got to admit it was unintentionally funny how Paul kept going about visions when he sees billions die, and then you see the vision and its like what, 10 people. I thought maybe that could've been tweaked.

Austin Butler's Feyd was really surprising in a good way. Judging from the trailers it looked kinda one note, but I thought Butler did a lot of great acting without speaking just with certain looks or expressions including watching Paul kill the baron. And his choice for how to speak/use his voice also helped him stand out. 

All in all, great film which I can't wait to see again.",2024-03-01
"So first off this film is incredible, I saw it 4 days ago and all I've done is think about when I can go again. I got to go to a double screening of part 1, immediately followed by part 2. Let me tell you, the fastest 6 hours of my life. The pacing in this sequel is off the charts.

I'm interested to see the difference with only watching part 2. But I can guarantee, whenever I rewatch this at home, it will be back to back it just feels ""right"". 

Absolutely incredible achievement. Everytime I think Villeneuve might have hit his peak, he keeps going. What a time to love sci-fi and film.",2024-03-01

"It's hard to describe just how impressed I was with this movie. I was enraptured the entire way through. The sound design was phenomenal, the score was incredible, the whole design team killed it with the costumes. Explosions in both Dune movies are incredibly visceral, and felt immense. The usage of the voice is very well done. The Harkonnen planet was a visual feast. Pacing was very well done. All the actors were on top of their game, and Timothee especially did an amazing job, especially once he embraced his role. 

Just wow - I am impressed by every level of this movie!",2024-03-03
"Obviously, beyond incredible. I watched in BFI IMAX - it was utterly immersive - except when people coming to and from the toilet would run across Arrakis, Geidi Prime, or the Emperor's face. 😂 Some people had to deal with their body's moisture and that's okay! I went twice! Ran like Shai-hulud was behind me!",2024-03-03
"If you haven't seen it yet, do not go to anything less than IMAX.

If you've never read the books, or even if you haven't seen any of the previous movies, or maybe don't remember much from Part One, I'd argue that it's digestible enough to follow what's going on while still having a good time.

Saw it last night. If I'm being honest, I haven't been particularly hyped until a few days ago when I decided I could swing treating myself to a night out, and started paying attention to all the buzz. I was seriously ready to wait until I could stream it at home and man, am I glad I didn't put it off! Long-time book fan and I have a few criticisms, but they really do pale in comparison to everything Villeneuve got right. Not sure I'd go as far as all the headlines putting it right alongside LotR, but *kull wahad!* that was the best movie experience I've had *since* LotR!

Most notable for me:

The entire Giedi Prime infrared sequence is one of the most entertainingly chilling things I've ever seen in film. Also, can we *please* talk about how Austin mafuckin' Butler totally nailed Feyd-Rautha?!?

The music and sound effects with Paul controlling the worm took that scene to a whole 'nother level. Especially considering it was a scene about...a kid...riding a worm.

Personally, I loved how they used Jessica's pregnancy.

Stilgar's humor was just subtle enough you could still laugh through serious moments without it feeling like forced comic relief.

Something about when Muad'dib popped up in particular really hit just how well-done the CGI was.

From the perspective of having to translate book to film, I can appreciate the choice of Chani going all moody. At the very least, Paul prophesying that she'll eventually come around softened up her character flip and added some interesting tension.

Would have liked to see Princess Irulan and Emperor Shaddam fleshed out just a bit more, but I think they at least managed to explain their roles well-enough and the actress who played the Princess owned what she was given.",2024-03-03
"Lady Jessica was on the highlights for me in this movie. Especially some of her cinematic shots of her as revered mother made me really think ""man, I wish I'd be as cool as her"". Dune from a technical view is a masterpiece in anyway but the way they portrayed some of the characters is just so good.",2024-03-03
"I thought it was so funny that out of all the crazy action in the movie, the one time everyone in my (very packed) theater audibly gasped was when Paul said he’d marry Irulan 😅 like how are you gonna do our girl Chani like that lmao",2024-03-03
"I went to see Hans Zimmer live last year, and I think the music he did for this film is some of his best.

Zendaya is *fantastic* in this.

Her expressions are the end of the movie convey *so* much.",2024-03-03
BRING PART III! BRING PART III! BRING PART III!,2024-03-04
I thought when Bautista’s character didn’t do much in the first movie that we’d get some big epic scene with him showing his fighting skills this time around. I love that they subverted my expectations and just made him a cowardly little dirtbag.,2024-03-05
"Man I was hyped and almost worried this movie wasn't going to live up to that, but nope this movie is awesome

Denis has somehow made a better movie than the first one, in the cinema which seems to be in a bit of a drought not just in money but films of this level, there is finally a movie that is just really really good

Everything is good, all the craftsmanship and work that goes into films like these

Denis might have cracked the code on bringing film to the masses but it's too early to tell, when I watched it the opening was 80 million but not sure how its entire run is going to. I hope it does well

What a great movie. I understand there might be some people who might not like slower more detailed crafted movies like this, but I hope most people can enjoy this, I would at least recommend you try it

Seriously great movie, I could mention one person but they are all good, everyone and everything. Explosions, vfx, acting, cinematography, sound, music, writing

Maybe just happy to see a great film by Denis Villeneuve again",2024-03-05

"These two movies are what child-me thought we were going to get back in '99 when The Phantom Menace came out. A dark story about the fall of an ancient regime at the hands of a corrupted youth. The tone is perfect.

Big parts of the original Star Wars movies were dark and gritty, a little like DV's *Dune.* The desert feels like an unforgiving and alien place that we see through an almost documentary lens. Farmers struggle to make a living, civilians are executed and stacked up and burned by uncaring fascist shock troops, informants slip quietly through dirty alleyways, and grungy smugglers don't hesitate to shoot first when they're cornered in divey bars. All of this low-level grounding helped sell it when crazy fantastical shit like the Death Star showed up. The prequels and sequels largely turned it into a brightly-colored kids series and by TLJ we were down to prank calls, yo mama jokes, and Marvel-style quips.

These two movies did it right, though. I'm glad we got them. Best theater experience in a long time.",2024-03-06

HOW did he channel Skarsgaard's voice so flawlessly though, to the point that I thought they did some digital enhancement to it, it was scary good. 

I also felt violated because I found him strangely seductive and kind of sexy, even though he's not. Same with Paul when he goes full messiah, and Ferguson scared but seduced me. 

I'm confused.",2024-03-20
Everything about Paul riding the worm for the first time was legit perfection.  Almost made me cry. Feel like we’re living in another Star Wars moment and it’s incredible.,2024-03-24
"Paul’s rise to power felt fast but believable. Loved that the tension was not in the potential for him to win, but Paul’s emotional reluctance to face the consequences of defeating his enemies.

Everything after he went south felt like a power fantasy fever dream, all in a good way and as it should

I wonder what people think while they're voting this a 1 or 2. What are they trying to accomplish?,2024-03-01
"I watched a Dune 1 & 2 double feature which was a whammy and left me dazed.
It was a fantastic experience, and Dune 2 is an absolutely gorgeous and amazing movie.




**Some great parts:**


- Film!Chani and the relationship between her and Paul in contrast to the book. Because now she feels like her own character and their relationship a lot more real and believable.


- The Sandworm Rides!!! So fantastic, I love it.


- The Giedi Prime scenes. Gorgeous but utterly terrifying.


- Timothee has some pipes. I didn't know that. And I don't mean that for The Voice, but his normal voice during his speeches to the fremen


- Everyone brought their A-levels to their acting




**Some of my criticism:**


- The Emperor. While he was okay, he seemed very bland and without a lot of agency. And I feel his fear regarding Leto and his subsequent actions could have been more pronounced.


- Stilgars fall from more mentor-like figure to zealot follower: it would have hit a lot harder if he hadn't been used so much as Comic relief. Yes, it was funny (eg. ""He's the Mahdi"") but IMO it took away from his downfall


- The role of Spice in Paul's (future) war and during the forced abdication of the emperor. A line about spice was literally the first line in the movie, even before the studio logo, but its meaning (controlling space flight and how Paul/the fremen can basically isolate whole planets and systems now) was a bit shunted to the side IMO.

"One of the best flat-out movies I've ever seen. My only miniscule desire would be to see more of Feyd-Rautha (sp?) being a pure menace and showing why he deserves his reputation, especially considering the ending, but that's a minor nitpick... The film is incredible.

I thought it would just be a visual spectacle (it is) and progression of the story from Part 1 (technically, it is), but it's so much more. The ascendancy of Paul to a complicated protagonist, the expansion of the stakes and the world set up in the first movie, the superior production design, etc. And the visuals, from the Harkonnen world to the sandworm stuff, are somehow even more striking.",2024-03-01

10/10 truly spectacular in every capacity.

I was blown the fuck away by literally every piece that makes this whole.

The visuals are fantastic, the sounds and music top-notch (Hans Zimmer also imo delivered some of his best to date), the story well it's Dune so of course it's good but it's also adapted very well to fit the medium and audience without hurting any of the source imo. The acting is superb by really everyone and the pacing lets every scene and every story beat shine and speak for itself.

I wasn't expecting how funny this thing would be at times as well! Stilgart created moments where the whole room was laughing.

And the action was fire. I will be thinking about the worm riding scenes and the final assault a lot, and even the final duel had something about it that just really made it pop.

I'll be rewatching this movie a lot.",2024-03-03

"I just saw Dune 2 and I thought it was great. I just had one question. Early in the movie, Stilgar has Paul perform this strenuous test of going deep into the desert and then returning back to them, to help prove that Paul is the one in the prophecy. They build it up to be this huge ordeal  that will really test Paul. Paul goes and there’s maybe 1 very brief scene where Chani meets him out there in the desert and helps him sandwalk. Then in the next scene Paul and Chani are fighting in a huge battle, with Paul seemingly having successfully crossed the desert and returned and it’s never mentioned again. Just wanted to make sure that I wasn’t missing something, maybe some scenes were cut or something? Just the crossing of the desert trial seemed to be a little bit underdone after such a buildup.",2024-03-05
That scene where Timotheè becomes Muad’Dib in the circle is about to transcend his career. He was good before now he’s about to hit the stratosphere. Can’t wait to see what he does with Bob Dylan,2024-03-05
"Second comment about this film, but I've been watching all the review and reaction videos on YouTube and reading a lot of articles about it.  One of the points that I've heard is that this is a very old-style film, ""hearkening back to Cleopatra and Ben Hur"" and those other old sword-and-sandal epics, not just because it takes place in the desert.  This is a star-making movie, where the performers can feast on and savor the material that they're given. Where there are long, lingering close-ups of the performers.  If somebody really went to the effort of re-editing it, this could almost work as a silent movie, given how good the direction was.  So even though the action really shines in this, there are so many scenes to connect with and discuss the human consequences of that action.  To sound like an old fogie, ""they don't make 'em like that no more."" 

The really interesting point that I heard too, is that when those epics from the 50s and 60s were being produced, it was being done as a response to television drawing peoples' eyeballs away from the movie theaters.  That the size and scale of the old epics were a way to give people an experience that they couldn't get at home.  And that we are kind of in a similar situation today.  That TV shows haven't QUITE caught up to movies, but they can definitely make a case that they're very close, with the funding behind them and the talent (sometimes) involved.  So the big immersive event films, like last year's Barbenheimer and now Dune, are the direction that the industry SHOULD take in order to remain relevant.  Whether it's realistic to expect Hollywood to output material of similar quality to this is a completely different story.  Since the opening of this has been so huge, despite the heavy material, and because the industry has mastered giving people more and more of what they like, it might be a good sign that Hollywood is going to give us more like THIS.  At the very least, the actors and actresses are going to want their roles in other movies to borrow style and substance from this.  Just thought it was a really interesting thought process.",2024-03-05

"Just got back from my 3rd viewing. When Paul rides the sand worm for the first time, we see him without goggles. The entire time, he has the hooks in both hands. When we see him stand up on the worm, his goggles are on. GLARING continuity error, literally unwatchable  /s


On a serious note every shot in this movie is a work of art. The scenery and cinematography are unbelievable. I love this film so much. Every use of the voice had me shook. And when Paul and Jessica are speaking before Jessica travels south, the way she said “*all of us*” emulating Alia’s voice was freaky as hell. 

Again the Giedi Prime sequence is as gorgeous as it is harrowing. Loved it. 

One of my favorite parts I caught in these rewatches are right before the atomics are shot, Stilgar and his army are calling worms. 1, it was almost a mini homage to the Beacons are Lit scene in ROTK, the way the camera was panning over each thumper. and 2 the way Zimmer MASTERFULLY scored that scene. The thumpers are beating out of turn with each other, then slowly builds into a crescendo of in time thumpers that beautifully transitions into the epic score leading into the attack. Jaw was on the floor. 

I will be back for a 4th viewing this time in IMAX again.",2024-03-09

"As someone who hasn’t read the books and only seen the movies. I think the scene with the hand inside the box and then they show the psychic women discussing how to control him was super important. In the first movie, that happened, but (I think) they didn’t show the discussion on how to control Tim and it’s because they couldn’t. 

Once he gained the power of foresight, humans are at the mercy of him being benevolent or a tyrant. He has become omniscient. The prophecy is BS, but he can follow it and use it as a tool to achieve the vision he wants. Cause even if you can see all possible futures, doesn’t mean you could rule the universe, but he had the perfect storm on this planet.

As they say, those who control the spice planet controls the universe.",2024-03-09
"1. I had constant goosebumps watching the film, I say it’s even better than the first one. I loved Part One too but I also felt it was more like a TV series, like watching Lost. A lot of things were going on but I also thought that nothing really happened. Now Part Two is much more of a traditional film. But I think it also comes down to the director’s master plan. Part One was world building, setting us on the journey. Part Two is where the actual history begins if I can say that.

2. Rebecca Ferguson is insanely good. Lady Jessica is by far the best acted character out of all. I admit I never really seen any other film with her in it but I’m absolutely a fan now. She is the best in both films.

3. Foundation needs a Villeneuve Dune style film adaptation. I still got chills watching the Apple TV series trailer but that was the only good part and the pilot. After that the writer’s never really trusted the viewers :(",2024-03-09

"Man, if you have the chance, watch this shit in IMAX because holy shit, this is probably one of the best movies you could experience that format with.


The scenes in Geidi Prime were fucking gorgeous, and the ink blot style fireworks were insanely breathtaking.


The entire cast killed it so much, and Timothy Chalamet, Javier Bardem, and Austin Butler In particular all played their parts perfectly.


That scene with Paul in the end, telling his Fremen followers to lead everyone to paradise is so chilling, he's become everything he's dreamed about in all his visions, this leader of a cult of personality, and you just get the feeling that's it's all over now, the holy war has finally begun, and Paul has become this person who chooses to cause a war that destroys so many lives, and there's nothing he can do about it.",2024-03-10

"To get the film-ee stuff out the way, it was shot beautifully, the cast was top notch and the music in this one was heavy, dark and atmospheric. Amazingly well made film with a clear visual vision and amazing execution. 


Now, am I a bit disappointed the ‘weird’ aspects of the book were toned down? A bit, was Christopher Walken not a very good emperor? also yes, he lacked that big royal presence. I wanted Charles Dance to take the role and I still think he would’ve been the way to go. 



Now, with those admittedly minor complaints out of the way, I loved this movie - Paul’s character arc was equal parts interesting and sinister, the movie does a great job making you both hate and understand Lady Jessica, and Fayd Rautha stole the show. I also absolutely loved the religious imagery and ‘vibes’ of the whole thing, especially having studied Islamic history both from a government propaganda pov (i come from saudi arabia) and a critical historic pov, Paul’s rise, the Fremen’s dedication to him, the portrayal of ‘miracles’ and the whole rising conquerer vibe of the movie was amazingly handled, and I loved Paul’s reluctance to accept his role as their messiah, until he finally accepted his destiny, embracing the propagated image created for him. The movie also does a great job of stringing you along with the whole “paul is a good guy” fake out form the first movie, until he drinks the water of life and things go for a sinister turn. Been a long time since I left the theater for a 30 minute walk in silence",2024-03-14
"the final battle scene with the fremen riding the worms was peak cinema. loved the film and how crazy weird it gets with the talking fetus, worm milk, psychic people etc. raid scenes and hand to hand combat scenes were great.

Gurney Halleck played the Baliset. I can die a happy man.",2024-03-26
"Absolutely astounding film. This must be what it felt like to see Star Wars in 1977

Villanueves worldbuilding is insane. The fremen feel like such a deeply real culture in every aspect - from costumes, to customs, superstitions, to language. They make this film feel alive.

Cheers to the art directors. The set pieces and sense of scale achieved here will be referenced for generations.

Super impressed with the script as well - Paul’s heel turn felt believable and driven by motive/circumstance. Very hard to achieve in a two and a half hour movie (GOT couldn’t do it in 6 seasons)

Must See this on the biggest screen you can find.",2024-03-02

Paul refusing to kill stilgar saying “To deny his talent in the upcoming battle” was the exact thing his father said in the first movie. And Paul wasn’t around when Leto said it. He really is a great leader like his father. Also possibly Eren Yaeger but we will see how that goes in the 3rd movie lol,2024-03-06

Yeah it’s rough but Paul is doing what he has to do. It’s the the only “narrow” way to overcome his enemies. It’s either free the Fremen and get revenge/honor back or allow the Fremen to become extinct and wither away with them.,2024-03-03

"Watching this film was a very emotional experience for me. I first read *Dune* when I was about 14 or 15. I've probably read it a dozen times since then. Seeing the characters and situations I love come to life on the screen was something I've waited for my whole life and this film did not disappoint. While I love Lynch's 1984 adaptation very much, Villeneuve's adaptation, while deviating from the book in significant ways, will always have a special place in my heart.

That said, there was one scene that was not in the film that I really wish Denis had included - that being the ritual of dividing up Jamis' belongings when Paul sheds water for the dead. It's a very touching and emotional scene and important to the process of Paul being adopted by Stilgar's tribe. I realise that elements of this scene were used in other parts of the film, but I really would have liked to see it portrayed more closely to the book version.",2024-03-03

"Man I feel like this is obvious but it's hitting me a day later. Early on in the movie Jessica tells Paul that his father never wanted revenge, but Paul says that he does. This makes more sense when we find out that jessica and Paul are actually part harkonnan as well, so that desire for violence/revenge comes from there.",2024-03-03

I watched all of the first movie and waited until halfway through this movie before I realized Stilgar was played by Javier Bardem. I kept feeling this odd sensation of recognizing his voice but not being able to name him during the first movie. I feel like he really sort of melded into the character.,2024-03-04
"Wow. I had stupidly high expectations and it surpassed them.  I did think the second d half felt a bit rushed, and I felt like they glossed over Paul's visions a bit compared to part 1.


But what a spectacular achievement.  Villenue has successfully pickled up where Peter Jackson left off with epic sci fi fantasy filmmaking.  Everything was just awesome.  The sandworm riding scene, wow",2024-03-04
"the costume design in this film is maybe the best of any sci-fi or fantasy film that I've ever seen. everything looks real and worn and practical while staying within it's own culture, *and* also being beautiful and elegant. to me it's one of the most impressive things about it, it really helps in the worldbuilding.",2024-03-04

"Reading all the comments of people saying their theater busted out laughing at Stilgar, glad I didn’t get that experience. Really would have taken away from the moments of his joy of the prophecy.

"Is anyone else wondering how exactly will Paul lead the Fremen to fight against the Great Houses in the next movie?

Saw the second one in theaters 3 hours ago and I was in simple awe. There’s just so so many thoughts running through my mind that I don’t even know where to begin. I’m glad to see other people needing out to this like I did. This movie legit makes me want to read the book now",2024-03-08

one of the best movies in the past few years.,2024-03-11
"Just finished my second watch. My immediate thought after was that this will be my first movie that I'll watch 3+ times in theaters. Unfortunately my little town doesn't have imax, so I'm debating making the 2 hour drive to the nearest imax theater lmao. This is such an incredible story. Hans Zimmer has solidified himself as one of the greatest film composers of our time. The scale of these films feels unprecedented. Not just in terms of the size of things like the ships, the sandworms, etc., but the themes as well. 

Just a few random thoughts:

Paul riding the sandworm for the first time gave me chills, even more so on my second viewing.

""The mahdi is too humble to say he is the mahdi. Even more reason to know he is!"" made me laugh out loud.

The way Stilgar says ""lisan al gaib"" after the fight with feyd is so funny to me, the relief in his voice, the way it sounds like he's saying ""I knew it"" after thinking he was about to watch Paul die. 

Damn. Such an awesome movie.",2024-03-13
Am I the only one who thought the baby sandworm was kind of cute and I was sad when it died,2024-03-13
I need a hype man like Javier Bardem in my life,2024-03-14
"I loved the visuals and general 'cinematic' experience but unpopular (maybe?) opinion: it felt somewhat 'hollow'. Paul didn't feel like an actual person -- the interiority of his character was entirely lacking beyond vague 'don't wanna go' allusions to the Jihad and the south -- his experience with the spice was also allusional and his transformation exact and sudden... Chani and Stilgar were better characterised, but they also had no arc... it felt a bit, almost, stale?

The emperor was so one dimensional (he also is in the book, but still) as to be essentially dull; the baron was a non factor; Raban did nothing but be replaced by an equally bland and displaced character... well acted, performed, imagined, delivered but... there was nothing beneath the veneer",2024-03-16
"This movie was a huge masterpiece and my theater was not able to destroy the experience. Being a small theater in a small town, they presented it with fat black bars to the sites because they don't know how to get their movies to fill the entire screen and the speakers were totally overwhelmed with the sound but it was still a rich movie experience.",2024-03-20
Since Rise of the Planet of the Apes trilogy ended. Dune is the latest one to capture that sci-fi epic. I know Avatar: Way of Water came out 2022 but plot made their world small & redundant.,2024-03-28
"I feel like it was rushed. What I love about the first movie was the atmosphere and this sense of underlying foreboding. Part 2 didn’t have that same feeling for me. Things just kept happening one after another with no space to breathe. Apparently, the things that happen in part 2 actually occurred over years in the novel, so why did they compress it to months? 

If they had made part 2 focus on Paul integrating with the Fremen, earning their reverence, bonding with Chani, building up the legend of the Muadib, and then ending with a crucial attack that makes him wrestle with the decision to drink the water of life to protect them, I think I would have liked it better. And then part 3 could’ve fleshed out Paul’s changing personality and focused on the political machinations needed to get his revenge and spend more time on the decision of the Fremen to carry out jihad.",2024-03-28
"Really liked the movie overall. Austin Butler was the best part along with Javier Bardem. My only complaint is that it felt like Timothy and Zendaya had like zero chemistry. Also, both of their dialogues at times felt too modern and out of place. “Hey, what are you guys laughing about?” Completely took me out of the movie",2024-03-01
"Saw this yesterday. 10/10.  
  
Stunning on every level - visuals, cinematography, score, acting. Timothée owned the latter half of the film. Chani was amazing. Austin Butler was terrifying as Feyd. The IR-shot scenes on Giedi Prime were beautiful.  
  
As someone who loves the book, I was very happy with Denis' adaptation of the second half. Enough changes were made to make it more adaptable and general audience friendly, while still maintaining the core themes and ideas.  
  
I might love Part Two even more than the first film, but I need couple of more watches as it's a lot to process.  
  
Going again today, tomorrow and next Saturday, finally in IMAX.  
  
This must make all the money in the world so we get Messiah and I will do my part.",2024-03-02

Definitely in my top ten movies of all time. I'm rarely speechless after exiting a movie.. But this? Maaaan that took me out",2024-03-03
"Saw it last night and loved it. There were a few differences from the book that kind of bummed me:

* The second half of the book takes place over a couple of years and Alia is actually born and we get to see some of her growth
* The book makes it explicitly clear that the marriage between Paul and Irulan is strictly political and Paul and Chani are still a couple
* The book has a lot more focus on Paul training the Fremen in the Weirding Way (which is something Lynch's version gives a lot of attention to)

With that said, those changes are not detrimental to the overall story and I think the two movies together make it to my top 3 sci-fi franchises.",2024-03-03
"My biggest annoyance in the book to film adaptation wasn't >!changing the brutal manner in which Feyd is killed!<, >!altering the ending by omitting the exchange between Chani and Jessica!<, or even the >!lack of a pre-born toddler for the finale!< - it was the inconsistent punctuation in the subtitles. What happened there? Part One had good grammar. 

Otherwise, this was a 10/10 film that had me on the edge of my seat throughout. Fantastic visuals, bone-rattling sound design, otherworldly and intense score, and fantastic performances abound. Cannot wait to watch this back-to-back with the first film. This is a masterpiece and easily my favorite film of the year.   

Bring on Part Three!",2024-03-01

"I loved this movie. But I have one major gripe that I don't see anyone discussing. 

Bautista's and Brolin's fight was pretty anti-climatic; which would have been passable if not for the worst like of dialogue in the movie ""this is for the duke, and my friends"". 

A large portion of my theatre laughed. It was so woefully out of place from the rest of the movie.

I also wish lady Jessica and Gurney got a scene together.. Thought that was strange.",2024-03-01
"Absolutely spectacular movie, 10/10 gonna see it 3 more times at least.

One thing I didn't quite understand and thought was kinda important: When Lady Jessica drinks the Holy Poison, the passing Reverend Mother remarks in terror that she's pregnant and everyone around kinda gasps in fear. What does that mean? And if it means something ominous and dangerous, why did they not do something about it?

I understood it as ""it is dangerous, but she is now the reverend mother so we must do as she says no matter what"". Is that correct? I was quite interested in that little plot point and moment in the movie, would love to hear more about the lore behind it!",2024-03-01

"I’m trying to be measured in my response to this film, but it was honestly one of the most moving artistic experiences I’ve ever witnessed. Story aside, the audio - visual achievement of this project is, for me, unmatched. Several instances brought tears to my eyes out of shear awe. As the final scene cut and the score hit, I just sat and cried for a solid 5 minutes.

Also, I was skeptical of TC as Paul, even for some of this movie, but he completely took over this film by the end. The scene of him announcing his arrival to the bene gesserit was fantastic.",2024-03-05
"Just came out of a very empty session (perks of going to the movies mid-week), probably one of the best cinematic experiences I've ever had based on sound alone, will be sad watching it at home without a surround system. Top notch visuals, which is a given with Villeneuve, and got me very excited for part 3. 

Also, a shout out to the movie's comedy, specially Javier's. Guy got pitch perfect comedic timing, that ""Lisan Al-Gaib!"" at the end of the last duel killed me, dude sounded like that uncle who just saw his favourite soccer player score a goal haha.",2024-03-13
"I guess I’m gonna be downvoted but these responses are confusing me.

It was a good, well made film but people saying it was one of the best films they’ve ever seen are a bit much. People are also saying specifically that it was better than Part 1 because Part 1 was slow. Did we watch the same movie? This was very slow. The final antagonist Paul faced took a ton of time even to be introduced. I still think Part 1 was the better movie.

That said, still a visually stunning and well acted movie. Would definitely recommend seeing in the highest quality format possible.",2024-03-01

"I am left emotionally overwhelmed at this achievement in filmmaking. So many masters at their craft collaborating to bring us something so layered and thoughtful and compelling to the point that the film is profound. 

How can one script/production so seamlessly blend together religious themes of epic proportion, completely unique world building, groundbreaking VFX and cinematography, simultaneous character and actor development, and a tragically compelling love story? 

Immediate, automatic instant all-timer. A humbling experience.",2024-03-13

"The moment when Rabban is approaching the door to Baron Harkonnen's chambers, and we here a servant/slave screaming, ""No, no!"" followed by a *blood curdling* scream - and then a blunt impact - really bothered me. It sounded so real.",2024-03-19
"One scene I haven't seen mentioned yet that I really loved was that bit with Rabba running and almost being killed by a Fremen. This is a feared guy who squared up with Gurney who is acknowledged as one of the best fighters in the empire and some random Fremen almost kills him. He's just sitting there thinking that that a no name Fremen almost took him out and that these fanatically loyal, dangerous people are willing to fight and die in Paul's name, and there are millions of them. I loved his look of realizing how fucked they are.",2024-03-31
"Good movie but it would’ve been even better even if it was 30 more minutes. Not the 5 out of 5 stars everybody is saying, more like a 4. I feel like even though it has a long runtime it felt a bit rushed. Austin Butler was under utilized and could have been more fleshed out and more impactful next to the romance between Paul and Chani which i felt came too quickly based on the scenes we had. Also the final assault on whatever compound it was felt too fast for me when they were suddenly in the room with the emperor and the baron. Would have loved to see more of the battle there and not this quick cut to it happening and feeling like we missed something. Still enjoyed it though",2024-03-01
"Has anyone noticed that the first shot of Part 1 is a vision and we see it play out in Part 2 when Chani tells Paul right before they kiss, “Arrakis is so beautiful when the sun is low.” There’s a quick moment after that where you can see on Paul’s face that he realizes another one of his visions has come to pass. I just love how subtle that call back was.",2024-03-02
Paul the absolute chad picking to marry the princess in front of his girlfriend,2024-03-02
"A solid 9/10.

We now have a definitive film adaptation of Dune, just like we got with LotR that will likely stand the test of time. 

Personal highlights: 

Chalamet's Paul after drinking from the Water of Life. What a transformation. Totally bought that version of his character, not thinking I would.

The score. A Time Of Quiet Between The Storms and the recurring musical motif is just chef's kiss.

Feyd Rautha. Butler absolutely nailed it and almost stole the show.

I was glad Denis wrote out Alia's character and kept her from being born yet. Would've been way too difficult to faithfully adapt this book without some weird shit and that's probably #1 for me.",2024-03-03
"Loved the movie, thoroughly entertained for the entire movie. Never once looked at my watch. A couple of points that I haven’t seen raised that I thought were great, subtle touches: 

1) I loved the juxtaposition between the north/south Fremen. It also seemed like a generational divide, with the younger Fremen (Chani, Shishakli, etc.) being the skeptical ones and the older folks like Stilgar buying in. Felt like a subtle nod to real life, where younger generations are increasingly apathetic/skeptical to organized religion (me included). 

2) I LOVED the scene where Rabban is flying his troops into the storm/ambush to face off against Mua’Dib. You see the shot of the Harkkonen guy throwing up out of nervousness, and the others looking scared stiff. Did such a great job of showing that despite Rabban and Vladimir’s designation of the Fremen as “rats,” they have struck fear into the hearts of the Harkkonen foot soldier. The fight was over before they even landed. 

Separately, Austin Butler stole the fuckin show. Feyd Rautha was terrifying. Chalamet’s sietch scene was incredibly well acted, and genuinely startling. Lastly, the intro to Feyd-Rautha and the oil fireworks were amazing. 

Can’t wait to go again in two days. This is the closest I have felt to coming out of the theaters after Mad Max: Fury Road. Which is a big compliment IMO.",2024-03-03
"Also Christopher Walken - massive miscast

Not sure if it’s because I watch Severance but I couldn’t really accept the character as this emperor who rules",2024-03-05
"So if you drink the blue worm juice, you become an asshole",2024-03-06
"As a cinematic experience, this movie is a 10/10

Visually stunning, beautiful score, just an utter spectacle. Probably the first movie since Fury Road where I was thinking to myself, “I have never seen anything like this.” 

The action sequences are incredible, I can’t fathom how this whole creative team put this together. In the final battle scene, I was just in awe of the VFX of the totally original sci fi vehicles and structures soaring in the background, the choreography of the actual fighting, the costume and weapon designs, the perfect cinematography, the sound design, the music, everything was incredible. It takes hundreds, if not thousands of people operating at the top of their game to pull all that off. 

I do think there was clunky dialogue at times and the flow of the plot wasn’t perfect. Not bad, but it’s just a lot stuffed into one movie (even if it was nearly three hours). 

Overall, a must see experience in theaters. Check it out in iMax if you can.",2024-03-01
Austin butler went for seconds when he kissed his uncle 😂😂😂,2024-03-01
"What a fucking achievement. I loved part 1 and this blew it away. And holy fuck Feyd Rautha, Butler crushed that role. ",2024-03-01
"As a huge book fan , seeing the final battle actually play out on a screen was phenomenal. Huge smile on my face the whole time. 

Giedi Prime black and white because of the black sun, also super well done. This movie was 10/10 for me. 

Small detail - didn't Ultimately take away, but anyone else disappointed with how long the fight was against feyd rautha at the end. I feel like the point was to show how easy it was for Paul? Idk correct me if I'm wrong",2024-03-01
"So incredibly incredibly good. I cannot wait to watch 1 & 2 back to back. My only complaints were the dipshits behind me that wouldnt stfu despite multiple people hushing/asking them to stop, and Walken not feeling transformed from his usual self enough. I thought all the other performances were very transformative and left the actor behind, while I only ever saw Walken, not the Emporer. But god damn what an incredible film - one of the best edited movies Ive ever seen",2024-03-01
"I love how they showed how manipulative and scary the Bene Gesserit truly are…it was something tamed and overlooked in the Lynch version of the movie. 

When you heard “the voice,” it’s not a funny quirk…it’s mental rape.",2024-03-01
"I loved it, except: they almost completely forgot about the Spacing Guild. The entire reason Paul can take over the Empire in the book is because his threat to destroy the spice will destroy the guild. That's how he can force them to transport the Fremen, otherwise they're not going very far.",2024-03-02

"A sequel just as good as Part One if not better

- Rebecca Ferguson and Javier Bardem carried the first act
- Pacing was almost too fast even though it's a long movie
- Technically, the movie is impressive in terms visual effects, cinematography, production design, sound. Will sweep the Oscars again
- Timothée Chalamet during the scene where he claims his Chosen One title was absolutely perfect! 
- Action was lacklustre except for the final fight
- Kinda wished the kept Anya Taylor-Joy's cameo as a secret


Visually impressive and one of the best IMAX experiences!",2024-03-01
This film is re-watchable. Just came from third viewing and the ending hit even harder,2024-03-02
"At 2 hour and 48 minutes, it felt like it could and even should have been longer. A bit more explaining through scenes some of the reasons why characters were at where they were at.

I enjoyed it **far** more than the first film.  Part 2 is the best sci-fi film I've seen since Ex Machina at least.

Probably the best IMAX experience I've ever seen (Metreon IMAX in SF, 70mm print).  It didn't have the crispness of Oppenheimer but this film better utilized what the IMAX format can do with scale and sound.",2024-03-02
"I echo so Many sentiments that have already been said: beautiful visually, stunning sound, Butler killed it, Chalamet having his “this dude is it” scene when fully embracing the messiah role etc etc…

But can we talk about how Zendaya just rocked dude with an RPG straight to the chest from like 5 feet away?",2024-03-03
Kinda shocked how different Chani is from the book. Not sure how I feel about it.,2024-03-01
Don’t go to a late night screening; you will stay up late thinking about this movie,2024-03-02
I feel like this is the closest I’ll ever get to being in 1980 and seeing The Empire Strikes Back in theaters. Seeing an absolute masterwork of science fiction. A sequel that meets expectations in every single way. It’s just perfect,2024-03-06
"As someone who was not a big fan of Part 1, Part 2 blew me away in every way possible

P.S. If you pretend the water of life is Gatorade, this movie is kinda hilarious",2024-03-01
"No exaggeration that might be one of the best third acts I’ve ever seen. The rest of the movie is great, but everything from Paul’s Water of Life sequence to the end is an all-time great 45-50 minute sequence.",2024-03-01
"I have mad respect for what Villeneuve did here. He adapted the book in a way you normally only see it in theater done with classic plays. The source material is an amazing story on the one hand but full of anachronistic elements on the other hand. While containing amazing ideas and concepts there is also a lot of problematic stuff in it. It's like super fascists vs. normal fascists vs. religious fanatics and terrorists vs. eugenic-witches. Typically we would see an adaption either ignoring this fact altogether or kind of whitewashing the story to make it palatable in the 21. century. Villeneuve did neither but instead leaned into all those problematic aspects and deconstructed the story to a point where basically every individual or fraction is kind of bad in it's own way. And he does that by staying essentially very close to the source material. The changes to the story are rather subtile and a lot of it is delivered by aesthetics. I don't think I have ever seen a sci-fi/fantasy blockbuster being that bold. Star Wars and even LotR (which I adore) look like movies for babies compared to this.

  
Also the costumes and set designs. OMG!!!",2024-03-01
"I think this movie will solidify it's four young stars as bona-fide movie stars. A lot of the discourse is already focused mainly on the performances of Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya, Austin Butler and Florence Pugh. Rightfully so. The film would not have worked as well without their stellar performances. This will be seen as career defining films for all of four of them. 

I was listening to ""The Big Picture"" podcast episode on this and I think they put it more aptly. This is them jumping from famous upcoming stars to Harrison Ford level movie star. 

Not to take anyway from the older actors, of course. They also gave great performances. Rebecca Ferguson, in particular, stands out. In many ways I think she gave the most interesting and thought provoking performance overall. 

I think this will also finally establish Denis Villeneuve as a big name director with the mainstream.",2024-03-01
"Ughhh. Absolutely incredible. Unfiltered thoughts and reactions:

&#x200B;

* Part One is so well done that its impossible not to be entertained, but it purely exists to set up the marvelous payoff of Part Two. The set up is important, but I think the contrasting scenes and echoes are where the magic is
* The execution of visuals, cinematography, casting, pace, costumes is just incredible. IMO Villeneuve has followed a similar trajectory to Christopher Nolan as a visionary director being given bigger budgets to work with, and there's something about his style that is absolutely captivating. One of my favourite things about these films is how convincingly it portrays the sense of scale and importance, and its easy to fall under the spell that these actors standing in a room talking are the most powerful people in the universe. Not an easy feat. 
*  Chalamet is truly Paul in Part Two. The diminutive desert mouse is a very fitting motif for the boyish actor who commands this massive film. in Part One, Leto foreshadows that he found his ""own way to lead"" and that Paul might do the same, and to see it come to fruition was so satisfying
* The film took juuuust enough time in the first act to really sell Paul and Jessica's transformation into Fremen, and I really appreciated the little details to sell this
* I found Javier Bardem to be pretty stale in Part One, but now with the context of Part Two I really enjoyed his arc. The juxtaposition of seeing Stilgar be disrespectful and aloof with Leto in Part One, to a fanatic of Muad'Dib in Part Two was excellent. And the scene of Stilgar and the other boomer-Fremen finding meaning in absolutely everything Paul did was hilarious 
* I also really appreciated the nuance of the North/South tribes and how this played into the plot. Paul's true love of the Fremen way of life (through Chani) was a solid emotional thread to the film, and grounded his character from the universe-conquering Emperor he becomes 
* Some clear seeds for a Part Three laid throughout, and I can't fucking wait
* Paul taking command of the sandworm was so powerful, and his conquering felt earned afterwards
* The scene of Paul's true ascension to prophet in the Fremen underground; wow. Ready to take any warriors on, and then a demonstration of his prophetic power to bring them to heel
* ""I can hear your footsteps, old man"". I had a big grin on my face at this reunion
* I really appreciated Feyd being given more nuance through his connection to the Bene Gesserit, and enough time to stand on his own. His extended introduction was excellent, and the parallels to Paul were given enough time to make an impact. And Feyd having the same speech pattern as the Baron was an excellent flourish to the role
* Poor Bautista gets another thankless role. His character deserved a bit more and I'm still waiting for his true breakout role
* I was a bit disappointed with the lack of time we got with Walken as the Emperor, but I'm still glad with his casting nonetheless. It was a great contrast to see him on the throne and all-powerful above the Baron, before seeing him brought to heel before Paul.
* And it was also a very nice touch to see the Baron have so much trouble bowing to the Emperor. Clearly a gesture he has rarely had to pull off, and you could see how much it chafed him to do so
* I knew it was coming, but seeing Paul command the Reverend Mother Mohaim to silence was everything I wanted it to be
* I can't even begin to pick out the visual details, but I can recall a scene of Chani fighting that echoes one of Paul's visions in Part One. I can't wait to see more",2024-03-01
Evangelical Jarvier Bardem cracked me the fuck up lol,2024-03-01
"The colosseum scene was fucking amazing, I fell in love with Feyd the moment he was introduced. >!So fucking bummed out when I realized the finale would be him vs Paul because that meant he would die and we wouldnt get anything of him in the third film!< Made me really excited for the new Gladiator film too.",2024-03-01

I’m so happy I never hopped on the Austin Butler hate train. He is an incredibly gifted actor who is going to reign in the industry for decades to come.,2024-03-01
"Love how striking all the war imagery is without ever overstaying its welcome. We hardly even get full sequences—more like quick little living tableaus, shreds of a masterpiece ripped from their museum to come ribboning past us. 

Also love the use of a humor part one lacked, and especially as a way to underscore how ridiculous the beginning of a myth can be—before we get swept along with the Fremen into cheering for Paul until it’s too late. Masterful stuff",2024-03-02
"My fave part is when Paul enters the room with the prisoners and everyone's (harkonnen's, emperors) face lights up with orange.

"If you can, you absolutely must see Dune Part 2 in theaters. It was truly incredible. The opening sequence with the Harkonnen troops on the rock tower under the eclipse, Paul riding the worm for the first time, Jessica drinking the water of life, and everything that takes place on Giede Prime - all visually phenomenal in every way.",2024-03-02

felt like a literal living paint at several scenes, it was incredible and mind blowing",2024-03-02
"Just got out of my showing and all I can really say is wow.

Timothée Chalamet is just further solidifying his status as a top tier actor, and this movie has launched the Dune universe as a top contender for one of the greatest Sci-fi film series I’ve ever watched. 

I didn’t read the book and I’m going into this franchise for the most part blind, and it’s so rewarding. I don’t know where this story is gonna take me, but i am 100% along for the ride.

LISAN AL GAIB!!!",2024-03-03
"Between the Dune and Avatar movies, I'm so happy to see that the sci-fi genre is still alive and well. This balance of spectacle and engaging storytelling is what made Star Wars so generational in the first place; that's why I think Star Wars is in desperate need of a well-planned movie trilogy instead of an endless onslaught of poorly planned disney+ shows. Honestly though, pains me to say but I'm ok at this point if Star Wars never comes back if i know the sci fi/fantasy genre torch is being carried by other incredible talent.",2024-03-03
"Phenomenal movie, but I really don't get all this hype about Feyd-Rautha being the scariest most evil movie villain ever. We literally see the guy for less than 15mins and he never really does anything impressive. He kills a bunch of NPC's, 3 drugged guys, a malnourished prisoner, and airstrikes the Fremen base. Don't get me wrong Austin Butler did a great job portraying him. I just don't get the hype for the character at all.   
   
I found the whole reaction from the Bene Gesserit during the arena scene pretty funny too. They were acting like Feyd-Rautha just did this amazing feat. When all he did was take out 3 drugged guys and struggled against the final guy whose been in prison for god knows how long. Like come on, we just saw Paul ride a fuckin worm and kill tons of Harkonnen. We're really supposed to think this guy is a threat?",2024-03-05

Saw in Dolby and in IMAX. The IMAX was a lot better. I am a huge fan of Dolby too but the increased aspect ratio added so much and the imax was so loud in a good way. Sometime I feel like they are just pumping it up but damn I can’t wait to see it in imax a few more times,2024-03-01

"Awesome movie, but the moment that stood out for me the most was that they brought back Jamis as a mentor. Jamis is the last one Paul asks for guidance before going south, it's whos opinion he trusts most, perhaps because he never saw him as a lord or messiah or son, just as another person. Jamis is basically the Djinn Stilgar mentioned.",2024-03-01

"Just got back from the theatre, and man, damn. The spectacle, visuals, cinematography, and sound were S-tier. I cannot wait to see it again, hopefully in IMAX. 

My reaction towards the characterisation compared to the novel was more mixed. I liked how they gave Chani way more agency and things to do, as the only character who wasn't drinking the Lisan-al-Gaib kool-aid and saw the Bene Gesserit propaganda for what it was. I didn't like how they make Paul buy-in 110% in becoming the symbol of the Lisan-al-Gaib to the point of seeming to forget about the Fremen dream and discarding Chani.

In the novel, the relationship between Paul and Chani is meant to mirror the Duke Leto and Lady Jessica - concubines who are really the wives. I was sad to see that disappear from the movie.",2024-03-01

However did anyone else find it way too loud? Maybe I'm getting old, but I don't remember movies being this loud in theatres ten years ago.

Everything has been said but I’d like to appreciate that you can see the budget in how damn beautiful and expansive and bold this movie is. Every last cent feels line it was used towards making the movie the best it could be. There are movies with double this reported budget that look far worse.,2024-03-02
Probably my favorite intro scene for a sci fi movie,2024-03-02
"I just came back from seeing it in IMAX and I was blown away by the sound design, score and visuals. Every scene and shot was perfect and you always knew what was happening, every action, sequence and dialogue said had impact and clarity. What I always find so compelling with Villeneuve’s films is how precise his storytelling is. The dynamic and love story of Paul and Chani is so emotional. The way he depicts each planet and how he didn’t shy away from the influence of Islam in Frank Herbert’s novel, and so many other aspects I can just rave on about, makes this a rewatch (many times) for me.",2024-03-03
"HIGHLIGHTS

Like everybody else I was pretty amused with Stilgar -- until Paul drank the worm bile. His fanaticism became terrifying.

Speaking of the water of life I wish Paul's was as creepy as Jessica's whole sequence. But, damn, Chalamet just exuded power and command after all that water of life business. I was glued to the screen when he marched in and defied the Fremen.

Giedi Prime. Need I say more? GIEDI PRIME.

Also, I couldn't have asked for better actresses portraying the Bene Gesserit. Rampling, Ferguson, and even Seydoux were phenomenal. I didn't get 'psychic witches' vibe from the BG in part 1 -- but in this one, *oh man.*",2024-03-03
"Making Dune pt 2, I'm sure the handling of Alia was one of the first hurdles Villeneuve and Co. came across and I think they handled it very well. 

A book-accurate Alia running around would have been almost impossible to not be cheesy or a CGI mess. 

They still kept the spirit of her gaining awareness early, while adding to Jessica's character.",2024-03-03
"There is so much DNA of Denis’ old stuff in this thing.  A ton of the shots of faces of the Fremen in the first third reminded me of the shots of recruits in the opening to Incendies.

In fact, just the way people moved through this whole movie and occupied the camera was really cool, if that makes sense.  It was just as impactful as the big set pieces.",2024-03-03
"That scene where Paul was talking about their narrow path to survival, I so wanted him to call it their golden path",2024-03-03
"Holy crap I saw this in IMAX and it was worth all of my monies! The sound design, the costumes, and the visuals were so cool!!!",2024-03-03
All the talk about bloodlines in this movie and not one single person acknowledged THE bloodline and their tribal chief Roman Reigns!,2024-03-03
"I liked Austins take on a more composed Feyd, but I feel like it changed the dynamic of the final fight. It was more about skill, than deception and distraction. No hip blade?!",2024-03-03
ABOMINATION!,2024-03-03
"I bought tickets to see this in IMAX, and based on what I've been reading this movie takes the cake in the ultimate imax experience, can't wait.",2024-03-03
"Maybe it's common knowledge and done purposefully, but was the black & white during the scenes of Harkonnens on Giedi Prime alluding to 1940s Nazi Germany? Sure got those vibes!",2024-03-03
How did Paul wake up suddenly when Chani placed a drop of the blue liquid on his lip? Was he pretending for the sake of the prophecy (desert spring tears) so that the people would believe him?,2024-03-03
"Saw it on Friday in Dolby Cinema. Loved it as a non-book reader. Will be seeing it in IMAX 70mm soon with the siblings.

There were a few small quibbles, but the overall experience that this movie was kind of renders those things inconsequential.

It's crazy how this movie is PG-13 when you consider that pretty much all of the MCU movies of the past decade were also PG-13. Those movies are like cartoons compared to this film from a tone perspective. Denis Villenueve and his editor did an incredible job making a dark, gritty sci-fi movie meet the requirements to stay PG-13 while delivering for the audience an R-ratedesque experience.",2024-03-03
"Best, pure, minute-for-minute, filmgoing experience I’ve ever had",2024-03-03
Paul Atreides gave me HUGE Eren Yeager (Attack on Titan) vibes,2024-03-03
"So, at the end of the movie, did Paul actually believe he is Lisan Al Gaib or was he playing along because he felt he had to? 

10/10 movie. So happy I saw it in the theater.",2024-03-04
[deleted],2024-03-04
Is there anyone that can find that scene with three worms attacking for a desktop background? Ngl that was really hard!,2024-03-04
"Odd request. But does anyone happen to have an English transcript of the scenes where they speak Fremen? I'm trying to see the movie here in Italy but unfortunately the English language showings here don't have English subtitles during those scenes, only the standard Italian subtitles.",2024-03-04
When the nukes screamed through the sky and hit was fucking nuts in Dolby. (But so was everything). That scene was unbelievable,2024-03-04
"I dunno why but I felt, like, REALLY confident walking down the street after getting out of this movie. 

Brb gonna go end an empire.",2024-03-05
"Curious, did anyone see Jon Bernthal? I think he was one of the Freeman when they first enter the city.",2024-03-05
Holy mother of God,2024-03-05
"Do people actually think Duke Leto was weak? He was definitely idealistic but it seemed to generate a lot of loyalty and he had a badass military. I mean, he was enough of a threat to be the target of a very expensive plot.",2024-03-05
"One of the best movies I’ve seen. 10/10, contemplating going to NYC and watching it on Lincoln square IMAX. Too bad its sold out for weeks. 
Anyone watched Dune 2 on Lincoln square IMAX? How was it? worth the trip?",2024-03-05
What was the point of that one Fremen girl staying behind (and apparently who killed a bunch of fayd’s men) when all the other fremen went south?,2024-03-05
guys what book do i have to read to know what happens right after this,2024-03-05
""".... Not Clever.""",2024-03-05
My favorite part of the movie is the technology: the weaponry and the air/spacecraft. Everything moved so quietly. The Emperor's polished chrome spacecraft reflecting the surrounding sky and desert was a particular highlight. Even the Harkonnen infantry were graceful when they climbed the rock formation by floating up it,2024-03-05
"My new favorite insult is ""You drink worm piss""",2024-03-06
We didn’t get Thanos vs Drax but we got Josh Brolin vs Dave Bautista in Dune.,2024-03-06
"Two questions:

Why was Feyd able to destroy the sietches? I thought their safety came from their secrecy, but it was actually just Rabban's unwillingness to use artillery? What? 

If Paul can see the future, why didn't that final Feyd fight look more like putting down an animal than an actual fight? Did he need to be seen taking a wound for some future fight? Was Feyd so much better than him that this was the only way to win?",2024-03-06
Amazing. Saw it last night and wow. The soundtrack was intense. Austin Butler was great. And the plot overall was full of surprises.,2024-03-07
"I think one thing the movie does better than the books is portraying the transition from friends to fanatics.  Stilgar goes from a mentor/father figure to a frothing-at-the-mouth zealot over the course of the film, and it's hard to portray that in text alone.

Love the Harkonen rodeo clowns, too.",2024-03-07
Glad I was able to see this in a movie theater because that sandworm ride is an incredible scene to experience in the big screen.,2024-03-07
"I really enjoyed the movie and i’m about to watch it again, but here is my question :

Did anyone understand how Harkonnen finally found Sietch Tabr ?

It seemed so difficult before, and they find it just by switching their leader ?",2024-03-07
"Watching Dune part 2 a third time the thing that really started standing out to me are the performances of Walken and Zendaya. I initially agreed about most reviews that Walken just plays himself to the point it becomes jarring but coming out of my third viewing I felt more comfortable Walken playing Walken as the Emperor than Zendaya does a Fremen.

The Emperor is the Emperor, it started to feel perfectly fine seeing his mannerisms as eccentric whereas Zendaya just came across too, I dunno, clean? in both her appearance and mannerisms. I'm not sure if this was intentional on Denis' part to make Chani stand out from all the other Fremen for the viewer's sake or whether Zendaya was just miscast; but she just felt like an American-Fremen. All the other Americanisms felt fine since they reflected the Landsraad culture.

Rather I started seeing Yacoub's performance as Shishakli as something more befitting how I imagined Chani, she just had that free and, more importantly, that coarse/gruff quality that marked all the other Fremen we see that Zendaya, for whatever reason, didn't match.",2024-03-07
"Everything from the moment Paul decided to go south to the end did feel a bit rushed but I think purposefully and not necessarily in a bad way. On one hand it shows that once he made that decision nothing is holding him back (not even bothering to properly explain to Chani what's going on, just following the narrow path to get over with it) and on the other hand this just feels like the prelude for Dune: Part Three. At some point I'll have to watch all of them back to back for the best viewing experience :D

I'll also have to re-watch it in English because some powerful quotes that I've read on reddit (""May thy knife chip and shatter"", ""Bring them Paradise"") don't have such a nice ring to them in German. Sometimes literal translations just can't match the original, I'm not blaming the translators for it.",2024-03-09
"10/10 film. A generational movie IMO. 


**Questions for the book readers:**

Anyone know if Thufir Hawat (Leto’s Mentat) is confirmed dead? He was alive and taken by the Harkonens in the book.

Anyone know why they made the Emperor look so old? Was that just a directorial choice? The book says that the emperor looked like he was in his 30s even though he was in his 70s. 

I of course don’t expect the film to 100% match the book, but these stood out to me, as I started reading the book after watching the movie. ",2024-03-09
Aight this one slapped hard. Felt more expansive than the first one. Also Geidi Prime was amazing. Felt as if I was teleported there.,2024-03-10
"Just saw this for the second time today, this time in IMAX. So worth it. I can’t get over the full body high of the battle of Arrakeen. The sound in IMAX was absolutely crazy. Unfortunately I think the projector may have been miscalibrated a bit because the picture didn’t seem as sharp as I was expecting and I think when I saw it in standard format it seemed crisper, maybe I’m just crazy though. When the love theme for Paul and Chani kicks in as the Fremen prepare to send the nonbelievers to Paradise, you just can’t help but feel the horror and the power. Definitely a 9/10 for me.",2024-03-10
"Honestly a 2-for-1 deal if you watch this in IMAX, a fantastic movie AND an almost 3-hour vibrating seat massage",2024-03-11
"Is this the most violent PG-13 of all time? I'm trying to think of one. I know there are movies with higher implicit body-counts (disaster films, Godzilla v Kong, etc.), but I can't think of any movies with as much in-your-face murder/death as this. The lack of blood and gore kept this from being rated R.",2024-03-11
I really liked it,2024-03-11
"Watching this movie in the theater was really awesome, I even closed my eyes at night before going to sleep and it seemed like I was in the middle of the desert",2024-03-12
"The thing that impressed me wasnt the visuals or the cgi or the worms, it was the the writing. It  is so solid and strong. Also the music just elevates the whole thing to another level.",2024-03-13
"Saw it last night   
all in all a great continuation however i felt it needed another 45 mins to really flush out a few things like the end battle sequence and pauls sand pilgrimage, ratha could have also used a bit more to build his presence, dont get me wrong i loved the gladiator bit but felt like his limited screen time wasn't enough same with the emperor.",2024-03-14
"Cinematic candy that was fast paced and more colorful than Part One. A great adventure that doesn't waste a moment. 

This part just feels like so much more is going on and the stakes getting higher rapidly. The parallels to real world power plays and rebellion and being based on the book make this well detailed and defined.

The idea of people creating myths to use them and become them as well as imperialistic power grabs is a story as old as time, but always interesting. Directing, effects, editing, cinematography, acting, writing all top notch.",2024-03-16
I thought Walken was an interesting choice. He wasn’t bad but very interesting decision.,2024-03-17
">!“At that time, this world had a Fremen name……Dune.”!<",2024-03-17
"My only critic is that it could have had about 30mins more of Harkonen and Emperor scenes.
Gidi Prime is the coolest place from the movies imo.


Hopefully the offshoot series will show more of it and other Harkonen awesomeness.


Probably the best movie villans ever, they really felt authentic and sold them in.",2024-03-17
"So one question I had from both movies (which I loved btw) that maybe I missed since I haven’t read the books…but like what’s the scale of the empire? I know it seems like each house has a planet, but I was just surprised that one planet could destroy the entire empires army in one battle even if they’re the much better fighters. And maybe they haven’t and just won bc now they have the emperor? Is it like you know ten planets, or an entire galaxy?  Maybe they’ll explain it more later",2024-03-18
"Paul character is a true defition of a tragic hero. In a Shakespearean play he would be a perfect protagonist. According to Aristotle's six characteristics of to define a tragic hero he must have these things : **hamartia, peripeteia, anagnorisis, hubris, nemesis, and catharsis**. Paul goes through this in part 1 and 2 and might even have the some more to offer in the next film.",2024-03-20
Wondering if anyone else noticed a “cork popping” sound effect during the scene where we hear the Baron’s servant screaming bloody murder behind a closed door and then see her dead with blood spatter? Possible heart plug reference??,2024-03-20
"I’ve not gone to the theater for a while (in fact one of the last was Wonka lmao) but damn this was a true work of art that must be experienced in IMAX (I watched both the 1.9:1 and 1.43:1 formats). Denis Villeneuve does not miss, like literally every film of his since Prisoners is great (still gotta watch his earlier Canadian films)",2024-03-24
"Really jealous of all the people watching it in IMAX, was great in a normal cinema too thoug",2024-03-27
"Just saw it last night. At the beginning I asked my buddy if the sense of scale is going to be as awesome as it was in the first.

The answer to that question is a resounding YES! Holy shit that was a fuckin incredible movie experience. Absolutely incredible.",2024-04-01
"Didn't feel this movie as much as the people in this thread. It is a far cry from LOTR that's for sure. LOTR had a lot of heart. I would even put GOT ahead of this since the characters were more intriguing and the politics was more complex and engaging. Dune is just too weird and part 2 gets even more so.

Still, the weirdness felt unique and Dune 2 did feel like a breath of fresh air. However, the cold tone (very common in Villenueve's movies) and quick pacing prevent Dune 2 from being an all time film imho. The film puts us at a distance from the 2 main characters of the previou film: Paul and his mother. Instead Chani becomes the emotional core of the movie. Moreover, the water of life thing wasn't well explained. Paul just becomes OP within minutes and he is able to steamroll the Emperor as well as the Harkonnens within seconds. No resistance whatsoever. Became all too simple.

I must say visually this movie was a treat for sure. Definitely worth it to see in theatres but I don't think this is a cinema classic. I still think BR 2049 is Denis's best sci-fi film. And from what I have read, Dune 3, whenever it comes out, will be even weirder. Man I was glad when the credits rolled because the bleak world of Dune is tough to sit in for more than a cople of hours.",2024-04-01
"My thoughts on the film:

* Timothy did a incredible job with this role given the amount of subtle transitions from being a servant / son of Duke all the way to being the messiah. A lot of emotions in-between his transition was portrayed in a way that made the whole journey believable. He did a similar character transition in ""The King"" which is on Netflix, amazing movie which I think was used as audition footage for this role in my opinion.

* Villeneuve has done something with this series that I don't think many people were expecting. The world building and cinematography was outstanding but he also captured a story that I believe is more relevant today than when it was written in the 60s. The families, superpowers, business interests all fighting for power in the form of spice. There is obviously a lot of similar themes to the middle east shortly before this book was written. To me this story was taken from when Mosaddegh tried to nationalize the oil industry only for the US/UK forces to interfere and create a coup overthrowing the government out of fear their oil resource would be at jeopardy and more underlying factors were built out and put into a science fiction setting. What makes you really contemplate is how much things have stayed the same even with corporate entities fighting over technological resources, Russia fighting over Ukrainian resources and obviously what is happening in Gaza to overtake land. It's really a movie that makes you reflect on what is happening in the world today even though it was written decades ago. The prophetic theme of the story makes it much more powerful when realizing how much history has repeated itself.

* One thing I was thinking about regarding the story between Paul and Chani is that he told her he would always love her as long as he breathes. In a prior scene we see Paul having visions of Chani seemingly dying when looking over the dune. I think Paul's newly found ability to see future outcomes has influenced his decision to take the Emperor's daughter as his bride to protect Chani from a negative outcome. I know the film frames the decision to take the Emperor's daughter Irulan as beneficial for Paul to be more acceptable to the Houses but we see the Houses reject his claim anyway. We also see prior that the Reverend Mother Mohiam also desired this outcome which she even seemingly discusses with Irulan. I believe this could be a red herring and that the decision to take Irulan as his bride is more about protecting Chani than about political motives. Paul says to Chani that his allegiance is to her and I don't think that has changed. We are often too reactionary to things and look back on them as fortunate and I think Chani will realize that Paul was protecting her.",2024-04-07
"Are there bots downvoting every single negative comment?

It was an absolutely beautiful film, that probably will grow on me during subsequent viewings but this was talked about like one of the best movies ever made and I never ever got that feeling during thus movie. 

It had pacing problems, it dragged on in places. 

I just dont get the complete love fest.",2024-03-01
"• A Time of Quiet Between the Storms has got to be one of the most beautiful and moving pieces of music I’ve ever heard 

• Austin Butler’s Feyd-Rautha was unbelievably captivating 

• The scene where Jessica drinks the Water of Life and shows Alia surrounded by that beautiful blue and becoming conscious, opening her eyes… holy shit 

• Timothee’s performance when Paul reaches the fundamentalists in the south - DAMN

• The Fremen riding in on the worms, flying the Atreides flag… CHILLS

• That ending… “Lead them to paradise” and the Fremen boarding the ships…. Jessica explaining that the holy war has begun… Wow. Just. Wow.

This movie was a cinematic masterpiece on every front. Acting, direction, score, cinematography, special effects… This is one of those films that will be talked about until the end of time. Hasn’t left my mind since I walked out of the theater.",2024-03-01

The ending of just a closeup of her emotion reminds me of the second hunger games movie where it just ends on Jennifer Lawrence closeup when she wakes up and I think they tell her her home was bombed.

If anyone wants a full-on literary analysis of the themes, meaning, etc: [click here](https://filmcolossus.com/dune-part-two-2024-explained)

I think my favorite scene was definitely the Lisan al Gaib speech. The change in Chalamet was insane.

Fun fact, the same infrared camera used for Geidi Prime was used in Zone of Interest",2024-03-01
"Great fucking movie.  Feels appropriately epic.  A lot of the on location shooting made this world feel a lot more real as opposed to Avatar style of mostly everything on a green screen. 

Watching Chalamet’s growth from meek, quiet boy to “he who do you do not fuck with” leader was fun to watch. 

Some characters feels a little waste.  Brolin’s Gurney comes to mind.  Streamlining the side stories and focusing on the main conflict though really helps the pacing of the story. 

Rebecca Ferguson shines brightest I feel in the whole movie.  Her role really stands out and was pretty masterfully done.

After a long long wait.  We finally get our Drax vs Thanos conclusion.",2024-03-01
"When I thought the female casts are already stacked enough, they suddenly showed Anya Taylor Joy out of nowhere.",2024-03-01

"This was incredible in IMAX. Seeing everyone’s gorgeous faces closeup approx 30 foot high and then the any long shots looked incredible; particularly when    Paul reached the cliff edge to look down below at the Fremens. And the sound was amazing, could hear the flutter of each wing on the dragonfly spaceships. A must watch in imax, really immersive experience. As much as I loved Oppenheimer in IMAX, this film because of its grand scale truly utilises yeh format better",2024-03-02

"I'm lucky enough to have seen this twice already, once at the IMAX fan event last weekend and once today. It's pretty rare for me to see the same movie in theaters twice in a week and I'm not an especially big Dune guy, but I am just stunned at how much I loved it even more the second time. Part One is an achievement in scale and filmmaking, but the character arcs and pacing were just not there. It was a lot of setup of which I am grateful for, but Part Two just fucking hums. Beautiful and epic in scope the entire time, satisfying arcs, a huge and more involved cast, even some natural humor. I think it was well assumed Denis would come back with a homerun this time around, but this thing shatters the bat. 

Denis has such an impressive visual language. Obviously he just made the headline rounds saying how much he hates dialogue and while that's obviously hyperbolic, the things he can do with frame are incredible. His sense of scale is seemingly unmatched in filmmaking right now, there's so many incredible shots of endless desert plains, slow moving ships or armies, or even just a fetus or Walken's face. That shot where Paul is running towards the middle of a sand dune caving in as he's about to jump on the sand worm is wildly impressive. Just think for a moment how hard it must be to shoot in an endless desert and keep it interesting for the eyes. The visual storytelling is doing a lot to keep our eyes busy and it's part of what keeps this from feeling three hours. 

Paul and Chani feel so right in this giving it an amazing emotional core. Zendaya is an actress I like a lot but she stunned me here, especially with that final shot. She's selling how tough Chani would have to be to live out there, but she's not prickly. She's vulnerable with Paul it's not something he has to force her to be, you can see she's kind but pragmatic and hardened. Both times I've seen this movie now I get really emotional when they kiss, just after having an honest conversation and the great line ""I would very much like to be equal with you"" and the incredible score that builds up that whole time. It's a moment that totally invests you in the rest of this insane movie plot. 

Timothee also really surprised me with how commanding he was of the screen in the final act. I'm no Dunehead outside of seeing the movie renditions but when he finally says ""Dune"" it is somehow the most awesomely legit way anyone has ever dropped a movie title in the movie. That scene starts a momentum that takes us all the way through the following battle and to the credits, really impressive. It can't be overstated how well cast these are how everyone gets their shine. Javier Bardem in particular is simultaneously having so much fun playing this incredibly sincere religious fanatic. Delivering ""He is too humble to admit he's the one! Another reason he must be! It is foreseen!"" in a made up language like he did is honestly a masterclass line reading. 

The moral complexity on display here has to be somewhat unmatched in this budget of filmmaking, right? Really the only thing in this movie that could be widely agreed upon is the Harkonnen's are not very nice. Other than that it's this massive jumbo of politics, religion, honor, freedom, destiny, and scheming. The second time I saw this I really zeroed in on how everyone was fighting the same war but for different reasons. Chani wants the Fremen free and lead by their own people, Paul wants to avenge his father, Jessica believes in the destiny and wants to protect her son, Gurney wants to fight for the honor of house Atreides, Javier fights for his religion, and it leads them all to the same battle. It's them aligning until they don't. Paul tries to avoid causing any major harm while purposefully posing as a messiah, but the circumstance forces him to follow his visions. He has to make a choice at some point to hit the gas or not, and that's when Chani and him are forced apart. Worth noting the final shot in this movie is not all of the soldiers boarding their warships, it ends with Chani leaving. Absolutely hearbreaking. 

The first real action scene where they attack the harvester was so, so satisfying. That shot of Zendaya running between the legs as the helicopter crashes in the background was such an amazing feeling, and that whole scene starting with the desert mouse, them popping out of the sand, when she shoots that guy with a rocket. The Fremen fighting style is awesome, I love when they just drop to the ground and leg grab the shins, and that jumping horizontal spin Timmy does in the final fight was nuts. The final battle was also incredible, I honestly wanted more of it. The main three warriors all have their ""leading the armada"" moment and Chani goes insane on some fools while the Brolin v Bautista fight is kept purposely succinct. But I just wanted a bit more of the battlefield fight and Paul's ascension to the Emperor's chamber, would have happily sat in that theater for 10 more minutes. 

It's a 9/10 for me, and if you told me it's a 10 I wouldn't disagree. I don't mean to be dismissive of Part 1 which is an achievement on its own, but I don't really see a reason to watch it again unless I'm marathonning. Part 2 was everything I wanted and more, a fully satisfying experience beginning to end. A great love story, action and scale on new levels, a full and vibrant universe with oily fireworks and whole cultures, some natural humor and pathos. I just loved it, and like everyone I really hope Denis gets to finish this the way he wants to. But if he doesn't it's still a massive achievement, and honestly just lucky in this box office landscape, that we got this movie.

Did anyone else think Zendayas acting fell kind of flat? I can’t believe all the praise I’m seeing for it; I thought she was by far the weakest of the bunch. Her chemistry with Timothée was lacking (a problem that falls on both of them) and the last half of the movie she just huffed and puffed like an angry kid. I was definitively underwhelmed but I think I may be alone on that lol,2024-03-02
"That duel between paul and feyd ratha at the end was so fucking intense. I literally was holding my breath until the end.   

Denis is in a tier of his own right now.",2024-03-01
"Fuck, this movie was everything I had hoped it would be and more. I was blown away by the scale of it all, there is something weirdly tangible about the world's Villeneuve shows us that feel miles away from the video game landscapes of recent comic book movies. 

I want to ride a giant fleshlight worm

9/10",2024-03-01
"Some things I really liked:

This is one of the most beautiful movies I’ve seen in recent memory. Some of the best VFX I’ve ever seen.

I chuckled when Baron Harkonnen saw Feyd-Ruatha attack the Fremen stronghold with airships and said, “That’s brilliant.” Yes, because only a strategic genius could figure out that bombing the shit out of a settlement owned by an enemy that has almost no anti-air is a good idea.

I like how utterly useless Dave Bautista’s character was. He was too much of an angry meathead to be an effective leader, and he couldn’t even fight. His sole purpose was to get shit on.

The Harkonnen took the “bad guys will kill their underlings without a second thought”’trope to another level. Between the Baron, Feyd-Ruatha, and Rabba, at least half a dozen underlings were killed for no reason other than evil.

It’a funny how the whole story of Dune is about religious fanaticism, holy war, and psychedelic drug use, which are all controversial subjects. But people are cool with Dune because it’s sci-fi and weird.",2024-03-04
"That final fight scene was absolutely great.  It felt real in a way most movies don't do anymore, and each guy seemed vulnerable.  I hope other directors pay attention (especially anyone doing a Marvel movie).",2024-03-04
"Probably get downvoted, but the acting of the two main actors Timothee and Zendaya felt incredibly stale to me and honestly took me out of the movie a lot. Neither were convincing in their roles and it felt like the actual physical acting in scenes where they interact was just super bland. 

It genuinely felt like the absolutely most intimate scene between them was when she was teaching him to sand walk. 

The last scene where Paul tells Chani he'll always love her just felt so stale- you couldn't see anything in his face and nothing in hers either. 

Feyd-Rautha stole the show for me, and Mohiam was electric in every scene she was in.

Other than that, movie was amazing as hell. Must see in IMAX. Sound was absolutely immaculate and the set design was ridiculously good, as well as costume design.",2024-03-01
"Am I the only one who overall really enjoyed the movie and thought it was great but was constantly caught off guard with the jarring transitions between scenes?


One example is when Paul is traversing the sand and Chani meets up with him to show him the way. The next scene is them, along with many others, ambushing a rig. Until the camera focused in on Paul, I was thinking this was taking place elsewhere while he was still out there on the ""trial"".


That's just one example but it felt like several other parts of the film had this rushed feeling compared to the first which seemed to allow scenes and moments to ""breathe"".


Again, overall it was incredible and I already recommended it to friends but I don't think it was as good as part 1.",2024-03-01
"I will be completely honest: I like this less than the last movie

Everything about the presentation was FANTASTIC. Geidi Prime looks alien as fuck. Arrakis always looked intimidating and hellish for anyone not Fremen. The effects were excellent. The sound and music continues to impress as always and Hans Zimmer brings it back in spades. The acting is as good as ever and so much is conveyed with the camerawork and just the eyes and the way people look at each other and say so much while not talking at all. I love how tonally so much is conveyed so smoothly like Paul very obviously leading the Fremen to their doom with Chani desperately trying to bring her people to their senses

The problems are almost all pacing and a couple of the characters, namely Feyd-Rautha and the Emperor. The Emperor felt really toothless and barely fleshed out. Very brief explanations for why he even instigated this whole thing and it feels brushed off when they ""reveal"" that it was the Bene Gesserit (which was already known from the last movie). Walken barely has any time to make this Emperor an actually formidable foe and he turns into a meek, pliant dumbass which was very disappointing. Austin Butler as Fayd-Rautha was flawless and conveyed the psychotic nature of a Harkonnen heir perfectly. The problem is there's almost zero tension with his character and he barely even feels like a threat. The arena scene felt like it was meant to convey him as a shrewd but accomplished warrior but they should have done that with someone other than the grunts that were thrown at him. I know he's another Bene Gesserit puppet but once again, toothless and pliant. So when he duels Paul, it barely feels like a challenge (even if the duel scene was fucking fantastic)

The pacing was, honestly, terrible because this is very obviously the second part to a trilogy. The whole trilogy could be theoretically plotted out as an inverse bell curve of pacing with the last movie ending as the bell curve was halfway through the dip and this one ends halfway through the next climb. The problem is, unlike something like Lord of the Rings where we had a bunch of subplots and many characters who were doing their own thing with complete arcs in The Two Towers, we're primarily following Paul through this whole movie and the first 2/3rds felt a bit too stretched out with the final third desperately playing catch-up. This meant so much of it felt so disjointed by the end. Things like the Emperor coming to Arrakis are kinda rushed and feel very sudden. Paul's arc after he becomes Lisan Al-Gaib happens at lightning speed. He just takes over the entire Fremen army, takes over the Emperor's base, captures and subdues him, duels Feyd and then we're left at another cliffhanger for when he executes his war in the next part which is probably another 3-4 years away, all within maybe the last 30-40 minutes

All in all, this is absolutely not a bad movie and I'd score it something like 8/10 but the first movie was such a fantastic setup and to be delivered yet more setup was a huge let down. I wish I liked this one more but I guess I might appreciate it more on a rewatch before the third movie which seems all but guaranteed

Edit: watched in IMAX and holy fuck it was an experience. People should try getting IMAX tickets if possible",2024-03-01
"My respect for Chalemet is through the roof right now. He absolutely crushed this movie.

That scene where he's preaching to the crowd and looking straight in the camera.

Or the scene where he walks in to the Emperor with his mask on, and acts only with his eyes.

Just an incredible performance.",2024-03-02
"Just got home from the cinema. Man I’m speechless. The cinematic experience of a lifetime. For me it’s Denis and Nolan at the top and then everyone else. The cinematography in this one somehow surpassed the first one which was already immaculate.. I’ll have a letterboxd review later but for now, all I can say is Paul’s gradual descent into what we see at the end was so fun

The juxtaposition between Feyd Rautha and Paul throughout was great culminating in that amazing fight at the end. Really thought Paul might’ve been a goner there at the end.

Couldn’t help but burst out laughing when Paul basically told the emperor “I’ll take your throne and your daughter”. Straight up bitched bro right to his face. Probably had never been talked to anywhere close to that rudely.

The mom just straight up staring down the other bene gesserit and telling her she should’ve picked the winning side was great too. We just gonna ignore the fact that she thought Paul might lose that fight too 😂 

Felt awful for Chiani in the last hour though. Seeing Paul break his promises to her and do a complete 180 on all the equality stuff he was preaching at first had to be so heartbreaking for her. Felt every bit of her pain during that final shot as Paul and the others take off, preparing to fight the other houses.

I still haven’t read the books so there was so much cool lore dropped in this that came as a surprise to me. Hopefully by the time Messiah drops I’ll have read the series and can truly appreciate everything here. Looking forward to seeing Paul sister too!

Stilgar hyping up literally everything Paul did as a sign of him being the messiah was brilliant. Dude behind me in the cinema kept bursting out laughing the whole time lmao.",2024-03-02
"Is it just me or are there large swathes of this movie missing? I feel there were character development scenes for Austin Butler's character (or at least scenes of him simply being a villain) completely missing. Same thing with the Emperor. I feel as if I may have blacked out for parts of the movie perhaps? Like seriously, they were just kinda in and out without doing much on screen or having much weight in the story. ",2024-03-03
They created a universe that looks and feels truly alien and advanced beyond anything we could even imagine.  Then you have Christopher Walken being Christopher Walken right in the middle of it.,2024-03-06
"What am I missing? I understand the visual marvel that the film is but the narrative, the pacing, some of the acting and even the editing were all poorly executed at times. 

Nolan talking to Denis before the release of the film and calling the film his Empire Strikes Back, plus the claims of it being one of the best sequels and sci-fi films ever made perhaps made me expect too much. Maybe this is the problem with social media, recency bias, and Nolan stans transferring to Denis in the meantime until Nolan’s next film? Don’t get me wrong I love Nolan’s work and I am a fan of many of Denis’ films but this just doesn’t add up. 

It’s shocking to see the comparisons to lotr and The Dark Knight. Does recency bias have that much of a stranglehold on perception or is it simply that the effects outweigh the pacing and storytelling issues for modern audiences? 

We spend so much of the story on things we don’t need repeated over and over. Zendaya’s acting was such a weak spot. I thought butler was surprisingly very good in this role. Walken felt a bit comical and certainly broke the verisimilitude. Bardem was good and executed those comedic moments well, but beyond that, there is a strange disconnect between characters and their ability to connect with the audience. Portraying Timothée in a menacing manner is a tough feat to pull off and it really wasn’t done effectively, which just shows it’s a casting issue. 

It was difficult to find anything compelling or engaging until 2/3 of the way through the film. The ending is rushed to the point where I don’t see how there is any sort of payoff. The lack of emotional heft and connection really left me wondering what I missed from this film.",2024-03-02
"10/10 for me, not a book reader.. 

The visuals, the emotional weight of the things happening to Paul. The religious stuff is huge.. you can see how powerful and how dangerous religious fever can be. Paul understands this and yet is forced into a situation he has trouble confronting. It was a beautiful story and the soundtrack and art direction and cinematography were all amazing.",2024-03-03

They did it. They outdid the first one.  Incredible.,2024-03-01
"My only complaint is that I felt like the third act was bit too rushed. I know its already pretty long at two and a half hours, but maybe another 10-15 minutes to give the third act some more breathing room. More of Paul embracing the holy war, more of that big battle with the worms, more ~~cowbell~~ emperor and the Landsraad, more of the Gurney/Raban showdown.

But overall this movie rules. Can't wait for part 3.",2024-03-01
"Austin Butler was so good in this that I have some sort of weird, fucked up crush on Feyd Rautha.

Edit: also, haven't seen it mentioned. But the sound of that knife sliding through Paul's hand at the end is the absolute worst noise I have ever heard in my life.",2024-03-01

Concise, to the point and got things going in a quick fashion. I'd have loved to see the Harkonnens die a more brutal death, but I guess knives to the throat are as good a way to go as any.

A solid 9/10 for me. Denis nailed it with the visuals, and storytelling.",2024-03-01
The scene where Paul and Chani embrace and kiss for the first time on top of the sand dune was great. The score behind the scene was incredible too from Hans. I’ve had the song stuck in my head since the film. ,2024-03-01
"I'm not sure why they chose to go with a few dead people on the ground and ""famine"", evidently still on Arrakis, as Paul's prescience of the future tragedy? Why no green banner and billions dead? The future visions could have been a tad more impactful/frightening and AT SCALE, especially when you have the Geidi Prime scenes to contrast with",2024-03-01
You know for all the longer movies they are producing these days in Hollywood this one deserved the most to be over 3 hrs long. That sequence before the climax with Paul and his ascends into being the supreme leader and his relationship with Chani needed a bit more fleshed out. Otherwise a perfect 10/10 movie imo.,2024-03-02
"
I’m adjusting to the very interesting change with Chani and the implications it has for Messiah. It’s entirely possible Denis is closing the whole saga with the next movie and not even bothering with setting up Children of Dune. Unless the ending with her bailing is a fake out? 

Though I’m bummed out >!We lost “History will call us wives”. It’s a great line from Jessica!< 

That being said, GOOD FUCKING LORD INCREDIBLE MOVIE. Absolutely a visual feast. Incredible sound. Captivating as hell. Even funny with Bardem’s Stilgar being the ultimate zealot/hypeman. Seriously find a guy who hypes you up like Stilgar. *Paul breaths* “LISAN AL GAIB!”",2024-03-02
"Harkonnen minions have *got* to learn to stand a little further out of reach. 

Loved it, visually spectacular and wonderfully performed. I don't think there was a single actor who didn't rock their role, or a single scene that wasn't a feast for the senses. 

I do feel like the plot clipped along a little too quickly, I could go for an Extended Cut. I also wonder how viewers coming to it without any book knowledge are gonna feel about Paul forcing the princess Irulan to marry him, seeming to set Chani aside. Especially as the film plays up her hurt and alienation.",2024-03-02
"This film hit me In so many of my favorite film places, it's of the highest quality 


Huge oppressive score


Scale, mecha, I loved the spice harvester sections.


Beautiful intricate costumes, The princess's headpiece for example down to the harkonen trooper suits and Paul's fremen garb and cloak


Well shot fights, and incredible cinematography. 


Dialed up on the humor a slight bit from Part 1 really added to the film too


Everything was just so magnificent.  


Seeing brolin and bardem together on screen is 🔥",2024-03-02
"Just fucking incredible. Wow. Like, just, wow. I saw it last night on IMAX and I would 100% recommend anyone planning to see it to do the same.

I have read the book, so for this movie in particular, I was the most curious about how Villeneuve was going to present 1) the final battle with the Fremen riding sandworms to war 2) the duel between Paul and Feyd-Rautha. And I think he knocked both out of the park.

I think if anyone was bored by the first film, they would hopefully like this one better, but stylistically it is pretty similar and I don't know that that would win over a lot of new fans. This movie has a LOT of action, but I would still describe it as more of a slow burn and a movie you have to appreciate more for its cinematic qualities than for relentless action and plotting. A Marvel movie it is not. (and thank god for that lol)

I thought nearly everyone in this movie was fantastic, particularly Javier Bardem. He brought this levity to the role that the movie occasionally needed. I think the only role I didn't love was Christopher Walken as the Emperor, mostly because I have a hard time taking Christopher Walken seriously in anything, and seeing him play perhaps the most serious role in the movie didn't work super well, IMO. Everyone else really ruled, though. Props to Austin Butler for managing to convince me he's a psychopath and not just the most ridiculously handsome man on the planet. Too bad he had to play a Harkonnen since he and Timothee Chalamet could have had an epic hair competition of some kind.",2024-03-02
"I really respect the fact that they leaned fully into the religious aspect of the book. Jessica is much more of a cynical and terrifying manipulator, there's repeated references to 'fundamentalists' and 'paradise' and they somehow managed to make Stilgar's faith comic relief and horrifying at the same time.

I can understand why they avoided using the word 'jihad' (the original book goes as far as one of the distant Fremen ancestors referencing 'the Hajj').",2024-03-02

As an adaptation I am missing some pieces that are very relevant in the next books and that change at the end is going to get tricky for the next movie. All in all, it's an excellent movie and the reason movie theaters remain. The only niptick is that after hearing Denis Villenueve's thoughts on dialogue, it becomes very apparent he really doesn't work too much on that. Excellent movie though and the art and costume departments were on spice it seems. Absolutely breathtaking",2024-03-02

"mind fucking blown.  It requires seeing the first film more than Aliens or Terminator 2 do, but I think it eclipses them as a sequel.  I think from a visual storytelling perspective it beats Empire Strikes back, but not from a story arc perspective. ESB is still my favorite stand-alone sequel ever, but i'm biased. Dune 2 is soooooooo close, but Messiah will give Paul, Alia, Jessica, and Chani the true arcs and will sweep the oscars in 2026-7 guaranteed.  Return of the King style.

"I saw this for the third time last night, the second time in IMAX. Worth it.",2024-03-06

"Damn, i didn’t realize how much of a tragedy this movie would be. A lot of similarities to the later seasons of Attack on Titan. It feels like when both Jessica and Paul drink the blue goo, they stop being themselves ? Seeing the past (and future for Paul) affects them to not be themselves anymore. It might be good intentions on keeping themselves alive but when does the cost become too high?",2024-03-07
"Who else thought Dave Bautista was poorly used in this movie. They gave Jarvier Bardem a lot of screen time, and rightly so as he was amazing in the movie, but then they give Bautista barely anything to do.

They dont even give him a  good fight scene in the end, he dies in two seconds.",2024-03-08
"I saw it in IMAX a few days ago and wow, what a film. I wasn’t totally won over by Part One if I’m honest, but I guess they had to get a lot of the setup out of the way first.

But it was worth it to make Part Two what it is. The world-building, the plot, the visuals, the sound design and score, the cast - all absolutely excellent.

It felt like every other scene had something incredible going on. Even though it was so long, it rarely dragged because they packed so much in. The pacing and exposition were perfectly balanced, which isn’t easy considering the source material.

The standout performance for me was Austin Butler. I’ve only really seen him in Masters of the Air, where he’s a little one-note. But he really killed it in this movie.

If I had a criticism, it’s that I didn’t find the romance between Paul and Chani very compelling. 

I didn’t feel that Timothée Chalamet and Zendaya had much on-screen chemistry, and the scenes of just them together were the only ones where the movie *ever so slightly* dragged. But I’m reaching a bit here because it’s absolutely not meant to be a love story.

It’s a film that made me feel good about films. The Marvelisation of cinema has made me very cynical about it as a medium lately, but this shows that, when everything is done right, cinema has still got it.",2024-03-15
"Great movie. Lots of memorable moments. (Almost) everyone was in top form. Timothy C. is here to stay, he really is the lisan-al-gaib of this generation of actors. Zendaya was aggressively mid, especially her dialogue delivery was atrocious. May the MILF illuminati reign forever.",2024-03-22

Multiple people walked out and lots of booing during the final exchange with the emperor. And to top it all, Timothy has zero leadership energy.

Edit: Lol at the responses below of people butt hurt at my experience.",2024-03-01

At time the movie breezes by and the viewer is unaware how much time has passed because of the engrossing visuals, acting, sound, and action. I wanted to see more and at times it felt rushed. The last half hour picks up and doesn’t let up, which only made me even more excited to see what is next for Paul, yet felt like another cliffhanger.

"There just has to be a third part now, right? But also apparently this is how the book (first, second?) ends with the incoming holy war?",2024-03-01
"It took two days for me to fully process the film and I can say that I loved it. It pays off the patience of you watching the first one (which I loved too) and builds on characters and themes beautifully. I was kind of worried this would be some sort of revenge story, but Denis focusing on the Prophecy angle was perfect. I would've loved more scenes of tension between Paul and Lady Jessica but I think Chani's expanded role here works well too.

Just a few nitpicks from my side especially related to the book:
- I don't remember the Atomic Arsenal being a thing in the books. I didn't mind it until it was revealed that the Leto had it stored without the Fremen's knowing about it and right under their noses. This kinda takes away the fact that the Fremen's weren't well versed with the land and what's going on around them at all times when in fact, they didn't let anything slip under the radar and used the knowledge of Arrakis to their advantage.
- Underutilizing Skarsgard and Saardukar. I loved this version of The Baron, as opposed to the depraved and cartoonishly-evil villain one you find in the books. Would've loved to see more of him. And also how powerful the Saardukar actually were. They looked cool AF fuck though.
- And finally, this is a personal one that comes from both the movies. Removing Thufir Hawat from the plot. He's my favourite character from the book and the side plot that he goes on is immensely interesting to me. I love the theory that the reason why the Emperor starts to distrust the Baron's rule is that he starts fearing the Baron's forces are getting stronger than the Saardukar - this is basically Hawat's plan. Getting the Emperor's crosshairs pointed at the Baron. I knew this would've been tough to add in an already complex plot...but yeah, I still stand by this nitpick. Thufir Hawat is the GOAT!

Like I said, these are nitpicks and nothing against the film. I loved the movie and this one pretty much solidifies Denis' status as one of the All-Time greats if it wasn't already the case before.

He did what so many people failed to do. Adapted Dune so well.",2024-03-01

Florence Pugh must have had a contractual obligation to have something on her head at all times (and looking hot while doing it),2024-03-01
"Dune Part 2 is a phenomenal film. Please see this movie every chance you get while it's in theaters, and if you can, see the IMAX version. I don't know how anyone could view this film otherwise. 

With that being said, I'm a tad bit conflicted about this film. I read the book. The book is awesome. It's the (*cough*) foundation (*cough*) of modern science fiction. This film isn't the second half of the book. I went into this film expecting to see baby Leto, a Fremen ""get to together"", and one enlightened toddler. None of those things appeared and now I'm wondering whether or not Villenueve wrote this entire film on the premise of being unable to find a child actor skilled enough to play that aforementioned toddler. 

Let me be a bit clearer. Villenueve's approach to the second half of Dune is very similar to how Stanley Kubrick adapted The Shining. He kept many of the book's themes but elaborated on them in a fashion the general movie going audience would understand. The film criticizes religious fanaticism more overtly than the books. It wasn't a problem but I wanted the film to explore other themes at a similar level. 

The biggest change from the books besides the time frame is Alia Atreides (Anya Taylor-Joy). She is way more powerful in this film as a fetus than she has been portrayed in the books. It's also my belief that she possesses both Lady Jessica and Paul in this adaptation, and there are scenes and dialogue that strongly allude to this. The Reverend Mother refers to ""Paul"" as ""an abomination"", which he shouldn't be because he's one tablespoon of salt away from the genetic concoction the Bene Gesserit was cooking for a millennia. That phrase in the books is used to describe Alia because she's pre-born. 

If that is the direction Villenueve is taking the series, then I'm locked in. I want to see conflict between Alia and Chani, who was likely pregnant at the end of the film, in the sequel with Princess Irulan documenting their fights in spiteful delight. 

All in all, the film did not adapt the book to my liking. However, it told a magnificent story that covered the books themes.",2024-03-01

The combination of Paul & the Fremen army using the warheads & the sandworms to fuck up the Sardaukar army has to be the most gangsta way I've seen a hero flip the script & take revenge on his enemies. They were really taking no prisoners when Gurney killed Glossu real quick  & some of the Sardaukar forces in the throne room got quietly murked in the dust when Paul stormed in.

One thing I especially love about this film is that building up to the scene where Paul takes absolute command over the Fremen after drinking the Water of Life, he's obviously still out of his element when interacting with them & in their early ambushes against the Harkonnen, but then he flips a switch in his swagger after his major trial with the giant sandworm.",2024-03-01

"When Stilgar [went full Monty Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rW8fDw8VzKI) I about lost it. I don't know if they were intentionally evoking the Life of Brian or just a happy coincidence. But I was chuckling with Bardem's delivery. 

Pacing was a little too rushed. Which, I get it. They want to keep this massive story under 3 hours. So there's a ton being left on the cutting room floor, as well as standard book->movie compression of time/characters/etc. 

Beast Rabban's fight with Gurney. It was blink-and-you-miss-it. Like... let the dude get more than literally 1 swing in before getting shanked. Not asking for some Duel of the Fates shit, but c'mon it needed more than that.

I loved how they shot the scenes under the black sun. That was a genius move to film it with infrared. And the transitions of characters from indoors to outdoors was seamless how it went from proper color to monochromatic. 

The one aspect I wished there was more of was the whole of the Dune universe. The movie had no mentats, no spacing guild, no navigators, etc. Again I get it, it's part of DV's need to compress the book into one cohesive story that can translate to the silver screen. Still just a little bummed.

There's a lot more I could go on about, but most all has probably been said in this thread already. Overall I really enjoyed the movie. Saw it at the early screening in IMAX and the scene with the nukes blasting the rocks then the sandworms enveloping the emperor's men was breathtaking.

On another note, loved the religious symbolism here - a few of Chani’s lines (“You want control? Tell people there’s a messiah - they’ll wait for centuries” and “This prophecy is how they enslave us”) cut very deep.",2024-03-03

"Gotta say, pretty spicy overall. 

On a technical level, no doubt a monumental achievement from a true visionary. Villeneuve flexing hard here bringing together a story once thought untellable on the screen to life with such precision and imagination. Both a continuation of the first story and a set up for the third, it feels grand, epic, but has a dark sinisterness to it. To me this and the first part are mandatory viewings together and I actually think one can't stand alone without the other (unlike Star Wars or the Lord of The Rings). You just gotta be in awe of the sheer scale of it and the vision that Villeneuve brought to life—I saw this in 70mm Imax so that DEFINITELY helps. 

I've read the book (only once and it's been a couple years) but there are some significant changes and I'm mostly okay with them. Despite it being a movie about the future the changes made were to bring the whole thing into the modern era. They also to bring some more conflict to make the back half of the story more digestable for film I think. Zendaya and Florence Pugh's characters are more fleshed out, feel like real people and aren't just faceless woman in awe of Paul's greatness. There are layers to them! I think diehard fans of the book will hate some of the choices but for me it didn't bother me toooo much, though it was a little jarring. 

There's a murderer's row of a cast here just like the first one but it feels more apparent in this part. I want to give a couple shoutouts to some people who I think absolutely stole the show. Rebecca Ferguson is incredible and easily one of the best actresses working today. I could just look at her onscreen for days, she commands the camera and is just the best. Another actor who deserves a shout out is Austin Butler who plays an INCREDIBLE villain. I wasn't sure if this kid was worth the hype but this movie cements it, he can do everything. Menacing, terrifying, evil, he fucking rocked it. On the other side, with this and and Wonka— Chalamet is one of the biggest box office draws we have and I'm not sure he deserves it? He's fine here, but anytime he has to yell or act 'hard' I didn't quite buy it. H's one of the least interesting things about the movie for me. 

There's some choices I found a little perplexing and I think the beginning takes awhile to get into things but it's hard to really get bogged down in my problems with it when the movie takes such a huge swing and hits for the most part. It succeeds in telling the themes from the book of how power can corrupt all and really how we are all pawns to those who lead us. There are no deity's, only the blood hungry who want to rule us all. 

Some scenes in this will stick with me for a long time, what a beautiful looking film. I can't wait rewatch that coliseum sequence again.",2024-03-03

"I thought it was nearly fucking flawless and everything I wanted and more from a high budget sci-fi epic.

  
But if I am to nitpick (from a book reader's perspective), almost all of my small criticisms from the movie are decisions that I can understand from a directorial point of view.

I can't believe i'm saying this for a movie that runs 2hrs 46mins, but I thought the pacing was just a little bit too fast. Especially during the latter half of the movie, every single scene felt so dense with plot-relevant information (in the bigger scale of Paul's arc after the first book) that even the scenes without any action felt riveting. Again, this isn't a full-blown criticism of sorts, but when i'm on the edge of my seat foaming at the mouth for every single scene it's borderline exhausting and I was scared to even reach for my popcorn for fear of missing key details.



I think I can speak for most of us book fans when I say that I would not at all mind another hour of runtime; and as I understand it there was ample footage that was cut out of the movie so I guess it was originally that length. But with regards to box office numbers and what the average normie's attention span for a movie is, I kind of get why it had to be trimmed down to a ""short"" 2hr46min runtime. I mean look at Killers of the Flower Moon: the movie flopped financially even though most critics and movie buffs liked it. I have reason to believe part of that was due to its runtime. We're not getting Dune Messiah without Part 2 becoming an overwhelming box office hit (because like it or not this is the only metric that matters to the big studios), so imo Denis had more than enough justification to cut out what he did, even though we all wanted more.

I also wished it had an R rating to become 'weirder' to include the spicy (pun intended) scenes in the book but i'm okay without it for the same reasons I listed above.",2024-03-04

"Just incredible. I usually struggle with CGI/VFX-heavy films, but this was one of the most beautiful and seamless ones I've seen. They did a fantastic job of subverting the hero's journey by foreshadowing Paul's thirst for power and his likely fall. The sound production was incredible; even the thumps of the worm felt amazing. It helped that I saw it in IMAX, where everything was amplified.

It's a pretty complex plot with many characters, and the way Villeneuve weaved it all together while maintaining pacing was impressive. Javier Bardem was hilarious. I love the Bene Gesserit and the general space-age feudalism. I didn't realize before, but it's because of the Butlerian Jihad that they refuse to use computers resembling humans, so it's all biological.

Also, the comparisons to oil/opiates was pretty clear. With the mujahideen angle, and it was a little weird rooting for Fremen coming from the perspective of the American Harkonnens.",2024-03-09

"I haven't read the books, so plsss don't answer with spoilers -

But I'm finding it hard to work out why the Bene Gesserit are so surprised by what has unfurled, with Paul turning fanatical and Jessica kinda becoming the embodiment of fear.

I've gathered that they're the ones who created the 'prophecy' (bene gesserit) and instilled it into the minds of the Fremen over many many years. And I know that they weren't certain whether Paul would be the Lisan Al Gaib.

But the prophecy has become true, as they planned and originally orchestrated. Obviously Paul has ""walked into the fire"", which they warned against. but it's not like they didn't see it coming.

Did things happen that weren't supposed to go to plan? Like Jessica becoming the Reverand Mother of the Fremen? Was the old lady who gives Jessica the water of life also a Bene Gesserit, or is she moreso a true fremen Reverand Mother?

I'm thinking mainly what didn't go to plan, is that Jessica was pregnant when she drank the water of life, and also Paul is a male, when he was supposed to ideally be a female.

As I write this I think it's less so that the Bene Gesserit are surprised, but moreso they know things have gotten out of hand and now they're trying to bring back order but they didn't realise how powerful Paul and Jessica would be",2024-03-17

2. Can I assume the water of life connects all minds of people who drinks it? Even future drinkers? Otherwise how could Paul sees his sister in future form? And also he says that he saw a plan to future. I am guessing this is kinda like Attack On Titan (iykyk)?",2024-03-17

"Didn't feel this movie as much as the people in this thread. It is a far cry from LOTR that's for sure. LOTR had a lot of heart. I would even put GOT ahead of this since the characters were more intriguing and the politics was more complex and engaging. Dune is just too weird and part 2 gets even more so.

Still, the weirdness felt unique and Dune 2 did feel like a breath of fresh air. However, the cold tone (very common in Villenueve's movies) and quick pacing prevent Dune 2 from being an all time film imho. The film puts us at a distance from the 2 main characters of the previou film: Paul and his mother. Instead Chani becomes the emotional core of the movie. Moreover, the water of life thing wasn't well explained. Paul just becomes OP within minutes and he is able to steamroll the Emperor as well as the Harkonnens within seconds. No resistance whatsoever. Became all too simple.

I must say visually this movie was a treat for sure. Definitely worth it to see in theatres but I don't think this is a cinema classic. I still think BR 2049 is Denis's best sci-fi film. And from what I have read, Dune 3, whenever it comes out, will be even weirder.

"Masterpiece. Dune 1 was the appetizer for Part 2's main course, and goddamn what a meal.

The first half especially is so beautifully edited. The whole development of Paul and Chani up against their however-many-weeks-long campaign against the Spice Harvesters was \*perfectly\* paced, and the performances so good. Denis' economy of storytelling with the visuals he chooses and arranges is on another level.

It's almost impossible to single out a best performance because everyone is so good. Every character is perfectly utilized in this story, no one feels like they get shorted for time or purpose in the story. Timmy carried the whole movie and his gradual turn to darkness was well-realized. Now that Zendaya has a real opportunity to play Chani, she crushed it, and the writing was so good with the whole internal politicking of the Fremen, I loved that whole aspect and how it played into her relationship with Paul and just the whole thematic tapestry. Javier Bardem also got more to do, he's great, often hilarious, but perfectly sells that blind religious zealotry. Rebecca Ferguson as Jessica after the Water of Life >>>>. Austin Butler's Feyd-Rautha was awesome; let's all agree to just let him keep doing whatever he wants with his voice, he's clearly good at it.

Also! While I'm not a Frank Herbert purist and don't have that perspective, I feel like every diversion the film made from the original book was the right choice to make it work for the movie, especially how >!Alia was handled!<.",2024-03-02

"This movie is a masterpiece. It’s like Empire Strikes Back. Very dark ending. The cinematography was beautiful. I am so so glad I watched this in IMAX; I had seen Dune on Netflix and regretted not seeing it in theaters the first time. 

I am just speechless. This may be one of the best movie going experiences of my life.",2024-03-02
"I don't think there's ever been a director in history that has had such mastery in combining practical effects with CGI. The scale and enormity of this movie was jaw-dropping. This also had some of the best art direction in almost any movie I've seen, the level of color, detail, and imagination in the costumes, the architecture, everything, it made me speechless. This movie is going to steamroll next year's award season. 

Nothing short of a masterpiece, 10/10.",2024-03-03
"Wow. What an incredible film, definitely one of the best blockbusters of all time. To me, this is on par with the OT and the Lotr trilogy. We are witnessing cinematic excellence. 

I do have a couple complaints I want to discuss first. Although I loved Feyd-Rautha, I wish they differentiated him a bit more from Rabban and didn’t have him also participate in the “so ruthless he kills his own henchman” trope. Also, his accent was kind of distracting and sometimes I couldn’t help but laugh when he spoke, which detracted from his intimidation a little. 

Additionally, I really wished the ending stressed a bit more that Paul’s actions have doomed the lives of trillions, and that although it was not his desired outcome, he still sees it as the optimal path. It seemed like the final part of his journey was missing. I expect the next film will grapple with the repercussions of his actions a lot more, but I wish this one at least touched on it a bit more. I would have taken inspiration from the incredible ending to Oppenheimer, where Oppy and the audience are struck with dread regarding what’s to come and we see flash forwards of the upcoming chaos.

However, besides criticisms like these, I loved the film. It pretty much nails everything I expect from filmmaking. Writing, acting, dialogue, character journeys, action, spectacle, it does it all excellently. This film almost perfectly portrays Paul’s descent into darkness, and I thought it did a great job conveying the important themes of the novel (the dangers of following a chosen one, how easily the masses can be swayed, the nature of fundamentalism, etc). I really liked most of the changes to the book and thought they improved the story in the film medium. 

Overall, absolutely incredible film.",2024-03-03
"The guy two seats over from me burst into tears at least twice. When Paul was given the name Usul, and during Timmy’s absolutely spectacular speech where he was declared Lisan al-Gaib. I had chills multiple times. 

Timothee was the right choice for this role (no shit). Whatever flickers of greatness he showed in The King are fully fledged raging wildfires here; I was absolutely blown away, esp in the second half.  Him and Zendaya are speaking the *hell* out of that fake language. 

I am hooked and very much still riding the high. Expect this to be all I talk about for the next few days.",2024-03-05
"Wow. What a terrible time. I'm glad people liked it and got enjoyment but I forsure will not be watching the 3rd one.

I wasn't a fan of the first but some of my friends loved it and said I would love #2 and said we had to go. Honestly, it may have been worse. It felt so long and was so boring. I must've checked the time 5 times throughout it. I dgaf about cinematography so maybe that has something to do with it.

To Each Their Own. If you liked the first one. You'll probably like the second. And if you didn't, you probably won't like the second.",2024-03-01
I fell asleep watching this snoozefest. The film lacked substance and the story was weak. Dune 1 is much better than 2.,2024-03-01
"Its good, but not great? A stunning film to look at but a couple of big moments didn't do much for me. Like the one where Paul climbs up the hill and gets his followers riled up or the worms stomping the battle. These are great shots, entrances even, but they do not have a proper lead up nor they lead to an equally great finish. Denis' greatest strengths are in the much calmer moments and that's where some supporting characters shined like Zendaya's Chani and Bardem's Stilgar. They give the film's much needed emotional quotient which the first film was short of. The last 30 min was solid, where everything worked up well, although a bit quickly.",2024-03-01

"Whew. Saw this last night and have (almost) nothing but good things to say about it

Denis Villenueve knocked it out of the park again. As a longtime fan of the series, this was an AMAZING tribute to the source material

Highlights:

The set designs and costumes were *incredible*. If I had to describe the aesthetic it would be a mix of minimalist and alien. These are human beings, but as imagined 8,000 years in our future, where we've both progressed and devolved from where we currently are. That tension was captured very well 

We saw the emperor, dukes, etc., presumably some of the most wealthy people alive. But we never saw what any of us would interpret as trappings of wealth. No jewels, precious metal, etc. Once again, everything was minimalist. Spice was the true wealth in the story, which further highlights the struggle for control of Dune in this movie

I like that Chani's character had more autonomy and self-determination in this adaptation. Definitely suited an actor as strong on the screen as Zendaya

Also lime how Paul's struggle was very well depicted. He was a reluctant messiah every step of the way, until he felt he had no choice but to step on that path

I do wish Alia's story would've been adapted more faithfully. I think it was an interesting approach, having a character born who was not only fully aware of the world, but ALL their ancestors triumphs, sins, etc. And the weight it all brings. It looks like Alia will be a character in the planned third film though (hoping it's greenlit) so I'm thinking it'll be given the attention it deserves

Knockout performances from everyone in the cast. The only somewhat weak ones were from Walken and Pugh, from what I felt at least. But, Ireland has more of a story part three anyway, and Shaddam was always more of a supporting character. Still have love for both of their performances",2024-03-01
"Denis perfectly understands how to portray being under the influence of The Voice. The scene of Count Fenrig stringing Feyd along down the hallway was just fantastic in its editing. 

""Wait, I don't recognize this place..."" (sic) I had the biggest smile on my face once I knew what was going on.",2024-03-02
The gladiator scene was the coolest thing I’ve ever seen,2024-03-02
"Two questions:

1. Where the hell did Chani get that ornithopter from?!?!

2. What are the logistics of get large amounts of people on and off a worm?",2024-03-02
"I can’t wait to be able to watch Part 1 and Part 2 back to back! So many unforgettable and visually stunning moments. Finally getting to see a fully realized Giedi Prime in all of its glory was amazing. Brilliantly designed down to the last detail (even the Harkonnen fireworks were black!)

I loved that Villeneuve leaned in hard to the references to the drawings that H.R. Giger did for the Jodorowsky story boards, especially with the Harkonnen/Giedi Prime designs in Part 2. Those creepy dudes circling/protecting Feyd in the Harkonnen colosseum looked like they were the inbred cousins of xenomorphs. You could drop them straight into any of the movies in the Alien franchise, and they’d be right at home. The profile  shots of the Baron in his floaty fat man throne reminded me of Giger’s sketches for the Harkonnen castle. Whether or not we should interpret that as a love letter or a middle finger/mic drop from Villeneuve to Jodorowsky is a fun little question to ponder.

I just wish he’d been able to work in a sly homage to the Guild Navigator vaginas in the Lynch version. I’m always going to have a soft spot in my heart for that magnificent trainwreck of a movie. It was so confusing that when it opened in theatres, they handled out glossary cheat sheets so that people who hadn’t read the books could keep up.",2024-03-02

Rebecca Ferguson is so so so good in this,2024-03-03
"Went in with unrealistic expectations after seeing all the reviews and it still managed to meet them and maybe even surpass (at least the cinematography did). So much was going on, you definitely have to be locked in all the way through. It's a big change up from the first movie. Only thing I surprisingly think should've been different is Christopher Walken. I love him and am shocked I'm even saying this, but he just seemed like the odd man out in every scene. The only one that just didn't look, move, and sound like he should be in this universe. Could've just been me tho but I think another person should've taken on the role",2024-03-03
Best sand I've ever seen.,2024-03-03
My only criticism so far for both movies is that they don’t do a good job showing how much time has passed. How long between them leaving their home world and then being obliterated on Arakis? How long were they in the desert before running into Gurney? The scenes jump from one to another but I don’t really feel the passing of time. It would add a bit more weight to the epic story if we could feel the passage of time more.,2024-03-05

"Christopher Walken’s Emperor apologist here -

 Disclaimer: I have not read the Dune books. On the other hand, I am gearing up for the release of D&D’s Netflix adaptation of The 3 Body Problem, which has already revealed several broad-stroke changes to the source material. It is with this mindset that I accept the fact that not everything has to be exactly like the books for the adaptation to be perfectly fine, or even great.

Now for my opinion:
Walken’s emperor is neurotic and paranoid. Between Duke Leto and him, it’s like a “you vs. the guy she told you not to worry about” meme. It’s plain to see how the bene gesserit could so easily twist him into plotting against house atreides, despite the significant risk it would pose if the other great houses were to learn of the betrayal. Even with the plan kept secret, the harkonnens correctly infer that the emperor is vulnerable, laying the path for Feyd Rautha to seize the throne.

Against the context of Dune 1, an old and frail emperor is totally consistent. Watch part 1 again and you might notice that we never see the sarduakar in a fair fight. We get them and the harkonnens tag teaming a half-awake house atreides, and then a squad of maybe a dozen sarduakar vs Duncan Idaho. Duncan, the guy who admires the desert power of the fremen, absolutely shreds the first 9 of them before a draw with the 10th. This helps me believe that a sneaky fremen attack could easily wipe both the entire sarduakar and harkonnen armies.

By the third act of Dune 2, the bene gesserit confirm that the emperor is done no matter what. For me, this wouldn’t work as well if the emperor was any less pathetic. Instead, I’d be thinking, “what’s stopping the emperor and his sarduakar from having a narrow path forward?”

In sum, I liked the movie. It’s very exciting to see a sci fi adaptation carried out to this degree of quality. I’ll be happy if the Netflix 3bp show is half as good as this.",2024-03-05

"Really didn't care for Walken's casting as Shaddam. He comes across as extremely feeble and frail, which isn't really the demeanor of the emperor of the universe.",2024-03-10
"Maybe it’s because I’m getting old, but I felt like I was watching 2 kids play dress up the whole time with Zendaya and Chalamet. Didn’t buy them in their roles. Could be because they’re so petite.",2024-03-02
The movie is average at best. Paul’s acceptance into the dessert tribe feels disconnected. He suddenly went from a complete outsider to riding sand worm. A few montages of him training to get accepted was definitely needed to make his acceptance more coherent.,2024-03-01
It's even more boring than the first,2024-03-01
"The characters in this movie are just so boring. It seems like their only purpose is to move the plot along. Also I don't know if it was Timothee Chalamet's acting but I was not convinced he was a leader at all or even fit in with the Fremen.

On a side note did the uprising seem underwhelming to anyone else? The Harkonnen never had the upperhand and were just getting their shit rocked. No losses from the Fremen and the counter attacks were dumb imo. I don't know if they were trying to make a point out of paul leading/motivating people but it seemed to me the Fremen could've rebelled much earlier.

The movie did look good and the score was fantastic!",2024-03-01
"I have to say this film suffers from poor editing and pacing. There are times when the movie drags (first 45 mins), times when it feels disjointed and towards the end just plain rushed. 

The entire sequence of them riding South on the worms till when Chani discovers Paul drank the worm juice is just bizzare. 

So we see Paul riding the worm. The next scene he is suddenly inside the chamber, looking at the baby worm. He's then given the juice which he drinks. We then see the juice lady inform Lady Jessica what Paul has done and they are shown walking into the cave. In the next scene we see Chani arrive via an ornithopter (??) and Jessica is waiting for her outside the cave (??). 

At this point I was legit going wtf is going on here? The whole sequence is just extremely disjointed. 

And I know everyone says the book's finale is also rushed but not having a single shot from Paul's POV after the events of the climax felt very weird. Chani was not the right character for the film to end on in my opinion. 

The final battle too is literally just 2 mins of action, apart from the fight between Paul and Feyd in which once again we aren't really shown how exactly did Paul land the killing blow (not a biggie, but still). 

I loved Part 1 but Part 2 had tons of issues. I wanted to love it but I just couldn't.",2024-03-04
"The one thing I was really focusing on while watching this masterpiece of a film was Denis's use of the lack of sound and fuck me it was incredible. Absolute silence except for the Harkonenn troops' bodies hitting the ground, being able to ear the footsteps on the sand, music only to enhance specific moments, I could hear every single line of dialogue. Christopher Nolan could learn a thing or two from this man.  


Even in non-imax it was an incredible experience.",2024-03-01
"So I watched this film with my parents, and we had kind of different reactions to the end. I thought it was interesting.

To them, they mostly felt like Paul did what he had to do and it was a triumphant ending for them. 

For me, I felt deflated and depressed at the end. I felt like ok he won, but he's not the person he used to be and this isn't where he wanted to end up. He's kinda ended up in this position where it feels like the aim isn't to have prosperity for the Fremen anymore. Now it's just the Fremen blindly following him in this game of powers. He's kinda leaning towards a dictator type character. And I felt like Chani had felt the same way, betrayed by him not just because of him leaving her but because of him changing and becoming something worse, and the Fremen being taken advantage of. As she had said at some point in the movie, she didn't want the Fremen to become slaves.

But I guess someone could argue that practically the results are good. The Fremen are free now and nothing bad has really happened.",2024-03-03
Christopher Walken is wildly miscast in this movie.,2024-03-01
Probably a hot take....but Zendaya stood out as just being Zendaya whereas everyone else felt like a character. If she wasn't with Timmy on screen....just awful,2024-03-01
"Part One absolutely is better. Part Two felt, aside from a few scenes, like it was by a different director. It was fun, but felt closer to a regular young adult dystopian film than the masterpiece I've had on in the background the past couple years (Part One). Some thoughts I'd like to expand on later:


• Stilgar, Rabban, the Baron, Gurney, and Feyd-Rautha all felt off. Feyd not as much, but introduced too late and underdeveloped.

• Harkonnen's in general were way dumbed down. Rabban and Feyd are like toddlers and the Baron a fraction of how menacing and interesting he was in P1. 

• Zendaya, Chalamet, and Pugh were all inconsistent in terms of acting/delivery at moments. Zendaya just being a huge miscast in my opinion. 

• Part 2 felt oddly edited and really suffers from the same as Dune (~1984). Incredibly rushed, particularly the last hour. 

• Quicker, jarring cuts and much less nuanced dialogue

Rewatching for sure. Probably a 7.5/10 for me right now. I really find it hard to imagine a casual viewer rating this higher than a 6/10 or so.",2024-03-02
Boring and slow.,2024-03-01
"Can anyone explain some issues that i had with this film ?   
1: all the talk about needing to cross some desert and beware of centipedes and  ""Dont listen to the  jinns"" - nothing happened with that   
2: introducing Feyd-Rautha too late just to be killed  
3: Feyd-Rautha just killing officilas left and right for nothing - dont these people have value ? he is psycho but not a moron  
4: we were never given a clue that that girl is a spy - came out of the blue. in my opinion  
5:why talk about the pool of holy water if it has absolute 0 use in the story ?   
6 : the Sardakaur  being bitch slapped by just anyone including chani   
7: the smugglers being killed off and gurney just shrugs off the death of his crew like nothing .  
8- how EXACTLY they sent the scroll off world ? used a Post office ?   
9- absolutely no mention of the *Spacing* Guild   
10 : no mention of the  mentat Thufir   
11: when they tell us that there a millions of fanatics ready to fight - it kind of deminishes the level of threat of the enemy . they were not millions of arakis , right   
12 : not a SINGLE drone in the air to see the hundreds (if not thousands) of warriors just outside the city ? 

  
just some of my gripes . feel free to share your thoughts",2024-03-03
"Just watched the premiere two hours ago.

Thoughts:

* Production-wise, it's exceptional.
* Visually stunning with incredible performances from everyone in the cast.
* Memorable and well-choreographed battles.
* Simultaneously provides closure and sets up a sequel in a smart way.
* The scenes on Geidi Prime are visually among the best I've seen in any film in a long time.
* The sequence where Paul takes control and declares himself Lisan al Gaib had me say ""Hooooly fuck.""
* However, I admit I found the movie a tad bit underwhelming compared to Part One, which I am a massive fan of. It lacks the ""X factor"" that the first film masterfully accomplished through a combination of tone, atmosphere, editing, careful use of music, and sense of mystery.
* In comparison, Part 2 feels like a blockbuster-ized version of the first film; a generalized ""Hollywood"" version designed for those who found Part One to be ""boring"" (when it was everything but). Or perhaps, like it was made by different people with different ideas of how the world of Dune should be portrayed. I know that this was unavoidable simply because of the way the story unfolds, but it was nonetheless my impression.
* If you watch Part 1 and Part 2 back-to-back, I suspect this tonal inconsistency will be jarring, not to mention the inconsistency in some characterization, for instance Stilgar.
* The film is bombastic and does its best to impress you, which it does, but ultimately I felt a lack of substance, emotional investment, and (in the first half) some pacing issues - none of the problems Part 1 suffered from.
* The portrayal of Part 2's themes -- such as prophecy, and dangers of faith -- felt a bit on the nose and ham-fisted. Like the film didn't expect its audience to be smart enough to handle some subtlety and connect the dots themselves -- rather, everything had to be explained in a blunt and direct way. On multiple occassions, the characters recap or explain what is happening as if the audience can't figure it out.
* I can also imagine Hans Zimmer will be perplexed when he watches the final cut, because there seems to be a bizzare lack of music in the film? So many scenes, and even battles, play out with total absence of music or with minimal amounts. As a result, some scenes felt like they didn't deliver the impact Dennis intended them to.
* The film definitely picks up once Austin Butler's character is introduced, although Feyd himself is a rather one-dimensional villain without much depth or complexity.
* The main conflict is also partially resolved via a plot device (spoilers: hidden atomic weapons) that's randomly introduced halfway through the movie, and wasn't hinted or established neither in this nor in the previous film - unless I missed something?
* Overall, it's still a solid film, particularly from a technical standpoint... but I prefer Part One.",2024-03-01
Anyone else really appreciate this movie but left the theater feeling it was kinda meh?,2024-03-01
"I think the screenwriters deserve an Oscar for just for wringing a third dimension out of the book version of Chani. Zendaya absolutely nailed it. It's been years since I read the book but I never felt like the book took the dangers of Paul being a tyrant too seriously (I know it gets fleshed out more in the sequels, but Dune seemed to only pay the idea lip service). Really emphasizing Chani and Jessica as being on opposite sides was brilliant.",2024-03-02
"Did anyone else feel like Paul’s transition from “I’m not going south, I’m not the One” to “I’m here and ready to drink the water of life” was a bit fast? Seemed like his mind just changed in an instant and that was that, unless I missed something",2024-03-03
"Look phenomenal movie best movie of 2024 easily so far however I have one complaint and I might get hate/ downvotes for it.

Did anyone think Zendaya was miscast as Chani? I don’t know it wasn’t as obvious in the first movie because she was barely given anything to do and yeah I get that she’s supposed to be the one voice of reason but here I felt like she was outacted by almost everyone and seemed out of her depth? I don’t know am I the only one who felt this way?",2024-03-01
"The first was a shallow spectacle.

This second is a marginally less shallow spectacle. Once more boasting quite impressive production values, and once more suffering dramatically from its perfunctory storytelling (and juvenile scoring approach).

Watchable, sure, but neither intellectually nor emotionally stimulating.

In the end, not enough meat on the bone to bite into for those who aren't moved spiritually by mere flesh and sinew.

**7/10**",2024-03-01
"Jaw dropping film. Absolutely staggering visuals and incredible sound. The kind of movie designed for the biggest screen and loudest theater you can find. Loved it.

But the movie, for me at least, is missing the emotional gravitas of a masterpiece (like Arrival, for example). The moment when Paul chooses Florence in front Zendaya should hit like a sledgehammer to the heart, but instead, it sorta feels like reading a line from the wikipedia plot summary. I thought all the performances were great, so I don't blame the actors at all. My guess is that they had to have cut some footage of Paul and Zendaya in the desert near the beginning that could have forged their relationship more persuasively and strongly, because even though they had chemistry, I don't know if I ever felt their love. And without that feeling, I didn't feel the heartbreak at the end. 

Still, this is incredible blockbuster filmmaking. Just trying to figure out why I felt like something was missing.",2024-03-02
This movie is a true masterpiece. It is a testament to the beauty of cinema and its power to immerse the viewer within itself and take them on a journey that is phenomenal. Javier Bardem was brilliant in this and Hans Zimmer was having a field day with his score. It was absolutely orgasmic listening to what he had created for this movie. Instant classic.,2024-03-01
"The film was allright, it had its moment, I sat tense in my chair and thoroughly enjoyed the movie. But there were times that I cought myself thinking: The pacing is off here, this wasnt good, etc.

I like a movie best when I dont notice myself noticing things in the movie. So I cant say its a masterpiece. It feels like they tried to put too much book into too short amount of time, leading many important parts of the books to be cut.

It felt a bit rushed, this movie. A good one, but the pacing is fast, a bit too fast. Ever so impressing visual and auditory effects cant change importance of the underlying dramatic curve that binds it all together.",2024-03-01

"So... First of all, banger, I 100% loved 80% of it and at least 80% loved the last 20%. I think the changes to Chani were a fantastic decision -- the story doesn't work without a window into Paul's conscience, and Chani gave us that while Paul did his Messiah bullshit. Tasteful, well conceived, well executed, I grok that and I'm here for it. 

I don't know if I can say the same for Jessica. Like.... I've read everything, I know, I get what she's supposed to be doing, but I felt **super** in touch with her character in part one, and in this one honestly Feyd Rautha is more sympathetic. And he *feeds people to people*, on screen. I don't understand her character in this half, with relation to her character in the previous half. Can't reconcile the Jessica who was sobbing in a tent with Paul, to the Jessica who's like ""woot, jihad bitches, it's on!""

"Loved it


Feyd  was great


Walken was great 

Everyone was great

Best Sci Fri adaptation ever",2024-03-06
"  This movie was amazing, holy fuck. Everyone, and I mean everyone, absolutely killed it in their performances. The sound quality was also amazing, when Paul is reading people's minds and calling out their secret thoughts, and at one point he says the fremen name for Arrakis - that ""Dune"" made a chill run up my spine. 10/10 adaptation and movie. I hope a lot of people watch this and we get a movie for Dune Messiah. Bring on Anya Taylor-Joy as Muad'dib's sister!",2024-03-06
"""People are too media illiterate to understand Paul is the villain"" doesn't make any sense to me, and I think it's only held by people who've read the books and can't see what they're actually being told by the film alone. 

>!There's nothing in the film to remotely demonstrate he's anything other than a hero. Here's a guy who does everything right fighting with an oppressed group with honour against the most blatant villains ever put to film. He can see the future, he can speak brand new languages just because, and he comes back to life in a ritual no man has ever survived. He rejects certain actions because he has a premonition that they'll end badly, but then has a new premonition that we don't see and acts on it. He kills the bad guys. Literally nothing here suggests villain.!<",2024-03-21
"I haven’t seen a comment that talks about this, but did everyone already know that the Baron was Jessica’s father? I didn’t read the books, so I was shook LOL very cool hearing Paul calling him grandfather just before killing him",2024-03-21
"This movie somehow felt too long, and also super rushed.",2024-03-23
"I like how they got more into what a psychopath Feyd is here.  Rabban also got more to do as well.

The film looks and sounds GORGEOUS!!

I’m, conflicted on the Jessica stuff.

I actually really like what they did with Chani here.  I did not mind her in the book by any means.  But here she is just a more engaging character with more to do imo.  And it makes be intrigued to see her in Messiah now.  Also Zendaya was really good here.

The ending definitely sets things up for Messiah as well.

Timothee acts his ass off in this film.  Paul is so damn intimidating in the latter part of this film.",2024-03-01
"9/10.

Good:
- costumes, especially Harkonnen
- Giedi Prime
- Fremen stuff
- overall book accuracy with smart changes

Less good:
- Stilgar could have been less funny
- Walken as the emperor fell very short",2024-03-01
I enjoyed it more than the first. Actually felt like a full movie. Why was Zendaya's character do pissed anyway? She's the one that talked him into going south,2024-03-01
"Good enough but Part 1 was much much better. This movie had great moments (riding the sandworm, knife fight) but the pacing and editing were quite poor. 

Anytime a scene would begin to get interesting it would just jump. Paul is told to trek across the desert and they just kind of ignore it. He is told he isn't Fremen so he will never be allowed to ride a worm (hard cut to him preparing to ride a worm) ... Just felt super rushed at times while dragging at others.",2024-03-01
Paul Atreides “I’m him” the movie,2024-03-01
"Last line of Part 1: “This is only the beginning…”

Last line of Part 2: “The holy war has begun…”

Denis, I love you man — you’re one of the best directors alive — but you gotta come up with better closing lines for these movies.

Anyone got a prediction for the final line of Messiah?",2024-03-01
"Mission Impossible 7 last year, Dune 2 this year, I’m liking this new annual tradition of having one blockbuster movie with 4-5 of the hottest women imaginable.",2024-03-01
I think this is a modern classic. I don’t think it’s reactionary. On an artistic and technical level it was so profound.,2024-03-02
"That was insanely bad ass. Incredible film , left the theatre shaking . Everything about it was perfect. I just knew I watched something historical as soon as it ended",2024-03-02
"Really loved it and the little diversions from the book. Chani having real agency was a nice turn and I was gutted for her at the end - though a little frustrated this ended on a cliff hanger with her supposedly riding off.

The time jump was handled very well and I was on hooks waiting to see how this was handled - especially after our glimpse of you know who earlier.

Loved Jessicas behind the scenes play and talking to her counterpart. Nice little sickness there.

Absolutely loved that small little horror aspect of ""what have we done"" when they realise she is pregnant - and we also see in real time what's happening (but lay viewers maybe not quite understanding) what's happening to her baby. Uncomfortable watching.

The Black sun of Geidi Prime was a delight. Can't describe why. When we've got sci fi films aplenty Denis has to try so hard to bring something new to the table.

I'm fully on board. I'll return to book three this year and see how I feel about the rest them, but certainly feels like a great compliment to the books as I do find them a difficult read.

"Part One was like reading an instruction manual filled with some very good lore/ artwork,   
finished by an innovative tutorial mission.

Part Two was the full game experience.

Can't wait for someone to do a showing of them together with a 10 minute Hans Zimmer intermission.",2024-03-03
"I agree with most here that the film was overall very good. The visuals, cinematography, score, acting (mostly), themes and story were really well executed. The one weak link for me was Zendaya. She just isn’t that great an actress, and she and Chalamet had zero chemistry. It wouldn’t have been a big deal normally, but for whatever reason Villeneuve put a lot of focus on Chani, which drew attention this weakness. 

I was also a little baffled by how rushed the ending was. Like, this is nearly a 3 hour movie where they were willing to take 20 minutes just to set up the Baron’s nephew, but they totally glossed over the beginning of a galactic Jihad. Also, why end on a scene of Chani (once again) giving her stank face? There’s galaxy spanning decisions going on at the palace with a messianic figure, but we are instead focused on the messiah’s jilted ex-lover. Weird. 

Other than that though, I thought it was a pretty incredible film, and about as good an adaptation of the novel as we could hope for.",2024-03-20
The most disturbing thing in this movie is Feyd-Rautha kissing the Baron on his lips twice.,2024-03-24
"Just walked out of a showing, it was so boring , it looked great, music was good, very well directed and acted, but so so boring. Nothing had any weight to it , I just didn't care about any of the characters it just sucked",2024-03-06
Great film but anyone else think it felt like about 4 hours long? First act dragged quite a bit. Still reckon Part 1 is the better film if I’m honest.,2024-03-01
"I dunno I really liked the movie stylistically for the most part but it was soooooo slowwwww. 

We spent all of movie one world building and then this movie we spent way too long with sequences of Paul and Chani staring at each other, the first half of the movie was super boring and dragged because of this for way too long. People in the theatre even seemed to be actively bored during this part, lots of ppl checking out and looking at their phones until we finally moved on from the ‘Paul is a Fremen now officially yay’ part of the movie.

Also felt like the director literally ripped off Aliens and Prometheus with how he did the Harkonnen’s. Their entire look as well as the aesthetic of their homeworld looked directly ripped off from Ridley Scott and the white dudes in Prometheus and Covenant. Wasn’t a fan of that at all personally. 

Also Feyd was just mehhhh and fell pretty flat for me in the ‘villain’ category. He didn’t seem very menacing in the least and I think part of it was due to the aesthetic choices of how they made him look. 

Solid B movie for me, but not deserving the 10/10 that lots of people are giving it. And I’m saying this as a massive book and Dune fan. 

The Zimmer sound score was at least spectacular though",2024-03-03
"Just saw the movie, I really don't know how to feel. Its beautifully made, well acted but the story is not good and pacing is too slow for what happened. 

Outside of destroying the North, Paul and Fremen ends up curb stomping the Harkonnens and becoming Emperor. It was fairly easy going for Paul, the only obstacle he had was drinking the blue Gatorade. Some of the way they acted towards Paul was a bit comical (Stilgar), which kind've showed the aging of Dune which you cant fault since it was written 60 yrs ago. 

I think Dune 1 and 2 are going to be one of the most overrated movie that will be talked about in the next 10 years. Not because the movie is bad but it's not excellent it's just good.

Also no bring in the fat man line.",2024-03-03
"Great visuals, decent acting, terrible pacing. 

Solid 7/10 for me. Not understanding the 10/10 hype rn.",2024-03-03
Feyd and Paul shoulda fucked frfr the sexual tension was more intense in the 10 minutes they’re on screen together than anything between him and Zendaya,2024-03-05
"(1) A bit dense for a Dune normie like me. This truly felt like a part 2 where you actually need to watch 1 again and relearn stuff. Also, THAT ENDING is made for Part 3 sadly.  
(2) Intensely slow. The action would only peak for 10 mins towards the end AND its barely a climax in fact.  
(3) A lot of the characters in this film are fodder (ie Butler and Pugh) and could have been edited out of it, and it would still make sense. Butler is definitely overhyped for how little/barebone his role is.  
(4) This film is overlong and such fluff. Zendaya and Chalamet took the biggest chunk of the film but still felt underwritten - that's a testament given how long the film feels. The religious cult storyline faired better but I felt that it could have been more subtle and organically ingrained into the storey rather than driven into dialogue.  
(5) Its biggest strength is that it is a visual feast. Every moment is a painting vibes",2024-03-01
"Visuals - stunning

Music and sound - stunning

Acting - very good mostly (could so with less childish screaming to portray anger to be honest).

Characters - what the fuck did they do? butchered chani, made jessica out to be evil, made stilgar look a fool, deleted alia (and so fucked up the baron's death scene).

At one point they made stilgar sound like something out of life of brian, I half expected jessica to say ""hes just a naughty boy""....

I dont expect the film to be one to one with the book, but there was no reason to make changes like this.

I've seen people try to go ""but its to make the message clearer""...if thats the case, its treating its audience as stupid and does not need to do so, and in any case, this film seems to have missed the point of the books and instead decided to make the first half into a teen romance for some reason, whilst skipping some key scenes from the book which add weight and nuance to the story and characters.

I really hope this does well this weekend and we get a third film real soon, cause I'd love to see the rest of the 'Paul' story get adapted with Messiah.",2024-03-01

There was a shot near the end of the third act when the Fremen ships are flying in to rain gunfire down on the Harkonnens/Sardaukar that almost looked like the X-wings attacking the death star in A New Hope. Felt very full circle since the novel Dune partially inspired Star Wars.,2024-03-01

"As others said, incredible movie, really enjoyed it in a theater.

One thing that lost me a little was how much did pass on arrakis during the movie ? We see Paul's mother pregnant throughout the film so less than 9 months ? Did she gave birth before the end ? We didn't see any baby. It confuses me quite a bit because going from total stranger to a full fremen fighter worm-rider and chani lover in less than a year seems weird for Paul.

Just a nitpick though",2024-03-01
So fucking amazing. Was fully gripped the entire runtime. Sets the bar absurdly high for the rest of 2024.,2024-03-01
"If someone could explain to me without spoiling the likely third movie… what is Chani’s role up until this point?

"So the ending was changed from what it is in the book so I have some questions about this new ending:

- The main point of him taking Irulan’s hand and becoming emperor in the book seemed to be that this move was the only way he could buy the support of the other houses, as being Emperor they would have to obey him. But in the movie with the other houses challenging him, what was really the point of wanting to take her hand if becoming emperor didn’t prevent the houses from turning against him?

- I feel like the whole Paul character aspect of him trying to avoid the Jihad for pretty much the entire movie just to end up going along with it in the final scene was confusing. Did I miss anything in the movie that would explain his sudden change of heart and why he is now suddenly okay with going along with it and sending the Fremen out to exterminate the other houses even when doing so will cost him Chani?",2024-03-01
Overall a great movie. But the lack of Alia is unforgettable. I missed the abomination of our heart.,2024-03-01

"Just saw it. Generally enjoyed it, but I have a bunch questions....

* When Paul gets sent into the desert by Stilgar, he bumps into Chani and then we're immediately thrown into a full battle scene in the next scene. Is it just me or was something cut from the film? It seemed like they were setting us up for a Paul surviving in the desert by himself scene.
* They establish that Jessica's eyes turn blue after drinking the worm piss. How come Paul's eyes turn blue before he drank the stuff?
* Where did Chani learn how to fly one of those helicopter things?
* When Feyd-Rautha gets sent to Arakis, did they establish that Baron Harkonnen would be joining him?
* When the Harkonnens attack the Fremen following the explosion at the spice depot, they make it seem like Stilgar is very badly injured and he wants to Paul to kill him. How is it that Stilgar is back in ship shape for the final battle sequence?
* Why does everyone stand idly by when Paul kills Baron Harkonnen (especially Feyd Rautha)?
* Is Jessica supposed to be good or bad? I was deeply confused about her role in all of this.

Poor Chani, good sis lost her man not to another woman, but to glorious purpose \*Loki voice\*.  
Its impossible to compete with that :(",2024-03-04
"Having just watched the first film yesterday for today’s viewing I have a lot of thoughts going through my head. First off the visuals and sound design were amazing. My jaw was dropped at several scenes with the Sandworms, the Harkonnen’s home planet, and the scene where the emperor’s ship was coming to the capital of Arrakis.

The action ranges from solid to excellent. Little to no complaints there.

I’ve never read the books but I did find the story predictable. Galactic holy war is the endgame. With that said the execution of it was well done. It’s portrayed both as a moment of triumph for Paul and Fremen, but also horror for the jihad to come.

The character writing is a little wonky. This is where I feel like 2 two and a half hour films isn’t quite enough to establish and flesh out all the characters in this massive ensemble cast. A few felt superfluous or weren’t given much to do, like Momoa and Bautista. Paul has it best overall in the narrative. Seeing him go through a transformation from a well meaning and kind young man to a conqueror who embraces the religious fervor is terrifying. A part of me thinks it went a little quickly of how fast Paul rises through the ranks and gains more followers. In this case a longer adaptation might have been more effective in fleshing that out

I didn’t quite buy the relationship between him and Chani but it did make for an effective if predictable crux. He loses the love of his life to gain power and become Emperor. A part of me wants to see the aftermath and how horrifically wrong the jihad will turn out.

It’s an excellent film and I see it sweeping 2025’s technical awards. I love the sound design when they summon the sandworms to ride and attack. It was one of my favorite reoccurring beats in the film.

All together I really enjoyed the film 8/10. Wish it was longer so characters can be more fleshed out.",2024-03-04

she stands there, paused for a few seconds, then she goes ahead and does it  -----   was it the Voice that made her do it?  Or did she just do it anyway, like, ""why not"" ?

Question: Those inkblot fireworks were so fucking cool of an idea but I noticed it seemed like they were splattering against a clear surface when they went off after Feyd's fight.

"Saw the movie a second time and while still very good (tried 4DX, but the theater we went to I think cheaped out on the seats), I have even more questions than I did last time:

* Gurney says that he bartered to smuggle survivors off world after the massacre. Are those survivors not going to tell everyone that a massacre took place? I still think the idea that it is some big secret that all the Atreides are dead doesn't make sense within the confines of the movie (dont tell me read the book)

* The Bene Gesserit have the power to make people do what they want via talking to them, and rarely ever use this ability. Why not? If they truly are trying to control everything from the shadows, how come they are not ACTIVELY using this all the time? Paul's mom uses it on Chani, and Fenring on the Harkanen so why aren't they just always telling people what to do? They could have told the Fremen to go away when they came for the emperor 

* If Arrakis was originally a tropical paradise, why was it called Dune lol? this one is kind of a joke question

* finally, it is a big point that nobody can go to the south of the planet because of the stormwall between the north and the south....what? the Harkenens have satellites and ships, why aren't they just landing on the other side of the storm? We see people walking around down there frequently in the movie meaning landing is very possible. It's also strange that the worms can go through the storm, or actually that the storm is so strong you can't get through it but if you sit on the back of the worm you are safe? what.",2024-03-15

"It was a fine movie. Lots and lots of eye candy and wonderful spectacle. My biggest beef with it was how tonally flat it was for 2.5 hours. By the end I was getting fatigued by the dreary, flat emotion of the whole thing and onslaught of frowny faces. The tone is trying to maintain a sense of intrigue and seriousness which it succeeds at, but I think because it's so relentless that it starts to feel tiring and lopsided after awhile. It ends up feeling like a 2.5 hour dream sequence, which is really interesting but unfortunately hurts the connection to the characters and immersion of Arrakis. The main disconnect for me was how the characters aren't very relatable, everyone is so entirely serious and lacking any color whatsoever (with the exception of a few passing moments) My impression of the Fremen from the book was that they were culturally vibrant and full of life despite their circumstances yet there are only brief glimpses of that in the movie.",2024-03-02
"Massive disappointment. I loved the first one. World building, political intrigue, great characters, massive battles etc. Dune 2, on the other hand, was bad. No real intrigue. Little more insight into the world behind it all. The battle scenes were laughable. The ""main battle"" was such a massive let down. A fucking joke. 

  
I get that they tried to go for the ""show Paul struggle with not fulfilling the prophecy"", but the entire story was predictable, boring, and filled with shallow 2D-characters. 

4/10

Edit: Loved Javier Bardem though. Awesome actor.",2024-03-04
"I loved it more than the first one. 

Denis Villeneuve continues to provide strong direction, writing and atmospheres throughout this movie as Villeneuve perfectly captures the characters, essence and themes of Dune. The camerawork, the visuals, the colors and production designs are all fantastic as it helped create the world and settings within the characters and tone. Various scenes of action, thrills, and tension were all well-executed and done beautifully. With many all-star cast members, all performances were great with not a single performance feeling dull or out of place. 

Since I haven’t read the original book yet, I may not be too familiar with the lore of Dune but the narrative is pretty interesting as some of the concepts, new characters and themes explored are pretty good. Including a great soundtrack, uses of dialogue and structures throughout. The only complaint I had was that there were a few pacing moments that could have improved. 

Overall, Dune: Part Two is a great continuation of the first film and Villeneuve has proven to be one of the best filmmakers we have right now.

I had 2 main problems with it: 


Stilgar being a comic relief. I hated it so much. I understand them trying to make it more approachable, but flanderizing such a badass character was not it.  


Christopher Walken was miscast. I haven't read the books, but even if you want to portray the emperor as a pathetic wimp, you still have to give him... something. He had no pulse going for him. Did not feel at all like the mighty and treacherous emperor I had imagined. Someone like Varys or Littlefinger would have fit much better. ",2024-03-05

"Liked it a lot, but there were some problems.

Feyd seemed to have no point other than being a 5-minute foil for Paul with a 20 minute build-up with a sterile mini-version of Gladiator inserted. We've also seen Paul win one knife fight, so we get to see him win one more, after it's been established that Feyd fought for sport in arranged matches and probably couldn't have won over an average Fremen fighter.

I haven't read the book, so my ""movie-mind"" would have merged Rabban and Feyd into one character that Gurney could have ended satisfyingly. Cutting out Feyd would have made the movie 20-25 minutes shorter without affecting the plot, and some other stuff could have gone in.

Rabban's end was anti-climactic. I understand the characters are apparently fairly faithful to the book, but both of them seemed to be used wrong.

I didn't expect Stilgar to be funny, and that watered down his character a lot, IMHO.",2024-03-01
"Man I knew the movie would be hyped to death but scrolling through the early thread and only finding 1 post even mentioning the horrible pacing/jumps that clearly felt like big moments are missing... People seem blinded by the spectacle.

That said, it was a wonderful cinematic experience with great acting and world building. Don't get me wrong. Awesome achievement!

But storywise it really fell short of my expectations and clearly has problems. Lot's of stuff I was eager to learn about (their relationship with the worms, how they use them in battle) was not there at all, other stuff just happened randomly & without any deeper explanation (the grandfather reveal, the spie?! getting burned, why df there was a sandworm behind paul when entering the south caves?!, the sudden tzrnarounds of Ghanjis char. Supportive of paul, even when he mentions the dangers of going south, then instant pissed after one thing she doesn't like etc). Even the final battle felt kinds rushed, like the third act has RotK style several endings and acts. 

Should've been three films for the first book imo and it would'e been a masterpiece. Pacing and weird time jumps was also my biggest gripe with the 1st one.",2024-03-01
Most overrated movie I seen this year but good enough,2024-03-02
"I loved the first movie. One of the best in recent years. This one…look, I enjoyed it, and visually it was incredible. 

But it felt a bit hollow and many of the storyline beats seemed silly. Paul over and over again fulfilling prophecies to the sounds of epic Hans Zimmer music and chanting…they did that over and over again. The final 20 minutes was ridiculous, the emperor inexplicably landing with all his troops just chilling on the desert and being wiped out…just silly. The music and visuals alone put it above most movies, but the storyline really held it back.",2024-03-02
"literally no one talking about zendaya? Honestly her portrayal of Chani didn't have an impact, and she had a lot more screentime and more to work with than some of the other actors. I didn't feel the strong emotional connection between Chani and Paul, like the actors don't have enough chemistry.",2024-03-06
"There were many things to like about the film, but it contained *way more* fan service than the first. Without geeking out about it, there are also things that the Lynch version did much better even in terms of what to include; I don't understand, for instance, why Villenueve (of whom I'm a huge fan in general) chose to simply exclude any mention of >!weirding (beyond the single phrase ""weirding woman""), Paul instructing the Fremen, etc.!<

It's also a bit about unnecessary bloat. In recent years corporate interests have affected franchise movies to such an extent that in a fairly short children's tale like *The Hobbit*, entire subplots are made out of whole cloth to inflate runtime (an elf-dwarf love story, a dumb rivalry between an orc and Thorin Oakenshield, the barrel fight scene, I could of course go on). Here, as one of many examples, we had one of those stuffed-in moments when the clumsy foreshadowing of >!Gurney Halleck's mention of his family's murder at the hands of Rabban!< was followed predictably by >!his killing of Rabban (forgetting to even mention his family)!<. 

While the focus on Feyd Rautha was fun and interesting, and visually the designers and director did a good job of consistently making the entire Harkkonen culture creepy and revolting, Paul Atreides by the final conflict should not have had such trouble killing him, between Bene Gesserit speed and control plus foresight. This is another thing Lynch did better--one simply cannot compare the battle in the current movie with the moment when Paul speaks the killing word, breaking Feyd's body and the rock under him almost nonchalantly, followed by the epic murmur from Stilgar (""Muad'dib!""). And going by the novels Feyd would be expected to have fighting prowess beyond limits today (without going deeply into it, there were swordsmen in the preceding war with the robots called the ""Butlerian Jihad"" which could move faster than machines, i.e. could move faster than modern humans do today and as the Bene Gesserit do, and Feyd as the scion of a major house would have every possible advantage coached and built into him.)

Thus the final one-on-one fight, which so many seem to have found enthralling, should have been more of Feyd moving beyond current human limits of speed and finesse, and Paul, younger, slighter and less well trained, countering with his half-formed Bene Gesserit movement skills plus his Kwizatz Haderach abilities. The first movie's death match was superior, where Paul's coached fighting skills and Bene Gesserit abilities were barely enough to keep him alive, until his foresight pushed him over the edge. That's the essence of a coming-of-age/golden-child story in this context.

Where the first movie was pretty much artful in every way, this movie in general was dumbed-down, full of more careless errors, and written to hammer away at personal moments like Chani's discontent. There's no reason for the change in approach and it weakened the story; Dune in book form was already one of the most compelling stories ever written. I wish the director had used the same ethic throughout both movies, but it feels like he must have compromised with corporate interests for the second. The same high standards from the first movie could have been observed while delivering all the (definitely gorgeous) eye candy of the second.

There were many things to like about the film, especially as an exercise in world-building; I just was hoping it'd be as excellent as the first. It's not bad, just a bit strange as an effort from someone so consistently, delicately thoughtful.",2024-03-02

"I don‘t know what to think. I absolutely loved the first part and watched it three times in cinemas… This one I didn‘t even want to watch again! 

Everything felt kind of unfinished for me. 
The ending was the best part and the middle seemed rushed in the sense that soo much was happening and I felt like it was just stacked on top of each other. 
Especially the part where he finally has his resurrection moment and „oh yeah her tears will wake him up“ and it was just too much for me.

Great acting from every actor and actress but there wasn‘t any type of fascination I had with the first part present. 

I watched the movie in D-Box seats and every action part was very nice. Especially the worm riding.",2024-03-01
"I liked it, but have mixed feelings. I felt that Paul and Lady Jessica were not portrayed too well or at least their motivations were not as clear. Paul goes from being adamant about staying north to suddenly drinking the water and embracing his ascension. In the book his thoughts and inner struggles make him feel like it's what he must do and to me is a tragedy. But the movie makes him seem to relish in his new power, rather than seeing it as a curse. When Paul tells Jessica ""that's not hope"" that was the Paul I knew from the book.


As for Jessica her actions are portrayed as insidious, like she's some kind of villain. But she was just doing what she had to do to keep Paul safe. Although Chani asking how she could do this to her son was spot on.


I guess the common thread is that I didn't feel the hesitance and strong desire to fight against what they had to do, rather they succumb to it rather quickly, but it is a long story and I understand that there must be a lot of thoughts and motivations on the cutting floor. There's also the problem of how to portray the visions and timelines in film, since it's a bit confusing and flowing in the book; seems their answer was to just not try and just have nightmares.


I have to admit I thought the movie dragged a couple times, but it went by surprisingly fast anyway.


What I liked were the changes to the ending. Reading the book it was so unsatisfying for Paul not to be the one that kills the Baron, so happy to see that change. Interesting that Alia isn't born yet. Maybe I need to reread the book, but I thought the Houses accepted his ascension to the throne? Or am I misremembering? Am I also misremembering Stilgar as not being such a fanatic?


All in all a good movie, but I hate the way the characters were portrayed in order to move the story along quicker. It's definitely given me more appreciation of the book and the time it spends on characters.",2024-03-01
Chalamet's so good in the last act of this. Felt like a real messianic figure when he converts the southern Fremen. He's given some good performances in the past but this was the first time he felt like a true movie star.,2024-03-01
"Might get downvoted into worm territory considering the general reception but I’ll offer two things I didn’t like:

1. The edit of Paul traveling South and drinking the blue water felt really jarring. I didn’t understand how he got from riding a sandworm with a group to arriving on foot alone. Also unclear why Chani arrived so much later in an ornithopter. My sense of travel times and travel companions were thrown off for a good couple of minutes.

2. As much as the film was marketed as a war movie and delivered on some fronts, I still wanted more. I would have loved a 30 minute sequence showing waves of Fremen and imperial forces clashing with each other, gaining and losing the high ground, seeing war tactics play out successfully and unsuccessfully, maybe some of the enemies finding a way to take down a worm, etc, pretty much what Return of the King did. Here it felt like Paul’s team got the upper hand and rolled over everyone within 10 minutes. I know the film’s making a point that desert power is overwhelming and severely underestimated by enemy forces but I just wanted a longer battle.",2024-03-01
"In a world where films are getting too woke for their own good, it’s nice to have a classic piece of sci-if that exhibits good old fashioned values.

"So I liked this movie but not nearly as much as the first one. I think the mixture of Hans Zimmer’s score shaking the whole theater mixed with the gorgeous visuals entranced me like Blade Runner 2049 did. It all seemed like it was leading up to something far more epic than this. It seems like this movie is rushing and I didn’t feel that with the first one. Paul speedruns his way to becoming the fremen leader and prophet and before I knew it he was killing the baron casually and bringing the leader of the entire known universe to his knees. This should feel more huge than it did. I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that Timothy Chalamet doesn’t emote much and when he does, I usually don’t know if he is sad, upset, excited, etc. He looks good for the part and was clearly chosen for his looks more than his skill like most of the actors in this movie.  I also noticed when I rewatched Blade Runner 2049 that Gosling doesn’t emote much even when he is supposed to be emotional. I really think the aesthetic and the soundtrack carried the film. I want to say the same thing happened with Dune Part 1. With Dune part 2 there had to be a lot of stuff happening and it hindered Villanues usual style maybe? This is all a hot take as I just saw it. But yeah kind of disappointed.",2024-03-03

**Please** reply and tell me your thoughts as I really want to discuss this!

(note I have NOT read the books, I am a huge fan of Denis Villeneuve and sci-fi)

#NEGATIVES
* first 1.5 acts appeared quite slow
* third act *very* rushed and ended abruptly
* dialogue very quite
* hardly *no* memorable lines opposed to first film (**THEYRE BRUTAL**)
* characters besides Paul seemed wooden and pointless 
* for example I thought Austin butler’s character would play more of a role in the films by the way they were talking about him but basically died semi off screen
* Hans Zimmer score more of the same, nothing revolutionary and the score was absent in a lot of the film. I wish Jóhann Jóhannsson was alive to produce the score instead but oh well.
* Christopher walken *very* out of place and overall underwhelming
* gravitas and scale of the universe and the empire appeared small
* character motives and decisions weren’t explained and seemed confusing -  but I chalk that up to the book being told potentially in internal monologues that are hard to translate to film? Maybe?
* Zendaya’s character in the third act

#Positives 
* Chalamet’s performance was absolutely phenomenal and carried the film
* the rise of Paul and his speech in the south along with his new authority as he rises to emperor
* the huge wide CGI shots of the dessert were impressive
* the sound design of the machinery 
* the artistic design and creativity of the harkonnen planet 
* Javier Bardem 

Overall: **7**

First movie: **8.5**

I feel as though this is a film where you may benefit from reading the books first. I strongly believe that this isn’t always the case but I think it applies here.",2024-03-02
"I may be going against the flow here. But i didn't enjoy the movie. 

I am a fan of the books. Part 1 stuck true to the book. And as a fan, i really appreciated that. And i was so excited to see part 2.

The first half was amazing. But there are some changes they made that just seemed crazy to me and really took me out of the movie.

These may be things i am miss-remembering, but after talking about it with my wife, who has never read the books, she had some of the same conclusions. 

Pauls crossing of the desert to make him a man was not an achievement worthy of him becoming a fremem. His riding of the worm was. And why they didnt have that celebration scene after he rode the worm instead of crossing the desert with chani? i do not know. 

The harkonans having their meeting in a bason rather than the city seemed like a crazy choice just so they could have the scene where the army ride in on sand worms. 

The meeting with the emporor. In the books was so much more civil. There was an explanation of how to avoid war. paul requires being married into the family and being declared emporor. How it was handled in the film was like watching someone slice a cake with a hammer. 

Creating the rift in the fremem between the north and south felt stupid. Changing Chani from being Pauls loving supporter to being his biggest critic was heartbreaking. Cutting down on the timespan ment we missed out on seeing how much of an abomination Pauls sister actually is.  

Paul doesn't get his son with Chani. 


It made the second half of the movie feel disjointed and rushed. And as someone who read the book and loved the first film. I felt pained watching the second. 

Yes, visually, it was spectacular. The acting was amazing. But the story felt like it had been changed for the worse. As one of my personal biggest greviences, the changes seemed to be in favour of visuals over the story. Like how in Game of Thrones, they inserted a zombie polar bear and used loads of their budget, removing some better scenes. 

I understand that so much is being changed. To make this book more suitable as a movie. That was the reason for some of the changes. Such as Chani being the voice of reason over Paul himself. But I dont like how it was done. And i feel like it could have been better. 

All in all, it's worth a watch. But it doesn't come close to how good the first film was in my eyes.",2024-03-03
This is the kinda movie you HAVE to watch on a big screen. The scope was unbelievable. The sound was like hitting me in the chest.,2024-03-01
"Oh it was fantastic. Everything I had hoped and more. It built on the foundation that part one laid out and masterfully so. It’s gonna be fun to watch both films back to back. The pacing was quicker and not a dull moment. I loved everything about it, the soundtrack, performances, visuals, the direction was just on another level. 

Best film of the year so far for me. Definitely different from the source material but in a unique way and I thought the ending was incredible. Yeah I do miss certain moments, dialogue and whatnot but it’s a great adaptation. I know Denis has talked about making a third film and I certainly hope so. There’s so much to explore in the Dune universe and I’m all for it.",2024-03-01
"“Lead them to paradise”
Holy shit

Absolutely mind-melting film. I feel like I need to see it two more times to fully take it in. Every change from the book was inspired. The action was inspired. Every frame is a work of art. Denis’ confidence in his vision is off the charts, it’s like nothing I’ve ever seen. The whole cast brought their A-game and Chalamet brought something way beyond that. Butler crushed it as Feyd, I don’t know how he made that character so repulsive and so captivating. Complimenting Paul on his death blow was just *chef’s kiss*. 

I love how the film was so overt about Jessica being being a poison to the Fremen, the book only briefly touches on her influence. The whole movie leans way more into the dark aspect of this story than the first book even does, people who haven’t read the book are going to have their world rocked. 

A genuinely legendary film. Bring on Messiah.",2024-03-01

"Just saw it tonight with a friend and holy crap was this an awesome movie! I love the absolute world building in these two movies. I want to know more and see the other houses.  How this world interacts with each other. Geidi Prime was incredible in infrared and so alien-like, like a black sun... wtf!  I feel like I would go to war for Paul Atredis. He definitely has that power and charisma. Chalamet was great. The incredible scale of things two, you know things are massive and when you see them blow up it is jaw dropping. I have one stickler, the final battle...does it not seem a little short...like we missed 10-15 mins of it.   
The battle plans were laid the initial worm assault and artillery barrage and freman jumping up was great on a giant open sand plain. Then we get into the inside the throne room with the emperor and his capture. After that we jump right to Arakeen and it's demise and siege and it's over. It just seems like we should have more fighting with the saddurkar, the emperor brought his whole army. We're are arakeens defences.  
It's not a downside to anything I still thoroughly enjoyed this and Part 1. 10/10 for me!  
Also the voices at the start of the movies talking about power and spive, who or what is speaking it? I don't think we hear it anywhere else in the movies?",2024-03-02

My only criticism is that it seems dumb that the Emporer would land on Arrakis when it was obvious that he was walking into an ambush. Also there's no explanation as to how Paul delivers a scroll with his Duke seal to the emporer on another planet in what seems like a day. And why the great houses would even consider making the trip out there at the request of a fallen house.,2024-03-02
"I can't lie I preferred the first one

Don't get me wrong, it looks fantastic and Chalamet, Bardem and Butler are great in it.

But I thought it kinda dragged in the middle portion, Florence Pugh was given nothing to do except being in stunning fits and recording her video diary, and I thought the ending was rather anticlimactic.

Also, reading the changes they made from the book (tbh I've never read it), I'm not sure how I feel about the timeline being condensed by that much. I also feel that the reason for Paul going to the dark side (seeming to be unable to resist the temptation) was lesser than the original reason, which was his and Chani's kid dying 

Overall, I'd give it 3.5/5. I gave the first one 4/5",2024-03-02

"Absolute masterpiece. I actually liked how Chani’s character was evolved to serve as a foil for Paul’s growing cult of personality.

The scene on Geidi Prime was enthralling and visceral, and the desert ambushes by the Fremen were top notch action scenes. 

The only thing I enjoyed more than the visuals was the audio. The music, sounds, and especially the recurring chant motif were sublime.

Might legitimately be a 10/10 viewing experience in the theatre.",2024-03-03

"Really great movie. I liked it a lot more than Part 1, although it of course gives part 1 more meaning now.


Anyway I haven't readthe book and have some questions...


1) Lisan al Gaib is a creation of the Bene Gesserit through hundreds of years of planning correct? So although some religious fanatics follow Paul blindly, he is indeed the chosen one right?


And is Kwaisatz Haderach essentially the same thing as Lisan al Gaib?


2) We see what I assume is Paul's sister walking to the ocean on what I presume is Arrakis in a vision. What is this about? Do the Fremen not know the ocean is there? Does she discover it?


3) Paul tells Stilgar that Arrakis will become paradise. He is lying right?


4) What makes Paul go ahead South after drinking the blur stuff. He still sees horror but sees himself leading as being a better future than him not leading?


5) How does the final fight with Feyd Rautha compare with how is goes does in the book? I was a little disappointed Paul didn't dispose of him more easily. Also Stilgar saying ""Lisab al Gaib"" immediately after winning the fight was a little too comical for the moment lol.",2024-03-03

In the first one he was a fearless monster who didn't take shit from no one but here he ran from the fremen, could barely hold his own weight hanging from the ornithopter and was afraid and humiliated multiple times.

I think more of feyds efficient attacks on the freman should've been more apparent hell maybe in that same scene he attacks the Sietch maybe there's one freman the Harkonans have cornered but can't kill could have them be tired but still mobile and have feyd be the one to kill him so that duel at the end could've had a bit more stake other than that I loved the movie,2024-03-11

Just finished watching it for the second time. What an incredible film,2024-03-20
"Saw it today in IMAX 70mm and it looked FUCKING amazing. But then, so did The Creator. 

Visually stunning, but for a nigh on 3-hour film, there were a few characters that didn’t really do much. I loved the baron, was expecting so much after the first film. He was an evil mastermind, but not? When he was climbing the stairs to the throne, I was expecting him to be “tricked you, suckers!” Nope. 

The Emperor and his daughter are barely in it. Same with Margot. I guess they’re going to have bigger parts in the next one, but I said that about several parts of the first one. Feyd was a one-dimensional bad guy, but he was great. Villeneuve clearly loved that character because he made him, and that whole black and white sequence, cool as fuck. But yeah, stole the show for 25 minutes then he’s gone.

I watched the first one last night in preparation, so 5-hours of an emo Timothee Chalamet wasn’t really my cup of tea, but I’ll admit he was captivating when he went heel. But again, for such a long film, it felt like large chunks of were cut out. 

80% looked amazing. I’m glad there was a finale this time and I’m looking forward to the conclusion. I’m glad it brought so many people joy and awe, but some of the reviews are well over the top.",2024-03-01

"So people probably won’t see this but anyway here are my thoughts on the movie.

First of all it was a good movie and one I am deffiently gonna rewatch many times, and i have been looking forward to watching since I saw part 1. 

But I have few things I will mention I feel wasn’t executed properly.

First is the pacing the majority of the film I guess 2 hours? are nice pacing and it goes into a lot of details, but at some point the movie just speeds up to be eleven and tries to move the plot insnaly fast, I think it’s when they get to the part where they finally decide to go south. We see them ride worms and then next seen Paul is drinking worm juice and chani arrive in a flyer( and where did she get this ? And how does she know how to fly it?) into Paul waking up and convincing all fremen to follow him and boom they are assaulting emperor. And considering the build up in the movie the entire battle goes way too fast. And midway through battle they are also assaulting haarkenen and it’s all over in 5 min. 

The movie is 2hr and 45 min and with the pacing I feel like they made a 4 hour film and realised it was to long in editing and had to kill their darlings and decided all the action at the end was less important than the storyline which is fair. But walking out of theater my
First thought was almost I hope they make an extended edition

My 2nd biggest problem or concern is the setup and pay off. There are a few times in the movie when they set up different things that doesn’t follow through further along. 
- the saudakaar are descrbibed as the best fighting force there is in d1 and we seem they getting moved down without any problem like if we take the final battle into account 1 fremen easy equals 10 saudakaar. Even the emperors personal which we presume are his best just vanishes in a cloud and never seen again. 
- the freaking laser cannon?? We see the fremen use these laser cannons tearing through haarkenen patrols and air ships like it’s nothing and then we don’t see them used ever again? Such a powerful weapon and only use it in the beginning. And it makes little sense in the first patrol scene where they are fighting under a spice crawler and Paul needs to reload chani bazooka that they use the laser right after and blow it all open? Why even risk going into close quarter combat could have fixed it all from afar in 10 seconds. 
- in same scene as above they put a lot of time into describing the energy shields and likewise in d1 but here in d2 it feels like they aren’t relevant outside that one scene with chani and the bqzooka. 
In the finale battle we see multiple flyers getting shot down by single shot and we also see gurney move down harkkenen soldiers one by one and shields don’t seem to matter. And I am mentioning these example because we see the shield cgi effect but it’s just there no real protection 

I might seem like I have a lot of criticism but it is because I like the movie a lot that I noticed these few things and I feel those problems don’t live up to the rest of the movie. The shots the actors the story everything else top notch entire experience 8/10 on a good day.",2024-03-02

"Surprised this is getting so much love. Maybe I just needed to see the first one again but the plotting and pacing felt so off - I really had a hard time following the plot and the payoff in the third act just wasn’t there with how rushed it was   

They really set up such a a great villain in Austin Buttler (although the Harkenens just randomly killing their minions constantly was cartoonishly bad directing - it had 0 impact by like the 5th time it happened- weirdly amateurish well for Denis to keep visiting ) - with the homoeroticism and mommy issues but then really did nothing with him

This absolutely needed to be 2 movies - one with Paul coming into his own as a disciple of the dessert and a second with Paul’s turn to delusion out of desperation to save people

The emperor falling for the world’s dumbest trap was…insane. Why was your daughter and whole army or even you there ? Really sloppy writing where character motivations went out the door 

I think Zendaya is one of the generations best talents but my god she is so miscast in this . Why is she the only one in her tribe that has no accent ?she doesn’t have the gravitas here

Waiting two years to see Batista vs Brolin and………….welp.,2024-03-01
"I liked it, but it's a step down compared to the 1st one imo.

Pacing was weird with some scenes taking a lot of time (like Paul & Chani flirting in the desert) while others interesting ones were just skipped (like Paul arriving into the south). And the fight scenes had the build to be satisfying but were mostly underwhelming, like a badly directed Paul vs Feyd Rautha (just look at the numbers of people asking what happened in this thread) or the Harkonnen getting obliterated using 0 strategy going into a fight with no visibility under Batista.

The weapon physics also have to be explained because it's weird how they can use lasers to destroy harvesters but not infantry ? And infantry never shoot at Fremen but I don't think they have any shield ?

It was cool seeing the Bene Gesserit playing all sides and having a better understanding of the Emperor strategy (or how clueless he was).",2024-03-01

I'd start a holy war for Florence Pugh.,2024-03-10
"This is what a $200M dollar movie should look like. It is one of the most impressive films I have seen. It is a director given freedom and a budget, with a cast and crew bringing their A game. And given the time to do it right. See it on IMAX. Its just impressive. 

I am not saying it is a perfect movie. Or that there is a formula for a hit movie. But when you see things like Blade Runner 2049, Oppenheimer, Barbie, Mad Max Fury Road, The Last Jedi (I don't care if you hate it, keep it to yourself), and Dune. And you see what real movies look like compared to so much of the MCU, DCEU, Jurassic Park, and Fast and Furious type movies that seem more concerned with hitting a target date than doing it right.   

Movies are not an assembly line. This movie makes most blockbusters look like shit despite the same budget. The cast was great, the visuals were amazing, if I am complaining it would be that I wish it didn't end as another To Be Continued. Really wish Hollywood would stop doing that.

And finally, I just didn’t like Chani’s character turn of her always in her feelings and angry at Paul for half of the movie.

"Dope visuals and even doper sound, but a little disappointing on the script side.

And the villains - I mean, feyd looked fucking awesome, and the harkonnen homeworld was very cool, but sheesh, none of the bad guys even put up a fight! Like, every time there's a faceoff, the bad guys just get steamrolled so hard it hardly even feels good to watch them lose. And back to Feyd - the movie doesn't sell the idea the he's a good fighter. All we see him do is kill two drugged guys and one non-drugged guys, and we're told by the film that he usually only fights drugged guys. So like... is he actually any good? All that is to say that it didn't feel like a satisfying payoff to see the bad guys defeated, and even if that's supposed to be intentional, it remains unsatisfying.

I didn't like it as much. Well shot but the plot is weak. I guess I'm not a fan of the source material,2024-03-01
"Chani being pissed was strange, jessica talking to a baby was weird, like she's possessed, i didnt like that, she just changes personality completely. Paul changes as well with the WoL, but in the books the Water doesn't necessarily make you evil but only opens the door to perception, therefore the choices you make might seems evil. He still has a soul but the movie kind of suggests the Water takes your soul, you heart, as the Emperor puts it, as describing Leto. 
The fanaticism was overplayed as well I think, possibly because they didnt want to dive into the depths of what it means to have a true 'jihad', its described in the book as a race consciousness where humanity is collectively acting to destroy and rebuild itself. Paul in the source material always aims to eventually lead the Fremen and overthrow the oppressors because he cares for them, only hoping he can avoid the jihad. Here he seems to be reluctant to do it in the first place, somewhat hoping for a stalement or somesuch. I felt the motivation was simplistic, linled to the previous WoL sudden personality change. 
The film kind of skimps on the intricacies of characters and their journeys, instead being quite ham-fisted, using big, skmetimes clumsy narrative levers to enact swift attitude transformation. 


I liked a lot of it, but much of it felt quite oddly paced and focused. Perhaps my mind is too full of the book to appreciate the story they present, coupled with the fact that i already know whats going to happen, i dont know.  But i knew the lord of the rings story before i watched it, and still enjoyed it immensely. I think the narrative simplicity of this film, which also emphasises style over substance, leaves it quite scarce for the person who already knows the plot.  ",2024-03-02
"I was disappointed. I find it too jarring to have Chalamet and Zendaya as the stars. Way too much time was spent on his acceptance and the details of Fremen society. I found the climax to be really rewarding, and enjoyed that the most, but it did feel a bit rushed. 

Austin Butler's voice was great, sounded just like his uncle.

There were some plot points and lines that were a bit much: ""This is for my duke, and my friends"". ""Old fashioned artillery, genius"".   


I felt like the concept of the chosen one was just echoed too much, a large portion of the film was people cheering or kneeling.   


Visually stunning. The scenes in the Harkonnen homeland were amazing.   


I think I would have enjoyed it more if we spent more time with the Harkonnens or the emperor. He didn't really have the commanding presence you would think ruler of the universe would have.",2024-03-02
"It's still good, but I felt by and large that the changes from the novel weakened the story. There are a couple that I understand given the medium and Box Office hopes (not having toddler Alia out there acting like an adult, stripping out Paul and Chani's murdered child side plot), but there were others that didn't work and/or were downright unforgivable:

1. By far the worst ommission was the complete absence of the Spacing Guild. They are one of the three pillars of power in the Universe, and arguably the most influential in the climax of the book. The lynchpin of Paul's leverage is his ability to destroy the spice, and the Guild in particular are the most invested in its safety; his threats pull the Guild in line, and that forces everyone else to acquiesce as well because otherwise the Guild will leave everyone marooned on Arrakis. Without them, the political aspect of the climax feels very derivative and plain.

2. In theory Chani's resistance is a good idea, but the execution was very forced. She's literally the only Fremen who doesn't get caught up in the Messiah prophecy, and we get zero insight into why she is the exception -- not even a reference to her mother being an agent of the Imperium to explain why she might have a different perspective. I get why the filmmakers wanted her to have more agency, but it's not what the story demanded, and they didn't add in enough backstory to effectively execute the change.

3. The choreography of the final fight with Feyd was excellent, but plot wise it again felt forced. Paul is one of the best fighters in the known universe, trained by the best of the best of three of the four elite fighting forces (the Atreides, the Bene Gesserit, and the Fremen). Feyd-Rautha is a strong fighter, but not shown to be quite at Paul's level (even in the movie, he struggles against a simple Atreides captive); him having the edge on Paul doesn't make sense. The fight in the book worked because even though Paul is the superior fighter, his reticence of Feyd's underhandedness levels the playing field. Feyd not doing anything underhanded in the fight eliminates this, and it's also completely out of character for him.",2024-03-03
"It deserves all the praise it is going to get, but I was a bit disappointed that Denis seems mostly uninterested in the interesting ecology and the relationship between the worms and the spice. Just going with ""atomics"" at the end to threaten the spice is boring. and kinda betrays the idea of using ""desert power"" and knowledge of the land to win.",2024-03-01
Timottee has beaten the fraud allegations. He's a talented actor,2024-03-02
"I wish Feyd-Rautha was more development as a complete psycho, that they showed just how deprived he was. He kinda felt flat.

I wish Rabban had put up more of a fight, shown him as an absolute tank, looks like he was all bark and no bite.

I wish the movie had a little more tempo, it wasn’t boring, far from it, but It feels like there was to much (absolutely beautiful) filler.

With that said.

Maybe the most beautiful movie I’ve ever seen, every frame is a painting.

Awesome casting (besides Austin Butler, I can’t stand him).

Im sure the movie will grow on me with future viewings, but it’s already very high on my most lIke’s movies list.

Many badass moments, Paul fully embracring being Lisan-al-Gaib and give that speech at the end was awesome.

Great movie",2024-03-01
"The first half felt pretty solid but I think the movie would have seriously benefitted from Chani actually having Leto II and by proxy less screen time, only because Chani isn't all that interesting of a character and didn't need like 5 different shots showing her feeling skeptical about Paul - the final shot of the film felt like she was planning to turn on him or something just a really bizarre choice - it felt like something you would show at the end of a season cliffhanger of a TV show and not the final shot at the end of a movie that's supposed to cap off a book.

I thought most of the movie was pretty good but Alia not being in it was the one real spot where they lost me and ruined the ending and my favorite parts from the book. Definitely could have used some of of the Spacing Guild and playing up the metaphysical side of the navigators.  Rabban and the Baron's deaths felt so underwhelming and rushed after all that buildup, next to no payoff.  Introducing Feyd that late was also a mistake, I think he needed more time overall to cook instead of devoting a huge chunk of the movie just to him.  

The visuals, sound, and acting for the most part where very good but I'm sorry, Christopher Walken was a terrible choice and has zero range, the dude feels like the same character in everything - he hardly had any lines though thankfully so it minimized some of it but just felt really weird it came off like his character was barely involved.  Overall it's not a bad movie but it kind of misses the vibe I was hoping they would hit.  If you haven't read the books you will probably like the movie but it ends up losing the things that made the book stand out in the first place and ends up feeling like more of just a standard action/revenge movie.",2024-03-02
I honestly had no idea what was happening 80% of the time.,2024-03-03
"Obviously incredible cinematography. Wow. 

Not a perfect movie but definitely one of the most incredible cinema experiences I have ever had. 

Huge improvement for me over the first movie. 

I do think it was a tad convenient  at times with some of the decisions of the characters and I’m not sold on Zendaya and Chalamets chemistry but I didn’t find the issues distracting",2024-03-01
"I am blown the fuck away. This is my favorite book of all-time, like many other people, and I just feel so grateful to get such an incredible adaptation of this book. I think this movie is perfect.

So incredibly impressed with all of the performances, especially Chalamet, Ferguson, and Butler. Feyd-Rautha is one of the most terrifying villains I’ve seen in a long time. The sandworm ride was fucking amazing. The scenes on Geidi Prime were mesmerizing. The sound design and score was fucking incredible.

Denis Villenueve is THE director of this era. What a fucking success. I cannot wait for Dune Messiah to be adapted.",2024-03-01
"It was funnier than I expected - in a good way. 

Also built up the themes of religious conflict and skepticism to a greater degree than I think even the book did - certainly it builds up the character of Chani and makes her much more interesting (Zendaya's performance helps). 

I actually support most of the changes they made from the book. They dropped things that didn't work there and other things that wouldn't have worked that well on screen. I won't give those away - but good on Villeneuve and Spaihts for *adapting* the material, and wisely.

Probably should see it again - I thought it dragged just a touch at times, but I might've been tired - but overall I was very much impressed. Bring on Part Three!",2024-03-01
"I really liked it, but my criticism from the first movie remains, it's impossible to tell how much time has passed. But in this movie Jessica never gives birth so we know it's less than 9 months unless Bene Gesserit has longer pregnancies for some reason.

But in the first movie? The amount of time between Atreides landing on Arrakis and then get destroyed could be a year or two days, no one knows.",2024-03-01
"If this movie doesn't deserve a 10/10, I don't know what perfect scores are reserved for.

The cinematography. The music. The stunning moments. The characters. Arrakis lives and breathes here. The action is engaging and compelling and believable. The fallout from pivotal decisions ripples through the narrative. The transposition of an impossibly dense novel onto the big screen in a tangible, thematically accurate, and emotional form--an impossible task, but done nigh flawlessly.

I honestly can't think of another science fiction film in recent memory that captures what Villaneuve has done here. I'm tempted to go see it in theaters a second time, and I almost never watch movies in theaters at all.",2024-03-01
"Was it just me, or did some scenes feel truncated or skipped?

Like, Paul was tasked to survive in the desert, had a single scene with Chani, and then the very next scene, he was under the sand ambushing with the rest of the Fremen warriors

Or when Glossu started bombing the Fremen's cave system all of a sudden

Or when Paul went from riding a giant worm outside to walking up to the Baron

Don't get me wrong, I still think this movie is easily a masterpiece, but I was surprised how often I was losing track of where characters were in the edit, when that wasn't a problem in the first one

Maybe Im just stupid",2024-03-01
"Looking back, its actually kind of crazy that modern Hollywood was able to create a truly worth adaptation of the cornerstone of modern sci-fi.",2024-03-01

"I love how this movie really leaned into some of the core themes of religion and prophecy in the books. I was worried they were going to shy away from some of the weirder stuff and make it a less serious action flick instead of letting the work speak for itself. It did have a few flaws in timeline/logic, but it's easy to gloss over given how great the overall story was. 

I really hope they do Messiah next.",2024-03-02

"I'd say I'm ""generally familiar"" with Dune because it's been around for so long, plus my wife has read the books.  I really enjoyed the first movie, but this one really didn't grip me at all. Maybe it was my lack of expectations, maybe I'm just not that into Dune, maybe I'm just not smart enough for the movie.  I found Giedi Prime to be the highlight for me, which doesn't surprise me as Salusa Secundus from Part 1 was one of my favorite parts of the movie.  

Cinematography overall was stunning as expected.

Timothy and Rebecca shone as their characters evolved, it was great to see more Josh Brolin, and Javier Bardem was a great supporting character.

We saw it in IMAX and the sound was entirely too loud at points or dead quiet, our ears are still ringing to our surprise.",2024-03-03
"OK, just got back from my second viewing. I saw an advance screening on Monday in IMAX, and I saw it in IMAX 70mm today. This film is a solid 9 out of 10 that definitely rewards rewatching. Absolutely incredible stuff in this one. There's depth to the story and what it's trying to portray. There's internal conflict playing out in Paul really well. The visuals were wonderful again. The sound was astonishing, and there were a few really beautiful moments elevated by the score. Major book spoilers ahead Couple nitpicks:  
* Chani's arc in this has changed from the book, in some ways better and in some ways worse. Her being kind of the embodiment of Paul's doubts and the naysayer definitely worked on screen. One of the bigger challenges with adapting Dune is replacing the internal monologues and exposition with events on screen that reveal that information. There's a lot to reveal, so creating that conflict was very convenient and was quite good for the most part. Three things that could have contributed to making her story deeper (and more tragic) that were left out were:  
* There was no connection between her and Dr Liet Kynes in the movie. If they had kept Kynes as Chani's parent, like in the book, it would have given her and Paul another way to connect (""Dead parent, huh? Yeah, me too. Sucks, right?"") It also would give her more to fight for and more agency besides just fighting 'for her people'.  
* Chani and Paul not having a child, and further, not having that child killed. I understand that the time has been compressed in the movie from a few years down to a few months, so I get that it had to be cut. Just something that was a little jarring to me the first time watching this one. It didn't bother me quite as much the second time.  
* Jessica not providing the final line of the book to Chani when Paul arranges his marriage to Irulan. ""Think on it, Chani: the princess will have the name, yet she'll live as less than a concubine - never to know a moment of tenderness from the man to whom she's bound. While we, Chani, **we who carry the name of concubine - history will call us wives.**"" The fact that Jessica wasn't married to Leto, and that Chani isn't married to Paul, is a huge point and one of the central conflicts of the following books. I wish they would have driven that point home. On rewatch, I can see how much they were driving a wedge between Jessica and Chani throughout the film, especially after the Water of Life scene with Chani, so it makes sense why Jessica wouldn't give that little bit of comfort to Chani in the moment. 


Altogether what they did made sense narratively as a film, but as an adaptation, it kind of felt like they gave a lot more agency to Jessica in these movies and took some away from Chani. Jessica has for sure been a major highlight of these films, so not taking anything away from her. I would have liked to see a bit more done with Chani though. 


* Christopher Walken as the emperor is a little bit bumbling and his motivations are a bit unknown. It just felt like he wasn't given a lot to do and you didn't really see the kind of frustration out of him that would have led him to take his family and his entire army to Arrakis. Maybe the point they were trying to make was that he was just a pawn of the Bene Jesserit, with Irulan and the Reverend Mother being in his ear all the time. That wasn't made very obvious though. 
* ...and so if the emperor isn't the big bad villain of part two, is it the Baron or the beast Rabban or the beautiful na-Baron Feyd-Rautha, or even the massive Sardaukar army? They don't really elevate the Baron to levels beyond the first movie; he's more like Hedonism-Bot in this movie. And the only thing that Rabban gets to do is rage, fail and die. They kind of went all in on Feyd, who was admittedly magnificent as a presence on-screen, but one thing that they didn't put into the movie (which they already gave precedent for in part one), was that Paul was seeing his fights in his visions ahead of time, but that Paul had never once seen Feyd in his visions, so he couldn't predict what he would do. It was like the Bene Gesserit were blocking his prescience as it related to Feyd. But we didn't get that. Only a kind of curious glance from Paul when he killed the Baron. Could have been an interesting bit of tension added to the final fight. 
* Some of Paul's big-boy-voice line deliveries were a little bit weak for me. With the addition of the Voice, it was fine, but there were a couple that didn't land at times. Same with Chani sometimes. 


 * No Thufir?? That's unfortunate. Also, the fact that Gurney doesn't have his suspicions about Jessica as the spy in the Atreides house, which could have really amped up the tension between him and the Fremen, if he tried to attack the Reverend Mother. 
* My only effects-related complaint I have is about the crowd shots on Geidi Prime. Everybody pumping their fists simultaneously looked like early 2000s CGI and distracted me a couple times. 
 * The tradition of not recognizing leadership except through battle was only really touched on, at the war council, but in the book, the heads of the tribes that swear allegiance have to come to him and fight him to the death in order for the tribes to come under Paul's control, a fact that he hates. 


Major kudos on how they handled Alia's inclusion in the movie. That could have really been fumbled and could have sank the movie with audiences. I'm really happy with the direction they took. Anyway, I still loved it, and hope that Denis can make something good out of Dune: Messiah. I really didn't like the book, but I will see anything that that man makes, and he's done enough to build trust in his ability to adapt the material. I honestly could have accepted this movie to be another 40-60 minutes long.",2024-03-03
"the movie is amazing, but I have a LOT of questions about the world presented as someone who isn't familiar with the books:

* why again is spice so important? to map the stars sure but once you have mapped a way to a new planet do you have to remap it EVERY time? it looked like they had mechanical wormholes to get from planet to planet so unless the fuel for that is spice which i dont think is how it works then idk what the point is

* and to that end, how is Paul gonna make Dune a paradise while not giving up spice and thus crippling everyone? i guess that's a big plot point for the next movie

* if the other houses aren't going to listen to him anyway, why still marry the Emperor's daughter? surely that would clear that problem from the table and he can go back to Chani while also then killing all the emperor's people for betraying his father. And is he not also the Harkkonen next in line with the 3 leaders gone and him the grandson? maybe there are others in line I guess but he has claim to at least two houses

* and to that end did ALL of the Atreides go to Dune? WHY? surely people were left behind on their homeworld at which point did Harkonnen attack that planet too? seems unfeasible. the same amount of unfeasible as bringing all of your nation's armaments to a foreign planet instead of leaving some nukes in your homeworld. how the heck were they even launching the nukes? why didnt they just nuke the emperor's ship besides having the cool worm scene? i guess so they could talk

* i remember in the old movie something about his name being a killword or something, which would cement the idea of people thinking he is a god but in this movie he doesn't really use the voice. the fanaticism of following him doesnt make sense to me considering that he seems to immediately throw away the initial wants of the fremen; why the heck would they follow him offworld? why the heck were they so quick to just raise this randomass flag they've never seen before to represent them? where did they even get all the flags, was Gurney (op has a typo, it says Hurney) storing them?

I understand the point is to show how crazy fanaticism is, but surely irl SOMEONE would hear what Zendaya was saying and connect the dots that it doesn't really benefit the Fremen to fight offworld, especially when Paul hadn't really done anything super godlike in the movie shown (there are some throwaway lines about him predicting the weather and his parlor trick of knowing people's past but all the bene gesserit seem to read people like that). Overall the movie was a better experience than the last one which was a bit slow, but yea you really have to suspend your beliefs about human nature, common sense, and the practicality of what amounts to sand as a fuel source (how the hell did they even get to Arrakis before they had discovered spice?)",2024-03-03
"Absolutely incredible movie. 

The only thing I don’t understand is Paul deciding to go through with everything. The entire first half of the movie he’s adamant that he doesn’t want to go south, he doesn’t want war, doesn’t want people to suffer. I understand how he turned after drinking the water of life but what lost me was why he decided to drink the water in the first place.",2024-03-04
"From a movie making perspective it was terrific. As someone who loves the books I thought Part I was a better adaptation. Part II was always going to be harder to adapt but there were changes I thought were unnecessary and poorly executed. People say this sets up a part III but given plot points that have been cut thus far I don’t see how adapting messiah/children without further moving away from the books will make sense. Still, phenomenal movie experience.",2024-03-04

"I liked the movie a lot, the pacing was a bit off at times, but the cinematography was gorgeous and the large scale of practically the whole film was impressive. 


Florence Pugh remains my favorite actress at the moment, no notes. Austin Butler deserves the hype he's getting, he nailed the role. The Dune 1 main cast was really good, but this felt like a film where all the big stars playing supporting roles helped a lot. 


I watched all of the best picture contenders for this year in theaters, and I honestly wonder how Dune 2 would've shook up the awards. Austin Butler could've gained supporting actor momentum, maybe they take the production or sound design awards. Just would've been a crazy packed year in some categories. ",2024-03-06
"Review:

I always viewed Dune as a terrible, dry, high-concept book that was used as a template for people who interpreted a better version out of it. I appreciate it for iconic imagery, worldbuilding, and its attempt at subert the fantasy tropes, but it had a terrible storytelling, full stop. Star Wars, Nausicaa, A Song of Ice and Fire, Pitch Black, The Incal, The Matrix, and even Avatar (yes, that Avatar) all feel like ""fixed versions"" of Dune.

In that sense, Denis' Dune Part Two joins that club. It is basically Dune if it were good.

Maybe I wasn't fond of Part One because it tried to be faithful to the source material. I appreciate the movie as a vibe piece, and the epic spectacle and vivid sensation sort of trick people into believing what they are watching is better than it really is.

If judged it as a story, its faithfulness to the book was poison. It is a hero's journey (I know the sequel book says it isn't, but judging the first one in isolation) in which the heroes are bores and don't make choices. It is messy and meandering. It focuses on such a nothing character like Paul instead of Duke Leto, who should have been the protagonist (it would be as if Game of Thrones Season 1's protagonist was not Ned, but Bran). Relies too heavily on ""prophecy"" ala the writer inserting his story notes through the fourth wall to contrive the characters into behaving the way they want, which is a storytelling sin. Lucas and the Wachowskis ripped this aspect off for their films and that's also what ruins their film.

The desert adventure in the latter half is a complete tone shift--all the plot momentum dies. The movie reboots itself again here into a different film. Having this journey in an already overstuffed movie also means the film cannot spare time to make these two characters suffer through the most oppressive climate imaginable. I never felt that the planet's heat was any danger to the characters. 

Part Two diverges quote a lot from the latter half of the book, in a way it fixes to make it... an actual story. It fixes most of my complaints with Part One. The plot is a lot more cohesive. There is a clear goal from the beginning to the end, and despite the slow pace, it keeps the momentum going. It tries to visualize what the book ""told"" the viewers. Arakkis actually feels dangerous, rather than just telling us it is dangerous. There are way more tensions and twist and turns. Alia's presence is way more terrifying as a fetus than a ridiculous ninja baby.

Paul is an actual character with his own agency. He actually gets to make his choices, in contrast to the book Paul, who basically rode where the plot went. Chani also gets to be her own character, and she actually has a chemistry now, whereas in the book she is his girlfriend just because. Jessica is also very proactive, instead of being reactive as she was in the book, and her manipulations are downright terrifying. Villneuve channels his inner Lynch in the Bene Gesserit scenes.

It gives the cast characterization they were missing from the book and Part One, while containing all the book's weirdness, thematic implications, and religious exploration. At times, I felt like I was watching some sort of biblical epic Hollywood used to produce in the 50s. Those massive budget three hour long religious epics that transported the audience into the sights they couldn't experience elsewhere? 

The story is still a lesser version of Laurence of Arabia. Some of the dialogues are hokey (the love confession before the marriage was a pure cringe), and I didn't buy Chani would kiss Paul at the first act. The Princess and her Bene Gesserit subplot feel more like a distraction from the main narrative (I like how the Syfy version handled the Princess character more). The heavy reliance of dream and ""foresight"" is still the narrative's weakness because it is such a fake way of driving a story. It seems no one but David Lynch knows how to make it work.

The nuke comes across as Deus Ex Machina.  It makes the climax too easy, almost like the victory was handed to the Fremens in one swipe, rather than a gradual strategical agglomeration in the course of war. They are capturing the literal Emperor of space. Harder the goal is, harder everything should be, but you don't get that difficulty at all. The Imperial and Hakonnen forces are all gathered here to protect the Emperor, but they didn't even try. After the worms attack, the next scene is Paul arriving at the throne room. It's sloppy. It doesn't feel like the Fremens are outsmarting the villains, but they won only because the villains were dumb.

With all that said, this is basically as good of an adaptation as this book can get. There is simply no big budget movie like this anymore. It puts the viewer into a different culture, in a different universe... I wasn't really mesmerized by the world Part One presented, but I was with the Fremen culture in Part Two. 

Even what could have been a throw-away scene like Feyd walking in a corridor with firecrackers shinning through the windows... that scene alone had more thoughts put into it than an entirety of a Marvel movie. It takes time and does its best to teleport the audience into some kind of religious experience--literally.  It has the sensitivity of an indie film with an auteur's specific vision, executed in a blockbuster resources and set-pieces.

8/10",2024-03-07
"This movie is still running through my mind, I don't know how I will be able to work today.

That said, I thought they hit the religious manipulation angle a little too hard. I was glad it was there since most adaptations don't really touch on it at all. (SyFy Dune mini-series)

And I was also disappointed that Alia wasn't in it, both because I always enjoyed her messing with the Reverend Mother and killing the Baron. But also because I find it hard to believe that the Atreides were wiped out, Paul finds the Freman, he is able to learn how to live the desert life and be accepted into their society, lead a guerrilla campaign that it eventually brings the Emperor to personally deal with the crisis, and win the throne; all inside of 9 month period? That's a bit of a stretch for me.",2024-03-07
"Just saw it. Loved it. I haven't read the books, so I am so excited to see where the story goes.

"Went to my 2nd viewing today. Twice in IMAX now. The film remains a delicious audio-visual feast from start to finish. So many jaw dropping images and sounds. Top notch cinematography and some of the best soundscapes/vfx shots I've ever heard/seen. One of my all-time favourite theatre experiences.


But in terms of storytelling and characters...it's not bad but it's not great either I'm afraid. I had most of my issues with:


- Paul's transition from reluctant hero to Messiah figure/Emperor was just so jarring to me. It didn't feel particularly convincing or well executed. I also don't know what to make of it. It felt like setup for the next part, so I don't know how to judge it yet. Could pay off hugely or not at all. I'm hoping for the first.


- the antagonists Feyd-Rautha and the Emperor. I've seen a lot of praise for Austin Butler, comparing him to some of the greates villains in movie history. Which I didn't see at all. It was by no means a bad performance. He did quite well with what he was given. But his role felt too familiar and to inconsequential to me to be up there with the greats. I haven't read the books but I feel like his character had so much potential in terms of being chaotic and unpredictable. But that wasn't really explored all that much. A lot of his threat came from other characters reacting to him or talking about him in a fearful or impressed way. Or him just murdering random servants every once in a while which got very boring very quickly. The makeup also did a lot of the heavy lifting to make him look weird and fucked up on the exterior. But on the interior he just felt so...empty? Or generic? I dunno. The film spent a good chunk of the runtime to establish him as the main antagonist but he never lived up to it. It was a solid performance but a flat, forgettable character. The conclusion of the final knife fight between him and Paul also felt lazy and anticlimactic. 


- Christopher Walken's Emperor was just a whole lot of nothing. I have no idea who this man is, what he wants, what he stands for. We know nothing about him. It's a wasted role, especially for such an iconic and esteemed actor as Walken. 


All in all, these criticisms of storytelling and characters don't hold that much weight for me because as I said it's not terribly bad. The visual and the excellent pacing make up a lot for it. Plus, Part 3 could retroactively absolve some of these criticisms for me. But for now, these points are what hold me back from calling Dune Part Two a masterpiece and what hold me back from fully jumping on the hype train.",2024-03-03
"Wow. Just came out from the theatres and my only regret is that I didn’t wait one more week to watch it in imax. 

I sincerely thought overtaking Oppenheimer as my favorite film would take decades but Dune Part 2 is a masterpiece. I’ve always been a big fan of soundtracks to the point that my friends laughed at my taste in music in high school, and yet again Hans Zimmer shows us again that he’s the GOAT. Combining his brilliance with the incorporating of the most beautiful instrument in the world, duduk, along with the Dune franchise. It doesn’t get any better really.

I watched the first part in a large group of people. Out of 10, I was a big fan, my brother didn’t hate it and the other didn’t like it. Two or three persons left the cinema. “It was too slow pace and boring and weird.” But my wife watched the first part yesterday for the first time and liked it very much, but I’ve reflected on that “slow paced” term that I’ve seen a lot of people expressing regarding the first movie. How? You can barely scratch your balls before something else happens, and it’s even faster paced in part two, whereas I think it should’ve been 20 to 30 minutes longer.",2024-03-05
"I've seen the movie twice now. I think both part one and part two are pretty equal in terms of individual quality. The first one has a strong start but slightly weak finish and the second one has a slightly weak start but super strong finish. I believe if you were to watch these both back-to-back it would make for one incredible sci fi movie.

&#x200B;

But lets not kid ourselves, its not a ""masterpiece"" (imo), it doesn't quite land an emotional punch or have the same level of heart that some of the best of all time have, but it is still incredible from a technical perspective, i feel like Denis pulled off the impossible of adapting this book into a movie that is accessible for everyone and does tell a legit fascinating story but at the end of the day its hard to call either of these movies ""best of all time"", maybe some of the best Science Fiction films of all time, but again thats mainly due to the script, acting and production design. Still, very much impressed with both films. Individually I'd give part 1 an 8/10 and part 2 an 8.5/10 but I think together seen as one they would be a 9/10 for me",2024-03-06

"You could definitely see why the early reviews were raving Butler and Chalamet. Butler acted like an animal and you would've never guessed he played the charismatic Elvis just one year earlier.

Chalamet's Paul was wonderfully tender in the first half, but he definitely was able to deliver on the authoritarian and messianic aura in the second half after he awoken as the Lisan Al-Gaib.

The movie was surprisingly funny and the audience in my Theatre got a bunch of laughs from Javier Bardem's delivery and the dialogie from the Southern religious fundamentalists.

Absolute 10/10 movie and Villenueve stuck the landing for Part 2.",2024-03-01

Every piece of this movie doubled down from Part One. Even my man Hans—that score!,2024-03-02
"It's not widely known so I wanted to point out that Feyd-Rautha (ritually?) kissing his uncle fits into the general ancient Roman coding that their culture has going on (what with colosseum fights, slavery, general blood thirst).

The Romans had a tradition called osculum (kiss, or ius osculi meaning right to a kiss) whereby a male relative up to a certain degree had the right to greet a female relative with a chaste kiss on the lips. This could have had a number of different functions, including an assertion of dominance over the women in the family.

I feel like the kiss in the movie could be a nod to that tradition, because even if the participants were two men it served to underline a certain familial power dynamic.

EDIT: I JUST REMEMBERED SOMETHING. In the early Roman Empire there was a rumor that Agrippina would often call upon this custom to kiss her UNCLE emperor Claudius. Whom she later scandalously married.

edit edit: Agrippina then made Claudius adopt her own son, who would become emperor Nero. You may remember him as the psycho emperor who set fire to his own city (not true). He definitely inspired the characterization of Feyd-Rautha",2024-03-03

…Or am I living in a dimension that split off in the middle of that scene?",2024-03-07
"Movie only watcher. What an insane experience, every shot is so massive. The riding the worm scene was so powerful, the tension was palpable. Really liked it but i was kinda lost at the sudden change in Paul's personality, was it the water? I did not get that part. First time watching i rate it an 8/10.",2024-03-13
"Can’t tell if I liked it yet. The first one had much more heart and character connectedness. The first felt like it had the perfect cast and I feel like Oscar Isaac and Jason Momoa were sorely missed here. Austin Butler was underused. Maybe this is the sequel where everyone loses their way a bit but I found myself not really attached to or liking anyone except Zendaya. Which may have been the intention judging by the final scene. It did a good job of making me want part three but I’m just not sure I enjoyed this like I did part one. Then again I enjoyed part one far more on second watch so I’m going to catch this again in imax next time. 

Also did we ever see the army from part one with the throat singer and the thousands of human sacrifices??",2024-03-03
"i liked it but felt annoyed with how little screentime there was to the actual plot moving forward of paul's holy war. felt like a slog and by the time we get to the big ending battle, it's over in 5 minutes and just feels so underwhelming. do we really need 40 minutes of wide angle shots and people silently staring at eachother or slow motion walking?",2024-03-06
"Part II felt a bit weird to me, but I may come around on a 2nd viewing (happened with Part I).

Many parts felt kinda wrong. It's been a while since I read the book, but I don't think this is how Paul's arc quite went and Chani's reactions didn't seem quite right, Stilgar wasn't that silly, I was really looking forward to Alita doing her thing vs the baron and that was a nope. Where was the spacing guild?

And I'm just never gonna be sold on Villeneuve's Harkonnens.

"Is this movie actually this good? I remember people saying the first one was good, but it was boring",2024-03-02
"Overall it's a great movie, probably more enjoyable than Part I, but it seems so rushed despite the long runtime.  Like they just completely gloss over so much, and the majority of the movie really is just people sitting in desert caves explaining the plot.  Somehow it works, though.  

It would have probably made a great TV series, but then you probably wouldn't have the same budget, cast and crew.",2024-03-04
"started strong. nice visuals. eventually i got tired of so many locations just being absolutely massive structures with almost no decoration, whether it's on arrakis, giedi primus or wherever. 

i am really disappointed with all the deviations and omissions from the books tho. wheres thufir hawat? why have the emperor spout dumb shit like ""leto ruled with his heart, that means he was weak"" etc.? and if so, how does appointing him duke of arrakis and then killing him help with that? why change pauls plan for destroying the spice to setting off nukes above the deposits? 

the second half of dune part 2 was really disappointing. as if they just couldnt be bothered anymore and just halfarsed it. it's pretty sad that this is the dune part 2 we have to live with now.

not a bad movie. but i had expectations, so it's a disappointing movie",2024-03-04
"I give it a 8.7

Liked the first one bit more although this one definitely expands on more things. Feyd was great but wish we saw more. Think the guy had maybe a total of 5 minutes of screen time and many are saying best villain since Heath Ledgers Joker? No chance.

One of the most stacked casts I've seen in some time and everyone was perfect. Some of Javier Bardems comedic lines felt slightly out of place but it somewhat worked.

Visuals were amazing but CGI was slightly underwhelming at times. Honestly not quite as much action as I expected. Couple worm riding scenes, ornithopter/spice harvester scene, feyd gladiator scene, feyd final fight and the end giant battle. But all those take up maybe 20-30 minutes of screen time out of 165 minutes. 

Don't get me wrong it was an amazing film and I'll rewatch it but I don't think it warrants a 10 and there's a handful of other Sci fi movies I prefer, including the first part.",2024-03-01

"Still prefer DUNE 1984, at the end of the day - who's with me?",2024-03-02
"I’m mixed on the first one. I do not love the first one as everyone seems to. I think it takes too long to get anywhere. It has MASSIVE Part 1 Syndrome. And (probably controversial) I think Timothee Chalamet ruins that movie. He makes Paul come across as flat and boring and makes it hard for me to be compelled by his journey. So I went into this is fairly lower expectations than everyone else. 

This movie was like a religious experience. Every SINGLE issue I had with the first one was non existent. This was one of the most satisfying theater experiences of my entire life. 

This must’ve been how it felt watching the original Star Wars trilogy or The Lord of the Rings in theaters for the first time. 

Holy shit",2024-03-01
"Just came out of the theatre. I can honestly say that was the closest I've come to having a religious experience, my god what a film.

DUNE: PART 2 

movie review

Just like the first part, it's absolutely gorgeous. There's so many unique looking things in it, like the bits on Giedi Prime, and some of the bits in the third act. Just like the first part, the music and sound design is amazing. Just like in the first part, the acting is great.

But that's sort of exactly what the movie is: the second part to the first part. Which is fine because that's exatly what it is, but at the same time it feels like it could have been more? Having read the book, they hit the marks they need to hit, and end the movie as the book ends. But it sort of feels like the entire thing needed a bit more space to breathe. 

Obviously we're headed for Dune: Messiah if the powers that be agree on it, and I'm looking forward to it... But this almost feels like the movies should be watched back to back. And if and when a third one get made, that should be added to the marathon.

tl;dr it's good but sort of leaves you craving for more 8/10",2024-03-01
"maybe this is easier to see in the book, so i’m hoping somebody can explain to me. obviously paul is now drinking his own kool aid and is on a dangerous self-righteous path. however I don’t know what he could have done differently that still would have led to fremen liberation. was there a middle ground option between “stay in the north and cede arrakis to the harkonnens” and “embrace messiah status and gun for the emperor’s seat”?",2024-03-01
"Awesome thread, just have a few questions about the movie:

1. Where did Paul’s goggles come from when he jumped on the worm? He didn’t have them on before jumping and I doubt he was able to put them on while holding on for his life, but he’s the messiah after all.

2. I would remember if I reread the books, but I can’t do that right now. On the scene where Alia speaks to Paul, she lets a tear out. Is she crying for the dead (Paul)? I believe Paul’s journey ends in Dune Messiah.

Incredible movie. So many amazing moments. Had two questions though if someone wouldn’t mind answering: 

1. Paul seems really against/reluctant being portrayed as the savior for half the movie. But then he does decide to go south, drink the blue liquid, and become the messiah figure they were promised. Why did he change his mind? He saw all the deaths, the holy war, etc. What makes him REALLY lean into it like he does. Is it just to get the fremen’s help? So he can get revenge for his House? 

2. And what does his mother get out of all this? She’s now the Reverend Mother and clearly spreads the rumors that Paul is the ONE they were promised. Then the end she tells his sister he’s starting the war against the houses. What does she have to gain? Why has she put this in motion?

1. Why was Chani's friend left back in the freman's caves, intentionally or she was captured?
2. Why (simplistically, movie only) does Paul have his heel turn?  The WOL basically just turns Jessica evil, does it just turn him evil too?  Or does it give him such a surge of power and vision he's like I must be the messiah because I have so much power?  Like what is his reasoning?

"Just left my 2nd viewing. Wish we had more space scenes, the ones from part one were gorgeous. Even though it wasnt my first watch I was holding my breath the entire final duel. Whew. The whole Giedi Prime sequence was fucking immaculate. Those “fireworks” and the scenes showing their military might was an excellent experience to see on IMAX. The scene where Paul does his first worm ride was also sublime. The views from where Paul was standing were breathtaking. I found myself at the edge of my seat the entire ride. Absolutely thrilling. I also loved the Emperor’s ship flying through Arakeeen. It’s tough, I felt the same way about Part one as I do part two, like some parts felt rushed while some felt drawn out. Pacing effectively in a dense story such as Dune is near impossible though. I’d give anything for a couple of 3.5 hour movies. Stellar movie. Chalamet was phenomenal especially in the second half.

I know he was there when the baron was knocked over and he was still on the ground when Paul stormed the room so not much time had to have passed. How did he get from the throne room to all the way outside to he killed by gurney?,2024-03-08

I thought it was a little slow to start and then was convinced the movie was cliffhanger us with the final siege (I didn’t read the book).

"Why does Paul change his mind and fulfill the prophecy if he thinks it's going to lead to billions of deaths? 

Also, I quite like the idea of Chani leading a rebellion. As she seemed like the only character you could reason with or relate to.

"*TLDR: Did anyone think the oil bath discussion in Dune Part 2 between Rabban and Baron Harkonnen was an identical shot to Dune Part 1?*

In Dune Part 1, there is a scene where Baron Harkonnen is in his oil bath talking to Rabban. When Rabban asks what to do about the Fremen, he responds, ""Kill them all,"" before going ""underwater."" We do not see him say ""kill them all"" but instead hear the words as the scene is shot from the back of Baron's head. 

In Dune Part 2, there is a similar scene where Baron talks to Rabban in the oil bath. Baron again ends the conversation by going ""underwater"" with the camera facing the front of Baron's face instead. I could've sworn I saw Baron mouth ""kill them all"" in the shot, even though his dialogue in the scene had already ended. It seemed like a re-used shot from Dune 1, just from another angle. 

I'm wondering if I hallucinated this since I haven't seen anyone mention it. The craziest thing was that when I mentioned this duplicate scene to my partner after the movie, they had noticed the same thing! (We'd been re-watching Dune Part 1 the day before, so we were well-trained to catch this if it was actually what happened.",2024-03-11
"I really loved how well they portrayed the scale of things and moments. That one shot of the emperors discoball of the ship landing and the scenery being reflected in it was stunning. Another is when the boulders started to come down on the soldiers. This one is more about the scale in the opposite direction, it was that scene where Paul talks about the different futures he sees and theres one very narrow one where they win. It's essentially the moment he accepts to play the role he's been avoiding. This prophet. This messiah who will take them to paradise. But all we see is his hand as he speaks. That was beautiful to me. He's still just a man doing what needs to be done. Playing the game.",2024-03-12

"I loved what Denis did with Dune.

I read the first book and to paraphrase Shut&Sitdowngames “you only have the read the first half”

And I felt that when reading the book. The first half was the most intriguing, interesting, and genuinely fascinating part of the book. Then the second half just happened. Like really fast making the ending feeling abrupt.

But thats not the case with movies. If felt like Dennis reshuffle events, cut parts, and the best he did was add in segments to flush the culture, the freeman, the battle strategy of the ending and most of all Channi.

In the book it felt like she was just a love interest and thats it, but in the movie she is her own person with her own beliefs, ideas, and views about the Freeman and the liberation of Arrakis.

Denis’ Dun reversed how I felt about the book, where Part 1 felt slow and meticulous, Part 2 was action packed, alive, and really felt like you were seeing a major change in history unfold.

I loved his take and it makes really desperate to see his take on Messiah and the rest of the series. Like an addict craving another hit.",2024-03-23
Did it not bother Paul how his mother kinda became insane after she drank the holy water?,2024-03-27

Was worried about my mum, who I was seeing it with, would hate it as she's not a fan of longer films (always falls asleep) and doesn't remember anything from the first dune, but she actually really enjoyed it! (Fell asleep for a little bit during the final battle, though)

The only thing that I didn't get was how did Paul know where and how to get the water of life/poison? Just his visions? I must've missed that detail",2024-03-29
"Amazing movie. I’m glad I caught it in theatres. 

Thinking about how Stilgar and the fundamentalists were so able to quickly justify Paul’s actions as being part of the prophecy, it only dawned on me, after the movie was done, how easily I’d believed the idea that there was only one narrow path for Paul after he drank the water of life, regardless of whether or not it was true—how susceptible I’d been to take what was being told to me at face value.",2024-03-30

"This movie looked stunning. The score was especially stunning. Actors and action sequences ARE good. Plot and dialogue were next to non existent. This movie was a snooze fest and overall, did unfortunately suck. Like really how can you be entertained by 80% of what you saw? You must be lying. There's no way there's any deeper plot that I'm missing, the story and script were DEAD. Help me out here anyone?",2024-04-05

"I can’t quite put my finger on it, but for me it didn’t achieve the cohesive brilliance of the first movie, don’t get me wrong many sublime moments, score was great; but it was almost a homage to the first, didn’t bring anything new. 

Some moments 5/5, majority 3/5, Christopher Walken 5/5 for being Christopher Walken but 0/5 for actually acting. Mind you maybe I was just in a crappy mood that day. As a lover of epic sci fi cinema I want this to do well. ",2024-03-03
I think I liked Part 1 more just for how amazing it was at establishing these visuals and characters and world. I felt like I hadn’t seen anything like it ever before. This was good but didn’t “wow” me in that sense (but that’s just the nature of it being a sequel I suppose),2024-03-03
"Well, they somehow managed to make it feel rushed. The point starting from when Paul was told to cross the desert to prove himself was when the pacing got away from Dennis. We go from Chani seemingly teaching Paul in the middle of the walk to.. it already being done. Stilgar's warning about desert Djinns turned into a non sequitor and Paul had a rocky montage that made him somehow a de facto leader of Siech Tabr.

Not a fan of that entire section.

Geidi Prime got us back on track. Feyd-Rautha, missing from the first film, shows up spectacularly and we finally get the bloodline mixing storyline. I do have to say, the knife-fighting scenes absolutely slayed. There were cuts, but not the rapid fire cuts that seem to be popular nowadays. We got to see some actual choreography and damn did it look good.

Then we're back to being semi-rushed with Paul's war in the North, which I do not think was done well at all. We're now at the point where Chani suddenly doesn't love Paul anymore and Paul simply decides to go through with the grand plan. Oh well.

It was kind of strange to me how the Battle of Arakeen felt like it was almost skipped. We had a battle plan that never really happened. We got our atomic strike on the Shield Wall and the wurm rush but then... the battle was just kinda done. Oh well. At least what we got looked cool.

Overall, visually stunning as expected. Dennis missed the mark on the plot and pacing by a fair margin, and I still can't believe we haven't gotten any Spacing Guild scenes. The spice isn't really shown as being important - we're told it is, so it must be. I think a demonstration of exactly why the Navigators are required with spice would have been a fantastic way to really sell the importance of the spice and the planet. And how the hell has nobody said ""the spice must flow"" yet? That's the actual blasphemy.

Overall, I think metacritic's score is about right. The flaws are overshadowed by how cool it was to look at. Definitely a worthy theatre experience.",2024-03-07
"Glad I held off on watching Part One all this time, and got to see it on the big screen for a double feature. 

Incredible looking movies and absolute peak sci-fi. Instant modern classics. 

I felt the editing in Part Two was much better than first, which I felt jumped around quite a lot. Understandable as there was a lot of ground to cover but I felt like the pacing suffered a bit. Part Two was much better in that regard.

And whilst this whole thread is full of just praise there's a couple of things I'm somewhat irked by. So much emphasis is put on how harsh Arrakis is during the day, yet everyone's always just standing there, direct in the sun, chilling. I always have an issue with people just being in direct sunlight in movies/tv because I'm Aussie, but still. I'm supposing their suits just regulate temperature fine, but there will still be a line like 'sun will be up soon, we should move'. 

The other thing we're also warned about is how intense the dust storms are, and how they can tear apart metal. We see that happen when Paul and Jessica are flying through one. Yet the Fremen are somehow just fine riding on the back of worms, covered by just cloth and little huts, going through the storms on the way South.

Anyway, small irks. These movies are fantastic and I hope there will be a third.

Also for a horror fan like myself, I was really pleasantly surprised with the amount of horror and creepy there is in these movies. Wasn't expecting that.",2024-03-01

"Unpopular opinion: The movie is such a better product than the novel. In general, I like the idea of the writer: a planet that is actually a desert, the magical aspects combined with galaxy war and all, but reading the book is a pain in the ass. the writing style is dull, conversations are sometime stupid and pretending to be deep and dangerous, and characters are too many and hence, most of them not really well built.",2024-03-03
"Good to great movie, not fantastic. I think I prefer the first one, even with its veeery slow pace at times, simply because the world and universe felt grander; this one felt hamstrung by the fact it was part 2 of something.
Comparing it to LotR is waay too far.",2024-03-03
"I feel like I may be the only person in the world that this series doesn't work for. It looks incredible, with an epic sense of scale, but I feel like all of the characters are dangerously underwritten to a point where their motivations become almost impossible to track, and that's the most important part of a story for me. Genuinely happy for everyone who's having such a transcendent time with this, though.",2024-03-07

"So… the movie was beautiful and I liked the added conflict within the fremen and the fundamentalists, but the movie itself wasn’t told in a very organic way. It just seemed like the director was like “okay this is the lady Jessica water of life scene” “now here is the Paul learning to ride a sand worm scene” etc etc. And the Harkonnen killing people randomly was supposed to show them as being scary but other than the screaming girls that the Baron killed, all the other senseless death scenes seemed silly. 

Maybe I’ve read the books too many times and seen the Lynch movie too many times, but the way this story was told was just blah to me. I am glad they didn’t try and get a kid actor to be his sister, because that wouldn’t have worked.",2024-03-04

Full disclosure, I’m a newbie and only came to Dune/Herbert once Villeneuve and Chalamet were announced for this project. I did my homework, read and listened to the books in prep. Part 1 was amazing of course. Part 2 mind blowing. Last night was the first time I ever experienced a sold out theater.

People seemed to enjoy the comedic relief of Stilgar but I didn't love it. This fanaticism is supposed to be so great it swallows the universe.

"Incredible movie. Can't wait to watch it again because to be honest I couldn't understand half the dialogue. So much whispering and mumbling. I may even watch an open subtitles screening.

My biggest criticism of this movie is that it didn't really show Paul's emboldening impact on the group enough. What couldn't they have done without Paul really? Paul told Gurney they were running low on firearms but we just saw scene after scene of them doing just fine on that part. Not too huge a deal but it made the movie a 9. But as I said I couldn't understand half the dialogue so it could've been explained lmao.

However, a disappointing adaptation if you’re a fan of the book. So many subplots missing. Many of the characters and their motivations are dramatically simplified. And the idea of “plans within plans” is lost here.

Paul’s descent to fulfilling the prophecy was much more interesting in the books, because Paul was constantly conflicted between honing and controlling his powers and realising what having these powers meant in the grand scale of things (The Golden Path). Jessica also was way more interesting in the book because of the guilt she felt poisoning Alia and also forcing the prophecy onto Paul.

Also minor nitpick, Princess Irulan and Feyd probably could have been introduced in the first film.

Like we're made to believe that all the signs pointing to Paul being Lisan al Gaib were made up to allow him and his mom to manipulate people, which I get, but he actually does see visions and Jessica actually does think he's the one. So was it not a fake religion? And if the Fremen were just being manipulated how did the water of life play into it cuz that seemed very real and gave both of them real insight/powers.",2024-03-02

Sequences were weirdly edited and ended so abruptly and it was really hard to grasp how much time was supposed to be passing between each scene.

In terms of cinematography and score it was beautiful though.",2024-03-03

But what if I consult Jamis through this rock.  

Jamis: go south  

Paul:  ok  

That was one of the sillier parts to me, the experience itself was amazing tho. I think it is in dire need of a director’s cut to flesh out some scenes, like Paul drinking the water of life, or his decision to marry Irulan. ",2024-03-04
"Oh finally I can open twitter; my feed was filled with dune references even though I had muted every word associated with it. Fuck you letterbox review images.

Coming to the film, I don’t understand why people are surprised to see Paul marrying the Princess, that was very predictable. 

Some people have said they liked the soundtrack better in dune 1 which I sorta agree with but it was still good. There were few moments when it felt like our seats were shaking; that’s definitely good.


While watching the movie I was confused why everyone had come to Dune but someone has cleared that in comments here, so thank you.
Austin Butler was great in this one; probably the highlight performance. 

Highlight scenes for me were-

The worm riding

Giedi Prime 

Paul after drinking the poison/that meeting 

The reveal (although it wasn’t dramatised, which I liked)

The final duel, the entire scene there tbh, specifically from the crawling of Baron

One question- I couldn’t really tell who was the woman leading Paul in his dreams, was it the Princess or was it Jessica?",2024-03-04

"I see a lot of people comparing this to LOTR or Empire strikes back... and most people even if they like Dune, they say things like ""almost comparing to Empire strikes back"".

Now I enjoy star wars but did we watch the same films? I do like Star Wars but for me Dune is way beyond that. It evokes conversation on a totally different level and hits so much deeper.

I think LOTR is in some ways ""complete"" as an adaptation. What I mean is, I could see someone down the line making a Dune adaptation that is worth making - Villeneuve chose a clear thing to focus on (religion/messiah aspect) and left the rest out, which I thought worked brilliantly. But it leaves room for other adaptations. However, I don't see that we're gonna see a LOTR remake that would be considered worth making even 10, maybe 20 years from now - which would be 40 years after LOTR was made. It's the definitive version, which is crazy. But Villeneuve's Dune's did something different than LOTR, I don't think it's a good comparison to think LOTR is simply ""above"" Dune as cinema, for me it isn't.",2024-03-04

"I just watched the movie, and i must say i thoroughly enjoyed it. Being almost three hours long, i thought it would be very boring in long parts, but to my surprise it was very well paced. You really dont even notuce that its an almost three hour long movie.

The acting from everyone eas really good. For me, the best performance was from Jarvier Bordem, he was so enjoyable to watch. Another really good performace was from the young villian, he reall felt like a formiddable villian. 

I just have a few questions thiygh that im hoping someone will be able to answer.

1) What is the importance of spice in the Dune universe, and not something like water? Why is it so valuable that they want to mine, and risjk thier people bing eaten by the giant worms? 

2) Why do the mian characters have the tube things in thier noses, and not everyone else? What is the purpose of the tubes, why do they need them, and the others dont.",2024-03-07
"Just like Part 1, Villeneuve did a *fantastic* job condensing the thick, abundant and nuanced concepts from the books onto screen, much more effectively than Lynch.  Especially when considering that this whole film is basically contained in the last 1/3rd of Lynch's film, lol.  Villeneuve put A LOT of time in the process of Paul winning over the Fremen, which iirc was sort of glossed over in the novel anyways, and was like a ten second voice over in Lynch's film too!  And rightfully so, that is an extremely import thing to make this fantasy film more realistic, right?  An outsider just coming in and sweeping up the Fremen into a Holy War?  And lots of attention was given to that, which I think was a criticism of the original novel (The White Savior complex).  So I like how that was addressed without really changing anything; it was just another added dimension.  



Also, the changes he made to the source material were, like Part 1, really handled carefully and always meant to invoke the spirit and nuances of the novel-- and in many cases, were basically to setting up plot and development for his eventual Part 3 (Dune Messiah, clearly)--  specifically creating this rivalry between Chani and Irulian.  Which, I gotta say, Zendaya and Florence Pugh make a GREAT nemesis, from even the one scene they're in together.  Can't wait!!!!  



Speaking of, I LOVE Villeneuve's tip of the hat to the novel, with Florence Pugh's dictation in some of the scenes.  Felt like an Easter egg for superfans!!!  And Zendaya is GREAT in this.  Obviously, they really tried hard to put her in the first film because she doesn't really appear until this half of novel #1 (lol), but she's great here.  In Part 1, she's basically a goal for Paul to achieve; here, she's a full-fledged character with her own motivations, convictions and dilemma.  That in itself, I love her moral dilemma with the prophesies, which iirc was *not* in the original novels, right?  I think that becomes something relatable to the audience, a critique of the Bene Gesserit.



I wasn't super convinced of Christopher Walken as the Emperor, but, hey, it's Christopher Walken, so I'll take him!  
Javier Bardem is GREAT as Stilgar, and is like the only brevity in the movie, lol.  I LOVE this guy.  



The rumors were true and Ana Taylor Joy as Alia Atreides is FUCKING PERFECT... but don't get your hopes up for seeing her for more than ten seconds, lol (which, if you've read Dune or at least seen Lynch's, you'd know).  St. Alia of The Knife is probably my favorite Dune character, so I'll just be hyped for Part 3, and they actually started to develop her character in a new/different way here, which I rather liked.  Villeneuve was good at giving these characters *more* to do than in the books.  So yeah, wish there was more St. Alia, but I guess good things come to those who wait.  If there is ever a fourth film (covering Children of Dune), she will be INSANELY AWESOME.  
The only two things I was let down with was the lack of Thufir... but I I read all his scenes were indeed filmed, but were cut from the movie because of time constraints, which is reasonable (it's still a long movie).  Also, I REALLY wanted to see some Guild Navigators, but alas, it wasn't meant to be.  But I guess Villeneuve can't put too much in one movie.  It seems he's been pacing it out a bit, each film sort of lets you see more of the outer galaxy (kinda like the novels, really), and maybe he's just saving the Spacing Guild for the third film.   



Another thing I love that Villeneuve has done was make this movie so inexplicably *strange*.  Like, these details that are so very foreign, really help make this vision of the future so bizarre (also something Lynch did, but Villeneuve does it in a more grounded way).  For instance, the *sound* of the Harkonnen gunfire is this weird, guttural thump that I've never heard before; why can't it sound like that?  He made familiar things intentionally unfamiliar, to make them in effect more distant, exotic and frankly dystopian, because the world of Dune is just that.  These characters don't live in a paradise, and I think that was what Frank Herbert's point was; it's sort an archaic future, right?  Humanity itself was redefined and the characters are constantly searching for it.",2024-03-07
"_if you can't be the best, be the worst_",2024-03-07
The fremen use human shields so there will inevitably be civilian casualties and Governor Feyd can't let them get away with shooting at civilian spice transports so the special military operation to destroy their terror tunnels and underground bases is justified under international law.

1) why did that one girl stay behind to get torched??? What was the point of her staying?

2) how did the bad guys know where the fremen peoples home was which they bombed? They had never located it before

"Just saw it on IMAX 70MM. Two things:

1. Wow! Timmy is the fucking man. When he gave that speech in the circle I was ready to go! I just have to watch it in theaters again.

2. I'm disappointed with IMAX. While the sound was great and the big screen was nice, I was disappointed in the actual picture quality. Maybe I expected more in terms of design. I think the picture would be better in Dolby. 70MM screen is nice but the seats are too close and I'm not a fan of theaters where you have to look up to watch the movie even when you're sitting in the upper rows. Movie screens should be eye level. Too close and it ruins the picture, it's like sitting close to the TV at home when you're watching an epic sci-fi movie.

Overall, I'm pumped and I hope they make Part 3.",2024-03-17
But but but..... the baby sandworm death was not nice. 😪,2024-03-17

"I liked both Dune parts but I think what puts me off  is that I feel they both suffer from a lack of character development. I just don't care enough about everyone involved in the story. I'm not sure why - maybe it's because the characters aren't likeable or there is not enough interpersonal dialogue relating to the thoughts of the characters themselves instead of what's going on in the world around then. It leads me to feel like in the third act of this movie I am watching an incredible visual spectacle, but while I'm seeing all these major events occur, I feel like i am admiring the cinematography and visuals more than that I actually care about what I am seeing.

Also, more of a side tangent - I imagine a lot of the technical details are explained in the books but I kept on wondering how certain things in the world actually worked:

* How did they get so many people on and off the sandworms (because it seems like it's really hard to get on it in the first place),

- How come the flechette-like turret in the copter during one of the crawler attacks is not used everywhere else, because it seemed to be pretty damn effective against large groups of Fremen or shield-less enemies

* In a similar vein, what weapon were the Fremen using to kill the Harkonnen from range during the intro battle when they are on top of the rock formation and why don't they use that more often?",2024-03-27
"Just watched the film and absolutely loved it!

Things I liked; 

Some of my favourite aspects were the performances. Chalamet absolutely kills it! The scene where he declares himself the Duke of Arrakis was legendary. He was absolutely perfect for the role. Javier Braden was amazing as Stilgar. With a surprising amount of comedy relief at times. Austin Butler really surprised me as well, he really leaned into it.

The score and music were some of the best I’ve ever scene. The music when Paul arrives in the south or when he rides the work were perfect.

The visuals on Guedi prime were stunning. The black sun contrasted with the white was a sight to behold. The visuals were unmatched. 

Thing that could have been better.

Bautista gets really sidelined for Rautha to take his place. 

The biggest gripe for me might be unpopular, but the editing could have been a bit better. I’m confident there’s an extended version with Jessica spreading the religion, more with Florence Pugh and the empires, and just more with Rautha and the Harkonens. No doubt it’s hard to include everything, but I thought some characters were underused. I felt that Zendaya and her character were given a lot of screen time that could have gone to others.

Overall fantastic film. 9.5/10",2024-03-01
Now thats pod racing,2024-03-01
Saw it yesterday. I enjoyed the spectacle of it and in general loved the cinematography. The pacing felt off and it definitely felt like some of the characters were shoved in. Also anyone else just not buying the two main leads acting? They seem mediocre to me especially the parts when they shout and try to show emotion. Still love anything Villeneuve puts tho,2024-03-04
"6/10

Just saw it this afternoon. I've watched part 1 six times but I was really disappointment and underwhelmed by part 2. I don't really even feel inspired to watch it again. Lots of things were well done but the screenplay, the choice of what to show and the scope of attention on details seemed misplaced and unconvincing compared to even part 1. I just didn't feel any of what it felt like they were trying to make me feel thru the art direction. It felt like a miniseries crammed into a movie format.",2024-03-20
"I can’t believe this movie has an 8.8 on IMDb and people are unironically comparing this to LoTR and Star Wars lmao. A 6/10 movie at best. Visuals were great but that’s about it. This movie will be forgotten once the initial hype dies down. 

Zendaya cannot act. Chalamet was just okay. The supporting characters were better. The final battle was also an absolute letdown - hell the third act as a whole felt like a mess. Maybe I bought into the hype too much but I cannot for the life of me understand how people are ranking this movie so high. Different strokes, I guess.",2024-03-23
"Loved the effects, sound design and cinematography, any scene with Austin Butler was a standout and the infrared scene was the highlight of the movie for me, but did anyone else find the story to be a little weak? It's based on such a well regarded book so I'm wondering did they cut things out or do I just have bad taste? Timothee Chalmet's acting wasn't great in my opinion and Zendaya's acting was pretty bad. Liked it overall though.",2024-03-01
"I gotta say, as someone who hasn't read the books and is experiencing this whole story for the first time through these films... Paul really pissed me off in the latter half of this movie. Stop trying to being so goddamn power-hungry, Paul! You're pushing Zendaya away!",2024-03-02
Am.i the only one who really thinks they went to far from the book?,2024-03-02
I really liked it but there were certain changes from the book that did leave a sour taste in my mouth. I do not expect 1 to 1s and it’s still a fantastic movie but Alia not being born and creeping everyone out was a real let down. Her killing Baron is one of my fave scenes in the book. I also really don’t like not having Leto 1 being born and Paul’s total disregard for Chani really was upsetting. Outside of that a solid 9/10 movie.,2024-03-02
"Just saw Dune Part 2. Came here to see reaction. It's been years since I read the books. The books I vaguely remember thinking the last two written by Frank's son based on his notes were a little over-the-top plot-wise with like eight clones of everyone constantly popping up. This movie I kind of have the opposite reaction. I'm a big character dialogue fan, and also a big political intrigue fan (so Game of Thrones/House of the Dragon is very much the gold standard for my tastes in recent fantasy TV/movies). This Dune movie just didn't feel like it had much of that. We didn't get a feel of scheming and plotting, it was all very paint-by-numbers pure action with dramatic landscape shots. So I need to go back and read the original book and see if that's a problem with the novel or just the movie.",2024-03-03
"Absolutely incredible experience in theaters, this is one of those movies that I just couldn't imagine watching at home. It just wouldn't be anywhere close to the same impact. Loved the visuals, loved the sound design, just great production all around. There was also a lot of interesting setup, hopefully the third movie ends up bringing it all together.

My only complaint would be just how some scenes were handled. I haven't read the novel, but I couldn't shake off this feeling that some characters or scenes felt kind of inconsistent with how they were being developed. Stuff like Stilgar becoming almost cartoonish comic relief, the deaths of the Harkonnens being pretty underwhelming, and Paul's decision to just immediately go to war.",2024-03-03
"Did anyone else have a problem with the editing at all? Paul walks out into the desert about to do is 40 days/40 nights. Chani seemingly can’t stand him, walks out with him. We are told about ghosts and whatnot and boom suddenly a battle. What?!",2024-03-03
"I know Im going against the current here but here it goes. I read Dune back in the late 70s, read most of Herbert's original follow ups ( but not those released posthumously by his son ).

I actually thought the first movie was better and was tighter. The second movie was a LOT of scenery and style but short on substance and actual dialogue.

&#x200B;

My 2 biggest gripes with Dune Part 2:

1. The Hollywood cliche about adding conflict between core characters ( ie, Paul vs  Jessica was overblown, and Paul vs Chani at the end was unnecessary ) Every director who brings a VERY popular book to screen always succumbs to the desire to ""spice it up"" LOTR is another example.
2.  Time- The events of Dune the novel span over 4 years, while the movie events take about 8 months. A few subtitles ( already plenty ) could have portrayed some passage of time.

Overall I enjoyed it quite a bit , just annoyed at the needless conflict added.",2024-03-05

"A 7 or 8/10. The cinematography was incredible, as was the score. Truly elevated the film. The dialogue was weak throughout. Autin Butler was brilliant, among a couple others. The first 20-30 minutes were slow, and then the end picked up things massively. Maybe a bit rushed, like Rogue Ones ending. 

I found all the ""he's the Messiah"" stuff incredibly cringe and not worthy of the few laughs it got in my packed IMAX theatre.",2024-03-03
"Wow, so much to process. It was certainly brilliant, engrossing, heavy, and all around epic. Beautifully shot, scored, and acted. But I'm also left with questions and thoughts, as a non-book reader:

-What is the balance between how much prophecy was true vs. Bene Gesserit propaganda? So much of the prophecy seemed to be played-along-to lies, but then suddenly magical worm juice showed up out of nowhere that (at times) seemed to have real effect on the outcome of things. Then there's the fact it was suddenly revealed that Chani's Fremen name had been part of the prophecy all long, but you'd think that would've been noted sooner when she and Paul first showed interest in each other - and what are the odds of her having that name in the first place if it's all just Bene Gesserit planning?

-More on the worm juice/poison - it seemed to totally overtake Jessica (and her child) into being devout to the prophecy, but Jessica also seemed to still be aware of the Bene Gesserit's manipulation over the centuries. Meanwhile, Paul drank the poison and became much more dictator-like at times, but then other times seemed more like his old self like nothing changed at all. So, what did the worm poison do exactly? It seemed like an out-of-nowhere plot device that had an unclear effect on two key characters. I’d also heard whispers of Paul’s descent into dictatorship and had hoped that would’ve had more motivation than “I drank dead worm juice and got more angry”.

-Did Paul ever tell Chani that he dreamed of her before they ever met? Just curious. When they first crossed paths in Part One, I was hoping he'd make a bigger deal out of meeting the girl from his visions, but of course there were more pressing matters at hand.

-More a critique than a question, but the first half of the film was so focussed on Paul's training on Arrakis that I found myself missing the bigger picture of the galaxy and its Houses/politics. But then when we finally re-entered the bigger picture in the second half, it felt like things escalated really fast. Basically, all Paul had to do after becoming a leader was drink the worm juice, be immediately convinced he was a messiah, and pretty much send a message to the Emperor saying ""dude, fight me"", which resulted in the Emperor falling into a pretty obvious trap, thus the film's ""final battle"". I found myself wanting more of a slow escalation into the Emperor's hand being directly forced into combat (and better development for Paul than drinking worm poison and changing).

-Also more critique than question, but I sorely missed the power of the Voice. Sure, it was used a few times, but after being so established in Part One, I thought it would be more of a plot device and cool overarching ""supernatural"" ability. Instead, its only real shining moments were the power transfer between the Reverend Mothers, Jessica forcing Chani to fulfill the continuously developing Prophecy (as I noted in question 1), and Paul telling the (former) Reverend Mother) to be silent. Cool moments, but I wanted more, and it could have been a much more interesting plot device to further Paul's ascent to power. 

Don't take any of these the wrong way, I did really enjoy the movie, and over time as I come to understand its world more (especially the poison), I'm sure I'll come to love it like I have with Part One over the last couple years. I guess after enjoying the worldbuilding of Part One so much, the more settled and focused approach to Part Two took me by surprise, along with the points above that I was a bit confused by. Still, it was a hell of a beautiful and enthralling ride I'm looking forward to seeing many more times (and understand further!).",2024-03-01
"I liked it. I liked part 1 more. As someone who has read the book I'm disappointed that Thufir wasn't in part 2 and that Alia wasn't born and didn't kill the baron. It also felt overpacked, although the pacing was still nice. Jessica was amazing and contrary to many opinions I thought Paul and Chani had great chemistry. I'd give the film a 7/10.",2024-03-01

"Extremely good movie, holy shit.  Easy 9/10, and frankly I give it a solid 9.5+.  Not quite perfect but *damn* close.

Changes from the book really bug me, though.  Alia not yet born.  Paul killing the Baron.  No Thufir!  Of course the movie can't follow the book perfectly, but those changes were jarring to me.

Worst, though, and I'm honestly surprised with how much it bothered me: Paul didn't drive his knife through Feyd's jaw into his brain.  I don't know, I was just really expecting to see that.  It's is such a satisfying moment in the book, and it would have fit perfectly in the film Denis made.  Maybe I'm being nitpicky, but that exact moment is such a huge part of Dune to me, and it sucks that they skipped over it.

Still.  10/10 soundtrack.  11/10 cinematography.  Butler's Feyd is one of the best characterizations I have ever seen.  Films based on books hardly get more ambitious and challenging than this, and it was an absolute, top-to-bottom crush job.",2024-03-02
"As somebody expected to be amazed coming out of this film, I thought it was alright. It felt like a decent sci fi movie but I don't really have this desire to rewatch it. Its setting up a good story but I feel like it will be one of those movies where you have to see the payoff in #3. Which is how I felt about #1. Guess I wasn't that enthralled by it.

But on an execution level, this movie is done so well. The directing, music, and action are well done. The few comedic bits also work.

Edit: I'm coming back to this because I'm warmed on the movie as days have past. I already liked the execution but Paul's story and the whole Lisan al gaib thing really intrigued me. Definitely thought provoking",2024-03-03
"Was there a scene or two missing from the movie or am I tripping? Stilgar asked paul to cross the desert by himself and then he started desert walking.

In the book a LARGE amount of the 3rd act takes places entirely offscreen in an exceedingly frustrating way, bad enough to drop the book (in my eyes) from a 10/10 to almost a 5/10 in literally the last 3 chapters.

Is this rectified in the movie? Those who read the book will know what I mean.",2024-03-06

Like everything is tied nicely with a bow and cherry on top. I was shocked. Paul just absolutely takes a dump on everyone's outstretched hands and walks away. I mean, I get that's what happens in the books but.... at least a bit more clever dialogue in the throne room maybe? 

Dialogue was super corny. If I hear another character say ""War is coming....what're you gonna do when it gets here?"" just so it can be used in trailers, I will jump into a sandworm's mouth. It's like Denis put 100 points into visuals and sound and 50 points into dialogue. Bad guys were comically bad. Like there's no nuance, just the cliche bad guy kills own henchmen 234982942834 times to show how evil they are. We get it. Dark, evil, pale pasty faces, evil, yes. That's evil alright.

I can't fault it too much though. It clears most other movies I've seen in the past few years based on sound and visuals alone.",2024-03-08
"Paul is what they meant when they said we need new modern masculinity that's not old school toxic or just gay, effeminate and metrosexual - just become an insane terrorist cult leader and have everyone worship you because of charisma, leadership and intelligence, that way you're still a high status dominant leader without being a toxic male stereotype",2024-03-08
"I liked it but didn't love it.  The problem I think the film has is that the more they tried to stick to the books, the more they lose the casual viewers who haven't read them.  While I understood the basics of what was going on, I feel like I was missing a lot concerning the motivations of certain characters.  

Also, what was up with the scene where Paul is going on some sort of vision quest in the dunes?  He gets sent on his way, meets up with Chani and then we abruptly cut to a battle scene.  The whole solo trip into the harsh wasteland was supposed to be some big test and they skipped right over it.",2024-03-11
"I truly truly loved the film. Honestly i watched it in a shitty cinema and really wanna go again on imax or Dolby atmos for a second viewing. Watching the first film for the first time was meshmarizing.

I haven’t felt that emotionally invested, affected and immersed by a film in a long long time and in a good positive way. It was just executed very well. The sound, the emotions, the fight scenes, how perfect Paul was as a fragile skinny child struggling, to a fierce fighter, desert mouse smart and cunning, not weirdly strong and acrobatic for no reason at all. The cinematography, the fight scenes, the intrigue, world building, it was all incredible. I felt the cinema in awe thinking this was a 9/10.

My gripes,

1. I felt Rabban was a completely different character. He was so menacing, strong, terryfing and then he becomes this weakling who could not reason at all. The follow them with helicopters while screaming the guys name on desert and then immediately running away felt so lame. The helicopter scene kinda made up for it as that was super cool. This scene almost completely took me out of the movie but the movie was so masterful it sucked me back in. I also really didn’t like the Rabban and Gurley scene. Just felt too rushed. Too perfect. Too simple.
2. Chani. Just the seemed like a 21st century teenager dropper in that setting. Her demeanor, beliefs , actions. She felt like a modern rebellious petulant adolescent teenager rather than a product of a violent brutal tribe commune culture. Not a book reader but from what I’ve read she’s a lot more supportive and understanding in the book and can think in complex layers based on her motivations rather than RELIGION BAD. The whole culture is built around tradition and respect and the way she just seemed to disrespect the gathering rules, her elders, etc. She just felt so out of place to me.
3. More Chani. I felt the romance was forced. I felt the characters didn’t have lots of chemistry. I read a comment saying these were teens in a deserted planet which made this awkwardness easier but Chani or Paul was never shown as awkward. Honestly the scene between Feyd and the Lady Gesseritt woman had so much more on screen chemistry.
4. More Chani. She was like pharaoh from the Moses story. Seeing so many miracles and not believing them. I read a comment here that said they liked her character until the water of life scene. Where you are literally witnessing a hundreds if not thousands of year old prophecy that should not be possible at all being fulfilled in front of your eyes and your response is like an atheist subreddit user. Honestly wished she would struggle more with the prophecy and Paul would try to convince her it’s not real. She not believing it made her look so stupid and unreasonable. There is literally so much proof that the prophecy is real.
5. The emperor didn’t really feel menacing or powerful at all. Could be the cinema I was at but they said wow he brought his whole army and the scale of his army didn’t feel any bigger than Harkonnen or Attreides gatherings. The first movies' imperial army planet scene made it a lot more epic. If we didn’t see baron kneeling and soldier behind him unsheating, I would not feel he yielded any power at all. Felt the 'Leto was weak' line was a cop out. Wanted that to be more fleshed out.
6. Important people being on the front lines all the time were lame. Whether gurley or Paul. Also gurley literally leading a suicide charge and surviving was lame. I know it’s the same in the book but it felt cheap. Sardaukar being weak was lame but I read many comments it’s the same in the book. The Fremen and desert power is underestimated. I didn’t get that sense from the movie, I wish there was a dialogues from Paul like that. I don’t know. The throne scene was really cool but then felt a little out of place and lacking scale. They just got there too quickly and the imperial guard just stood there.

I just wished Chani at least struggled with the prophecy a little and maybe the Lisan al gaib is men made but the hazerach thing is very real and very mystical that required a thousand year planning and luck of a perfect being that will lead to a better world. I felt that wasn’t handled with proper respect.",2024-03-13
"Dune is a monumental film, a full-fledged auteur Blockbuster.  Without a doubt it will be a topic of conversation for years to come.  There are shots and scenes that will remain etched in my memory for a long time.
 However, Dune has the least lovable and endearing characters in the history of cinema (let's add a little drama to the criticism).  And for this type of story, where the objective is to create a film saga, the characters should be the initial and most important point to develop for their creators.  Since they ARE the ones we are going to follow for so long and it is FOR them that we get excited, suffer, laugh, cry, etc.  Because at the end of the day, this is their story.  It's your way.  It is their lives that are at stake.

 But unfortunately, its creators don't seem to care too much that their CHARACTERS are the least memorable thing in their story.  And yes, as I said before, Duna is spectacular in all its other sections: the sound and the soundtrack are the best I have ever heard in my life (we continue with the drama), the VFX are incredibly realistic (every pixel is be careful), the production design, with that imposing desert, really makes you immerse yourself in Arrakis and its universe, the photography is chameleon-like and loaded with information and meaning, and the performances are truly impressive (Rebeca Ferguson, Austin Buttler and Javier Bardem, wow).

 But what about the emotion?  Dune fails miserably to deliver a story you really care about.  And for me, the big problem is that the only purpose of the characters, their ONLY function, is to be the means, or the tool, to tell you the story.  They are empty shells.  Without soul.  And the thing is, we don't know them.  In both films (because the same thing happens in the first) at no point do they stop, not even a little bit, in showing us the HUMANITY of these people.  Paul went from being the spoiled son of one of the most important houses in the universe, to being the MESSIAH of an entire planet and to leading a revolution against the galactic government (Is that what they say?).  The kid literally became a god who can see all possible futures.  And he accepts it with coldness and exasperating depression.  And this happens with ALL the characters (except for Jessica and Stilgar).  None of them generate a drop of empathy in me.  And this is because, I don't know who they are, I don't know them at all, I don't know their fears, their personal ambitions, their tastes, their desires.  I know they do what they do because they have a duty to do it, but is it really what they want to do as people?  These and many other questions are ones that Dune is never going to bother answering us, or showing us.

 And it's not that nothing happens to the characters, quite the opposite, everything happens to them, but the problem is that it doesn't generate anything for me.
 So, I wonder, if I don't care about any of the characters in the slightest, why should I care what happens to them or what they do?  (Spoiler alert) Why would I care that Paul is the Baron's grandson?  Why would I care if Gurney is alive and kills Rabban?  Why should I care that Paul takes revenge on his family by killing the Baron?  Why should I care about the extermination of House Atreides?  I don't know them, I don't know who they are, I don't care about them.  They are actors, not characters.

 I think that is the BIG problem in both films and (hopefully not), it is the problem that will drag down the entire saga.",2024-03-14
"My biggest question is why was Chani so upset at the end?

 I get it on an emotional level, but if you look at it logically, what was Paul supposed to do? If you want the liberation of the Fremen, then Paul chose the only correct path - it had to lead to conquering Arrakis, then an alliance with the Emperor, and then galactic war if the Houses would not fall in line.

So what should have Paul done, according to Chani? What different path should he have taken that would still lead to freedom for her people?",2024-03-19
"10/10 cinematography. 7, 8 and 9s in other aspects.

8/10 overall. Better than Interstellar or BR2049.",2024-03-05
"Might be the best movie of the 2020s so far IMO.   

Recommend seeing it in IMAX. I skipped seeing this one in IMAX after feeling disappointed by many 70MM IMAX movies (TENET, Oppenheimer, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (all good movies, but was not sure the IMAX was worth it)).   

Was still epic and great in standard, though. ",2024-03-06
"Denis Villeneuve’s name really has got to be in the running for one of the best directors after Dune 2. I was surprised that my film friend didn’t actually know his name until yesterday after our IMAX screening. I’ve consistently liked (if not loved) all of his movies and Dune part 1’s easily one of *those* movies that’ll stick into my head. Idk if I love part 2 as much, it has more spectacle and the visuals and on sound are great but part 1 has a certain vibe to it. On first watch it definitely feels like the first hour or so of this movie felt like a series of events that he had to condense but Idk if that’ll go away or be more noticeable on a second viewing. 

That said, I LOVED Geidi Prime, holy shit the black and white sequence, the sandworm riding, the everything. This dude does not have one single boring shot in an almost 3 hour movie and that’s a feat in on itself when it comes to ‘modern’ Hollywood blockbusters.",2024-03-01
"I'm surprised no one has commented on Chani's adaption compared to the book. While I loved most of the book, I disliked how the women were written. They fawned over Paul, lacked agency and seemed empty-minded.

I love that Chani had a much stronger, defiant character [in the movie]. Providing some contrast to Paul's rise and serving as an ominous prelude to what's coming. Some might disagree but I think it's an improvement on the books.",2024-03-01
"Haven't seen the movie, but as someone who didn't like Part 1 and found it to be incredibly boring and slow, would I like Part 2 and is it any different?",2024-03-06
"It was ok. Much better than the first one. But I guess I don't really get the hype. Worms were great, music was half of the movie which I like. I didn't like those loud clinging sounds of the knives.

IMAX was full week after premiere.

Why didn't they use guns instead of knives?

Anyway 7/10. Good in cinema but at hope I would probably not finish it in 1 go.",2024-03-08
"10/10 spectacular. I walked out the theatre feeling like I had an inspired spiritual awakening. Everything was clearer, connected, and zen.

Christopher Nolan compared Dune part 2 to Empire Strikes Back and I totally agree. Going to see it a third time. Potential legendary trilogy if Denis Villeneuve can stick the landing.",2024-03-01
"I liked this version,the look and feel of it,I liked the characters however,the actress portraying Chani,I didn't like her portrayal of a character I grew up
with from reading the novel,to sitting in a theater and watching the 80s version all day,like every showing to the syfy networks miniseries and follow ups,I just feel Zendayas performance made Chani too angry,weak and spoiled,kinda ruined the movie especially that ending.I know I am in a minority but do't care.

Chani is Freman and strong enough and smart enough to see the union of Paul and House Corino was a necessary evil and she was pauls wife not Irulan,however the temper tantrum running off really shit on a great character,what a disservice to  Frank Herberts masterpiece.",2024-03-03
"Hot take but Paul is NOT the villain. As a journalist, I think audiences always want to assign something as black-or-white and the point of this series to me so far is to prioritize the coexistence of people with honorable intentions doing evil things.

To quote: “his rule is more about exploring the gray areas of morality and leadership than casting him as a straightforward villain.”",2024-03-03
My only gripe with this movie is they didn’t explain why Arrakis was so important. Do they even call the spice Melange? If I recall correctly they never touched on what Melange does and why it’s such an important commodity in the universe.,2024-03-02
"Just got out of the theater, the movie was insane ! Waaaaaay better than the source material. It even got a standing ovation once the credit rolled which is an incredibly rare feat for any movie in my local theater.",2024-03-02
Will Austin Butler be talking like the Baron now for a couple of years?,2024-03-02
"Overall liked the movie, but there were major changes I'm not sure how they are going to wrap up. I'm not sure about Sith Lord Paul and Jessica. Wasn't made clear Paul chose the jihad to control it and lessen death-toll. He just looked evil at the end. And I get getting a big actor/actress and expanding their part, but not at the cost of one of the greatest pieces of literature of all time. I have no idea how they are going to bring Chani back. I mean...Shaitan is on his way.

Edit: Stuff

Edit 2: Oh yeah, not thrilled with what they did to Stilgar. Everett McGill will always be my Stilgar.",2024-03-04
Why didn’t Paul use the voice to win his 1v1s? Especially against Elvis at the end? Would have totally shown how powerful he is.,2024-03-06
"Unpopular opinion I'm sure, but I was very disappointed in the movie. Without writing an essay, the movie felt very rushed and, in many ways, shallow. It did not hit the same marks as the first one imo. So many things happened in part two, in such a quick succession, that the movie didn't have time to look at any of the story elements at a deep level.

It feels like the movie got Marvelized, it cashed in on the success of the first movie, and depended on cheap stuff like (admittedly impressive) visuals. 

Currently I'm hoping that I will learn to enjoy it on second viewing when it comes out on Bluray, I  really wanted to enjoy the movie, but I'm not really expecting that to happen.",2024-03-26
I’m going to get down voted but screw everybody smacking on their popcorn in the quiet parts of the movie. Can’t wait to watch this in an empty theater,2024-03-04
"Anyone else not a fan of the OST? After Wonder Woman 2, I can't not laugh and think of [ANCIENT LAMENTATION MUSIC], but even beside that, I found the music to be pretty uninteresting.",2024-03-06
"Pacing-wise, it was pretty bad. Perhaps Alia should have been cut entirely.",2024-03-09
"Reading through these comments, I can confidently say that I must have missed the point of the movie.",2024-03-10
I'm really surprise by the intensity of the praise. It was good but I don't think these movies have very strong characters,2024-03-17
"Hans Motherfucking Zimmer everyone. Just holy shit the sound design in the movie is incredible. There are multiple sequences where you can FEEL the score in your bones, even in the quiet moments, there is almost a steady thrum of bass driving the movie forward, truly elevating an incredibly beautifully shot film. It envelopes you throughout the runtime until the scene with the duel and even it's fucking ABSENCE is felt. Bought another ticket for a showing on Sunday. I'm gonna pop an edible this time and ride the worm with Paul",2024-03-01
"I thought part 1 was mid, Paul was emotionless and flat, the “fremen-ness” of the fremen was a bit too played up, and I didn’t feel like a lot of substance actually happened. I walked out of the theater feeling like I just watched 2.5 hrs of setup. 

But it was worth it! By the end of part 2 Paul is a badass, but with depth as he realizes the personal sacrifices he has to make to achieve the future he wants. So many epic moments once the emperor lands on arrakis. I give it a 7.5, there were a lot of silly walks which were kinda goofy, and it’s kinda boring to me how without exception every Harkon is just a straight evil dude who loves being bad for badness sake. The trope of “ILL EVEN KILL MY SUBORDINATE” is so played out and happened like 6 times, only with the Harkons. Also had some gripes with fight choreography. 

Maybe I’m just a history nerd who’s watched too many YouTube videos, but the amount of damn combat spins and somersaults was way too high. In a fight they’re totally pointless unless you’re wielding an actual great sword which requires you to use momentum. Broke my immersion at times. And it’s not the movies fault but it being chalemet and zendaya broke my immersion at times to.",2024-03-06
"Amazing film.   I was glued to my seat the whole time.      Visuals are amazing,   Story.  Everything.    Just so good.",2024-03-01
"boring movie with great visuals and wooden actors that belong as still images as models, not actors",2024-03-05
I haven't read the book but I'm a bit disappointed it left on another cliffhanger,2024-03-01
"my biggest surprise here was Zendaya. Never a fan, probably from lack of seeing her in things, but here i really felt for her character. In the book she kinda just went with the flow due to her heritage. They removed that aspect here, for time most likely, but with that, she  has purpose and since it is at odds with Paul to a degree it adds some nice tension. Nice little surprise.",2024-03-01
"Yeah, this film blew me the fuck away. It gave me a feeling I haven’t felt since seeing Fury Road back in 2015. It’s an absolute spectacle. 

Those 166 mins fucking FLEW.",2024-03-01
Also House Harkonnen as the creepy BDSM house was cool.,2024-03-01
"Everyone having a religious experience as Paul says he's the Messiah is insane, but Gurney was just excited to go and kill people because ""fuckem that's why!"" 

Shit had me cracking up

""I AM YOUR DUKE!""

*Gurney ready to kill everyone who killed Leto finally*",2024-03-01
Im dissatisfied more than i expected with the ending. Obviously it's more of a source material issue than the movie's but still I felt like i watched Part 2 of 3 and I really didnt like that feeling after already being blueballed with part 1,2024-03-01
"I’m an idiot and accidentally bought front row seats to my local IMAX theatre.

However. This was amazing. And I’ll be seeing it again without breaking my neck next time.",2024-03-01
Ok so cutting out Alia hurt the film so much because it all happens in 5-6 months. Someone has to say it. That is the films biggest flaw,2024-03-01
"Thought it was great. Every performance was stellar. Visuals were incredible.

I loved how it's clearly the second of three movies but unlike the usual trope of the bad guys winning in part 2, in this one the hero literally becomes the emperor, and yet it feels like a downer ending because of the way they teased how Paul attaining power will lead to misery.

I also think the Zendaya and Timothee fans will be angry that they didnt end the movie together and instead he chose someone else. Wouldn't be surprised if the cinemascore is lower than the movie deserves because of that, and the ending in general.

Overall, i loved it on its own but especially as a companion to part 1,  which I rewatched just before leaving for the cinema tonight",2024-03-01
the scale of the film is right up there with LOTR. GOATed film for me,2024-03-01
"As someone who hated Dune I because it was slow, and boring... will I like this?",2024-03-01
"Am I crazy, or was the reveal that Jessica was Baron's daughter insanely glossed over? Am I missing anything? Was this already revealed in Part One and I just don't remember it?",2024-03-01
"Was it just my theater (saw it in IMAX) or were Chanis eyes way more Brown than Blue in a lot of scenes? I don't know enough Dune lore, so do the Freman's eyes change color or what?",2024-03-01
"Hearing “DUNE” named dropped was a good moment. That, and pretty much the ‘nah we ain’t doing that shit’ when being told he had to kill Stilgar if he wanted to speak at council.",2024-03-01
"Dune has been my absolute favorite for decades now, since reading it as an early teen. Hell my GSD is named Feyd, of the House Barkonnen for Christ's sake. 

I had chill watching this. Watched Part One (again) last night and while sitting in the cinema this evening I couldn't believe I was finally seeing it. Seeing Dune done right. Shai-Hulud honored. 

Finally the immense, epic scale of Dune brought to life. The serious science fiction it is, the titan of the genre. Yeah it had some chuckles, but this is our Godfather. A no bullshit film. No Marvel quips, or Star Wars kid gloves.

Denis you madlad. You had me with Blade Runner 2049, taking an amazing OG film and building on it, and now this... Speechless. 

Must see.",2024-03-01
"I’ve seen it more than once now (and have read the books so my thoughts are going to cover the whole series potentially). 

If you only get one thing from me, take that it should be seen in IMAX, period. Dolby Cinema is inferior for this. 

# Questions 

* Did the Great Houses nuke Arrakis at the end? What was that flash, orbital bombardment?
* How do the Fremen vessels gain passage to the Great Houses’ homeworlds? I guess they just demand it from the Guild who says okay fine since the spice would be destroyed if they don’t comply?
* Was the final Atreides soldier in the gladiator pit the captain of the guard? (“Shields!” guy when they disembark in Pt One)
* If Paul knowing the old Fremen name is such a big deal, why does the Baron also call it Dune in part one? He thinks the Fremen are subhuman, he wouldn’t be using their folk names. 


# Reactions not specifically related to changes from book:
* Utter joy during the raids, Paul’s first sandride, the war council, and the climactic attack. 
* Paul entering the war council, with a sandworm exploding up behind him and heavy drums, that’ll go down as an all-timer badass shot.
* Paul’s ambivalence and waffling with taking advantage of the prophesy and then doing it anyway and not knowing what he really believed felt messy but I guess it makes sense. It feels to me like Paul sometimes tries to be a simple Fedaykin, but he’s lying to Chani and himself, that’s just not the person he is.
* The first time watching, I did not like Javier Bardem’s portrayal of Stilgar, but it grew on me in repeat viewings. It felt like comic relief but less overdone than I initially thought. 
* Why, exactly, the Emperor would ever come to Arrakis in the first place upon receiving the challenge never felt clear. TBF I think this applies to the book, too.
* And why did the Saudakar mass faced toward the mountain?
* A bit confused by the layout of Arrakeen and the Shield Wall. I could’ve sworn that mountain formation wasn’t there in part one. 
* Walken. I don’t get the casting. Not what I pictured.
* On the other hand, Florence Pugh is incredible as Irulan and Austin Butler is great as Feyd-Rautha. 
* >!Sad no more Sardaukar language except for the first moment!<. I still don’t get why the Sardaukar specifically having prophetic sayings in the cold open. >!Because like, now they’re all going to be dead except for the Corrino house guard. It won’t make sense to have those sayings continue.!< Instead, if they would’ve known that they had multiple films locked, they could’ve used it as the NAVIGATION GUILD’S language, which they’ll need in books 2 and on, and which would have been a little confusing to not hear in the first movie but a wild exciting tease for the super fans who see the explanation in captions  
* Anya Taylor Joy is an inspired choice for an adult Alia, and tells me he’s setting someone up to adapt CHILDREN (or at least leaving it open), even if he says he isn’t. I’m not sure how they’re going to deal with ages >!since she’s supposed to be like 21 in that book!<. 
* I’m guessing the vision Chani has where Paul sees her blistered is of the >!Stone Burner in MESSIAH!<
* Really strange coincidence that “Usul” means the same thing as “Al Qaeda.” Fundamentalism, indeed.
* I wish some guild representatives had been in this one. 
* Simply incredible visuals. That this movie can look this good, and others so bad, is amazing. 
* Strong strong soundtrack. 
* >!Zendaya is going to break me in MESSIAH!<

# Reactions specifically to changes:
* Did not like Chani being the only Fremen not to believe in the prophesy by the end. None of that is in the book. I really didn’t like ending it on her. If every other Fedaykin leaves, IDK where Chani is going. >!Jacurutu?!<
* Even though I said I don’t like Chani being alone to reject Paul… on the other hand I loved the visual of Chani being the only one not to bow for Paul besides Irulan, it makes clear that Paul considers Chani his true wife and equal. That removes the need for Jessica to have the only “history knows us as true wives” speech which would feel a little on the nose and feel like a weird place to end in a movie.
* Slightly disappointed Thufir Hawat wasn’t in it and that Feyd Rautha’s daggers poison wasn’t switched in the gladiator ring. Hoping an extended edition exists.
* Did not enjoy Bardem’s portrayal as nothing but a zealot, I didn’t think it went that far. Stilgar and Paul are supposed to be best friends. Did not come across at all. 
* A little disappointed in the Jessica stoking the flames plot but necessary for a sped up timeline, and nice to see her take a more active role I guess 
* Also slightly disappointed the Jamis was my friend scene did not come to pass, but explaining the water instead was nice.
* It’s too bad Chani isn’t related to Liet-Kynes in this, but the ages wouldn’t have made sense, and I’m happy with the portrayal in the last film
* As a book reader, I’m disappointed they didn’t threaten to kill all the sandworms with water and instead threaten to nuke the spicefields (at least one or two worms would probably survive?). Of course that then requires you to explain the link between spice and the worms more which is too much background since it’s supposed to be this big secret. So, fine with the change I guess, but it’ll always bother me. 
* Fine with no Count Fenring 
* I had a strong reaction to the end the first time, the down note for Chani hurts, but it fits, >!the story is a tragedy, especially for her.!<
* Good choice to remove Feyd-Rautha having to cheat in his gladiator match against the undrugged Atreides since it makes him seem like more of a threat in the climactic duel 
* Big fan of how they portrayed collecting water, way better than bloodletting. 
* Probably for the best that the polygamy-against-a-widow’s-will plotline was removed 
* Loved the explanation of the Water of Life and loved the scene discovering the nuclear arsenal",2024-03-01
"This is strictly a book detail but in the novel, the Fremen have actually developed the ability to heal cuts quickly to preserve their bodies' water content - a mix of evolution and one of the health benefits of the spice melange. This is why book readers were not surprised to see Paul survive several cuts at the end.

"I wasn't impressed with the Part I, but this one takes the cake. We get to see how divided Fremen, characters themselves & relationships between them are far more complex. Wasn't fan of the book either, this movie provides much needed depth to the story to make it far more engaging.

"I did like the movie, 4/5 on Letterboxd. I just think unlike the first film, where apart from omitting some dialogue and changing Liet Kynes to a woman it was a pretty straight adaptation, this one changed or removed a lot more.

So how is Paul the grandson of the fat Harkonnen? I missed that part. Audio was a bit muffled. It sounded like they were saying Rebecca Ferguson’s character had a daughter with the fat Harkonnen?,2024-03-03
"So the first movie was very much a faithful retelling of the book.


This quickly began diverging from the source material, to the point that large plot points are different by the end (Chani, specifically)


It almost feels like the Evangelion reboot movies. By the time we're done with part 4, will it be unrecognizable? 


And given that I liked most of the changes...is it wrong to hope for this?",2024-03-03
Can someone explain to my why the emperor would come to Arrakis himself? Seems like it was too easy for Paul and the fremen to take control and capture him as prisoner.,2024-03-04
"I think Austin Butler was my favorite part about this. Haven't been unimpressed with his acting since Yoga Hosers lol.

Glad they didn't back-to-back film these because Chalamet felt older and more mature because... he was. Paul was much less emotionally restrained in this which was good.

Surprised they basically cut Alia out but I can feel why they did for the sake of pacing. And that little nod at the end about her was kind of important because it would be real hard to adapt the later stories without her, she's quite an important character.

I've always loved the Lynch film for its art direction and vision but this is a marked improvement. The extended scenes with Charlotte Rampling were also very welcome to see. I can only imagine how much her experience making Zardoz must have played into her being a veteran on the set here. I feel like Villeneuve was actively having her tap into that role.

My only wish would've been more extended scenes around the galaxy, much more Geidi Prime, some more Salusa Secundus because fuck me that was fascinating. And just a bit more of a tour in general of the planeterary societies. Maybe even a small introduction to some of the other house members.

I also feel like the spacing guild was essentially cut from the story as a faction. The Lynch movie in fact did a better job with them even if the puppets were weird lol, he did a great job of illustrating the evolution aspect of spice. But you only really see them for a brief moment in the first film and the fact that the galactic space travel economy hinges on this planet is kind of just thrown to the wayside for the messiah story POV.

Mentat stuff also, thrown to the wayside. You get Thufir in the first film but much like the first movie you don't get much notion that Paul is basically the combination of a Mentat and Bene Gesserit.

On the much more positive side, the tech in both films was superb. The ships, the weapons, the armor, it's perfect in almost every respect there.

Good movie, I could've handled another hour on each film that went deeper on the things that this version omitted. Even a little exposition on 'how humanity got to where we are now' would've been great. Like the narration TV edit of the Lynch movie is jank as hell but it's all pertinent information that immerses you in the world.",2024-03-04

1. There was a lot of mumbling in the movie and I kinda missed the significance of the underground River. It’s the moisture of their dead, correct? And they don’t drink it because it’s sacred? I heard Stilgar say something abut Arrakis turning into a green paradise. What does that have to do with the river?

2. How did Paul even send word to the Emperor? Do the Fremen have ships with space traveling capabilities?

3. How does Paul subjugate the entire universe with just his Fremen army? The Fremen are fierce but how can they win against all the other Houses armies?",2024-03-05

I have a scientific background and I see things in this film that are contradicted by basic physics... yet I *feel* like I'm witnessing technology far beyond my comprehension. Even the psychic visions and hyper-biology just makes me think ""Oh, these people just figured something out in 8k years of selection."" It's rare that a film goes beyond inviting me to suspend my disbelief, but actually compels me to. Like some form of hypnosis. The only thing that made me aware of the fiction was the fact everyone was mostly speaking english. Now I know how Star Wars watchers might have felt.",2024-03-24
"I have to be honest, while I think the visuals of this movie were 10/10, I HATED what they did to Stilgar, Chani, and Jessica's characters. Stilgar is reduced to a fundamentalist lackey which is totally not what he was like in the books. I am rereading Children of Dune and there is a paragraph in there about how much he abhors how Paul's legacy has become a religion. He never believed in it truly. 

Chani's character. gosh. I understand what they were trying to do but damn...I could not understand why she loved Paul and why he loved her in this film. She was angry for 99% of the film and Paul never communicated shit with her unlike their book counterparts where she was aware of, and on board, with all of the decisions that he made. She knew he would have to have a political marriage and understood why. Likewise, Paul always made it known to her that she was the love of his life and he would never even look Irulan's way despite her having his name. They just ruined their love story to me. It also would have been nice for the two of them to have a music motif for their romance but...I know that is asking too much.

Lastly, Jessica. Lord almighty what they did to her. She went crazy after the water of life. She wasn't even around Paul much in this film which is not what happened in the book. Ug. I just hated what they did to her because she wasn't a mother anymore. blech.",2024-03-25

I feel like shedding tears it was so beautiful. 

I wasn't much of a fan of the first film. But once you watch this one, you'll understand completely. They tie in together so fking well. The actors nailed it. 

Masterpiece.",2024-03-01
I loved the book when I first read it and loved both movies. What really struck me in this movie over the book though was the degradation of the relationship between Paul and Chani. Dennis setting up their relationship early on then crashing it down around them struck a cord with me. Zendaya and Chamlet killed it as well. Excellent film,2024-03-01
This is the best movie I've seen in theaters since ROTK. Holy shit.,2024-03-02
Only criticisms: The should have not had Feyd-Rautha always cheating in the Giedi Prime fights. It would have made him almost beating Paul believable. Like the guy only had one half fair fight in his life and he almost beats a battle seasoned Paul? Also Paul getting stabbed twice(I’m pretty vitals places) and just being ok? Other than those things it’s nearly perfect.,2024-03-02

- What's up with personal shields no longer being used? The only time you saw it on screen was when he disabled it in the fighting arena. The only other relevant shield was when they blew up the one airship. Then they were casually shooting multiple down later on.

- Giant laser that can fuck up the spice harvesters. Why only used against spice harvesters?

- How did they suddenly know where the fremen base was? Did the Harkonnen know the whole time? If so, why had they not already blown it up? Did they just forget about artillery because they're so used to going into melee to smack things?",2024-03-02
"Love this movie. Solid 8 maybe 9/10 for me. Only things that I wished were a little different: wish rabban’s character didn’t crumple so quickly (immediately ran away from fremen, immediately got punked by feyd rautha, and lost to gurney in what I was hoping would be an epic fight), I couldn’t unsee Christopher walken as Christopher walken",2024-03-04

Some of the character focused ones it was obvious the interior design was clearly blue-room or soundstage or whatever.

Paul is a unique case, he's the son of a Bene Gesserit and has been taught their ways. Jessica was supposed to have a daughter, like all Bene Genesserit, but she thought she could give birth to the One. And since they were being moved to planet where a prophecy had been laid down for just such an occasion, Paul had be tested. Like the Reverend Mother said, he inherits their power, he carries two birthrights.

Why was Feyd tested? That woman just slept with him and that seemed to be the entirety of his usefulness.",2024-03-08

"Here’s my review as someone who didn’t read the book: this movie is LOUD! That IMAX theater was seriously thumping. Beautiful movie too. 

I like it a lot, but the ending seemed a bit rushed to me. While I don’t want this ridiculously long movie to be even longer, here’s what I thought was left out: 1) Zendaya rebel attitude towards Paul taking power . I wish they fully fleshed that out more. They were together, and in love, and she’s upset he drank the Water of Life and is blaming his mother. But by the end of the movie, she feels like a side character getting upset about Paul’s decision making. Didn’t feel like a love story falling apart due to Paul’s fate and his ability to see into the future. 

2) this ties into number one, but Paul’s complete abandonment of denying he is the messiah and wishing power didn’t land at his feet. Yeah I’m understanding the plot, that there is a narrow path and he sees every possible outcome, but the only time we saw him mentally toil over this is the scene where he’s sitting there saying there is a narrow path. All other scenes for the remainder of the movie he is full steam ahead “I am Lisan Al-guiab now”. I wish they fleshed out his unwillingness to pursue this, but he must so people do not starve to death. 

Or maybe those don’t happen in the book I didn’t read, which would also be bad imo. 

Anyway, awesome movie to see in IMAX. I’m certainly glad I did",2024-03-28

"**Paul Muaddib Atreides, Duke of Atreides, is a hero.**

After resenting and fearing power and leadership for most of the film, an unwilling Paul soon accepts his role in the prophecy after life and fate direct him forcefully. 

After accepting this role and drinking the Water of Life, Paul is able to “see” into the future. He states that enemies are all around, and that the path to success is “narrow”. We see Paul take that narrow path towards the end of the film, leading the Fremen to successfully overtake the Haarkenens and the Emperor. 

Paul was faced with the choice of either freeing the Fremen of generational oppression and imminent genocide, and exacting revenge/regaining honor on those that conspired against the Atreides, or allowing the Fremen to become extinct and thus withering away with them. 

Further, the Bene Gesserit were weaving another inheritor of the prophecy by setting up Feyd-Rautha as a potential candidate, instead of Paul. We’re shown that Feyd-Rautha is ruthless, power-hungry with 0 resentments towards leadership, and just completely evil. 

If Paul were not to fulfill the prophecy, and instead chose to be a pacifist (even after life/fate maneuvered the decision towards him), the alternative result in Feyd-Rautha becoming the Mahdi and eventually residing as the Emperor, would be far more catastrophic for the universe.",2024-03-06

"The movie was amazing but it does feel awkward watching it while living in a country where muslim is the majority. Since im no muslim (or of any religion honestly), do wondered if its going to offend anyone.

But I am also happy that such movie that questioned the rise of religion and its role in politics got released and I do hope it helped some people to question things and not just follow them blindly.

"Loved it. 

Visually it was so unique and so much better than the first one.

I did understand the changes done with Alia and The Baron's death. Those changes were ok, but I felt at the ending the conflict between Chani and Paul was a bit bigger than in the book. The movie felt like it ends abruptly and feels like a cliffhanger of sorts, but with Chani being mad/disappointed.",2024-03-03

"I caught this in the Lincoln Square IMAX and it was an incredible experience, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.

However, I can't help but think the ending makes no sense and undoes the events of the film.

The instant >!the Emperor shows up Paul should have just nuked him and the Harkonnens. The only reason *not* to do so is because he needed the Emperor to legitimize his claim to the throne. Also why would the Emperor even travel to Arrakis? Just to shame the Baron? Seem awfully convenient for Paul's sake.!<

However, >!the Great Houses *not* recognizing his claim makes no sense. By what right would they even refuse it? The Emperor himself has clearly abdicated.!<

Most importantly, >!if the Great Houses refuse him as Emperor then there is no reason for Paul to marry Florence Pugh...!<

Also, >!why would the family atomics be on Arrakis rather than Caladan? And why wouldn't Paul know this, since his father seemingly brought him into war councils where he learned they planned to ally the Fremen?!<

And as great as Austin Butler was I do wonder why not just cast Bill Skarsgaard?",2024-03-07
"Did anyone else think it was super corny that Chani saved Paul's life by putting a tear in the blue water, and then putting it on his mouth? That was super cringe. The only way they could have made it more cringe is if she kissed him back to life. Im surprised a character off screen didnt say after he came back to life, love is the answer.  

Either have Paul drink the blue liquid and be able to survive it on his own, or dont have him drink it at all. Are we supposed to assume that if she hadnt of been there that he would have died right there and then??",2024-03-08

As a movie experience, 10/10. As an adaption eh, 9/10 just because of Alia and her not killing the Baron. And the one that I thought was unforgivable was not having ""I was a friend of Jamis"" and Paul giving water for the dead (tho maybe that was in the end of the first one, but I don't remember)

The scene of Paul riding his first worm was one of the absolute coolest scenes I've ever seen in any movie ever. Give Denis the Oscar already along with all the technical awards.",2024-03-01
"This was probably one of my favourite movie going experiences iv ever had. I definitely recommend watching part 1 before you go see part 2 even if you’ve seen it recently, I feel it’s better enjoyed as a whole rather than two parts. The only issue I had was that everything felt a little too easy compared to part 1, the bad guys felt less threatening and things always seemed to go the good guys way bar a few incidents. I also feel it could have gone for a little longer as some of the scenes felt cut short or rushed.

One thing I didn't fully understand, why was Chani so upset with Paul? She seemed to become extremely angry with him after he drank the water of life and almost died. With everything they had already done together fighting against the Harkonnens, I couldn't really follow the reasoning for her to seemingly flip against Paul at that point.

I think the biggest difference between Part 2 and basically every other movie that Villeneuve has directed is that all the other movies seemed very distant. Sure, really emotional moments occurred in BR2049, Arrival, Prisoners, and Part 1, but I always felt like I was a distant observer.

"Dune Part 2:  
A deconstruction of the esthetics of religion and its portrayal.

The idea of a messiah, the one who  
will come to save us all. Is a religious idea, a romantic one, as it encourages  
one to deposit all their doubts and anxieties into a single image that would be  
responsible for consulting all of them. This very image is the one that Paul  
Atreides exhibits. Being the will of the Bene Gesserit, what matters most  
in the eyes of the Fremen, although they are unconscious of it, is that Paul  
looks the part. Looking the part however is not an entirely visual aesthetic  
problem, it is also an aesthetic of character. All the details of his  
prophesied arrival played to Paul’s character and his ability to adapt to the  
situation he found himself in. Regardless of the motivations and driving  
factors that may have laid within Paul, if he looked like the Lisan al-Gaib, he  
was to be the Lisan al-Gaib.

The display of perceived aesthetics  
extends itself far into the film and how it chose to portray the world of dune.  
The obvious Arabian /middle eastern influences are worn on its sleeve. With  
certain phrases and words being ripped straight out of the Arabic language. Its  
choice to adopt the aesthetic flavor of Middle Eastern culture, aided in  
drawing out its more religious themes, without it being shoved down one’s  
throat. Making it a tad bit more believable that in this entirely fictitious  
world, you would find a similar essence that can be found in our reality as  
well.

From a simplistic point of view,  
the movie could be summed up too “If it looks like the prophecy is coming true  
it might as well be”. Emphasizing the importance of self-realization and  
agency, the hijacking of personal motivation and beliefs can come before an  
individual as paintings and representations, those that just so happen to align  
with narratives that have been laid before them.

"So I've got a couple questions about the ending. Why was the war over so quickly? It seemed so sudden the Emperor arrives, lands with his army and gets beaten in a day. Seemed too easy.

"As a fan both of Frank Herbert's seminal sci-fi novel and of Denis Villeneuve's towering first attempt at translating Herbert's text to the big screen, I was eagerly awaiting this film, and after having seen it, I'm now fully convinced that I have seen the face of God. Ironic hyperbole, I know, especially given the film's piercing religious commentary, but this is destined to be remembered as one of the greatest cinematic achievements not just of this decade but also of the 21st century. We may only be three months into the year thus far, but when it comes to 2024 in cinema, as far as I'm concerned, this is the one to beat.

Villeneuve once again not only proves why and how he's one of our finest living filmmakers but also — alongside the extraordinary cast and crew — does considerable justice to the source material he's adapting, bringing Herbert's characters, environments, and symbolism to life in the most unexpected yet also perfect ways you could possibly imagine. This truly is an epic in every meaning of the word, from its jaw-droppingly grand scale to the explosive performances from such a superbly chosen murderer's row of talent. Costume designer Jacqueline West, production designer Patrice Vermette, and especially cinematographer Greig Fraser all do a magnificent job once more of creating a world that stays true to the spirit of Herbert while also managing to stand out from other contemporary science fantasy films.

While excelling as a sweeping war film packed with exciting action sequences and first-rate visual effects, this excels even more as a hauntingly brutal tale of political manipulation, religious fanaticism, faith corrupted, and the battles — both outside and within — between destiny and free will, appropriately horrifying in its imagery and implications and rightfully scathing in its bite. I have admittedly yet to read Dune Messiah, but if it lives up to the quality of Herbert's original novel and the Hollywood powers that be greenlight a film adaptation of that with Villeneuve and company returning, then we may very well be in for the best big-budget blockbuster trilogy since Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings.",2024-03-01
"First of all, we finally got to see it (yay)and it was beautiful. Everything fit so perfectly although I would've loved to experience it on IMAX but I don't have one in my hometown. Loved the additions to the cast. Loved the music, correct me if I'm wrong, they've used a lot from the first film, right? I was surprised to see Anya Taylor in it more so because we were shown the trailer for mad Max before the film and she was being such a badass in it. She's having quite the year I must say. I don't want to nitpick and accept/love the film as it is BUT I just can't with Austin Butler 😭 why didn't they go for someone with more grit? I guess. Baron and Rabban were sooo perfectly cast. I can never take this dude seriously ever. He took me out of the film sooo many times.I kept thinking about his Elvis accent fiasco. Another thing that bugged me was Baron dying that easily. I felt like that moment deserved more friction? Somebody opposing, something happening? Everyone just kinda stood there.

There is zero suspense or drama. There was not one single moment where I was worried that the hero on screen would not succeed.

Dollars to donuts based on that large of a budget that was probably the worst film this year. 190 million bones and you get that dialogue. The sand people kill everyone like they are made of paper and they also have nukes?! What is even the struggle? 

3/10. All the dune simps will downvote this, I don't care. 

I haven't read the books, but a character that scrawny and kicking everyone's ass is not believable. I'd kick Paul's ass with a potato masher. That last fight scene was so silly.

"Just saw it, here is my full review. I loved some parts, and hated a lot of the others.


I'll start with what I didn't like:

Even though I liked it, this movie was so off compared to the first movie. The pacing was all wrong.

Some elements were really overdone - Chani glaring and storming out repeatedly, and the overwhelming random violence from the Harkonnen; neck snapping, throat slitting and headbashing, it was all a bit cheap and cliche.

Zendayas pouty face. Drove me insane.

Feyd Rautha was a bit too moustache twirling, his evil so over-exaggerated that I didn't feel the portrayal at all - the stare and weird mouth movements made him look like a Marilyn Manson wannabe, and having 3 cannibal brides to boot was just way too much.

Christopher Walken was completely wasted here - you have one of the most talented actors ever, and he just walks around looking bored, overshadowed by his daughters plotting and screen time? When I heard Walken was the Emperor I was over the moon, I thought, now there's an actor who can go from menacingly calm to terrifyingly unhinged in an instant! But no, he just walked around looking vacant, with virtually no screen presence.

Chani and Paul's ""love story"" didn't convince me at all. They went from ""Chani doesn't like this outsider"" to ""wow they are so in love"" to ""Chani is mad because Paul is a fanatic who is now marrying this random woman"", and it all happened with such speed and so little development that I had whiplash watching it.

Way too many embryo shots. We get it, she's pregnant.

Way too much action, not enough focus on the chilling suspense and dive into faith and fanaticism that made part 1 a masterpiece. The action scenes were also repetitive - how many spice harvesters getting lasered in half do we need to see?

Sardukar still don't feel menacing. Like part 1, this supposedly terrifying warrior elite keep getting mown down faster than red shirts in Star Trek. 

Speaking of the Sardukar, NO THROAT SINGING SCENE?! Come on Villnueve, I wanted my damn fan service! People lost their shit over how cool it was in part 1, I at least expected a head nod to it in part 2.

The monochrome on Geidi Prime didn't do it for me. I know, its meant to be artistic, but it didn't look like that in the first film, it was too much, too exaggerated.

How abruptly and pathetically major players died - Raban, and especially the Baron going from full on constant perverted terror to just lying there helpless and getting stabbed. Didn't like that one bit. 

The worms, but I hated them in the first movie. The worms in Dune should have looked like the Krayt Dragon in the Mandalorian.

Speaking of the worms, Paul's solo ride was great, but how the HELL did they get a load of people plus the Reverend Mother's travel box on the back of one? I'm not surprised they didn't even attempt to show it on screen.

The whole ""no one lives in the south and its impenetrable"" thing. They are living in a super advanced future... I'm sure they could at least scan it and see.

We didn't get an explanation for the leather spider creature!!

Overall, this film felt far less alien than the first.

Lady Jessica looking terrified when Paul got stabbed... can't she see the future now? It would have made more sense if Chani looked terrified but Jessica looked calm.



What I did love:

Rebecca Ferguson. Everything about her performance blew my mind. It helps that she has an intense and fascinating face,  but she is a fantastic actress. I believed every part of her role, and watching her turn from calculating bene gesserit mother into fanatical cult matriarch was just a spectacle. She, more than anyone else, kept me glued to my seat for the entire movie. Just captivating!

Paul, AFTER he drank the water of life. Until that point, I couldn't tell if Timothy Chalamet was a cardboard, one-dimensional actor, or if he was just trying way too hard to brood to sell his sex appeal. But when he went full chaos messiah at the end, I felt it, and I realised I was way off about his acting ability. It made it all the more impactful that he only came to life at that point.

Paul walking in to stab the Baron, without anyone even twitching to stop him. It really felt like I was watching a prophecy unfold, and it was breathtaking to see.

The old Reverend Mother - as I felt myself getting swept up in the prophecy, the sudden cuts to her composed logic brought me back down to earth, and reminded me that yes, these are stories, and it's fanaticism. Powerful stuff.

All of the scenes involving Fremen fading in and out of the sandstorm - visually stunning.

Speaking of visual stunning, that first scene with Sardukar all floating up the cliff side against a red sun was probably my favourite visual in the movie. After that, the movie wasn't as stunning as I had hoped.

The scene where Chani drained a LIVING Sardukar of his water - that was the only scene that made me intensely feel empathy for another human.

EVERYTHING about the Fremen and their culture - what an experience! It was so fleshed out and there were so many scenes where I just found myself wanting to be there, and wishing it was all real.

The whole powerful psychic fetus thing, thought that was very cool.

Christopher Walken accepting the role, and therefore leaning into the meme from his Fat Boy Slim music video dance about Dune (""Walk without rhythm, and it won't attract the worm..."")

The eargasm musical score, although it didn't blow my mind like in the first one, it was still great.

"This movie was 80% great and 20% trash, which I think is the appropriate ratio.

I was laughing *at* the movie throughout, like I did while seeing the Star Wars Prequels. Unlike the prequels, I took the rest of the movie seriously. It’s a healthy balance between cinema and entertainment.

Did find that it was paced quite quickly, which is probably best for a 165 minute movie. They pack in a lot, but I feel like there was some character development or plot development that could have been added to the middle. Doesn’t kill the movie, but sometimes slowing down helps the climax feel even greater.",2024-03-07

"Really disliked it

First off, everyone is saying how beautiful it is, even the people that dislike it. But I just find the colour grading so ugly and dull. The first one was even worse, so they made it a little less ugly at least. I enjoy the cinematography framing etc. But Idk why you would choose to make your colour scheme so lifeless.

Everyone is liking the soundtrack. I really dislike it. Not memorable and just irritating. 

I didn't enjoy acting from most people, chalamet is wooden and lifeless. Zendaya seems like she's acting. They have absolutely no chemistry with eachother.

I enjoyed butler and Skarsgard a lot but their characters weren't given much to do. Very anticlimactic characters.


The characters are so one dimensional and have no charm. There's no character moments. There's no chemistry.
I don't enjoy watching any of the characters apart from the villains. How have I watched 6 hours of this series and not give a single shit about a single character.


The story is uninteresting, mainly because I don't give a shit about the characters.

The editing was terrible, felt like I was watching a music video at times.

Why was there no blood at all?? Made it feel so childish. People getting their neck slit and there's no blood. Just looked so stupid.

That ending felt so rushed. The final fight was so meh and underwhelming. Like they haven't even shown butler to be an amazing fighter. He killed one guy fairly while the rest were drugged and injured. But he had great screen presence and they have this anticlimactic end to the character. Both cool villains killed off in uninteresting ways.


I think both Villanueve and Nolan have made me realise that I value character more than anything, so I never enjoy their movies because they care more about making set pieces. I need character moments, people to care about, enjoyable dialogue. This had none of that.


Idk, Villanueve just seems to make such heartless, soulless movies that have good cinematography.


3/10 for my enjoyment of that",2024-03-10

The weighty religious and political themes as a backdrop to the ""heroes journey"" makes it so much more interesting than most of the material that Dune has inspired over the decades.

"Can someone please explain how it is possible for the desert people to have something as high-tech as the black device that they stick into the ground. What exactly does it to, and where are they getting them from? Is the reason why they always stick them in the ground to create some sort of noise, vibration that the worms dont like and therefore keep them away? 

Are they taking them from the soldiers they kill? It seems that the soldiers such as the ones from the start of the movie would have the devices on them, as they seem to be far more advanced then the desert people, plus they dont have any production facilities for guns, etc.

Not once did i see the black device they stick into the ground help them out in any way. Its not like they needed them to see a giant worm in he distance to hitch a ride on. If anything, they just punch the sand to sense if any worms are nearby, thus making the black devices that they stick into the sand completly pointless.",2024-03-08

"Part two was a miss for me. I liked Part one much better; it was a more patient, contemplative film that gave its viewers more time to digest its feast for the senses and complex plot lines. Part one was brooding and suspenseful with interludes of psychedelic seance that, combined with the brilliant sound editing, created a mystical aura that was absolutely captivating for a major motion picture of it's production quality. I never felt nearly the same sense of immersion in part two. It felt rushed, disjointed, and lacking in build-up; twice the sex and half the foreplay.... it didn't get me sufficiently aroused, and as a result, I felt unfulfilled with the climax.

I believe the director wished he could have made this a trilogy with the same exposition and pacing as the first film, but the execs demanded a faster paced, dumbed-down movie to appease the masses who generally prefer a purely visceral experience; to get off and go home without being challenged mentally or spiritually. Very sad because as a trilogy in step with the first film, this would be a landmark in cinema that would only grow in popularity over time. 

Part Two is an unfortunate product of Hollywood forsaking art for the almighty dollar. They sold out to the mainstream complaints about Part One. Pandering to dolts with the attention span of a toddler to sell more tickets. This is why we can't have anything good anymore.",2024-03-17

"tear me apart normies but as a huge fan of part 1, i found this to be the total marvel-fication of what was so great about the first. bloated, no patience, practically threw any of part 1’s transcendental style, pace and atmosphere out the window in favor of what basically are super hero antics. i love most of the moments people are raving about but i think if you enjoyed the merging of art film aesthetics with blockbuster budgets of part 1 (that was more akin to blade runner 2024), then part 2 feels like the same old fluff. would have liked it more as miniseries.",2024-03-06

Everything else is meh. It still feels like exposition to something bigger and most of the characters and relationships feel flat. The older actors were good but the younger ones felt weird.

After 2 years and almost 6 hours I feel like I didn't really get something.

Half of the movie is Paul not wanting to be the messiah and in the middle after 5 minutes he quickly changes his mind and starts blasting.

Also I still can't get over the fact the emperor came to the planet himself and not summoned the barons to him/meet at the moon or somthing and that somehow some sand warriors with swords damaged the strongest army in the universe. Feels like plot decided to let him fall hostage to Paul.

- No character development or back story on who the Freeman characters are (we still dont know Zendaya character, who is she, how did she end up fighthing, where are her parents?! SOMETHING!) 


- Why did Zendaya's friend died?! What was the reason?! And again, who us this girl?? 


- How to they put a whole tribe on top of a sandworm??? How do they jump out of it?? How??? No-sense. 


- Why did Paul went from wanting to free the Freeman, to become the emperor and start a war?! Because the blue water showed him it was the only way?! Dumb af, he could do so many different things. No logic.

Fraser and Villenueve love jerking off over scale and that's about it, there's hardly anything remarkable to admire or think about. Only the Harkonnen planet tickled me slightly.

"This movie is everything that is wrong with how hollywood big films go right now.

Let's see, I am not a long time fan of the books. I just read the first one a couple years ago, because it's a classic. I liked it, it was a small book, easy to  read, really humble in it's style, but with a lot of interesting themes touched in a really good way. 

Thus said. This movie makes me sad, of thinking the absurd escale of production expenses they should have done to shot it. The movie looks beautiful, the photography is pretty standard but really well talen care off. No shots will blow your mind or you will remember then, but they are good screensavers.

But all of that is to cover an empty shell. The movie not only again, decides to not adapt important parts of the book. They decide to dumb down all the themes they touch that appear in the book (that are not every theme) they totally make the religious people dumb fanatics, instead of victims of the Bene Gesserith, and the Bene gesserith instead of kinda sect of nazis, are just powerful woman controlling everything. This kinda desvirtuates imo the themes of the book, and also it ignores all the ecology themes.

The movie in itself it doesn't do anything above average, Villeneuve can do way better things, and the slow moving camera pans, the landscape shots, are really boring when there is no meaning behind and you abuse them. The movie does nothing special not memorable. The worst part is the transitions, that seem rushed sometimes and most are extremely abrupt. They didn't even tried to make the movie flow.

Most people I watched both movies with they barely understand the minimum of the plot. Even though wveryone said it was cool or ok, they don't see a reason as to why spend 6 hours watching it again, and are totally uninterested in a third movie.

This is because this movie is victim of Hollywood new vices. Movies have to be an spectacular event. So they just created a crazy budget, and they tried to make everything grand and apotheosic on screen, to look expensive, and also a cast full of tons of well known celebrities. Offcourse the movie has to be long so it's worth your money huh? And two parts, because that means twice as money. Offcourse the specialized magazines will need to make audience react about this big event, to get better SEO and more audience, so they will say that the movie is crazy good. Even saying is the new lotr(lmao). 

Then you get there and is just an expensive souless movie. What it really baffles me is that both movies like they are, you can fit them in one 3 hours movie,easily, and it will be better.

One of the best things of the book is how it is concise. Not too long, it has a couple scenarios, and it always has a reasonable scale. Idk why the movie had to be long, grand, tons of scenarios.

Dune, like most SciFi combat, gets ruined as soon as you apply any kind of combat logic to it.  
  
Dune isn't even self-consistent.  Sometimes the blade from Duncan Idaho travels really fast and kills people through shields, sometimes Feyd-Rautha's opponent had his blade slowed down a lot by the shield.  
  
Dune 2 was especially problematic as people on the sand can't have shields and they were getting sniped by laser rifles and large masses of troops were getting blasted with autocanons from the air.  If that's the case, all that's needed to defeat the Fremen meat wave Zerg rushes is more autocannon turrets or even a WW1 Maxim machine gun.  
  
Let's ignore the lack of shields on the sand and assume everyone has energy shields and the equivalent of medieval shields.  And the energy shields permit human max sword speeds.  If that's the case, you'd just resort to large vehicles with mechanical grinders in the front like a farm tractor, and you'd just tear through the meat waves.

"I'm finding it difficult to believe how well-reviewed this film is.

The changes to the storyline aren't just ones necessary because of the nature of adaptations or because of practical limits on the filmmaker.

They leave in developments while completely removing the context that made them notable and meaningful, destroyed entirely the political manipulation, had characters explicitly announcing their motivations (""You can't just have character say how they feel!  That makes me feel *angry*!"" -- The Robot Devil, Futurama), and turned major plot points into meaningless, incoherent nonsense.

Consider the nature of the leverage Paul brought the Fremen:  in the novel, >!he realized that the transformed Water of Life would be a catalytic poison to the sandworm ecology and would annihilate all the sandworms if introduced in the right place -- which requires Reverend Mothers with the ability to transform the Water in full knowledge that they'd be destroying the Spice, which given the consequences was something only the Fremen would possibly be willing to do.  This keeps the other Houses from invading Arrakis.!<

In this movie, >!the Fremen threaten to *nuke the spicefields*, which any one of the Great Houses could do, and most of the leaders of those Houses wouldn't be addicted to the Spice and likely wouldn't realize the consequences on the galaxy if they'd done it.  What's more, the film has the orbiting forces *not recognize Paul's leadership*, when the entire point of threatening the Spice was to force the Spacing Guild and Bene Gesserit to force the galaxy to accept the Fremen, since they are absolutely dependent on the substance.!<

Even little details like >!the Baron summoning all the Great Houses by claiming the Saudarkar had invaded and the Emperor coming alone instead of at the head of an invasion force!< made an utter mockery of the politics of the novel.

That's saying nothing of the excessive chiaroscuro which was seemingly designed to conceal the sets as much as possible.

I had high hopes after seeing the first film, and they have not only not been fulfilled, but betrayed.  Villeneuve went far beyond adapting the novels to the silver screen, but merely kept some of the events of the books without reflecting why they occurred or what they meant.

"20 minutes of weirdness and good scenes doesn’t make up for 2hr 20mins of incompetent editing, ugly cinematography, and seemingly nonexistent blocking and framing. Let’s not kid ourselves just because it is better than other big budget movies, c’mon now. This and Poor Things being so beloved genuinely makes me think modern audiences should be required to watch at least 25 movies pre-1980 so they can understand what good filmmaking is, because if this is what is considered great, cinema is dead",2024-03-04
"Love this movie. I can go on and on about the cinematic wonder it was. As a book fan, I dont care that much they didnt adapt all the elements. I think it could have been 10 mins longer with a bit more on the political drama/great houses and the spacing guild. But I get it, how many things can you focus on.

The only gripe I really have with this movie and the world building - the sword fighting makes no sense. I get the shields, they can be a danger around worms. I can even fill in the gaps from the books regarding the laser guns/shield issue. But why the hell aren't all Sardukar and even the Harkonen's using bullet guns on Arrakis? We even see how effective regular guns are when they use them to kill the Fremen in the first half. But they are still using swords? Like in the final battle charge, why didnt both sides come with guns??? Why did the Harkonen soldiers even walk with fucking sword when they obviously have regular weapons. 

I love this movie and its honestly a sci fi masterpiece but man, you cant have these powerful military forces that rule the entire universe but they can't even think about basic tactics.",2024-03-01
"So some changes between book and movie.

Isn't his sister already born when they take the capital?

"Chani getting the closing shot instead of Paul is laughable. Denis doesn’t understand what a heroes journey is. Paul is the star it’s his story it’s his movie, Chani is barely in the books, she doesn’t deserve to be on the posters opposite Paul.. I just don’t get it.",2024-03-04
"I'm not a fan of Dune, so I'm prepared for all the downvotes. I don't care, I gave it a chance (again).

This is what I wrote about Dune Part One: This movie is so boring. Nothing happens. It's all a set up for part two. It ends just when it's getting good. It's a 3-hour incomplete movie. There's nothing satisfying about it.

Fast forward three years later and we finally get part two... What a fuckin' snooze fest. There are way too many characters introduced and so much extraneous information going on. I had to go on Wikipedia afterwards just for clarification. The most thrilling part of the movie was the sandworm riding. And a whole lot of nothing happens. Then all of a sudden, Stellan Skarsgård, Dave Bautista and Austin Butler (I can't remember their character names) all die in a row. Suddenly, Paul has become kind of an asshole now, basically taking control into his own hands. When he told the princess he was going to marry her, I heard a woman behind me audibly gasp. And then it ends on a similarly disappointing note, with Chani pissed at him, and yet *another* unsatisfying cliffhanger ending.

I really can't do it anymore. Doesn't seem like Dune Messiah is in any hurry to be made, either. I should have learned my lesson with the 1984 film, way back when. I love sci-fi, but for whatever reason, this series is not for me.",2024-03-05
What a shit movie.,2024-03-06
"Let's start off with the positives: truly amazing cinematography and the highest production values on the big screen so far this year. Honestly the visuals were incredible, no complaints in that aspect.  
  
Now for the negatives: I heavily disliked the blatant white saviour trope with all of the side characters being middle eastern/black and so easily misled into following a couple of whites, it felt soooooooooo condescending and patronizing.  
  
I think one can also draw political parallels to what is going on in the real world since much of this film's plotline mirrors the Israeli-Hamas conflict with the Gazans being Freman and the Israelis being the Emperor/Harkonnens. Not neccessarily a good or bad thing, just an interesting observation.  
  
**Overall** ***Dune Part Two*** **(2024) rating: 7/10, I saw this for free with my accumulated admission points at my local cinema. Definitely worth a watch in theaters just for the spectacle alone but don't expect the usual white saviour trope to be subverted in this film.**",2024-03-10
Man these are the best boring movies ever.  I'm still pissed there's going to be a Part III.  I just want something to end already.,2024-03-04
"There’s a lot I liked about this film and some stuff I didn’t. Many people can summarize those much more eloquently than I can. 

I saw the first film again in IMAX quite recently and thought this one’s extensive use of the format helped with the scale. But I still feel like the grasp they have on using it is less than stellar. Some scenes that should’ve been in 1:43 (the missiles, the knife fight) weren’t. The scenes of the two of them in the tent felt awkwardly framed and shot and lacked energy. It felt like the filmmakers are not super comfortable with leveraging the large scale format or are still learning. I’m sure if we get Messiah it’ll be even better.

It’s an unfair comparison but I also saw Tenet again in IMAX and Nolan’s handling of it as a storytelling medium is second to none. There’s a brief shot of Debecki (whose performance I didn’t particularly care for) on the boat and the expressiveness and emotion was really striking. I didn’t find anything like that in this film. ",2024-03-04
"I just saw it my third time and it needs to be discussed....

When Jessica drinks the Water of Life and tells Paul he will eventually have to too, that's 100% not Timothee Chalamet she's talking to.

That's very clearly his stunt double and I gotta know how that ended up in the film.",2024-03-09
The music was beautiful. The scene introducing Austin Butler’s character was so intense and freaky but his character didn’t really go anywhere. Plus his accent was all over the place. The costumes were also really off for me! It was so hard to take Paul seriously in his baggy pants with the cup lol.,2024-03-10
"Movie was garbage when it came out, still gonna be garbage with different actors!!!",2024-03-01
"Can we get a new thing and not the love of someone brings back someone and then they are the one? Sand Neo. Movie was good but this tired trope took me out of it. And if the book had it and wasn't tired at the time, narrative things from the book were changed so that's a bad excuse and just feels like lazy writing in an other wise well written movie.",2024-03-04
"I feel like I must watched a different movie to everyone else.

I didn't get much chemistry from Paul and Chani and didn't really buy  the romance. Also where were the stakes here. Paul won every battle and even when  the harkonnen blew up their base it didn't effect the Frenen or Paul at all not even a life changing injury to a main character.

Plus I was hoping for the big show down between Rabban and Hurney but it lasted like 10 seconds. 

It wasn't a bad movie but I think if this was 2 120-30 min movies it could have been paced a bit slower and allowed more character development. Maybe this whole thing would have been better as an 12 episode epic mini serie.

Maybe after I rewatch it I will appreciate it more IDK",2024-03-07

"Really bad movie, what could be an amazing art and legendary one, they made it cheap “holywood superhero wins in 2 minutes all good bad guys defeated” movie. 
Out of almost 3 hours 1 full hour is a scene of this girl who looks like she is AI generated - while looking at camera or somewhere randomly. 

Also story went really stupid, main guy was strugling whole movie and at the end all changed he became most loved and defeted enemies who were presented as a rough, very dangerous, strong, etc.. in 2 minutes of action, like super easy.. of course he also killed that guy in 1 on 1 was there any doubt? And how he did it? In a most stupid way - by putting whole sword in his chest so he gets closer! Hahahahah
Of course.. what is a sword in chest for our hero.. for him that is like a mosquito bite

Also, first part was much better cause music, effects, scenes were great, now they did not so anything new but just reduced value of those amazing scenes and characters..",2024-03-25

"Ugh I got dragged to this movie last night blind. I haven’t seen the first Dune. But my friend invited me to the movies last night. I like sci-fi and fantasy so I figured how hard could it be to follow. He always drags me to Marvel movies as well and I actually ended up liking the Avengers and Thor. 

So I sit down expecting this to be a standard 1 hour 40 minute movie. 

First thing I see is the poster children of Gen Z. Kylie Jenners boyfriend aka Willy Wonka and Rue from Euphoria. Spoiler I don’t like either of them. 

How distracting they had those AirPods in their nose. AirPods go in your ears Genz not your nose. 

Anyway I hate worms in any form and  I was heavily confused by that scene because I thought he was riding a sand storm. When I found out it was a giant worm I was disgusted. 

So I decided to check the runtime because I didn’t really understand why it was cool that everyone was just getting blue eyes or talking in monotone voices. 

Also them dancing in the sand like a musicaless musical pretty much lost me. 

Clearly everyone was very important and dark and interesting but I’ve never been to a movie I couldn’t just figure out starting in the middle of the series. Tropes are all the same they rarely change. As long as you pay attention you can normally figure out the plot.

When I found out this movie was going to be as long as Lord of the freaking Rings I was done. The only movies that need to be that long are literally Lord of the Rings. 

Which I watch 2 or 3 times a year. 

So anyway I decided to sleep for a bit to get through the movie because of course we went to the cheap theater this time with the uncomfortable chairs for a 3 hour movie. I had great dreams though.",2024-03-31

"Has anyone brought up the way women in power are betrayed as evil manipulative witches? And that men are the pure right/wrong devine fighter for freedom.

I can unsee the fact that the Benij Jesturt are in the shadows mixing bloodlines and in the end holding onto power at all costs. And seeding the next generation with the same DNA as past generations. And are always present when a change of power, so they can tweak it to their preferred outcome.

I presume the books are like that because it was a time and a genre that devalued and misogynist view women in power. But I fear that women will gloss over this part of the movie to fawn over the marketing hype and cinematography.

I was not impressed with the portrayal of women in the movie. In the end the only women not in power had to leave on a worm to escape the killing of Paul's followers.",2024-03-04

Overall, it just felt like an episode of really high budget tv show. Nothing really gets resolved. One conflict is exchanged for another, the story continues forever and never ends. I hate how movies have become tv and vice versa.

I honestly think I might be done with this franchise. I really felt like this movie should have been 2 hours flat. Run time was egregious for how little happened. Checked my watch so many times I lost count.",2024-03-02

Cinematography and music was 10/10. Some of the choreography missed for me, and the random 2 minute conversation in the middle of a duel was weird. Can't really think of anything else I hated.

"When Dune: Part one came out, we took a chance to watch it on 4DX.  Seats move, vibrate, throw wind in your face, smells, flash lights.

It was an great experience for Part one.   We went and saw Jurassic World: Dominion in 4DX and it was a fucking miserable experience (movie and the features).

So going into Part two, we all decided to take a chance and go with 4DX again... and it was another amazing experience.

The ""Ride features"" are subtle enough to not overpower what you are experiencing, until it was. 

One great experience was the very beginning when the dudes got sniped in the head by the Freyman.  Air was blasted into the back of your ears and head where ever the dudes got hit with bullets.  

Another was when Paul was finally riding the grandfather worm.. it was just a rollercoaster of air, smells, and movement.

but, There was a few moments it was like ""ok, wow, this is ridculous"".   haha   When the freyman attacked the spice production area at the end and all those boulders came down...  it was like 2 minutes of bouncing.  It was a great, but also bad experience.  lol

I highly recommend watching this movie in 4DX if you can.

"The way she slowly turns into the Reverend Mother in both title and personality was very well done - one of several examples of parallel storytelling between both parts.

"I am bothered by some of the comments I've seen around here seeming, sometimes, to celebrate Fayd as somehow the ""least evil Harkonnen"" (lol?) but, with that said:

The one very interesting thing about him was that he uses a concept of honor to maintain self-control and prevent himself from falling into psychotic chaos (that's my read on him), but because he is in fact a psychopath, he also sees honor as a game, a bizarre funny falsehood.

Him repeating ""may your knife chip and shatter"" gave me chills because he was at once both entering into Paul's (and the fremen's) system of honor, full-heartedly giving respect for what he recognized as a system for maintaining control, AND mocking it as a joke, all at the same time.

And Butler did a really good job letting all that show in his manner and facial expressions.",2024-03-03

I didn’t read the books but Paul can see multiple futures happen and said there was a slim path they needed to take to get the results that was most favorable to them. Kind of like Dr Strange in Infinity War. Perhaps he knows taking Florence as his bride is the path he needs to take to lead him back to Chani while saving his people?,2024-03-01
Then Chani let off some steam but riding a gigantic sand worm back home.,2024-03-02
"Yea it's weird but the book goes into it, both Jessica and Paul realize the only way forward is to take Irulan as his wife. It was kind of like the Fremen tradition of having to best the leader in combat, the noble bloodlines are still a tradition in the universe.

The book also ends on Jessica telling Chani that much like Jessica being Duke Leto's concubine, both Jessica and Chani will be seen as the wives, despite the other women having the title.

Edit: To elaborate, in the book Chani is also much more submissive to Paul, she was in love with him basically from day one and continuously through the end. In the Emperor/Irulan scene, when Paul starts mentioning taking Irulan as his wife, Chani asks Paul if he would like her to leave, as there is nothing formal or promised between them. He responds that he doesn't want her to leave his side ever again.

Part of that submissiveness is due to a dude in the 60s writing women, but the impetus is quasi-incestuous royal bloodline traditions. Not unlike the royal families on Earth..",2024-03-02
He just is so direct it was hilarious,2024-03-01
"That actually pissed me off a bit because it's a vital scene in the books that was not at all set up. There's whole discussions about how Duke Leto never took a wife because he loved Jessica and she loved him back. Paul and Chani have a kid together, and Paul already has another wife that he takes care of (Jamis' family). Chani knew it was a political marriage and he straight up tells Irulan that he'll never have kids with her.",2024-03-03

"Yea, and I have to say: it kind of doesn't make sense because they also changed the ending in that the other great houses choose war instead of capitulating. IIRC in the book his marrying Irulan is what consolidates the power. It's almost pointless though if the other houses do end up choosing war. Also they've now called his bluff on the blowing up spice thing. And now Paul has just had all his Fremen warriors get on spaceships, to go where and do what exactly?",2024-03-02
"I legit thought he could beat Feyd easily, but got stabbed twice on purpose just so Chani couldn’t get *too* mad at him.",2024-03-05

Granted I don't have a huge TV like some people but I dread the day I rewatch this at home. While I'll surely enjoy it I just know it will never be the same as the insane vision-filling immersion IMAX offers,2024-03-01
Watching part 2 in imax made me mad I didnt see part 1 that way.,2024-03-01
"I kept thinking during the entire screening the same thing, and that there is not a single home system that can do it justice or even come close to replicate the experience",2024-03-01
"Saw it in an AMC Dolby theater, it felt like a two an a half hour ride.",2024-03-02
"Mad Max Fury Road vibes. The movie's real good, but in a cinema? Different experience.",2024-03-02
"Made for IMAX

Oppenheimer was decent in IMAX (too much personal up close shots to be fully enjoyable to be honest) 

But the wide expansive scale of Dune made it absolutely perfect",2024-03-05
"We didn't have an IMAX screen, just a superdeluxe or whatever it's resolution is... but the Dolby Atmos... whew lad.",2024-03-02
Watched it in Dolby and felt like I was riding the worms myself,2024-03-03
I saw it in Dolby. Maybe not as good of a  picture as IMAX but the sound was insane. I felt like I was inside the worm.,2024-03-03
"I've only seen 3 movies in theatre in the last 3 years, and 2 of them were Dune. Totally worth it",2024-03-06
"Got a hall pass from the family. Decided not to call any friends just headed out for a rainy sunday alone on my motorcycle. Rode from SF to the small town of fairfax to watch dune at their charming ""little"" theater. This movie reminded me why movie theaters are special. It was such a wonderful emotional experience. Escaped into the world of dune for a couple of hours.   Killers of the flower moon didn't bring that out in me lol.  That was the last movie I was excited about enough to go see in an actual theater and it was just ok.. ",2024-03-04
I saw it in a large RPX theater and was thinking that the entire time. Absolutely stunning movie.,2024-03-07
First movie I have been to with a full house in maybe 2 decades... definitely inspired me to do it more often.,2024-03-10
"I agree but I also hate that. I loved seeing it in theaters but I almost never see movies in theaters, and I feel like every movie sucks at home these days, even in surround sound on a great TV. I have a toddler so I can’t have it being theater-loud, which means dialog is basically imperceptible. Thankfully unlike at the theater, I can use subtitles at home ",2024-03-15
"I agree, just a bit loud for me though, I wish it was a bit quieter, Maybe it was tuned for a full theatre and mine was a mostly empty afternoon show, but it was on the edge of painful in a few places.",2024-03-17
Man it was surreal experiencing the movie in imax,2024-03-21
"I have an 85"" TV it's no theater but it is a decent experience",2024-04-08
Did you look at the sand? Unbelievable.,2024-03-04
"But was it made to be seen with Buttkicker™️ seats? Even without them, the audio was pretty butt kicking. I would get pretty distracted if it was any more.",2024-03-04
"I can relate to this a lot. My wife loved the first film and I didn't and she really wanted me to see the second one with her. 

Gone into it super skeptical and came out a mega fan. Absolute cinema, direction, story-telling, sound - all of it was on point!",2024-03-02
"Had not read the books before. They had always been “on my list,” but I had never gotten around to them. 

Starting the first book this week.",2024-03-03
"I think in general the changes were good decisions for the film. A couple minor gripes, but it’s hard to be upset when about anything when it turned out this well.",2024-03-02
"My mother handed me a copy of Dune 25 years ago. I've flown her across the country to see me and my family, as well as both Parts 1 & 2 as a direct result of that act.",2024-03-04
Looks like it did well at the box office too which is great to see. The first film didn’t exactly light the world on fire financially & I remember people debating on whether it was because COVID was still a thing or if people just didn’t care about Dune,2024-03-04
As a long time Dune fan this has been great. I've begun to hear Dune references being thrown into casual conversations around the office. And from people whom definitely would not have had any interest in the exploring the story before hand.,2024-03-07
"I sat next to an elderly couple, probably late 60’s. The way the sweet old lady would gasp silently at important plot points, and her husband would chuckle at obvious corny but silly points was really nice.

Story easy enough to follow but doesn’t dump a terrible amount of exposition while still being artsy 🤌",2024-03-13
I just saw Dune last night and quickly booked Dune 2. Became a big fan right away. Cant wait to pick up the books.,2024-03-16
I did not read the book nor see any adaptations. I am not a science fiction/fantasy fan (maybe I should say *was* not). I thoroughly enjoyed Dune and found Dune 2 riveting. Excellent storytelling/filmmaking.,2024-03-16
Yep. One of my students loves Dune and he feels kinda sad now because it was his weird thing. Now it's popular,2024-03-23
"I didn't know anything about Dune before this movie, maybe a bit from Warhammer 40k, this got me hyped for Dune 3.",2024-03-23
"Paul lets himself get stabbed in a non-lethal (but very NEARLY lethal) spot so he could go for the kill. It was the only way he could get Rautha to open up. You've basically got it right. 

Edit for names",2024-03-01
"They also foreshadowed him killing Rautha in this manner iirc. One of the visions he has earlier showed the shot of the last dagger stabbing Rautha, so clearly Paul knew this was coming and how to win.",2024-03-01
Yeah he pulled the blade out of himself and stuck Feyd with it while also getting stuck with his own by Feyd.,2024-03-01
I loved the callback to that. He uses the same trick Gurney showed him to beat Feyd-Rautha,2024-03-01
">Also idk if anyone noticed but that sequence was basically foreshadowed when Paul and Gurney were sparring in Part 1

Related, I like that both movies basically introduce Paul by having someone give him shit for facing the wrong direction.",2024-03-01
"I believe it's also a call back to the pain box, he endured the pain of the blade through his hand",2024-03-01
Yeah he pulled the blade out of himself and stuck Feyd with it while also getting stuck with his own by Feyd.,2024-03-01
"I liked how when Paul was on the ground and Feyd jumped on him it was just like when Paul and Gurney were sparring in part 1. Both eliminated each other, but this time Paul learned and kicked him away",2024-03-01
"In the book, Paul shoves the dagger up under Feyd-Rautha's jaw straight into his brain. Was a tad bit disappointed that's not how it went down in the movie.",2024-03-02
"yep he got stabbed with his own blade, then redirected Rautha's blade aimed at his throat to his shoulder. then grabbed the dagger stuck in his side and pulled an uno reverse card.",2024-03-01
It was also foreshadowed by the scene where Chani fires at the chopper and it can only let its shield down when it's firing,2024-03-02
"He sheathed the sword.

>""I did not come here to win,"" Paul whispered, smiling. ""I came here to kill you. Death is lighter than a feather.""

-Paul Muad'Dib Atreides, probably",2024-03-02
"Yeah not sure what happened there, felt a bit rushed",2024-03-01
I was confused by that too.,2024-03-01
To me it looked like he was stabbed in the right side but when he pulled it out it was on the left. Really weird.,2024-03-02
"Also earlier in the movie.. ""their shield only opens when they attack"". There's a constant reminder throughout the film that you have to be on your game every single second, and unpredictable. I saw it yesterday, so it's all pretty fresh still. ",2024-03-06
"That fight was very very poorly done.

They should have given more foresight into him constantly losing the battle. Then they should have laid the grounds only way to move forward is to take a step back, and overlay it with him getting stabbed, etc.

They should have also shown Feyd as far far more formidable. Not fighting drugged up prisoners of war. Gurney should have been shitting himself saying do not fight him, he's a fucking machine, he doesn't feel pain, etc. 

Instead he was obviously a bit of a nepo baby fighting drugged people, and spoilt by his uncle. Then he can easily beat the shit out of Paul who spent months/years in the desert fighting tooth and nail.",2024-03-10
"It was a callback to when he was training with Aquaman, I think.",2024-03-02
"They did this twice in the movie.. dagger about to impale the protagonist, only for it to be flipped and stabbed into the antagonist.

I wanted to see the struggle.",2024-03-07
"Yes this was my one complaint with the movie, it was the climax it should have been crystal clear and shown exactly how it happened.",2024-03-03
"He gets stabbed in the side, then directs the dagger to have it stabbed into his shoulder while his other hand deals the killing blow with another dagger I presume he had on his body somewhere",2024-03-01
"This seemed like a call back to his training in the first movie.  In the shield sparring scene he believes that he was won, but would have been stabbed by Gurney.  At that time Gurney corrects him, but he shows in Dune Part Two that his approach was actually correct.  Brilliant way to handle the scene.",2024-03-02
It references one of the first scenes of Paul when he and Gurney fought and he thinks he gets the kill but opens himself to a low attack,2024-03-14
"It's funny because in the book it explains how all that went down and why in exceptional detail, but in the movie it's just something that kinda happens.",2024-03-04
Probably paralleling how Gurney and him fought at the beginning of Part 1,2024-03-06
It’s called a ‘call back’ and Dennis most certainly did it on purpose because he is Lisan al Gaib,2024-03-11
The fight was won by Paul before it ever started. He is way more powerful. He just had to act like the fight was done properly and honorably so that the death would be accepted by the Emperor and other houses.,2024-03-01
"Terrible and cliche fight scene. Oh look, Paul gets stabbed twice (let’s ignore the poison and why this was possible and cool in the book) and then does an Arya to flip the knife from inside of him to inside Feyd while the camera is just showing their faces. Rad. Sick.",2024-03-01
Yup,2024-03-03
It was the trick he learned from Gurney in the first movie when they are sparring. Remember gurney pulled the blade from his thigh and took Paul with him.,2024-03-11
"Havnt seen any of the new Dune films, they look all sparse and flat, shot like a typical teeny dystopian flick, are they any good? Everyone says they’re epic. 

The David Lynch film was awesome, the production design was some of the best in the history of film. 

In the old Dune, Paul stabs Feyd then screams at him which splits open his chest and the earth, he no longer needed the weirding module. The sound weaponry concept is amazing and still fresh to this day.

Love this film but the book is even more vivid and impending. ",2024-03-01
"I’m pretty sure it was the chrys knife (sand worm tooth knife) that he used to kill him, but I could be wrong",2024-03-02
I noticed alot of things setup in 1 pay off in here,2024-03-04
"I assumed Paul has like an Attack on Titan thing going on from the moment he drank the blue water, and had basically already seen that he would win and how. His entire demeanor changed after that moment.",2024-03-04
"Also, maybe I need to see it again, but FR ends up with 2 blades, correct? Though he only started with the one from the emperor. I remember in the book he does pull the 2nd blade, as this is a move he displays earlier showing his sinister ways. Maybe part of the scene was cut showing more detail to some of these moves?",2024-03-04
Dennis Villeneuve has always been great with portraying giant objects(see: Blade Runner 2049),2024-03-01
"I love every scene with spice harvesters too, they're so huge",2024-03-01
"I love that shot as well, the speed at which they move on the ship does a good job of showcasing the immense scale of the thing",2024-03-01
"Speaking small details, you can see the calluses on Paul’s hands from living the Life of a freman. Great little detail",2024-03-02
Was it nukes Paul used on the sand behind the emperor's ship?,2024-03-01
"The emperors ship coming down to land was a a shot that'd be jaw dropping in most movies, but was borderline run of the mill, as everything else was also just amazingly I don't even know, sci-fi-bigger-than-life.",2024-03-02
Why emperor ship landed where they can be easily targeted by fermens,2024-03-01
And the flames coming off the Emperor’s ship.,2024-03-02
Absolutely unforgettable shot,2024-03-01
"I thought it was fun that it looked so much like a chrome HDRI ball, wonder if the VFX artists had a knowing little wink with that.",2024-03-02
"That explosion was one of the most mesmerizing I've seen at the theater. The blinding flash, the full body audio shaking, and the complete obliteration across the horizon with Paul for scale was insane. Plus, mirroring the explosion on the emperor's ship was impressive too.",2024-03-01
Pretty hard to pull of in VFX from what little I know about it. This movie was chock full of some of the best VFX work I've ever seen,2024-03-01
Absolutely my favorites shot/visual of the movie. It felt like an homage to older sci fi movies where a reflective ship was the only Cg thing we had the ability to do well.,2024-03-01
One thing irked me. Nukes. They used them and then went on around like there's no radioactivity in the area? Do they have different nukes by then or what? lol,2024-03-03
"I'm wondering about the nuclear radiation and shockwaves and stuff. Unless the mountains were really far away (I think they were shown to be not very close on the map but we don't exactly know how far they were), say 10km +, the multiple nukes should have wiped the whole area out no?",2024-03-03
Also have to thank Greg Frasier for that. His collaboration with Gareth Edwards on Rogue One was a masterclass in scale.,2024-03-03
100%. Denis misses nothing in visual storytelling.  His films are masterclass.,2024-03-03
Reflecting its own massive shadow cast on the rock. I laughed out loud out of awe because I didn't know how else to react. That shot. Damn.,2024-03-04
"So when I saw that ship reflecting the distorted world around it I immediately started contrasting it with the pristine reflection of the inside of the Seitch from their pool of water, which I thought was an amazing combo of imagery.",2024-03-04
Kudos for actually spotting that. I just got back from seeing it Cinema and didn't notice it. It's definitely one for the rewatch to spot details such as this.,2024-03-02
"I also noticed that and thought it was an incredible detail. My belief is that it is deliberately that way, so that when we improve is it's a planet it makes it clear that it is *his*, as it is even present on his ship.",2024-03-02
Dude. That thing was reflecting it's own shadow. That shit was just cool as hell.,2024-03-04
I have long said that Denis is a master of scale. I don’t know how else to put it.,2024-03-09
Did they use the nukes to blast through the shield wall?,2024-03-10
I was not expecting the sheer scale of that attack. It was so sick,2024-03-17
The dust igniting on the shields of the emperor's ship was fire.  Literally fire and the coolest scene in scifi I've ever seen.,2024-03-20
"Credit the sound design as well. Not sure how much more the subwoofers rumble for the imax showings but even watching part 1 at home with the subwoofer turned way up, the undefined giant vibrations of the sound design made me feel the size more so than the image.",2024-03-28
That was my favorite shot of either movie. It’s absolutely stunning,2024-03-02
I’m not sure how minor of a detail it was. It really stuck out to me when I saw it. Amazing work,2024-03-03
And that is exactly why he's the best fit for Rendezvous with Rama,2024-03-03
Reminded me of the shiny chrome ball they use to calibrate VFX shots in films.,2024-03-03
I noticed and loved that too. It made me wonder why it was so striking and I don’t think I’ve ever seen a reflection that clear and huge before.,2024-03-04
"It was well done. That little look of “respect, dog.” 

Also credit to the actress. She gives a brief glimpse of “oh shit”, followed by the realization that she is outmatched and can’t win this fight, and finally ends with calming herself and plotting.",2024-03-01
The vibrations when anyone uses the Voice hits so well. Also lol to the Reverend Mother calling him an abomination lol,2024-03-01
I love how they showed the before and after drinking the Life water relationship with Paul & Chani. Before she & Paul were equals and talked to another as such. After she would see him from the perspective of the crowd/followers. Even their last conversation she didn’t approach him he came to her. He truly transcended to a path she couldn’t follow.,2024-03-01
I absolutely loved the way they portrayed Feyd. He's clearly evil and a villain and yet he flat out respects Paul. He even has this little twinkle of like put away their superstitions you're better than this.,2024-03-01
"He was like:""Damn, I wanna fight this guy"". You can say what you want about him, but he respected fighting abilities.",2024-03-01
Paul using The Voice was so loud in IMAX it made my chest hurt.,2024-03-01
"Yeah, that scene was incredible! The power dynamics at play, and the way Paul asserted himself against such authority, was truly captivating. And Feyd-Rautha's reaction just added another layer of intensity to it all. Definitely one of the standout moments for me too!",2024-03-01
"Some guy sitting behind me in the theater loudly said, ""THAT'S RIGHT, BITCH!"" when Paul did that.",2024-03-01
"Put her in her place, in front of everyone too. Respect",2024-03-01
"Feyd-Rautha thinking ""damn this dude is crazay""",2024-03-02
Also Feyds face when paul killed the baron. He fucking loved it ,2024-03-02
"I'm disappointed that Paul didn't get to say the ""Look into that place you dare not look and you will find me staring back"" line.",2024-03-02
"> Feyd-Rautha

Austin Butler crushed this role. What an amazing baddie!!",2024-03-03
"I thought Chalamet was good in other things I've seen (Call Me By Your Name, Don't Look Up) and same for Butler (Masters of the Air), but in this they emerged as true Movie Stars. Chalamet takes Paul from boyish understudy to commanding messiah. Butler makes Feyd-Rautha feel like the real nephew of Baron Harkonnen and mimics Skarsgard perfectly. I was so excited for this but I never expected to come out of this thinking these two were standout stars.",2024-03-05
"I think she says ""an abomination"" at the end.",2024-03-01
He was like “that’s hot”,2024-03-03
That’s was the only time his eyes lit up. He was that shook.,2024-03-03
loved this scene,2024-03-01
This was the best moment of the movie,2024-03-02
Dude that part in the big IMAX was awesome! It send chills down my spine and probably everyone else in the theater!,2024-03-02
"What, besides honor I guess, stopped Paul from using the voice against Feyd in the fight?",2024-03-01
Abomination!,2024-03-01
"She was like ""he is him""",2024-03-02
"""Blasphemy!""


So good to see that bitch put in her place ",2024-03-04
"""abomination"" XD",2024-03-01
Haha I clocked that too. Was squinting the whole movie and that one scene he was like 😳 oh shit,2024-03-02
"Feyd constantly looking at people like 

Ya barkin in the wrong Harkonnen

(⌐■_■)",2024-03-04
"I literally laughed but mostly because she was so shook and the guy sitting in front of me said ""oh my God"" and leaned back in his seat like Paul was shouting at him instead. ",2024-03-06
"Ya and she was like ""oh hell nah!"" *Stumble stumble*",2024-03-02
Guys gone full Anakin / Vader arc right,2024-03-04
"i laughed.. Feyd had a real recognize real moment.  
Hes a psycho for sure, but i loved how would acknowlege impressive feats.. i mean he complimented Paul as he was dying",2024-03-04
I was waiting for the voice move the whole movie and this delivered at such a great moment.,2024-03-03
Yea it looked like it turned him on lmao. That was the moment he wanted to throw hands.,2024-03-04
"Paul doing that in Dune '84 with ""SILENCE!!"" has always been one of my favorite scenes too.",2024-03-05
she never recover from that stun lock,2024-03-07
Paul using the voice against the Reverend Mother made me physically recoil in my seat.,2024-03-07
Yes!!,2024-03-04
"I love how Paul just starts throwing around the voice like its nothing at the end, as a power it's absolutely terrifying.",2024-03-04
"One of the most satisfying “sit the fuck down” moments I’ve seen. Seeing it in IMAX as well, you could just feel the vibrations of him using the voice which was great.",2024-03-05
This also happened in the 1984 version so I was super excited when I saw it in the trailer.,2024-03-06
"should've said the line, ""Try looking into that place where you dare not look! You'll find me there, staring out at you""",2024-03-04
he made her smell the glove,2024-03-06
abomination,2024-03-06
"I loved that too, gave me chills when she fell back in fear.   Lbr she deserved it and more. ",2024-03-06
Why didn’t he just use the voice to say “Kill yourself” to Fayd-Rautha,2024-03-11
"My friend whispered to me in the cinema ""the bitch was rattled""",2024-03-13
Incredibly satisfying.,2024-03-18
It was finally good to see one of the actors acting. It was a hard task for all of them considering the lack of dialogue. ,2024-03-04
This is my favourite moment in the whole movie. it was just too badass. She was intimidating throughout the movie and first and Paul just made her shut up with a word.,2024-03-04
"I loved Giedi Prime. The only color I noticed was a smidge of blue through the binoculars HUD of the blonde Bene Gesserit.



What I missed was those weird spider mutant pet things from the first movie, I wanted more weird stuff like that. Although the all black hook people in the fighting pit were kinda weird.",2024-03-01
"it's nice to see something really new in the cinema. we've seen so many Re-hashes of styles, of cyberpunk, etc. but i haven't seen anything like this ever before.


it did however remind me of a non-organic and non-phallic version of HR Giger's designs for Jodorovsky Dune, combined with Denis' brutalistic architecture",2024-03-01
Denis Villeneuve’s favorite color is diegetic greyscale. ,2024-03-01
Best scene in the movie IMO. It's so foreign and strange to us but yet it's so fucking cool,2024-03-01
It would have been an even better touch if Austin Butler left the planet only to realize his clothes weren't black this whole time and he's actually dressed like a clown.,2024-03-03
"And the crazy thing, is that they are all 100% humans.",2024-03-01
"Geiger for life

Edit: Giger",2024-03-01
“Diegetic greyscale” is a cool and appropriate phrase,2024-03-01
"Very similar to the scene on Salusa Seconds in the first movie.  The Sardukar are made out to be terrifying and alien.  Also, by far the most Warhammer 40k scene of the movies.  No surprise there since 40k borrowed heavily from Dune.",2024-03-02
The fireworks somewhat reminds me of the Arrival alien's circular symbol language..,2024-03-02
"I might be tripping slightly but when the Bene Gesserit were walking into the room where Lady Fenring was waiting for them, I felt like I saw the color sap away as they got closer to the balcony.",2024-03-03
I wanted like 2h movie about Geidi Prime. Absolutely stunning.,2024-03-04
"But it never, ever looked fake. Every single set looked practical, authentic, and just straight up real. That's the craziest part, especially with how easy it is to cut corners on production design these days. I fully believed Feyd and Lea Seydoux were in that hallway together.",2024-03-07
I didn’t know the Harkonnens were the Engineers that created the Xenonorphs…,2024-03-02
They used infrared filming for those scenes and it was perfect in portraying the truly alien nature of that planet.,2024-03-02
It was shot in infrared for that effect according to Villeneuve.,2024-03-03
"One of the Giedi prime scenes looked like the nazi party rallies. I said something like ""nazis, but in black and white"" to my friend at the cinema. His reply: The nazis *were* in black and white.",2024-03-03
"I'm torn, because I agree with everything you said, but I also think the way the Harkonnens were visualized as pale goth weirdos undercuts an important message in the book about how extreme opulence is often a mask for depravity, exploitation, and brutality.

The Harkonnens of the book are extremely beautiful (the Baron and Rabban excepting -- although the Baron was said to be beautiful in his youth) and obscenely wealthy. Their subjugation and enslavement of others feeds this wealth, and under that veneer of beauty they commit sickening and unspeakable acts of hedonism. Having them look like what an obvious sicko would look like kind of undercuts the message of atrocity being hidden beneath a veneer of beauty.",2024-03-03
"Absolutely genius movie switching to black and white for the for the arena scene. I leaned over to my friend and just said ""This looks so fucking cool."" We were in total agreement.",2024-03-03
The black robes of the GB turning white in the sunlight. *Mwah.*,2024-03-03
No wonder Harkonens and Feyd especially are so crazy. I would lose it too if I was on such a black lit planet entire time lol,2024-03-03
Makes me wonder how the only fatty besides Vlad is that random servant presenting the blades,2024-03-02
"The only thing I disliked about the Giedi Prime scenes was the ""Berlin Nazi March."" Like yes we get they're evil but c'mon we don't need that cliche.",2024-03-01
that was probably cinematically my favorite part about the movie. the scene in the coliseum or whatever it is was bone chilling the way all the harkonnens move in the stands. it reminded me of north korea the way the people there have to act all happy everytime they see their leader except this was supposed to be real. the grayscale effect was insane put together with the music,2024-03-17
I thought it was just a creative choice to make it black and white to show it's a flashback lol. Now I like it better seeing it the way you do,2024-03-01
"Thought maybe it was under an eclipse, but yeah, maybe it's a different colored sun.",2024-03-01
H.R. Giger would of liked it.,2024-03-02
They shot most of those scenes in infrared,2024-03-03

The Fremen attacking the other houses is the only option they have to try to secure the planet for the Fremen. Not attacking them is a death sentence.

It is almost a childish attitude for Chani for us but for her is the natural Fremen way, letting the outsiders do what they do while the Fremen do what they do.",2024-03-15

Those shots perfectly drove home this concept which is incredible,2024-03-01

Feyd is a lot less outwardly psychotic. The Baron is training Feyd to be a charismatic leader. He wants Rabban to be a brutal oppressor so that Feyd can later go in and overthrow Rabban to make the people of Arrakis think he's a hero.

Feyd tries to assassinate the Baron but fails. The Baron strikes a deal with him and promises to make him emperor.

Paul threatening to do that meant that he has really gone mad with power and was prepared to destroy the entire empire as we know it if it meant getting his revenge. Also I hate that they made the Holy War about fighting with Landsraad now. At the end of the novel Paul already had the control of the entire world. There was absolutely no strategic advantage to starting the Fremen Jihad. It was not a reaction to the Landsraad’s declaration of war. The only reason it happened was that when Paul set on his quest to revenge his father and gain absolute power, he has set off on the path of being the cause of the greatest genocide the galaxy has ever seen.

"> Overall I think it's a great adaptation, faithful to the spirit of the book, and streamlines the perhaps overly dense plot to make it more accessible. 

Interesting. Because that was something that left me going ""huh?"" at points. I definitely did not find the plot as pleasing as you. My thoughts:

* The pacing was weird at times, the transitions with all the implied developments–e.g., the mighty force of the Muaddib and his fremen fighters–were a bit abrupt.

* Paul's transition into the Messiah, the catharsis of him deciding to make the move, it lacked something.

* So many of the points you mentioned definitely brought back memories and I wished they were included (partially, not as a whole saga themselves). Especially the bits about the Spacing Guild, the Bene Gesserit's conspiracy, Chani & Leto and then the spice trade.

* Chani's disappointment/anger at the end... that was a letdown to me. It just screamed ""we should put in some romantic drama and connect it to politics in a way""",2024-03-29

"Very smart way to do it though. I love how the underdog (aka protagonist faction) in this movie went full on Machiavellian route immediately to increase their chance of success, which also realistically paid off very well.",2024-03-02
"Am I missing something or did she just say ""we must convert them, starting with the weak and vulnerable"" and then one time tell some people to spread the word? I thought we were going to be in for some scenes where she does some harsh stuff to convince people.",2024-03-10
I was worried he would come off as Austin Butler in large head makeup but he was completely captivating. ,2024-03-01
"I fucking loved it! I was very curious what kind of voice he was gonna use. Stellan was basically just doing blubbery Stellan, and Dave Bautista didn’t change his voice really either. I was *not* expecting him to just go full “Vaguely Swedish Skarsgard.” He nailed it, too.",2024-03-01
"Austin Butler blew me away - I genuinely thought his Elvis was just meh, but now this? This was impressive",2024-03-01
I had read he studied animals in prep for the role and I totally saw it in the gladiator ring and his little animalistic facial movements. Really creepy and disconcerting,2024-03-01
"His face and big ass head was soo perfect for the role that he didn't even need to say anything and would've been great. And you can tell he trained his ass off for the fight, they barely showed Chalamet since he might have used his stunt doubles more, the camera was all over Butler.",2024-03-01

Awards time come around the cast should get some love but Butler is on a different level,2024-03-01
I honestly thought he was Skarsgard's son the whole time because of how much he sounded like Stellan. Was surprised when I checked the credits afterward,2024-03-02
Surely they could have found an actual Skarsgård for the role though? There’s so many of them lol,2024-03-01
I immediately was like “oh my mom (the biggest Elvis fan I know) won’t like this”,2024-03-01
Yea I thought he looked ridiculous in the trailer but he was a great character in the end.,2024-03-01
He’s almost too good at sounding like Stellan. I found myself confused about which one of them was talking a few times,2024-03-02
I genuinely thought it was Bill Skasgard,2024-03-02
Honestly Feyds first line sounded just like his Elvis voice to me which was LOL. But then he became a bad ass villain that i wish we got more of.,2024-03-01
"I wanted Barry Keoghan as Feyd from the moment Villeneuve confirmed the character would be in part 2, but Butler won me over with his performance. I still think Keoghan would have been great but don't know if he would have had Butler's intimidating physicality.",2024-03-01
(flits tongue),2024-03-01
He is who Jared Leto thinks he is,2024-03-04
That was such a cool flourish. Made total sense in the plot and it was a convincing take,2024-03-01
It was very much a Bill Skarsgard impression and it was weird to me that they didn't just cast another Skarsgard but I was also very much here for it,2024-03-04
Kiss my feet!,2024-03-01
Damn I fully thought that was a Skarsgard until I read this comment. I did honestly hate how much they had shot to be like LOOK AT HIS PROMINENT BROW BONE while he stared into the camera like pennywise.,2024-03-02
I thought it was Alexander skasgard at first lol,2024-03-03
I'm mildly embarrassed for thinking it was his son Bill the whole movie.,2024-03-01
"I was so confused because I thought, ""Why is Stellan Skarsgard talking here?""  Then I started thinking, ""Is this some clone of the Baron?  Are they using Stellan's voice to convey that but a younger actor?""",2024-03-04

"I honestly thought they dubbed Stellan's voice over his it was so convincing!

Felt bad for the actor that he got overdubbed. Little did I know.",2024-03-13
He nailed the impression sometimes and sometimes he just sounded like a generic Pirate.,2024-03-01
No he didn't. He faded in and out of it. It was irritatingly inconsistent.,2024-03-01
He was fantastic! I was seriously so bummed we didn’t see his character survive the Gom Jabbar. ,2024-03-03
Yeah I was very pleasantly surprised and I felt like he stole every scene he was in and I couldn't help but want to see more of him.,2024-03-03
He stole the movie. We're supposed to hate and disgust the harkonnens but you had to love him for how pure he was a la kal drogo. ,2024-03-04
My only complaint is that he shines so briefly. It would've been better if they'd shown more of him unleashing terror upon Arrakis prior to the final confrontation.,2024-03-03
"He was great in Elvis, but I agree it kind of seemed that maybe that's just because he's like that in real life.",2024-03-02
He reminded me of Bill Skarsgard's Pennywise and Ledgers' Joker in the best ways,2024-03-05
"I’m having trouble processing that that was him. I truly didn’t know it until I came into this thread. He’s so uninteresting in Masters of the Air; completely, COMPLETELY dominated this movie.",2024-03-02

"Yeah he's really impressed me every time I see him.  Seems like a genuinely humble and decent guy as well, really excited to see where he goes with his career",2024-03-04

Why did you ever have any doubts?,2024-03-05
"I knew he was the real deal at the end of Elvis when it switches from Austin to real footage of Elvis and I was like ""oh that's what Elvis looked like!""",2024-03-16
Seriously! Going into the movie I was wondering who they had cast to be Paul's foil. Had to be someone who felt legitimate standing across from Chalamet. Butler was some inspired casting and he fucking killed it.,2024-03-08
"It’s as if people didn’t see Once Upon A Time in Hollywood.  If Quentin deems you good enough, you’re good enough.",2024-03-12
"I remember back when he just had recurring or guest roles on shows like Arrow and Switched at Birth, but I definitely remember liking him a lot when he was the lead for The Shannara Chronicles.  I know people like to give that show shit, but I enjoyed it enough and could already tell he had some serious talent.

Now to see his success with this and Elvis just feels wild.  Good on him, dude’s killing it.",2024-03-18

"If that’s your idea of a cruel ploy, sign me up for another!",2024-03-02
Didn't read the books so he's probably a much-worse character compared to the movie version but he's kinda doing something for me lol. Probably partly due to Austin Butler's effect but stiiiiill,2024-03-02
And letting the Chosen One penetrate him for the big finisher? Por que no,2024-03-02

"His boyishness was a welcome choice because his was a previlaged boy from a Nobel house who was mostly sheltered but also trained. That came out in his mannerisms and his capabilities. Also, it is a great visual-auditory whiplash when the switch happens and he becomes this ruthless, commanding presence.

My problem with Timmy, in one and most of two, is his tendency to mumble act. Just a personal grip of mine, makes him seem like a monotonic sad boy. Works a bit in two, but he should've been a bit more expressive, his emotions were pretty plateau throughout. But from the Southern Sietch speech onwards, in combination with his acting and Denis' directing, Paul embodied the presence of an unreachable figure.",2024-03-01

Am I alone in thinking this is Bardem best performance yet.,2024-03-01
Bardem also got the laughs in my theater,2024-03-01
"Yeah making him a cheerleader immediately instead of over time was a smart move, gave the movie some levity seems the audiences are enjoying",2024-03-01
"""I'm not the Messiah""





""He is the Messiah!!!""",2024-03-01
"I love the way Villinilli managed to sprinkle humor in like that. The setting is so severe, strict and strangling, and then he hits you out of the blind zone. Like you say, Javier nailed the delivery, I just appreciate how it was made room for it to begin with.",2024-03-01
Stilgar was the greatest hype man in this movie and I loved it.,2024-03-01
"Stilgar is on a fucking wild ride, imagine having a literal god of your religion walking beside you >!twice in fact with the second one even more immortal and alien!<",2024-03-02
"Paul: \*breathes\*  
Stilgar: ""LISAN-al-GAIB""",2024-03-01
"Same, I was bursting out laughing every time he talked about Paul throughout the movie. Which made his final scene in the movie the sadder/more tragic, as he shouts PARADISE with a smile and his eyes full of faith.

EDIT: Watched it a second time (I enjoyed the movie even more)! Stilgar doesn't say ""Paradise"" nor does he wear a smile, instead he shouts ""LISAN AL-GAIB! LISAN AL-GAIB!"" with fanatical eyes as they ready for battle. However, he does get overly enthusiastic when Paul says, ""Show them paradise"" just a little prior. The effect is the same.

EDIT 2: Javier Bardem delivers a fantastic performance as Stilgar.",2024-03-01
"At first, I thought it was full on funny, but the real magic I think is how I came around to it by the end. When everyone is chanting it and holding their blades up, I half wanted to join them lol",2024-03-02

"I never understood the term ""ate/devoured the role"" before. Now I get it. Bardem just feasted every time he was on the screen. He was glowing the entire time.

I'd love to see interviews with him talking about this movie.",2024-03-03

Myself and partner were cracking up the entire time thinking of the life of brian,2024-03-04
Reminded me of that scene in Life of Brian,2024-03-08
Same thing happened in my theater,2024-03-10
Watched it in religious Texas. The humble line was met with very uncomfortable silence,2024-03-25
"This scene is my biggest complaint about this movie. It made Stilgar and his men seem childishly naive. In the book he's a hard, perceptive person. The way he should have been portrayed is as someone who believes in the Bene Gesserit mythology so completely that he can't perceive evidence that it might be wrong. ",2024-03-02
It was so funny,2024-03-01
Yeah my audience laughed at a lot lol,2024-03-02
"I loved how his devotion was mostly played for laughs, but in that pivotal moment when Paul was casting a huge shadow of doubt, he doubled down, and we get a good look at his shear desperation and need for Paul to live up to the legend - ""I don't care what you believe; I believe it!"" Great moment.",2024-03-04
Stilgar was acting like he was a character in Life of Brian.,2024-03-04
stilgar makes a great hype man! 😂,2024-03-06
So funny,2024-03-11
"There were time I thought I was watching Lawrence of Arabia's Anthony Quinn instead of Javier Bardem. Same character, different movie, resemblance is uncanny",2024-03-12
"My mind immediately went to The Life of Brian: ""Only the true messiah would deny his divinity.""",2024-04-06
I hated that. People laughed when Mohiam said Abomination. Such an underwhelming second half of a pretty good adaptation.,2024-03-01
I can't imagine anything worse than paying laughing during this film,2024-03-02
That's exactly what the Messiah would say!!!,2024-03-01
"I immediately tought of the Scene in Life of  Brian, it is so similar",2024-03-01

""I'm not the messiah!""

""Only the real messiah would deny his divinity.""

""Alright fine I am the messiah""

""HE IS THE MESSIAH!""


I'm paraphrasing from memory but that was essentially the exchange.

Edit: formatting.",2024-03-02
The fact that Paul even picked a similar sounding name for himself Muadilb which is just phonetically similar to Mahdi with extra letters LoL,2024-03-02
">The Mahdi is too humble to say that he’s the Mahdi. Which means he’s the Mahdi*

Lol, same in my theater. Everyone burst out laughing in this scene",2024-03-02
Same here! He played it perfectly. Zealotry that’s almost comical. Until the moment that he’s leading a Holy War in Paul’s name.,2024-03-02
Javier Bardem and his fanaticism was the best part.,2024-03-02
"Seemed very Life of Brian, honestly.",2024-03-03

Huge credit to TC. He pulled off a level of intimidating presence I didn't think he was capable of.,2024-03-01
"I also loved the part where he absolutely publicly addressed and shut down that ludicrous-for-the-occasion protocol where *only leaders should be allowed to speak and since he's not, he should kill Stilgar then & there so he can take his place just to speak.*

"Whole time he’s basically saying:

 I've seen a lot of movies in theaters, but the last time an experience felt so large, satisfying and complete was LOTR. If the third movie is anywhere near as good as the second, it'll be one of the best trilogies, period.


Also, I haven't seen a single other person mention it, but the first scene with that deep orange tone with the Sardukar getting picked off one by one and the bodies raining down was when I was ride or die for that movie.

"So long as you're on top, as the worm starts to submerge.... you'll just end up on the top of the sand anyway, right?

Canonically, being kept above the sand (via the pried-open scales revealing the sand-vulnerable parts of their anatomy) eventually exhausts the worm, as it's not natural behavior for them. Presumably, as they get tired they get a little easier to handle and less dangerous overall to manage which is probably important for the transport of non-fedaykin (they also probably use smaller, less powerful worms for this). For a long range trip like the one to the south, they likely ride them to their maximum exhaustion and then dismount.

For riding them right into the thick of battle, that's probably a great deal more risky and reckless, as fitting the leadership of the Lisan al-Gaib :)",2024-03-01

My theory is just that everyone has a little sled for this situation and they all pull them out at once and just say “okay! On 3… everyone get your sand sled and jump! 1…2…3!! JUMP” and they just sled down a sand dune off the worm.,2024-03-10

"I love how Denis made Chani an actual voice of reason. It feels like there is no character in the original novel that says ""Maybe this isn't right""",2024-03-01
">It just feels like maybe these people aren’t the best role models for Paul

It's a shame because his only *true* role model was ripped away from him in Duke Leto.

Compare how Paul's father talked about him ""answering the calling of being a leader"" in the first film to all of the advice given in this one. I sincerely think if Leto was around Paul would have at the very least had a real sage to lean on for advice.

Ultimately, by removing the Duke from Paul's life, the Emperor ultimately fucked his own rule in a self-fulfilling prophecy kind of way.",2024-03-01
"> Not to mention Paul’s mother who at times feels like is filling her own agenda. 

Once she drinks the water of life, her entire perspective is informed with the past knowledge of her previous Reverend Mothers, and shes literally scheming and plotting with her unborn daughter that has the same memories and knowledge telepathically...

That'll change a person....",2024-03-01
"There were LOTS of examples of roles being reversed or changed, and some great use of contrasts thematically and visually:

-Paul bringing Mohaim to heel using the voice, after being helpless before her in Part One

-The Emperor on his throne and all powerful above the Baron, before being brought low and appearing weak before Paul

-The Baron himself before the Emperor, being physically unable to bow due to his size, reluctance, and lack of practice

-Stilgar being aloof and disinterested in Leto/Paul in Part One, before becoming a mentor and then fanatical zealot in Part Two

-Jessica being a concerned mother and wayward student of Mohaim in Part One, to becoming a cold and calculating Reverend Mother in Part Two

-Gurney being the harsh teacher to Paul in Part One, to being easily outmatched by him in Part Two",2024-03-01
"Speaking of Gurney part and him suggesting to use atomics, it's weird they didn't point out how they are banned in this universe and it's authorization for everyone else to annihilate you if you use them offensively (which I'm not sure if Paul did in the movie to blow up that mountain?)",2024-03-01
Thank you. You explained exactly what I loved— each character isn’t just a side character to some side plot… all these characters and plots really feel well put together.,2024-03-01
"One of my favorite lines in the book is where Paul says that Stilgar  was no longer a friend he was a follower, they totally portrayed that so well in the movie.",2024-03-01
I’m not certain that I love the tonal shifts in Jessica in this movie adaptation but it works well enough. Rebecca kills it of course.,2024-03-01
The Herberts wrote Dune to be a very conscious warning (and semi-satire) of the dangers of strong men dictators. Paul is meant to be scary and Leto is meant to be self-aware.,2024-03-01
"Gurney is totally the Yoko Ono of this scenario.

The scene where Chani keeps trying to stand up and be the only voice of reason against a holy war that will turn the galaxy into a graveyard, and Gurney just keeps pushing her down and silencing her… in the moment it was funny but in retrospect it’s horrific.",2024-03-03
"I've always likened it to being an inversion of the hero's journey. Refusing the call to action because he knows the true nightmare at the end of the road, surrounded by mentor characters who push and pull him to the worst extremes of humanity. It's a beautiful story and really shows that the only difference between a hero and a villain is the point of view.",2024-03-03
I had a great time but had some holes I'd love someone to be able to explain.  Why suddenly when Austin Butler's character comes to town can they just pelt the base with artillery?  Why do they suddenly know where they are and why didn't his brother do that earlier?  Also they keep saying the South of the planet is uninhabitable because this giant dust storm around the equater blocks them off.  Why can't they just fly in to the southern hemisphere from outer space?  They have literal space ships and could explore the southern lands.  It makes no sense to me.,2024-03-03
"Zendaya absolutely killed the acting in this role. Never overacted, whenever something hit her character in her soul you could see just a faint microexpression of grief or disgust, then back to her disciplined resolved face. Just a little twitch lets you know exactly how it affects her

Also thought it was funny that her ""real name"" sounded so similar to just zendaya lol",2024-03-01
"It’s like Chani says to him, something along the lines of their fates were already designed. Much of what makes Paul become who he is by the end of the film is the combination of his Mother, Gurney and Stilgar and the ways they view and have used Paul.",2024-03-02

"I love that shot of the barons body dumped in the desert crawling with insects picking him apart, the fat ravenous eater gets eaten lol",2024-03-01
On my second watch I was kinda lingering on the lines between Paul and Leto from the first movie “And Grandfather fought bulls for sport! Yes! And look where that got him.” With house Atreides being associated with the Bull it kinda came full circle.,2024-03-01
Wow I couldn't hear him say that line because the music was louder than the vocals,2024-03-01

That whole scene was cold. I was expecting the Emperor's soldiers + Harkonnen's in that room to engage Paul and the Fremen straight away however they all stood their ground and watched in fear as Paul just walked up to the Baron for the kill.,2024-03-01
"I liked how the  film makers were paying homage to alia killing the baron in the book with the Gom Jabbar by having Paul say the ""You die like an animal"" line, mirroring the reverend mother telling him that Gom Jabbar was to distinguish between human and animal and that whole interaction",2024-03-01
“An animal caught in a trap will gnaw off its own leg to escape. What will you do?”,2024-03-01

"Absolutely loved how cool every mechanism sounded. the Fulton? engineers, guys who make the sound effects just forget the name, did a fantastic job",2024-03-01
Paul's arc was really well done. Timo pulled it off so well.,2024-03-01
"The use of the thumpers to imitate the diegetic beating of war drums, right before the final assault, was incredible.

Just an amazing fusion of sound and picture throughout the whole film.",2024-03-02
"The way the soundtrack meshes with the in-universe events. The sound of the Orthopedocopters (I know its wrong but its the word that intercepted my mind and it chuckled me) so menacing, outerworldly and just.. plain right.",2024-03-01
"> Zimmer left a lot of his extended ideas for this film

One of my main takeaways, the music in the first was unique (and good), but I've only relistened to the soundtrack once since as nothing really ""hooked"" enough for me to relisten.  

Several scenes here it really built up into crescendos, and I can't wait to blast through it on some headphones in the office.",2024-03-01
I was struck by the use of bells when Paul's ascendancy was finalized.,2024-03-01
"> I can’t wait to go again.

As someone who saw it twice already, it's better the second time. The first time I was probably too tense about if it would live up to expectations, the second time, knowing it's a masterpiece, made me enjoy it so much more.",2024-03-01
"it’s also interesting that despite the BG inventing the prophecy and tipping the scales, paul really does accomplish all sorts of crazy shit, see the future and defeat the invaders with seemingly no other options. he obviously grows egocentric and power hungry but it’s hard to see what the preferable alternative is (thus far in the story)",2024-03-01
I also love how as the movie progresses he looks more and more and more like his father (the hair and face almost resembled Oscar Isaac to the t especially during the finale).,2024-03-02
The creepy freaky white skin and pale atmosphere on the Harkonen planet was crazy well done.,2024-03-02
"Regarding your second point, there was a on overhead shot of him going through a crowd of fremen it stuck out to me that they avoided the “spot the main character” trope",2024-03-02
This movie had the best cinematography ever,2024-03-02
I was really hoping to get some of those Atreides family pipes again.,2024-03-06
I'm glad the wailing was toned down this time. It was too much for me in the last one and was bordering on Junkie XL Snyder Cut territory,2024-03-02
"> Zimmer left a lot of his extended ideas for this film: he really enabled the music to transport us to a new soundscape.

I loved Feyd-Rautha's theme in the coliseum--it reminded me of the opening of Genesis by Justice.",2024-03-07
The sound design was incredible. Absolutely amazing,2024-03-12
When I look at timothee I think of that rolling stone cover they did of that guy that was responsible for the Boston thing,2024-03-01
"I agree with the soundtrack. There was a drum sequence that sounded akin to Bane’s theme as he climbs out the prison. The only gripe I have about his music choices is the motif of the screaming lamentation of a woman as a reoccurring one. It’s nice, but I feel he should have used it less.",2024-03-03
"> Timothée went from an absolutely suave young man in the first act to a completely believable figurehead of religious fanatics.

I was actually thinking that he still looked too lanky and kinda out-of-place in some parts.  And then I started thinking about casting what-ifs on who else Denise could've cast in the Paul role that could achieve the same kind of magnetism that Chalamet had in the movie.  Closest I could come up with was Dev Patel, but beyond that, I couldn't think of any other young male actors that could've pulled this performance off.",2024-03-01
"Yeah but, is it fanatics if he can actually see the future and read minds? Buuuuut he's still bringing the entire galaxy down so yeah.",2024-03-02
Legit the best performance of his career and he is only in the late 20s,2024-03-01
Been feeling for a while that he’s the new Leo. Teen heart throb looks but he has the acting chops and is making excellent career choices. He’s an Oscar winner in the making and I wouldn’t be surprised to see him go down as one of the greats of his generation.,2024-03-01
"Big time. I've enjoyed Chalamet's previous roles but they've never blown me away. Was beginning to feel that we were getting a little inundated with his castings.

But this performance puts him over the top for me. Just wow.",2024-03-01
Back in the Summer of 2014 I interned for a film company in NYC. Guy in program went to NYU with him and said he was going to be the next big star (I hadn’t heard of him yet) so sort of thought he was blowing smoke. Interstellar came out later that year and I was like wow he was right! Now…it’s like holy shit that guy might have been more right about that than I’ll be about anything ever.,2024-03-03
Wonka was a smash success and his next movie is looking like it’s going to be a smash success also.,2024-03-02
You could say the same for Austin Butler as well...,2024-03-01
"the last 3 movies I've seen him in were Little Women, Wonka, and Dune 2. his versatility and acting ability are top notch",2024-03-11
"Between Wonka and his pointless appearance in Don't Look Up I've been worrying that he's getting oversaturated in Hollywood, but this performance assuaged all my doubts.",2024-03-05
"I had my doubts with him even after film #1 because he’s so slight he looks like a strong wind would blow him over, but he was EXCEPTIONAL. I can’t imagine someone else doing better.",2024-04-02
"I know it’s not exactly the same as riding a giant worm, but that scene gave me a visceral flashback to when I was first learning to surf. The details in that scene are crazy and really pull you into the experience when it could’ve easily looked goofy.",2024-03-01
"The scale in this movie (and previous one) was massive and Denis absolutely know how to put it on screen. Fraser’s cinematography was brilliant as well, Worm ride, the atomic explosion, ships, cities, arena scene with Feyd.  everything was jaw-dropping. Definitely a movie you wanna see on a biggest screen possible for you.",2024-03-01
"Just got out of the movie and damn was that first worm ride was amazing! The sound and visuals were bomb. It was almost too good because I couldn’t stop thinking the rest of the movie how the hell do they get off those things. 

I also found the baby worm very cute, whoops!",2024-03-01
Absolutely agree! The anticipation of the worms arriving is so intense! That scene alone was worth the price of admission,2024-03-01
"A grandfather of a worm! One of my favorite tropes is when the locals/pros are like, “Give it a try, rookie!…. Oh shit, that’s too hard for your first try!….. OH SHIT, he did it!?”",2024-03-01
"That scene was insane and amazing in IMAX, but really every scene was insane and amazing in IMAX - the Geidi Prime arena fight, the impact of ""the voice"" in the final scene, and the final battle to take Arrakeen",2024-03-01
The only downside to watching this in IMAX is the fact that I didn’t have literal sand hitting my face at 300km/h. Sure I’d be bleed and die but it’d feel real. It felt too real to the point I wish I was on a roller coaster instead lmao,2024-03-01
"And the sound? Everytime the worm rammed into a sand dune, I could feel it in my bones",2024-03-01
"Agreed! Another thing I loved is we didn't really get full on worm with riders on it until the final battles. Those worms coming in above the sand towards the Sardaukar on IMAX was absolutely incredible, I was grinning in my seat like a little kid",2024-03-01
I was blown away by how realistic that scene felt. Honestly insane that they basically made riding a giant sand worm through the desert feel 100% believable.,2024-03-01
"Hands down one of, if not the, coolest scenes I've ever seen",2024-03-01
"I wasn't expecting that scene to be nearly that compelling, it's so kinetic",2024-03-01
"Agreed that scene particularly stood out in IMAX, absolutely incredible experience in theaters.",2024-03-01
It worked really well in 4Dx. Felt like I was trying to grip onto my seat with my arse cheeks.,2024-03-03
"Yeah, I was gonna say that hey, if you've already seen this part in the trailer, this would be a good time for a bathroom break if you're holding it in and really need to go but goddamn, the scene just elevates itself in an IMAX theater.",2024-03-01
"That was my favorite scene, especially in IMAX. I was unconsciously pushing myself so far back into my seat I felt like I was in a centrifuge. Just incredible.",2024-03-01
sounded like the walls were going to cave in,2024-03-01
I keep repeating this comment. Best use of imax sound systems I’ve ever experienced,2024-03-01
"I stopped watching trailers since man of steel came out. I mean that movie wasn't good but I remember distinctly waiting for scenes from the trailer, basically ruined the experience.",2024-03-02
">they gave away a good portion of the scene in the first trailer and it didn’t at all take away from the scene in context.

I felt this away about the moment when you see the three sand worms emerging through the dust cloud kicking off the Fremen assault. I'd already seen the shot in the trailer but the way the tension is built and it breaking with that absolutely floored me",2024-03-03
This is why I don't watch trailers anymore. I went in completely blind and it was amazing.,2024-03-03

Earlier he did one of these breakdowns on the Gom Jabbar scene in part 1, also with Vanity Fair.",2024-03-30
That scene was also the preview after the recent Dune encore release in IMAX.,2024-03-01
It was the final battle for me. I can't even begin to describe it in words. Just so much going on in so many ways,2024-03-01
It was crazy just thinking of how he would even be able to do it with the hooks. Then when he threw it I realized the next step,2024-03-01
Yeah this was one of my favorite scenes,2024-03-02
Exactly this! It reminded me of the Interstellar docking sequence. You just forget where you are and let the music and the visuals take over you. I feel sad for anyone not watching that scene in IMAX. The whole room shook and it legit felt like an experience I haven't had in a long time!,2024-03-04
"Only concern is I’ve heard Messiah pretty much skips over the war, while the war has been this huge setup in the films to the point of being Part Two’s direct cliffhanger. I certainly hope that’s not skipped.",2024-03-01

"I really like her uncertainty about Paul after he came back from water of life.

"Completely agree, it would have wasted zendayas role to have her just be kind of a cheerleader for Paul who is totally on board for him to be lisan al gaib like she is in the book. Also cutting out Leto 2 made sense for pacing and just screen time in general.",2024-03-01
"In theory it's a great change, but in practice it felt forced. People are in large part a product of their environments, and we literally don't get any insight into why Chani is seemingly the only Fremen on the entire planet who is against Paul's ascendance by the end of the movie.

There is some lip service paid to Northerners being less superstitious, but by movie's end we don't see a single person other than Chani who hasn't bought into Paul. It just felt like the filmmakers wanting Chani to have more agency rather than the story demanding it. I get why they want her to have agency, but the whole point of the story is that the Fremens' agency has been subtly and systematically undermined for centuries. 

If they wanted to sell Chani being different, they should have explored the fact that her mother was Liet Kynes. Having a parent who was an agent of the Imperium would at least offer Chani a different perspective that could conceivably explain her detachment from the prophecy that sweeps up the rest of her people.",2024-03-03
"Copying another commenter here, but they mentioned how the child actor in Arrival was the weakest part of the movie.

"I actually love the brief glimpse that we see. “I love you, brother.” Chills.

I do wish we could have the actors interact more though in that scene. If I remember correctly Alia is very supportive of Paul for a long time. Maybe Paul could have held her hand and speaks with her briefly for the film? I want a little more humanity to the films than what I think books sometimes lack.",2024-03-01
"Pregnant Jessica talking to her unborn child was more unnerving than child Alia could've been on screen, imo. The book has the benefit of playing with our imagination and can force the uncanny valley aspect of a mature personality in a toddler's body. But that in a visual medium would just come out as cute I think. I have seen too many shit talking toddlers with no mouth guard often enough to let that pass as scary or unnerving.",2024-03-01
"Yes... I can understand this change. But my problem is with the timing, in the book he need 4 years to gain the likes and respect of the Freemen and make the guerrilla war, in the movie is ¿few months?

"Which means Paul got to kill the Baron... and it was just to fucking good. ""You die like an animal.""",2024-03-01
"Agreed, though I wsih we could have had more of the Reverend Mother's absolute horror at discovering who/what Alia is.",2024-03-02

"Aw, but they leave out the coolest sibling interaction in the book. Paul leaving a prescient message for Alia during the siege.",2024-03-02
I thought they pulled it off fine in the miniseries,2024-03-03
"I strongly disagree. It is an essential element of the ""weirdness"" of Dune. There are very few things I like from the Lynch version but ""Alia of the Knife"" was very well done there which means it is doable. Coward move by Dennis not to try.

Since he is not planning to do Children it is understandable, because Alia's murder of the Baron plays off in Children.",2024-03-03
"Twilight made that mistake, so no other film has to. No more super-intelligent CGI babies. It just can't be done without avoiding supreme goofiness or uncanny valley terror.",2024-03-02
"One of the few ""child actor"" performances that I've seen like that is Aidan Gallagher playing Five in The Umbrella Academy. At 15 he really pulled off the ""60-year-old in a teenager's body"" shtick incredibly well. Of course, Alia is supposed to be much younger than 15, so I agree that it would be very tricky to pull that off on screen without interrupting the entire film.",2024-03-10
I think that the film established enough that Alia was gonna be anything but ordinary.,2024-03-02

"> watching the Dune movie trilogy back-to-back will be the first true equivalent in experience to watching the LOTR trilogy back-to-back

I was about halfway through Part 2 when this dawned on me as well. 2-3 more years and a sit down of the entirely trilogy is going to LotR levels of fucking yes",2024-03-01
"Paul will be the anti-aragorn for this generation, if Messiah gets released. And the Dune trilogy will be an antithesis to LotR itself. A cynical take on prophecy, heroism, and a cautionary tale first. Reflects the trends of philosophy in the times we live in.",2024-03-01
"Dune book for sci-fi was practically what LotR books were for fantasy. Something that finally made the genre *big* and made people understand that these genres aren't just for silly stories for little children.


There are other parallels between them too, like the author's son trying to complete his father's work after he passed away. And now you can add ""having a fantastic movie trilogy which is as close to a perfect adaptation as you could possibly get"" to the list of those parallels.",2024-03-01
Basically my thoughts - comparing this to the level of LOTR. Just a masterful work of art in every single way,2024-03-01
"Yeah, this is going to be this generations grand opus trilogy if/when Villeneuve finishes the 3rd film.

I missed the original Star Wars trilogy due to being too young at the time.  

Lord of the Rings was great and still stands the test of time.  It was ""our generation's"" grand trilogy.

So glad we're all getting to enjoy another great trilogy (sci-fi again this time!) to join the pantheon.",2024-03-01
Man I really hope there's a third film. The energy was just electric in the theater. Haven't seen a movie like this in a long time.,2024-03-01
"Yes! I thought this same thing. Immediately came home and did a quick google search for when we can expect the third chapter …sounds like it could be as far off as 2030, but hopefully more like 2028. Still worth it.",2024-03-01
"> Oh, and I’m seriously regretting having doubts about Austin Butler in this film. Man f'ing killed it. To the point of almost stealing the show.

He absolutely nailed that introductory fight. Conveyed so much information (about the character and his relationship with the Duke) through facial expressions alone. And real scary charisma. I 100% bought him as an alternative ""Chosen One"" for the Bene Gesserit, rather than as just a dude that Paul has to fight.",2024-03-02

"I have zero knowledge of the source material -- never watched the movie/mini-series or read the book -- so the first thing I did when it ended was Google if there was going to be a third. 

Gladly, there is. The next book in the series apparently skips the war and goes right into what happens afterwards. Could be interesting",2024-03-02
"LOTR has always been my favorite trilogy with ROTK being my favorite movie, and now I'm not so sure.",2024-03-02
"I was thinking nearly the same thing while watching this. My thought was, ""Well Sci-Fi finally has its LOTR quality trilogy""",2024-03-02
"100% agree, definitely going to be a generational trilogy. Same as it was for Star Wars in the 80s, LotR in the 00's and now Dune in the 20's",2024-03-02
"The only difference would be the first movie imo,  I need like 3 hours of this stuff back to back please!!! PLEASE!!! If they release extended versions I will be able to die happy",2024-03-03

dune 1 was boring though right?,2024-03-04
I think his baron was far weaker in terms of impact - visually interesting but the thoughts and machination we get from the books baron makes him a stand out villain. I feel like the baron is more a presence than a person in the films.,2024-03-01
"I think most of the changes made were for the better, but the omissions really stung. Especially that they left out >!Thufir trying to outwit the Baron!<, minimized the role of >!the Spacing Guild!<, and didn't surprise us with >!count Fenring!<.

As a movie and as a sequel: 10/10.  
As an adaptation of my favorite book: 7/10.",2024-03-01
"My thoughts exactly. Part 1 was Dune Book 1 and part of Book 2 adapted almost perfectly with some minor changes and content cut.

Part 2 sticks to what is outlined within the remainder of Book 2 and Book 3 with some minor and major changes. For me Part 1 was the stronger film but I still enjoyed Denis’ take on Dune in part 2.

I’m very curious to see how he will adapt Messiah. I’ve never read the book so I’m deciding whether to read it first or go in blind and read the book after. Plenty of time to decide I suppose.",2024-03-01
Part 2 did a way better job of conveying the mysticism themes that make the story such an interesting one imo. Part 1 feels basic in comparison.,2024-03-03
"I absolutely felt this! I feel Dune 1 is a very solid, almost literally translation of the book, but not an amazing 10/10. 

This movie was just incredible because of the more diverse settings, colors, and fantastic pacing. Also I highly respect his changes from the novel.",2024-03-01
"Reinvented is a wildly strong word if you ask me. 

Reimagined is a much more apt way to look at it for me, because there are a lot of changes, some better, some worse.",2024-03-03
"I reread the book just before I saw the movie. Literally finished the last chapter this morning before catching a noonish showing. The book had a lot of flaws that I never really noticed the first time I read it. 

The book never really sells (at least for me) Paul’s time as a hunted fugitive, the actual fighting against the harkonnens, and the Paul/Chani courtship (for lack of a better word). A lot of this stuff is only referred to in the book but explicitly shown in the movie. I was also disappointed that >!Gurney is denied his harkonnen blood and that it’s Alia that kills Vlad and not Paul (or Gurney).!<

The movie fixes a lot of these flaws tho. I guess what I’m saying is I think this may be one of those rare movies that is better than the source material it adapts, while simultaneously being one of the rare sequels better than the first movie. 

Once I saw the “he who controls the spice controls the universe” stinger preempt even the WB title card, I knew I was in for a good time.",2024-03-03
I'm excited for it,2024-03-01
I appreciated that Feyd Rautha actually died and fought with honor too - both in that final fight and in his first scene. It gave him a bit more complexity,2024-03-01
"I love how there's this Yin and Yang/Light and Darkness motif with Paul and Feyd, it's even reflected in their grab and armor respectively. You can tell from the get go, Timothée Chalamet and Austin Butler they perfectly work as foils both as actors and their characters. 

Paul fights with restraint and grace as Feyd fights with a brutal and violent style. I appreciate how Feyd, even in death, compliments Paul after he bested him.",2024-03-01
And the entire fight isn’t scored either. It was incredible.,2024-03-01
Loved it. Although I’m actually confused about the final death blow. Did Paul have a hidden knife? I didn’t understand the geography of the knives and the wounds,2024-03-01
One of my favorite scenes in a long time. Captivating and you’re just glued in from the third act to the end.,2024-03-01
The fact that the plot had already diverged in noticeable ways meant a part of me wondered if Feyd was gonna win. Impossible yet tantalizing.,2024-03-01
"Loved that fight, but I wish Gurney vs Dave Bautista was an actual fight as well, Bautista went out too easily, especially considering his role in Part One",2024-03-01
Hit me on the way home that both movies end with a great Paul fight scene,2024-03-01
The editing/choreography was even better in this movie compared to the first. I remembering feeling so so about the final fight. But this was a significant improvement across the board,2024-03-01
The background music and sound all drop away and ALL you can hear is their breath and grunts. It was SPECTACULAR,2024-03-02
It was great but I thought feyds death would be more gnarly like in the book,2024-03-01
The sound of the blows and the knives was unerving.  Really made you think any strike could kill.,2024-03-01
My theatre was packed and you could literally hear a pin drop.,2024-03-05
"> Man I knew how that final fight was gonna end

You and Paul both. So funny when Gurney says ""why does he take risks like that"" like my guy do you not get it yet?",2024-03-04
Greig Fraser is also an amazing director of photography.,2024-03-01

"God watching that scene where Paul uses the Voice to say ""SILENCE"" and one of the Bene Gesserit literally stumble, you *feel* like you're being yelled at by an otherworldy person.

Also happy to see Timothée get to do a scene that his fellow Paul actor, Kyle MacLachlan, did 40 years ago in Lynch's Dune.",2024-03-01
The “using the voice” scenes are so well done. We watched a double bill and I forgot how great Rebecca Ferguson is when portraying it. Escaping with Paul in the first film was fantastic in imax. ,2024-03-01
"Him addressing the Fremen got me to say ""Holy ffffffuck"" outloud.


Timotheé was fantastic throughout the movie.",2024-03-01
"The scene with the Fremen was so gripping and he was so impressive, despite mostly speaking in a made up language. He was really dialed in with this performance, and did so well capturing Paul's boyish naivete in Part 1 growing to the hardened Lisan-al-Gaib by the end of Part 2",2024-03-01
"Obviously it’s early but I think its very likely he gets a Best Actor nomination, and I can’t imagine they’ll use any other clip than the scene where Paul becomes the Lisan al Gaib. Would this be the first time an Oscar clip is delivered mostly in a fictional language?",2024-03-01

He absolutely brought it in this one. Insanely magnetic every second he was on screen.,2024-03-01
If anyone watched him in “ the king “ he gave a phenomenal pre battle speech to his army. Kid has the goods.,2024-03-01

Especially Chani, the look of defiance on her face was superb.",2024-03-03
"Added to this was the absolute change in pace at this moment. 

I expected that Paul would be more authoritative on “the path” he sees, but for him to basically override whatever ideas anyone else had about how to respond to the Harkonens was WAY beyond my expectation.

And same for the actor - you could sense the portrayal of conviction coming but for it to happen in the blink of a scene?! Bravo all round",2024-03-03
Yeah that was the best sequence of the movie I think. When he singled the one warrior out and you realize that after the water of life he really could see everything. That dude was a skeptic ready to kill Paul and then he was on his knees. Fucking great cinema.,2024-03-06

Have you seen The King? That movie follows a shockingly similar arc to Dune and really solidified my opinion on Chalamet’s acting chops.

"To be fair, the final battle was pretty much identical to the book depiction. It starts and ends within the span of about one chapter. The Fremen attack and it’s pretty much immediately apparent to everyone that the Imperial force is completely unprepared and outmatched.",2024-03-02
"It definitely felt like there were some scenes missing between Paul gaining control of the Fremen and when the emperor shows up. Like a ""preparing the troops for war"" montage or even just a beat to pause and let the characters reflect. Paul/Jessica interaction was sorely lacking as well.",2024-03-01
It could have been an extra hour and I would not have complained,2024-03-02
"I felt the entire third act was rushed. Especially compared to the beginning where we spend so much time seeing Paul 'become' a Fremen. 

We don't even get a chance to reflect and realize the gravity of Paul's actions once the climax ends. It just cuts to The Holy War. Also felt that the battle was won a little too easily. 

I know I'm in the minority but I prefer Part 1 over this.",2024-03-01
Agreed. They started fighting and then like 30 seconds later they were already on the Emperor's ship.,2024-03-10

"I'm concerned more people aren't saying this, it felt way too rushed",2024-03-09

Anyone that complains about these changes, just don't understand why they needed to be made.",2024-03-01

">  I think its a definite ""you need to have seen part 1"",

I actually think not that much come to think of it. You just need to know that the Harkonnen are the bad guys and wiped out Paul's family but that's made pretty clear in the movie itself.",2024-03-01
"Chani being the voice of doubt was a smart way to bring Paul's internal conflict to the screen, and it gave a lot more depth to her character. It says a lot that the film's closing shot was her.

Taking Alia off the stage completely was for the best; Jessica talking to her unborn baby was chilling.",2024-03-06
"If we get Messiah, I just don’t understand how the Chani changes hold up…if it ends here they’re fine as is.",2024-03-03
"Respectfully disagree. I like the changes to Chani in theory (I was excited to see them going into the theater), but in practice it didn't work. She's the only Fremen that voices any opposition to Paul's ascendance by the end of the film, and we don't get any insight into why she's different. It felt more like the filmmakers wanting her to have agency than the story demanding it.

I'd argue it shows either a lack of understanding of or lack of care for the material on Denis' part; the Fremen are proud strong people, but their agency has been subtly stripped from them by centuries of plotting and propaganda. Herbert was showing the power and ills of these kinds of power structures (and the film seems to get it in that great exchange where Paul talks about how heartbreaking it is what the Bene Gesserit did to the Fremen). But in that same vein, Chani is Fremen, and as a product of growing up Fremen, would be subject to the same lack of agency as the rest of her people. We don't get an explanation for why she is different -- we get some lip service about Northerners vs Southerners, but it's band aid over a bullet hole given that we don't see any other Northerners resist Paul's rule at the end of the film.",2024-03-03
"It was basically done already in Matrix: Reloaded. I know that was almost 20 years ago, but it’s basically just replaced the water of life with techno music. 

Seriously though, I think Villeneuve probably felt sex in general would have detracted from the power of the zealotry portrayed in the film. Like, 15 minutes into the film an entire community just has sex with one another? And Paul and Jessica are both there? As an audience we’d view them as crazed desert sex-goblins instead of an oppressed people desperate for actual hope. 

I missed it too.",2024-03-01
My only criticism is that they kind of ignored the spacing guild in this adaptation. I think a scene or two showing how nobody fucks with the spacing guild might have helped audience understand why Paul's threat at the end was so scary to everyone.,2024-03-01
"The spice orgy was probably cut to ensure a PG-13, ~~sadly~~.

No navigators :(,2024-03-01
"Paul's revenge worked better for me in the book because the betrayal and evil is more present throughout the story. The revenge is less satisfying in the film, perhaps its better to watch both films in one sitting.

And then, of course, there's the omitted dinner sequence and the book's more elaborate intrigues and underlying layers of power struggles and betrayal. But definitely a visual feast. I must admit though,  that I've exhausted my quota of constantly whispering voices in strange languages with Jackson's Tolkien adaptations:)",2024-03-01
"I felt the same way walking out of this movie as I did when I walked out of Jurassic Park 30 years ago.  It's a watershed moment.  This is the greatest sci-fi or fantasy epic film I've ever seen.  If they stick the landing with the third one, it eclipses both Star Wars and Lord of the Rings as the greatest trilogy of all time.

I really can't say enough about how blown away I was by Dune 2.  I enjoyed Dune 1, but I did not love it - there was just something missing as far as story and character development.  Whatever was missing though, Dune 2 had it and more.  I'm stunned and impressed.  Incredible.  Phenomenal.

The best portrayal of a Messiah character that I've ever seen.",2024-03-02

"Whether the time jump would be included or not was my biggest question going into the movie. But I understand why it was skipped. It brings with it so many significant plot elements, like Alia’s character and Paul’s son, that it would have likely felt confusing, rushed, and impersonal even in a longer movie like this. Honestly it’s a complaint I have with the original book too, the last third is so fast-paced that it hurts the development of the characters a bit.",2024-03-02

Our thought process has been that the Water of Life probably made it longer than usual, because all of this in that time period seems.... improbable?",2024-03-09
I think it's because it feels timeless. You know how some movies like Rebel Moon give away that it was made in the 2020s? Dune doesn't feel that way. It's high-concept scifi shot like Oscar bait. And I'm here for it. I'm actually thinking of watching it again.,2024-03-01
I was saying to my wife today that this is the 2020s version of Star Wars/LotR. Glad it happened to Dune of all things,2024-03-01

"Star wars, even at its peak, was never close to this.

But LOTR was.",2024-03-03

"This is how i finally read Dune. I knew it was a book that people liked and that people said Star Wars was loosely based off. But when news broke DV, my favorite modern director was doing an adaptation, i had to read it. I used to love reading as a child and had gotten away from it in my adult life. Dune was the first fictional book i read in 15 years and it blew me away. 

To have DV get the opportunity to do the adaptation and exceed all expectations in doing so makes me so happy. Its a fascinating universe and tragic powerful story. So beautiful to see it on the big screen. Bravo, Frank Herbert. Bravo, Denis.",2024-03-03

"I'm glad the work with Nolan, but I'm also glad he moved on. The Thin Red Line is my favorite score by him, but this had me so overwhelmed with the textures almost making a stylistic samples from other scores and their films messages. The deep brooding and sometimes bordering on 'Mongolian throat singing'-choir feel like the meditative chants from Koyaanisqatsi. The Bene Gessirit wailing chants too sound so similar to Bulgarian Choir Music, and also similar to the score of Ghost in the Shell. The score of GinS has a Japanese style marriage folk song with similar harmony from Bugaria too. The breathy percussive shots during the harvester attack also references the art design of Ghost in the Shell and Akira, the latter of which feature similar chanting and drum work in it's score.",2024-03-01

He's gonna be an emperor out of Sietch Tabr.

He's got that ambition, home girl, he's destined to rise

"> the way Herbert wrote Chani, and generally any of the women, besides a handful of the BG. 

This film really put Irulan, Chani, the BG, and Jessica front and center, and showed that all of this is their doing, their fuckup, and their attempt to desperately claw back power.

Baron, Feyd, the Emperor, Paul, they're not really in charge, until it gets out of control.

It's a really good way to delve into the worldbuilding of Dune as well as get away from Herbert's frankly god-awful writing of anyone without a penis.",2024-03-04
"> why wouldn't the greater houses accept his ascendency 


Because he's a threat to them. There's supposed to be a status quo. Also, he threatened them. It's one thing to have a monopoly on spice but it's something entirely different to threaten to destroy all spice production. Also the Bene Gesserit don't like him and they sway the houses.  


 Edit: say -> sway",2024-03-02
"Because those things aren’t supposed to be concentrated in one person, there’s a sort of check-balance thing going on between the Emperor, the Great Houses, the Bene Gesserit and the Space Guild, that stops any one party from having too much power. Paul breaks the game.


If the President of the United States, with the support of the US military, declares himself not just the head of Executive Branch, but also the head of the Jusicary and Legislative Branches as well, how would inidividual states react?

"I didn’t understand why when they got attacked by Fyed-Rautha led Harkonnen that they fled, when we had just established where the atomic arsenal was. Why not just attack back?",2024-03-01
They definitely got told to cut it down from 3+ hrs and IMO the 3rd act suffered for it,2024-03-16
"The most important in-movie reason is that it underscores Paul's embrace of Harkonnen-style brutality as he transforms from a starry-eyed hero into a bloody tyrant. I'm paraphrasing but he follows it with a line like ""We'll fight like Harkonnens."" The revelation that the noble Atreides and vile Harkonnen are one and the same after all validates Paul's decision to abandon the heroic ideals of his father. When the Emperor insults the late Duke by calling him weak right before Paul's duel, Paul doesn't argue because he agrees.",2024-03-01
"I mean I don't feel it have weight in the story. He is still a Atreides, and his father's blood. If the story tries to make something more interesting out of it, it needs to make Paul not only Harkonnen, but also NOT Atreides.",2024-03-01
"It reveals just how deep the Bene Gesserit plotting is. The Bene Gesserit managed to get a child with blood from two of the fiercest enemies among the Great Houses. The book also makes clear that it's no coincidence that the Emperor has 5 daughters but no male heirs. All of the prophecies about the Lisan al-gaib were planted by the Bene Gesserit. Lady Fenring engraved a command that would paralyze Feyd Rautha and Paul knows that such a command is there and explicitly refuses to use it. Everything was set up for a Bene Gessserit trained man to ascend the throne.

The scene with the Reverend Mother/Emperor's Truthsayer saying that no matter what happened, the Emperor would lose his throne wasn't from the book but reinforces this.",2024-03-02
It becomes much more important in the next couple of books/movies.,2024-03-01
"To reveal the full extent and culmination of the Bene Gesserit's secret centuries-long breeding program. 

The Kwisatz Haderach they were after would've been a child of both Atreides and Harkonnen blood (the irony is that these two families have been sworn enemies for centuries), but the film didn't seem to bother explaining that. Well, they sort of did in the scene where Lady Fenring reports back to the Reverend Mother after successfully getting pregnant with Feyd-Rautha's seed.

But there will definitely be more on Paul's / Jessica's /little sister's Harkonnen lineage in the sequels though.",2024-03-01
"It doesn’t affect this story that much, but it’s important info the audience needs to know because book 3 has a story that is greatly affected by this information. In case they adapt book 3, it’s a good thing they drop the news here instead of there.",2024-03-02
"Next book is all about Paul dealing with the consequences of his actions, and the one after that is has a lot to do with the harkonnen lineage.",2024-03-01
Theres more to come from that from later books. It's a massive plot point so dont read anything cuz people might spoil it,2024-03-02
"As a movie-only, it was clear that his surprise attack against the Emperor and the Harkonnen's was inspired by the attack the Harkonnen launched on his own family.

He even said they'll have to fight like Harkonnen's.",2024-03-02
"didn't Paul say in the film because they are Harkonnen is why the poison does not effect them?

"> The ornithopter machine gun shotgun thing

">another thing I noticed on second watch is how much Feyd respects Paul. There are multiple shots of Feyd examining Paul and Austin Butler does such a good job of having these faces of admiration and respect. Even when he says “he’s bluffing” at one moment towards the end, he has this sly smile on his face like “yea this mf is a formidable opponent”

Feyd's reactions at the end were awesome. You could tell he just **loved** Paul walking in on the emperor like he already owned the place and killing the Baron. He probably felt honored when he learned he's Paul's cousin.",2024-03-03
I hope the Blu-Ray release has a super duper extended and deleted scenes edit that is 6 hours. I could have sat in that theater for double the run time no problem.,2024-03-03
"I truly truly loved the film. Honestly i watched it in a shitty cinema and really wanna go again on imax or Dolby atmos for a second viewing. Watching the first film for the first time was meshmarizing.

I haven’t felt that emotionally invested, affected and immersed by a film in a long long time and in a good positive way. It was just executed very well. The sound, the emotions, the fight scenes, how perfect Paul was as a fragile skinny child struggling, to a fierce fighter, desert mouse smart and cunning, not weirdly strong and acrobatic for no reason at all. The cinematography, the fight scenes, the intrigue, world building, it was all incredible. I felt the cinema in awe thinking this was a 9/10. 

My gripes,

1) I felt Rabban was a completely different character. He was so menacing, strong, terryfing and then he becomes this weakling who could not reason at all. The follow them with helicopters while screaming the guys name on desert and then immediately running away felt so lame. The helicopter scene kinda made up for it as that was super cool. This scene almost completely took me out of the movie but the movie was so masterful it sucked me back in. I also really didn’t like the Rabban and Gurley scene. Just felt too rushed. Too perfect. Too simple.

2) Chani. Just the seemed like a 21st century teenager dropper in that setting. Her demeanor, beliefs , actions. She felt like a modern rebellious petulant adolescent teenager rather than a product of a violent brutal tribe commune culture. Not a book reader but from what I’ve read she’s a lot more supportive and understanding in the book and can think in complex layers based on her motivations rather than RELIGION BAD. The whole culture is built around tradition and respect and the way she just seemed to disrespect the gathering rules, her elders, etc. She just felt so out of place to me.

3) More Chani. I felt the romance was forced. I felt the characters didn’t have lots of chemistry. I read a comment saying these were teens in a deserted planet which made this awkwardness easier but Chani or Paul was never shown as awkward or lacking actions. Honestly the scene between Feyd and the Lady Gesseritt woman had so much more on screen chemistry.

4) More Chani. She was like pharaoh from the Moses story. Seeing so many miracles and not believing them. I read a comment here that said they liked her character until the water of life scene. Where you are literally witnessing a hundreds if not thousands of year old prophecy that should not be possible at all being fulfilled in front of your eyes and your response is like an atheist subreddit user. Honestly wished she would struggle more with the prophecy and Paul would try to convince her it’s not real. She not believing it made her look so stupid and unreasonable. There is literally so much proof that the prophecy is real. 

5) The emperor didn’t really feel menacing or powerful at all. Could be sinema i was at but they said wow he brought his whole army and the scale of his army didn’t feel any bigger than harkonen or atteides gatherings. The first movies imperial army planet scene made it a lot more epic. If we didn’t see baron kneeling and soldier behind him I would feel he yielded any power at all. Felt the Leto was weak line was a cop out. Wanted that to be more fleshed out.

6) Important people being on the front lines all the time were lame. Whether gurley or Paul. Also gurley literally leading a suicide charge and surviving was lame. I know it’s the same in the book but it felt cheap. Sardaukar being weak was lame but I read many comments it’s the same in the book. The Fremen and desert power is underestimated. I didn’t get that sense from the movie, I wish there was a dialogues from Paul like that. I don’t know. The throne scene was really cool but then felt a little out of place and lacking scale. They just got there too quickly and the imperial guard just stood there.

I just wished Chani at least struggled with the prophecy a little and maybe the Lisan al gaib is men made but the hazerach thing is very real and very mystical that required a thousand year planning and luck of a perfect being that will lead to a better world. I felt that wasn’t handled with proper respect.",2024-03-13

And did he really just flame her to death? Brutal,2024-03-05
"I thought about that too. Really just the Harkannens in general, in the first film you get the notion that they're being set up to be these epic strong villains but in this one you realize they aren't shit lol. Outside of Feyd I suppose.",2024-03-04
The 5 thousand year long breeding program by the Bene Gesseret to produce the Kwisatz Haderach played a major role in the books. The fact that Jessica was the baron’s daughter (a byproduct of rape) and her producing a male heir produced a Kwisatz Haderach a generation earlier than intended. The relevance is on a Biblical scale but is really hard to express on film,2024-03-01
I read the book and honestly forgot it was even brought up in there until it came up again in the second one(?). It's not a hugely important plot point... yet.,2024-03-01
"In the book it's revealed way earlier, when Paul is having his visions in the stiltent right after Atreides are massacred, and the emphasis is way more on the Bene Gesserit's breeding plans than the actual connection itself.",2024-03-01
"No it happens pretty much after they escape when, due to exposure to the spice, his brain starts ""leveling up"" and instead of dreaming, he's seeing it unfold in front of his eyes combined with his mentat training, to see it.",2024-03-01
Yes,2024-03-01
"In the book it happens during the part where Paul is having visions in the desert, it would’ve been in part 1 if they decided to it exactly like the book. Basically Paul finds out through his visions, tells Jessica because she didn’t know, and then she’s upset about it, and that’s about it. I think the movie made it more impactful than the book to be honest. 

It is important information that the audience needs to know though, this is crucial information that is a huge part to one of the books down the line. If they ever adapt past book 2, audiences will be glad that Denis didn’t leave this part out.",2024-03-01
"They didn't mention that Mohiam is Jessica's mother either (which is from the Brian Herbert prequel novels, so it's non-canon technically).",2024-03-01

"Yes, he speaks like a totally different person -- because he is. Like Jessica, after she drank the water of life. They become an amalgamation of their ancestors memories.",2024-03-03

"Yeah, I haven't seen much commentary online but that was one of the first thing me and my friends discussed after seeing it.",2024-03-03

"It's definitely got its differences from the book, but this feels like one of those movies that is a good adaptation because it made reasonable changes to adapt to a visual medium",2024-03-01

"I was mostly happy with how it turned out compared to the book, however, the loss of Jamis’ extended funeral ceremony was a huge disappointment. One of my favorite moments from the book",2024-03-01
"Felt underwhelming in Dolby to be honest. Or maybe it was my theater? I always prefer it to liemax, but I think this movie might be the exception.",2024-03-01
"Yes, I wish they had mentioned the science/geo-engineering that made Arrakis into a desert planet which subsequently created its political inequalities all for spice. Also more on what spice actually does and why its important. The spacing guild's role and its control over political entities I hope is a factor in Part3/Messiah. And the role of bloodline/feudal manipulation. Still 11/10.",2024-03-03
"Did IMAX last Sunday, and Dolby tonight. Dolby audio was definitely punchier, although the full ratio on IMAX has a level of immersion that's hard to beat. I'd say do both, while you can. A good time either way.",2024-03-01
"Dolby was great. For my city, the Dolby is bigger than our IMAX, and has _way_ better audio.

Still missed a few lines, because Denis sometimes Nolans his dialogue, but still 10/10 worth it.",2024-03-01
It’s been so long since I’ve read Dune (the first book). What’s the timeline like with the movies? I ask cause I’d love to reread it but if it’s gonna spoil the next movie I’d rather not read it so I can go in fresh,2024-03-13
Is it too loud in imax? I really wanna see it at my theatre but also don’t want to leave with my ears bleeding haha,2024-03-01

"There are some major changes from the books, some characters left out, or parts of their backstories omitted. That is all okay in my opinion. The core message of the books is there, the feel is there. This is the best possible adaptation that could have been done imo. I highly suggest you give it a read though.",2024-03-01
I liked the movie but I definitely get the vibe that Denis got some notes to pick up the pace lol,2024-03-01
It’s fantastic foreshadowing for what happens when Paul drinks the water of life too. Spoiler: nothing good. ,2024-03-03

It was a fantastic scene. Just perfect,2024-03-02
The rising crescendo as Feyd struts out into the arena was so good at a primal level. Loved the design of this whole sequence. It truly *felt* like a future where branches of humanity had diverged into the alien.,2024-03-01
It was almost surreal. The part on Geidi Prime might've been my favorite out of the whole film,2024-03-01
"For me, it was when the Harkonnens started floating up the mountain and the Duke yelling “They fly now?!”",2024-03-02
"The best part was when Paul Arrakis yelled, ""It's Dune-ing time!"" and duned all over that guy.",2024-03-04
"I don't know if you've read the books, but the Sardaukar are actually nerfed a lot more in part one compared to the book, but the Fremen taking them out so easily is actually pretty accurate. The Sardaukar are supposed to be unstoppable, but the Fremen take them out with ease and it's supposed to be a constant shock to everyone how easy it is for them.",2024-03-01
"I don’t necessarily disagree with your complaints, but most seem to be things that are actually pretty faithful to the book.

For instance, I feel like the movie actually spends quite a bit more time establishing the importance of Paul drinking the water than in the book. They dwell more on how it’s made, what it does, and how men can’t drink it. And they repeatedly remind both Paul and the audience that he must drink it to become the one. Whereas in the book, Paul kinda just figures out on his own that he should drink it, and does it off-screen. And Jessica is actually surprised and upset when she hears he drank it.

And I’ve always thought the book ending felt pretty rushed, so the movie’s ending didn’t bother me so much.",2024-03-02
"Couldn’t disagree more. I liked Part 1 but it was missing a lot of things for me. The Harkonnen felt one dimensional, just evil ugly and stupid bad guys, there was a lot of exposition in the dialogue (which okay is unavoidable with a story like this) but still it took me out of it a few times. And the introduction of Chani and the ending of the film in general was a bit weak imo.

Part 2 fixes ALL of those problems. Feyd gives Harkonnen a whole new dynamic, the world expands so much and stops holding the audience’s hand, Chani and Paul both develop into infinitely more interesting characters. Sure, there were some parts that felt rushed but in my opinion the pay off was there with all the character and story decisions.",2024-03-02
The scene with Paul addressing the Fremen and the atomics flying overhead. So fucking good.,2024-03-02

There's something quite important in the books that's not explained in the movies. All great houses have nukes, but using nukes against another great house means your planet gets glassed, period.

Paul uses it against a mountain, not a house so that's sort of a loophole. This creates an opening for the worms, and makes it so the storm batters everything inside even harder.",2024-03-03

Again, this might just be me (I also haven't read the books) but I felt like there were several times in the movie where we're shown one thing and the next scene feels like it should have been several scenes later.

"The emperor is tough to play because he has so little screen time, but yeah old quiet Walken was not a great choice. I can understand trying to have him portrayed as the outplayed ruler being twised around by bene gesserit, but he just comes off as a ruler no one would have followed in the first place. The old sci fi channel miniseries did a better job with Giancarlo Giannini, who could atleast bring italian charisma to the role.

But here, Paul's play for the throne via the hand of Irulan is depicted as an utter betrayal to Chani (and the Fremen people). If Paul and Chani are going to be reconciled, it feels like it will take most of movie 3 to negotiate it -- which is *not* in line with Dune: Messiah. This may be a major clue that Dune: Part 3 is going to veer sharply from the events of book, which would not necessarily surprise me, as the books only get stranger.",2024-03-01

Granted I’ve only finished the first novel but I can’t imagine they could’ve elaborated on Shaddam IV further and for that Walken served his part. He’s kind of a foot note in a way? Yes he has reasons to do what he does but he’s kind of a strawman for the Imperium and the bene geserits plotting and scheming . If anything I’m more upset we didn’t get any insight to the Spacing Guilds politics of WHY Paul threatening the Great Houses with the destruction of spice is a meaningful act. But considering Villenueves adaptation seems to be more Paul and leaning on the genetic history stuff more than the greater Landsraad/guild/spice politics I see why he condensed the final moments to “the houses don’t accept your ascendancy” and the jihad begins lol.,2024-03-01

The Kwisatz Haderach is Paul, but they didn't believe it was him until it was too late, and because their actions made him hate them he does not have alegiance toward them. He's a rogue and fucked up their plan.",2024-03-09
"1) in the book, there is a lot of concern of the stagnation of humanity as a species-  that they will peak, get too comfortable, and decline and lose their technology, culture, maybe even due to war (think forgotten tech ala Foundation or even Warhammer ~~10k~~ 40k).  This  is in fact somewhat related to why the have mentats instead of computers.

Part of the BG purpose is to prevent the dying out of humanity, and the KH is the being with past and future knowledge that will guide the species.

2) Regarding Jessica, not sure what you're asking.  She was instructed to be the Duke's ~~concubine~~ make some babies (they never married- that was his choice in case he ever needed to make a political marriage), and Jessica never disobeyed the BG except that she loved the Duke, and he wanted a son, so she gave him Paul.

3)I'm cribbing from another user, but the main point is that Herbert never specifies what exactly triggers the Jihad, so in the movie they use refusal of Paul ascendancy to provide it:

(this is a  quote from u/nkyaxs 's reply that addresses your question)

>The other houses reject Paul, presumably because he basically usurped the throne from the emperor. A man, presumably thought to be dead, shows up at the head of a terrorist army and hostages the most valuable material in the known universe, spice, in order to leverage himself into power. Its not a surprise that the Great Houses refuse to accept this.

The power balance between the Shipping Guild, the BG, the Great Houses (Atreadis, Harkonnen et all), and the Emperor isn't something that's discussed a lot in the movie, but it's a real thing and the entire reason the Emperor tries to kill off the Atreadis in the first place- he fears House Atreadis is getting too powerful and could at some point in the future threaten him by getting a group of houses together. ""ape strong together.""

So the idea is reasonable that the houses would think to stand together against Paul when he's litteraly threatening a permanent end to the galactic order with the threat of 'accept me or I'll nuke the spice fields.' Now, in the context of the movie you might think they'd at least negotiate a little, or maybe Paul would slow down and say something like 'listen, you don't really have a choice here.'

And that gets to Nkyaxs' second point about the cause of the jihad in the book: none is ever given. Thus, in the movie Denis chooses to use the rejection of Paul by the Houses as the spark that starts the holocaust Paul has feared/triggered.

In a couple months he brought Raban to his knees, forced the Baron back to Arrakis, convinced all the tribes and the Emperor to come. If we abstract from the movie, it's all too rushed.

And for Chani to leave Paul alone and abandon him because he was forced to follow the path is pure invented drama and goes against the love story we've been told. On top of that, it seems unnecessary to me, it is in the third part of the story where this character really will shines with her own light.",2024-03-03

I dug it, was my fav change (also it added that character the audience can tie their morals too) apart from Alia being a fetus that could talk with Lady Jessica, that was just SUPER creepy, weird and awesome.

It's a bunch of Dune fan boys. It's similar to people who say Star Wars Episode I is the best movie ever.,2024-03-01
"I don’t want to come across as trying to change anyone’s mind about it, but I’ll give my perspective as to why I preferred the pacing here than in Part One, specifically as someone who hasn’t read the book. 

In Part One, so much of the first half of the film seems to be filled with an absolute ton of worldbuilding. A decent bit of it is about Arrakis, but there’s also a load about the wider politics of the Empire, and almost every ounce of that feels meaningless to have learned by the second half of the film. Once Paul and Jessica have escaped, I find the earlier inclusion of some scenes — like when Paul learns about the sacred palm trees, or the discussions about the formality involved in the handing over of Arrakis to House Atreides — to be superfluous. I don’t feel any driving action in the first half. Even the scene with the sandworm eating the spice harvester — which is incredibly well done — doesn’t seem to move the plot along at all, merely show the power of the sandworms and begin to hint at Paul’s vision with the spice. 

Almost all of the second half of that film is just about the desert/etc, and very little about the specifics of the galactic politics that the film has dedicated so much time to; there are people after Paul and Jessica, but that’s all I feel I need to know at that point. I get that they’re super necessary and have absolutely no suggestion on how to change it for the better, but the shift in weight and focus just felt a tad unbalanced. The assault of Arrakis feels like it comes too late in the film to be the inciting incident, but simultaneously too early for it to be the climax. Had the film ended when Paul and Jessica spent that first night in the tent, I think I could’ve appreciated it more.

In this one, while yes, it takes a long time before Feyd to show up, I understand perfectly the conflicts that are propelling the story forward, largely *in part* due to the set up in the first film. Many of the Fremen believe Paul is their savior, so those beliefs (combined with Paul’s own desire to avenge his father and his people) push him and the Fremen to attack the Harkonnen, which in turn causes the Baron to increase his grip on the planet through a handful of measures, including bringing in his nephew to take control. 

Most of the slowness in this film comes across in my eyes as time spent building up characters, one of the main deficits in Part Once. To me, there’s just a much more clear back-and-forth of wills and goals here than in the first film. But again, you’re totally valid in your own opinions.",2024-03-01
This movie wasn’t close to being slow,2024-03-02
There are millions of people on Reddit - it shouldn't be confusing that not all of them share the same opinion about things. I didn't find this movie to be slow and I also enjoyed it more than part 1. That doesn't make either of us wrong.,2024-03-01
They definitely streamlined plot. If they kept everything then I think the Duke would still be alive 6 hours into the movie.,2024-03-01

"I think there's a very intentional contrast between the coldness of the aristocracy in Part 1, and the warmth of the common people in Part 2.

Part 1 has a lot of giant sets with only one or two characters in to highlight the emptiness and isolation. The characters are very unemotional. Part 2 the sets are crammed with thousands of extras, they feel like a real community, they laugh and joke like war buddies. The Fremen feel more human.",2024-03-02

The Emperor got bodied the same exact way. The atomics destroyed the shields allowing strafing runs and free shots for the lasers. Lasers are OP as Fuck, you see it with the Fremen just cutting through the spice harvesters. Small note, I can’t remember if it’s explained in part 1 but the Fremen are superior hand to hand combatants to the Sardakuar. Ez W for Paul.",2024-03-02

"Haha, this is not really explained in the books either, for these characters. However, the detail of getting on and off is talked about with ""hooks and ropes"" where they had some technique to hook the sandworm to climb it, and they could somehow detach the hooks at will so they could descend down and then detach the hook and jump free of the worm.

More interestingly, it talks about a technique where they could determine the worm was going to dive into the ground again when it began to slow down, so they would time their descent off of the worm to coincide with when they would slow down, and they would gracefully detach safely off of it. This was considered dangerous, as if you detached too late you could be caught in the wake.

But ya, the only real explanation is they had some hooks and rope technique, and it must be assumed that they had some skill or knowledge on how to do it by learning from the Fremen.",2024-03-04
"Well first, just because the emperor would lose their support doesn't mean they are going to support Paul. Just because the support of the previous emperor would topple doesn't guarantee support of the new guy.

With that being said, it's also a little more complicated. Of note, it's been a LONG time since I read these, like 20+ years, but going by my memory there is first needing to understand that not all of the houses were instantly on the same page of what happened to the Atreides and the involvement of the emperor, but even if they were aware you need to remember that this Dune series is sort of like Game of Thrones in a sci-fi world, and even though one character thinks or says something is going to happen a certain way, sometimes things happen unpredictably.

The revelation that Paul has the abilities and the connection to the Bene Gesserit breeding program make many of the houses distrustful and even fearful of his intentions. What is the extent of his power? This is not clear to them. Also, the Bene Gesserit are basically known for their scheming, long-term planning, and manipulation. So, there is probably some concern among the houses if that might influence the emperor, like the man behind the curtain power structure.

Also, religious concerns. Not all the houses are believers and supporters of this ""fringe"" religion and with Paul being a Messiah like figure, there is worry of the imposing of religious beliefs and practices across the empire leading to possible conflict.

So, while the emperor was displaced, as expected, they do not immediately jump in line to support Paul as the new emperor for these, and I am sure other reasons.",2024-03-04

A navigator is a major character in Messiah so he may be saving it for that.,2024-03-04
"There's two separate things going on here.

1. The Bene Gesserit planted a bunch of fake prophecies in Fremen culture so that Jessica could manipulate them. In the movie it kind of sounds like the BG did that over the course of a few months specifically for the Paul/Jessica situation but in the books it's just a standard thing the BG do everywhere over the course of centuries as part of their long-range contingency planning, just in case they need ways to manipulate a population at some point.

2. Paul is the result of the Bene Gesserit breeding project to create a superhuman who can see through time. When the Bene Gesserit talk about ""the Kwisatz Haderach"" that's not a prophecy, it's a plan. The BG are not actually religious nuts, they're scientists. The spooky religious shit is just a -tool- they use to control others. 

Paul does end up fulfilling all of the Fremen's prophecies but that's not because of any mystical reason, it's a combination of a. they were specifically set up for him to take advantage of and b. because he's superpowerful he can actually do all of the shit that the prophecies promised their messiah would do.",2024-03-04
"I think it's ambiguous, in part because Paul is a messiah to some and not others. The Bene Gesserit sisterhood has been doing this giant breeding program to produce a very specific person with special abilities. Paul is indeed that person. Not prophecised in a religious sense, but the result of an extremely long intermarriage scheme to produce a person with supernatural abilities. So in that sense Paul actually is special and has special abilities.

On the other hand, there is the prophecy of the Mahdi/Lisan al-Gaib, the one who will free the Fremen and lead them to paradise. This prophecy is invented and spread by the Bene Gesserit for their own benefit. The idea is if needed they could use the prophecy to influence events on Arrakis, which Jessica does.",2024-03-04
"I guess you could interpret it in multiple ways. But personally no, I don't think it is real. The Bene Gesserit are masters at planting myths throughout history that become legends/religions so they can exploit them later. They carefully crafted this line of events to bring forth a believable messiah.

Although you could argue that since Paul does do the things he was written to do he does 'fulfill' the prophecy in a way. Like if I predicted a bunch of made up stuff about my kid and it ended up happening, like yeah I made it up but then it happened so isn't it kind of true?

Where it gets a bit blurry with that line of thinking though is that the Bene Gesserit can 'force' people to do things with the voice though. Like the part of the prophecy where the desert spring would revive the messiah from the dead... Well yeah that happened but they made it happen against her will... It wasn't like it just naturally happened.",2024-03-04
"Correct. They made her an actual character.

In the books she just went along with Paul and had pretty much zero agency.",2024-03-05

"> Why was Feyd able to destroy the sietches? I thought their safety came from their secrecy, but it was actually just Rabban's unwillingness to use artillery? What?

the secret of Arrakis is that the Fremen exist in millions in the deep desert (the south), not the 10s of thousands most of the galaxy believed.  The seitches nearer the northern territories were known and not secret.

The use of artillery was  a surprise because it was an ancient weapon.  Shields had made all projectile weapons obsolete.  In the book, it's the Atreides that retreat into some caves after the Harkonen attack.  They can't go in because it's too defensible. 
 Unable to draw them out, the Harkonen use  artillery to destroy the cave entrances and seal the Atreadis in,  dooming them.

In the logic of the book, this would be like going to a modern war with a catapult.  It's just entirely unexpected.  (You have to suspend your disbelief a little since it's understood that shields can't be used in the desert that everyone doesn't already have AK47s, but hey.)

This scene is transposed on to the the Fremen in the movie.  They can't go in because the Fremen would easily kill any invader.  So Feyd destroys the mountains around them.

>If Paul can see the future

after he takes the water of life to become the KH, he does literally see the future, but only possible futures, and even then not always in their entirety. Nor does He know which possible future will come to be. So it can be useful, or strangle you in uncertainty, or if you rely on your precience too much cause you to fear risking any decision for which you can't see a clear result.

In the specific case of the fight with Feyd, Paul had no visions at all, except that he was likely to die.",2024-03-06
I never got the impression he can see the future to that degree which combat engagements would be child's play,2024-03-06
"Paul can indeed see the future. He actually sees possible futures. While your question makes sense, and I don't claim to be able to fully understand it myself, the answer is simple. If you accept he sees possible futures, and that he chose the one shown in the film, there is nothing else to it. He just sees the future. And what happens in the film happens because he chose such a future. Maybe he sees that to win that fight, he has to do that and be wounded, and that's the only possibility in which the aftermath of him being emperor happens. I think it is also worth mentioning that once Paul sees possible futures and has also unlocked his ancestral memories, there is no sense of time for him. He knows what happened, and what will happen. As said in the first film, the kwisatz haderach is a being beyond time and space. Paul is literally God xd",2024-03-06

"It's one of the many, many plotholes introduced by keeping the developments of the novel without keeping the reasons and motivations in the novel.

In the novel, Feyd-Rautha wasn't ruthlessly oppressing the Fremen more effectively than Rabban.  Rabban was desperately squeezing Arrakis for all the spice he could get while (in the perceptions of the people ruling the planet) eliminating the Fremen.  In actuality, the Fremen decided to take their 'civilians' back to the southern home sietches to avoid the worst of the fighting and deceive Rabban.

(Note:  the Fremen 'civilians' were so formidable that an attack force of Saudarkar that penetrated the southern regions was forced to retreat in disarray with major casualities from a defense force formed of old men, women, and children -- and only by desperately using their own ship drives as improvised flame weapons.)

The sietches' locations weren't widely known, and in the novel the Fremen decide to abandon the northern ones so that they wouldn't come under direct attack. 

Rabban was intended to persecute the workers and maximize Spice production, then be replaced by the ""kinder and gentler"" Feyd-Rautha who would then be loved by the people.  As the Baron notes, oppression is a relative thing.  That's why Feyd-Rautha is introduced in the same scene the Baron appears in, and why Rabban never appears ""onscreen"" in the novel.

Paul can see the future, but in the novel, Paul's actions had opened up a period of immense uncertainty where even the tiniest random factor could change the future completely, leaving him and the Spacing Guild Navigators blind.

The fight is very different in the novel.  The fighters are equally matched, and Jessica takes Paul aside to whisper that the BG often implant a control phrase in people they see as dangers, and urges Paul to use it to win.  Paul refuses.  At one point in the battle, Feyd gains the upperhand, and Paul's ancestral memories begin demanding that he use the phrase -- he gasps out ""I will not say it!"", and Feyd is so startled by this non-sequitur that he gives Paul an opening to lethally stab him.

As to why Paul demanded the battle in the first place... that's a very complicated question, and one of the points of the novel is that there are multiple possible motivations that we're not explicitly given.  One reading is that it's a suicide attempt on Paul's part, one last desperate attempt to halt the Jihad.  Paul eventually realizes that it doesn't matter whether he lives or dies, the entire human race demands change and upheaval and the Jihad will occur no matter what.",2024-03-06

I have to disagree.  First, I couldn't figure out why the harvesters were different than in the first film.  Did Harkonens take them when they left and the Atredies brought/built their own, and the Harkonens brought them back?  

But what really got me was the way they just pretty much mowed them down with the ornithopter.  In the book, it's always implied that the Fremen are WAY better at killing the Harkonens then they are them, so to see half the group get taken out by just guns seemed disrespectful",2024-03-01

This lessened his prowess as a fighter, when one unknown fighter is able to kill him. It would be really strange if he would have killed Paul in the end because of that.

Most other problems that i had were about world building. The fremen were never shown to build technology. But they used big ass lasers to fuck up the spice harvesters, had rockets and obviously instantly knew how to flight the Sardaukan space fleet in combat.

Essentially a lot of exposition is missing in the movie because it's just heaps of internal monologues, and the book itself also ends rather abruptly which explains the jarring pacing of the end. Not that this excuses Denis from not finding better solutions,  but that's a reasoning as to why the movie is like this.

There's also the fact that the first movie only covered like a 1/3rd of the book, so the 2nd one is where all the meat resides. This leads to the 2nd movie being far larger in scope than the first, which makes it feel like a very grandiose sequel. It genuinely does ""improve"" and ""expand"" the world from the 1st movie, and those aspects combined with ""gigantic epic end battle"" (which it actually isn't because in traditional Denis fashion they decided to spend all the budget for only 30 seconds of footage) gives it those ""LotR/ESB"" vibes. It's just rare in general for sequels to actually improve the original and be more than ""redoing the first movie but with a few tweaks"", so Dune part 2 feels like a grandiose sequel when in reality it isn't really a sequel,  it's just the actual main meat of the book and part 1 was just a prologue.",2024-03-03

From the beginning the show pretty clearly that he has no grasp on the situation, that he’s reacting poorly and out of desperation, and that only amplified when he finds out the Fremen just destroyed their large spice depot (which they say in the movie destroyed like 50%+ of their total spice harvest); leading him to attack the Sietch, his pilot surveyor resisting, him breaking is neck..that whole scene was so good to me",2024-03-08

It's weird how he's both good when he screams and shows emotion, but is absolutely wooden in other scenes (too wordless and too stoic). Although in those instances, since we know Timothee can act, I'd say the screenplay and direction didn't utilize his strengths enough.

Also not a fan of the romance of Paul and Chani. Started off nice when they are speaking to each other on the dunes about Fremen differences. Then it just felt like a weak typical romance between two characters forced to smooch because script said so.",2024-03-03

It’s not the Harkonnen part of the bloodline that makes him turn but the fact that the poison fully unlocks his prescience.

This seems more like a boy who wants revenge and will stop at Nothing to get it while pretending he is conflicted about it. If he was actually conflicted we didn't see it until after he had already set the wheels in motion.  

It would be interesting if Paul had you know tried to live peaceably with the Fremen and move on. Only to keep getting dragged back into the war despite knowing from his visions it would only end in bloodshed.

What appeared to have happened was that Jessica intentionally set up the whole scene in that cave so that the Fremen onlookers could witness this final step of the prophecy coming true. She even used The Voice on Chani to do it. The tears didn't actually do anything to wake up Paul.

The atreides family nukes to blow a path in the mountains. Throws the sardaukar into disarray because they did not expect it. No one uses nukes in the empire, it's seen as suicide since the rest of the empire would immediately nuke the offender. 


Then the fremen come in riding worms. The empire didn't even realize worms could be ridden or controlled, and the sardaukar and harkonnens would have never stuck around when a worm showed up before. How do you respond to a bunch of giant monsters showing up?


Sardaukar are seen as the strongest force hands down in the galaxy. No one would attack the imperial army outright unless all the major houses were in on it. The emperor saw coming to Arrakis as a massive show of force and power. The idea that any army could actually stand up to him was absurd. No one knew that the fremen were actually quite numerous, or that being raised in the horrible conditions of Arrakis made them superior warriors by far than the Sardaukar.

Not just their fighting skills, but the actual amount they had. The only thing stopping the Fremen was resources.

Pretty much, when you take their shields away, have superior warriors, and now have a leader who understands how to beat these people. Of course you steamroll through them.

I guess it is a little weird to have 3 cuts back to back to explain the stuff that happens after paul drank the water but it wasnt particularly hard to understand that they first send for Lady Jessica, who then sends for Chani, its obvious to assume this all didnt happen with an hour or so, im not entirely sure what was confusing about this scene tbh lol.

The space guild being MIA is baffling.  They had such drip in Part One.  Was looking forward to seeing them.,2024-03-04
"1. We see that Jamis is still in Paul's head (he mistakes Chani for him) & then he has some bonding with her. 


2. What is there to explain here? All of Feyd's best scenes from the book (except his very early introduction one, which would have made Part One even longer, added to the budget etc) were included here & executed really well. Most people have nothing but praise for Butler & the scenes he's in.


3. Are you new to watching movies? Killing off subordinates for no reason is a usual activity of psychotic characters in positions of power. And why is it moronic when the ones he killed are SO easily replaceable, & he faces no consequences for killing them?


4. Unnecessary. She was clearly shown to be on the Fremen's side, Chani's friend, & the Fremen predominantly used guerrilla tactics - so ofc a few of them were spies as well.


5. It says a lot about how extreme Fremen culture is, that they have so much water on their desert planet, but refuse to drink it - not just because it's randomly holy, but because it was being saved for their dream (of creating a Green Paradise on Arrakis in future, under Lisn Al Gaib - essentially transforming the ecology there using that water someday). It also made Feyd's later destruction of the same even more tragic.


6. Fremen were clearly mentioned to be on equal footing with (or even stronger than the Sardaukar); Chani is Fremen as well. The Sardaukar were also vastly outnumbered, & unfamiliar with the terrain, Fremen tactics etc. It's similar to how far more advanced, highly trained soldiers in even our real world sometimes end up losing to guerrilla warfare.


7. Paul orders the Fremen to stop killing the smugglers after confirming that it's indeed Gurney. Also, Gurney's loyalty is to the Atreides, not some random smugglers he just happened to be working with at the time.


8. You're just being a troll, aren't you? You literally just mentioned the smugglers in your previous comment. So it's not as though you aren't aware of such routes offworld being present, which the Fremen can make use off to send a mere scroll.


9. The film works as it is without involving the spacing guild. They'll surely feature more prominently in the next film. 


10. As far as the movies are concerned, unless explicitly shown to be alive later (like Gurney, or the  gladiators that Feyd killed), every other known Atreides character is dead, although some no-name survivors were mentioned by Gurney to have been smuggled back to Caladan.


11. The ""Enemy"" (Harkonnens & The Emperor) AREN'T the biggest threat in this film - it's the Holy War that Paul could (and does) trigger by seizing religiopolitical over the Fremen. 


12. The Emperor already knew that war was coming, plus everyone at Arrakkeen were used to feeling complacent against worms, Fremen etc while they were within the shield walls, natural mountain barriers etc.

 Not to mention being overconfident in the Sardaukars' strength - like a ""Who's gonna be stupid enough to attack *us* , lol?"" attitude, & also busy taking the Harkonnens to task. 


More than half these questions were SO dumb & nitpicky. The last one is the only somewhat legitimate criticism you've said. But I bet you aren't even gonna read this comment.",2024-03-03

"As a book reader I did find myself getting annoyed at things that they could have been far less confusing for general audiences if they just added one or two lines of expository dialogue.

In the books, most of the Great Houses have stockpiles of atomic weapons, however it was decided [period of time that I can’t remember] ago that it’s a war crime to use them as weapons, and if you do, all of the other Great Houses are basically contractually obliged to all team up and wipe your house from existence.

In the book, there’s a “Shield Wall” that protects Arrakeen from the worms. It’s a natural rock formation, similar to the mountains that surrounded the Empire’s encampment in the movie.

Paul ends up using his family atomics on the Shield Wall instead of firing them at human targets, which is a clever loophole because there’s nothing in the Convention that forbids you from using atomics for other purposes as long as they’re not being dropped on people. With the Shield Wall blown open, Paul is able to bring sandworms into the conflict which is a decisive factor in his victory.

I think that’s something they could have explained with, like, two lines and it would make the giant hidden atomic stash feel like much less of a random asspull.",2024-03-01

The underlying problem being, although Chani is firmly against Paul ascension into this half manufactured half inevitable godhood, she really didn’t have an alternative to it. They are hunted by the Harkonnens, they have to go south. After that point of plot, her rejection to Paul feels more like throwing a tantrum. All she could do is to yell at people, but that feels really ineffective to say the least

The problem with what you are saying is that your assuming that they are adapting the book well.

"Calling Paul a 'villain' is indeed a bit much 👍🏽 - BUT let me list some things that the films outright say & show which makes Paul an antihero at least, albeit perhaps a tragic one.

Both films state multiple times that the Fremen's Lisan Al Gaib prophecy is fake propaganda that was planted by the Bene Gesserit over many years to manipulate them. Paul too is shown to be aware that it's fake. He sees a vision in Part One - in the tent where he inhales spice in the air following the Atreides' massacre - of a Holy War that could happen in his name, involving the Fremen; One spanning the entire galaxy, killing billions perhaps. AND YET, in the ecological station scene the very next day, he tells Liet Kynes that he will become the Fremen's Messiah & use them to gain revenge against the Harkonnens & the Emperor - all despite knowing that the Fremen's prophecy is fake, and that his plan *could possibly* result in the terrible war he had visions of. He repeats something similar to Jessica in the beginning of Part Two - ""I must sway the non-believers, and use them to disrupt spice production; that's the only way to get to the Emperor"". 


>He can see the future, he can speak brand new languages just because, and he comes back to life in a ritual no man has ever survived

None of this is because he's an actual hero of prophecy though - Paul's abilities are the result of him being the endproduct of a millennia long eugenics program by the Bene Gesserit (the Kwisatz Haderach). Paul & Jessica are essentially posing his science-given KH abilities in front of the Fremen as 'fate given', making the latter believe that it's because he's the Lisan Al Gaib of their fake prophecy, so that he can seize religiopolitical power over the Fremen, primarily for HIS goals.

>He rejects certain actions because he has a premonition that they'll end badly, but then has a new premonition that we don't see and acts on it.

Yeah, this is why I still said he isn't a villain, more like a tragic antihero. While it *was* both selfish & manipulative of him initially to use the Fremen's fake prophecy to control them for his revenge's sake, after spending time with & getting to know them, he DOES genuinely begin to care for Chani & her people. Him taking off his Atreides ring while saying ""Father, I've found my way"", and then showing anger at Jessica for continuing to manipulate the Fremen, refusing to go South etc all being evidence of his real change of heart.

 I called him 'tragic' because after the Sietch Tabr attack, being forced to go South, and then seeing the visions after drinking Water of Life, he really didn't have a choice anymore BUT to seize religiopolitical power over the Fremen. BUT, things wouldn't have reached such an extreme lose-lose scenario (i.e. 'get annihilated now' versus 'Surviving, but also starting a Holy War that kills billions') in the first place, if he hadn't selfishly picked this path for personal revenge at the end of Part One, despite knowing the risks from his visions.  Jessica had even suggested that they simply escape offworld using Stilgar's help back then - Paul was the one who refused at the time. The actually right thing to do really was him taking the L and escaping, rather than manipulating an entire native population and then leading them to a galactic jihad, primarily for his revenge (at least to begin with).

Before you say ""What about the Fremen's liberation?"" note how Paul himself didn't say a word about that in either the ecological station scene in Part One or the beginning of Part Two. It was only after he started actually caring for the Fremen that this too became a main goal for him, rather than just a side effect. Also note that the Fremen were able to survive relatively well against the dumb brute Rabban - and it was only the more aggressive attacks under Paul's command that led to Rabban being replaced by Feyd, the attack on Sietch Tabr, and so on.",2024-03-21
"Nah, I disagree. I mean I don't agree that he's a villain either, if anything he's a very tragic character who I massively feel for. But he ain't a hero and the movie tells you that.


Obviously he's a charismatic triumphant leader, no one would follow him if he wasn't, and as the audience we are kinda in their shoes as we see his rise to power. It *is* epic, we are supposed to get caught up in the frenzy too.

But the sheer amount of cosmically negative and spooky music whenever Jessica and Paul talk about him becoming the prophet, the way in which stilgar gets increasingly fanatical, all of Paul's tears throughout the movie, his defeated look when he says ""lead them to paradise"". Chani as a character is basically a walking flashing billboard that screams ""WHAT PAUL IS DOING IS BAD"". And ""the holy war begins"", holy wars have never been anything other than horrific.

Paul is (was?) a good person at heart, thrust into tragic circumstances. I don't think he's evil, but he certainly unleashes evil, in order to fulfil the terrible purpose he's burdened with.

The movie doesn't scream THIS GUY IS EVIL, but it sure as hell tries to make you stop thinking he's a hero by the end of the movie. I think it's so well done.",2024-03-21
"In the movie, nobody knows until Paul takes the Water of Life. ~~This is a plot hole because~~ When Jessica takes the Water of Life, she would have had access to her mother's memory, but this isn't shown to the audience.

What’s your conflict about Jessica?,2024-03-01
"I think what they did with Jessica sets up really interesting conflict with Chani in Messiah.  Jessica is completely blinded by her visions of grandeur for her son and becoming the chosen one she was trained to create, while Chani is more the voice of reason of seeing how out of control these mechanisms have gotten them thanks to bene gesserate and fremen fanatics synthesizing this monster out of a once innocent kid",2024-03-01
"She wanted Paul to go south and ally with the other tribes, but she didn't want him to declare himself the messiah and ruler of the Fremen. Remember the bit at the beginning where she talked about all the Fremen being equal and Paul said he'd like to be equal to her? She respected Paul as a fighter, but since she didn't believe in the prophecy, she (accurately) saw his claim of being the messiah as a manipulation of her people. She wanted the Fremen to rule themselves, not submit to Paul's rule. When Paul took power by declaring himself messiah and then Emperor, it made her question if he really had the Fremen's best interests at heart.",2024-03-01
"She wants what's best for her people, but within fremen ranks she even shows that she doesn't like the fanatics because their believes are based on lies (the bene gesserate meddling starting thousands of years ago). She knows if they go their route of winning freedom by giving power to the fanatics there will be repercussions.

At the same time the harkonnens fucking suuuuck and shed rather see them toppled and give her people a better chance to live freely.  She knows he can be a great leader but gets upset with the fanatics meddling and using their worm piss to power him up, fundamentally changing the guy she's grown to love

At the end though a final straw for her was seeing Paul making the deal with the emperor for the princess's hand.  Paul claims to not be just a foreigner yet in that moment he still prioritizes a foreign custom of marrying another royal family to gain power.  She doesn't give a fuck about royal houses and all that bullshit so she takes it up on herself to walk out to make a statement.

Paul can see all now though so her told her those sweet little nothing's before hand as a way to help patch things up with her down the road",2024-03-01

"she wanted him to go south because the fremen, and she needed him as muad’dib the legendary fedaykin freedom fighter. she never fully believed in the prophecy shit anyways. she believed it was bene gesserit manipulation of her people and everything up until that point tells us Paul agrees and doesnt want it

Isn't the reason obvious? It was to make sure that audiences didn't leave the theatre thinking that they witnessed a hero's great triumph - but instead, dwelling on how Paul had *in effect* wronged, betrayed & hurt Chani (though *we* know that after a certain point, he had very little choice in the matter).

 Her character in the film is used by Villeneuve throughout Part Two to indicate how the audience is supposed to be feeling about Paul's actions at each point - a necessary step considering how many antiheroes (including Paul himself from the book) had been mistakenly idolised by many in the past.",2024-03-20

"> there was no reason to make changes like this

I can think of a few reasons for those changes, namely to give Chani something to do more interesting than being Paul's adoring housewife. As for Jessica, she kinda recedes in the background in the second half of the book, and this gives her a bit more agency.

> this film seemed to have missed the point of the books

Did it? Frank Herbert, 1985:

> Dune was aimed at this whole idea of the infallible leader because my view of history says that mistakes made by a leader (or made in a leader's name) are amplified by the numbers who follow without question.

I don't think the movie missed the point of the books at all. If anything it's made clearer in the movie than it is in the books.",2024-03-01
"To address one particular bit, I think the idea of Stilgar being affable, friendly, wholesome-seeming, and even comedic, while engaged in this religious rhetoric, isn't some kind of tonal miss. It's to show the different sides of this kind of belief. 

Ultimately, this is a character who goes from being Paul's mentor to his closest friend and advisor, to his most loyal right hand servant in warfare and violence on a massive scale. He truly believes in Paul. He's filled with real, positive emotion.

""Send them to Paradise."" How does Stilgar react? With the biggest smile of his life, as he prepares to set off on a galactic jihad that kills billions (I really hope we get the 'Genghis Khan and Hitler' conversation in the third movie, feels like something Denis would skip for his distaste for heavy dialogue, but it's so interesting.)",2024-03-01
">its treating its audience as stupid and does not need to do so

BRUH. There are people idolising Tyler Durden, Eren Yeagar, Tony Soprano, Walter White, Don Draper, Logan Roy & countless other such heavily problematic characters even today.

Heck, some people who had read the first Dune novel alone had mistaken it for yet another white saviour/'chosen one' story too, as opposed to a deconstruction of those tropes.

So I absolutely DON'T blame Denis for deciding to make the film's themes more evident, & emphasising more on whichever traits & actions of these characters served those themes better. The visual medium doesn't have the luxury of pages of internal monologue to clarify such things after all.

As for Chani: You do realise that Herbert's writing of this 'love interest' in the 60s is definitely dated today, right? Chani being given some actual agency & a personality that functioned as an ideological foil to Paul & Jessica made her WAY more interesting than the Nth 'sci-fi native culture girlfriend'.",2024-03-01

I don't think she was set up to be specifically important to the reclamation of Arrakis. Just for Paul's future, which she was.

- We show Paul forming friendships with more of the Fremen crew 
- Have Feyd specifically target and torture aforementioned crew as part of his governorship

Part of that is hubris. Part if it is that they believed they would be safe behind the Shield Wall, with an entire army of (what they belived were) the best soldiers in the known universe.  
  
They did not expect Paul would violate the cultural taboo on using nukes, they did not know Fremen *actually* ride sandworms, and they did not know how strong the Fremen were (nor how *many* of them there was).  
  
> then the great houses just show up with one call, historically those calls go unanswered in the face of an emperor.  
  
They just found out that the Emperor had violated the balance of power agreement which their entire culture was based on. Once that box was open, they all knew that any of them could be next if they happened to become too powerful, so of course they'll show up.

"I think book readers shouldn’t go into these movie thinking every detail is gonna be kept in the movie or that it would be entirely consistent with the book in such a short time. The makers of the movie will choose to tailor it towards movie watchers rather than book readers. And they need to make it so that the watchers are able to keep up with what’s happening without confusing them and overwhelming them with an overload of information. 

I do agree that the second half felt rush in some parts. But it definitely feels like there  is more likely to be a director’s cut on the horizon. It’s not a written rule but movies usually aren’t this long or even longer because then theaters won’t be able to make more profit. If you cut the movie down to 1hr and 30 minutes rather than 3 hours, then the people who want to profit from this can make double the money because they get to do twice the number of showings in theaters. And that’s probably the root of all this. Profit. So when we think about why this part is sped up or why that part is left out or not fleshed out or changed, it’s probably because of the aforementioned restraints.

Edit: also, to have Alia come into the picture now will risk the focus of this film, which is entirely about Paul ascending to this god like figure and his vengeance. And I guess that is why they chose not to have Alia be born because if so, they’d have to write a four year old stabbing an old man. And if that were to happen, they’d have to develop Alia even more in this same film which would take time away from the focus they want.",2024-03-03

Paul seems like just another timid good guy, the Harkonnen are stereotypical angry and ugly villains and it seems to build up to a very standard revenge story.

Part 2 completely changes that, it expands and elevates all the characters and story elements. Paul’s shift in personality is perfectly executed and so enthralling to watch, the new characters are all great and the story in general becomes so much more complex and interesting compared to Part 1. Add to that Villeneuve’s amazing directing and filmmaking in general and Dune Part 2 is a definitive Sci-Fi film of this generation.",2024-03-03
"Felt the same sadly. Although I have not read the books, the second half of the movie still felt stupid/rushed at times, and some of the character decisions felt forced. To list my major grievances against the movie - 

  
1. Chani alone going against the flow of her entire tribe seems stupid, at least make a rebel/non-aligned group or something which she leads or is a part of.  Personally, I think she should have been written to be supportive of Paul, maybe use another character to oppose Paul.

2. Should have shown more of how drinking the blue liquid changed Paul. They hinted some things, but they didn't lean enough into the horror aspect of it (which I loved in the first part). 

  
These are all I remember at the moment, but I loved the first Dune a lot more. Everything flowed more naturally in the first movie. They should have pushed some content to the 3rd part of the movie in order to make drastic character changes more digestable to the viewers.",2024-03-03

"1) Kwisatz Haderach is a superbeing with immense prescience & Bene Gesserit abilities that the BG had been trying to create through eugenic programs over centuries. So a product of science (in a version of our universe's distant future where spice exists & is discovered).

Lisn Al Gaib is just the ""chosen one/Messiah"" of a fake prophecy that the BG had planted over centuries on Arrakis (they do similar manipulation of local religions on other planets as well, to control the people there, if ever such a need were to arise). Paul & Jessica are essentially posing to the Fremen that his ""science given"" Kwisatz Haderach abilities are actually because he's their Lisn Al Gaib of prophecy (Paul & Jessica refer to the Fremen's prophecy as fake multiple times in this movie itself). 

Paul's prescience aside, him being able to ride the Grandfather worm first try was just a coincidence; Chani is actually forced by Jessica through the Voice to give Paul her tears, to wake him up after his Water of Life coma - in order to make the ""desert spring tears"" part of the prophecy appear real (Jessica's use of the Voice in this scene, Chani saying she didn't like her Desert Spring name earlier on, & the reason now being revealed to be its association with the prophecy she hates, are all changes from the book made specifically to emphasise how Jessica is making the prophecy SEEM real to the Fremen. How Paul actually wakes up is also told to the audience earlier on, after Jessica's Water of Life scene - transmuting the poison through Bene Gesserit training; whether Paul, who has by this point embraced becoming the Lisn al Gaib, was intentionally waiting to wake up until he recieved ""Desert Spring Tears"", or if he had woke up exactly then by coincidence, or just being exposed to Water of Life again - mixed with her tears - as in the book, is unclear).

In any case, No - the Kwisatz Haderach isn't the same as Lisn Al Gaib - one is a real, planned result of science; the other is a fake chosen one of fate, that Paul is just pretending to be.

2) The ocean is only in a possible future. It doesn't exist yet.

3) No, Paul actually does see a possible future where seas & vegetation are developed on Arrakis. Ecological transformation of the planet is a big theme here.

4) Paul only drinks the Water of Life AFTER he goes South btw. He goes South despite the terrible futures he had seen till then because Sietch Tabr got massacred by Feyd (he was upset that he couldn't foresee & prevent it through his currently limited prescience), and because Chani tells him that the survivors were refusing to go South themselves without him.

5) Yeah, Paul has an easier time with Feyd in the book cos he could foresee pretty much all his exact moves. But a one-sided fight like that is what would have underwhelmed most other people, as opposed to the more tense one (with Feyd seeming like a decent threat) in the film.

3) Not really? He will do anything for Fremen and most of what he does is for them to have better future. That's like one of his primary motivations.

4) He couldn't forsee Feyd destroying Tabr. This scares him and he never wants to experience that again, to not be able to predict the danger that could harm those closest to him. To get proper vision of the future, not just random fragments, he needs to drink the water of life and that's what he does. Again, one of his main motivations is for his friends and Fremen to have good future. 

5) In the book Paul is basically a god after drinking the water of life. He sees many futures, sees a narrow path how to get the one where Fremen and his friends prosper and then just follows it.

> The emperor falling for the world’s dumbest trap was…insane. Why was your daughter and whole army or even you there ? Really sloppy writing where character motivations went out the door


He ""fell for the trap"" because they were all misinformed, as far as they knew the whole planet only had about 50k Fremen, not literal millions of them who, as it turns out, are actually the best trained soldiers in the universe. IIRC, not only did they not know about the atomic bombs (or assumed they couldn't be used for whatever reason), the usage of atomic arsenal is prohibited, so never in a million years did the Emperor or any of them expect to face such a ruthless first strike which disabled all of their defenses.


As per the Wikia:


> Atomics harbored a pronounced psychological and social stigma, and were rarely used due to traumatic historical events. **Their prohibition was enforced by the Great Convention, which dictated that the offensive use of atomics is grounds for planetary annihilation.**


> The destruction of part of the Shield Wall by Paul Atreides just prior to the Battle of Arrakeen, which led to the defeat of the forces of House Harkonnen and the Sardaukar, and the the Ascension of House Atreides. **By using them on the shield wall, and not directly on the opposition forces, Paul was able to circumvent the Great Convention, paving the way for his ascension.**


As for why he brought his whole army? We already know how he was jealous/afraid of Paul's father and his growing popularity, it was just a pompous display of force I guess, he's the emperor after all. Also, he's dealing with the Harkonnen whom he used to do his dirty business, and I'm sure he's well aware of what kind of people they are, who knows what they'd try to pull if he came around unprepared and they realized they could take advantage of it in some way.",2024-03-09

"Tl;dr - You should read the book(s).  

> why again is spice so important?  

Space travel is dangerous/crazy, etc. Warhammer 40k actually got a lot of their inspiration from Dune. Long story short, Spice lets the navigators get through space. Without it, no interstellar travel.  

> and to that end, how is Paul gonna make Dune a paradise while not giving up spice and thus crippling everyone? i guess that's a big plot point for the next movie  

Yessss, read the book(s).  

> if the other houses aren't going to listen to him anyway, why still marry the Emperor's daughter? surely that would clear that problem from the table and he can go back to Chani while also then killing all the emperor's people for betraying his father. And is he not also the Harkkonen next in line with the 3 leaders gone and him the grandson? maybe there are others in line I guess but he has claim to at least two houses  

Movie slightly different than books. Read them.  

> and to that end did ALL of the Atreides go to Dune?  

The House royalty, etc did, yes. There were survivors, etc, but those are commoners. No one cares about them. The house members that *matter* on the galactic stage were wiped out.  

Rest of your post shows a very fundamental lack of understanding about fanaticism and how powerful propaganda is. You should read the books.",2024-03-03
"1) Movies completely glossed over the Space Guild, who has a monopoly on space travel. Their navigators are high on spice and that way they can travel through space safely, because they have a short prescience (very similar to Paul's). There are no mechanical wormholes, they are bending the space (you can see this in the first movie, a bit). Basically, no spice = no space travel, no trade, and also no prolonging of life for the rich.

2) This is a huge plot point of the series

3) This one was a movie mistake, the scene should have been more similar to the book. Paul discovers how spice is actually made and through this knowledge he could potentionally destroy it. Navigators of the Guild are present in that last scene in the book and when Paul is threatening to destroy all spice, they can see through prescience that he is actually capable to do it. They therefore call the fleets above Arrakis to go away. Emperor's whole claim on the throne is that he can assure the spice to flow through trade, if he cannot do that, he has no right to rule. Paul, who controls the spice, controls the universe.

4) Their literally said in the first movie that there are still Atreides on Caladan, that's why Jessica wanted to leave the planet with the smugglers. 

5) Read a bit of Muslim history, how they spread the word of Islam after Muhammed's death.

"Jessica drinks the ""the Water of Life"", which is basically super-duper concentrated Spice that is poisonous to whomever consumes it. But Bene Gesserit like Jessica are trained to possess complete mastery over their bodies own chemistry and are able to transmute the poison. Those who survive this ordeal achieve access to the memories and personalities of their female ancestors, but only the female ancestors, the male line being a dark void, and are known as Reverend Mothers. During this ritual, a Reverend Mother near death can also pass along her own genetic memories to another, carrying on the line. So Jessica contains within her mind the personalities and memories of generations of Reverend Mothers before her, as well as all of her own female ancestors.

However, because she underwent this ritual while pregnant, her unborn daughter Alia was awakened to full consciousness while still within the womb, and just like her mother also gained access the memories of her female ancestors and Reverend Mothers. This is considered by the Bene Gesserit to be an abominable act, since an unborn child does not have their own established persona to wrangle all of the other personalities living within their mind and keep them from taking control.

In Paul's case, he's the Kwisatz Haderach, the end-goal of a centuries long Bene Gesserit breeding experiment to produce a male who could access both the genetic memories of his female AND male ancestors, and when combined with his prescient abilities would essentially become omniscient, a being able to see and perceive all across all of time and space.

The other part of the equation that is “he who controls the spice controls the galaxy” is that the navigators who actually fly the ships by using the spice have more power than the emperor himself.  By threatening the spice fields, he has the navigators under his thumb.  This has given him enough leverage to overthrow the emperor, but it’s still an unstable situation because Paul is doing it at gunpoint",2024-03-02

the spacing guild has a monopoly on space travel. They're the ones Paul threatens with destroying the spice, which would also destroy the empire. So the spacing guild bows to Paul, which forces the great houses to as well. The holy war is the fremen unleashing their religious fervor on the galaxy.

In the book he lived with the fremen for around 3 years waging guerilla war before taking over the Empire.

The harkonnen ancestry doesn't really become important until later on in the series, for Paul it's more of a shock that the man he hates the most is actually his grandfather, and reinforces his disdain for the bene gesserit and their scheming. 


Paul wanted to avoid going south because that would set him on the path of his visions, and he wanted to avoid that at all cost. As he said to Chani early on, the fremen should have their own destiny and be free of outsiders and their prophecies. But when Paul has to finally go south and drink the poison, he fully sees what lies ahead and realizes he has to follow his visions. In short, he has to start the holy war and kill billions in a bloody jihad, but that future is much better than if he *didn't* follow his visions, in which case humanity would decay and die out.

With how it's integrated into the Freman's fighting style after Paul ascends, it was probably something that would be a pita to do the CGI for, when they've just established that they're badass fighters through exposition.  I'd still love to see it though, same as you!",2024-04-07

And it just gets worse as the books go on and Herbert starts typing with one hand. 

In comparison, I really like how the DV films handle the BGs and I can't think of one change they made that I don't agree with. To me, Paul killing the Baron was very cathartic, Chani and Feyd both felt more well-rounded, and I really appreciate how they handled Alia (I'm not a fan of ""little kid with adult personality"" characters because it always feels like the author just didn't want to bother writing an actual little kid.

"> I'm still a little confused on what's the fake religion implanted by the bene gesserit and what's real


This obfuscation is somewhat the entire point in a thematic sense. It goes to show how powerful the Bene Geserit are in religious manipulation, so powerful that most don't know what's planted or not. But it also plays into themes of religious fanaticism that is inherent in humans in the real world as well.

"The BG did this universe wide. They would plant the messiah story on each planet, sometimes customizing it to the locals and their customs. It was done only to give their sect potential safe passage, if any of them would get stranded or imprisoned on these planets.

So it wasn’t really an entire religion, it was just a messiah story.  Just like on earth, we didn’t have one messiah or messiah story, we had many. Then people would form religions around these stories as people would present themselves as the possible ‘one’.",2024-03-02
"It was created by the bene gesserit while they were already in full manipulation to be a seedling for further manipulation if needed.

Then Paul just went and actually did it with Jessica believing he could.

As to the answer of what's fake and what's real, I think the bene gesserit knew it was one day possible if the perfect specimen were in place but while they were trying to create the perfect specimen they would've never let them get into position unless as a last resort.

Jessica talks about how she probably did bring about the Kwisatz Haderach in Paul and it comes to fruition.

Only female Bene Gesserit can survive the Water of Life, but the Kwisatz Haderach was foretold to survive it as a male Bene Gesserit and obtain essentially unlimited powers of prescience.

On the other hand, the prophecy that the Fremen believe in was put there - seeds were planted - by the Bene Gesserit in Arrakis as part of the Missionaria Protectiva over centuries. It was meant to help Bene Gesserit obtain safe passage among the locals, in case they needed it on the oppressive planet - they allude to this in the first movie as well.  Kynes notices how Paul wears his stillsuit and thinks he might be the prophecy etc.

So Paul really does have the powers and is the Kwisatz Haderach, the fulfillment of Bene Gesserit prophecy.  At the same time the story of the prophecy was planted within the Fremen and the Fremen fall prey to Paul's ascendance.",2024-03-02

The overarching narrative of Dune as a whole is, you shouldn't give absolutely power and faith to a single charismatic leader.  Denis tweaks it to make Paul more sympathetic, and resistant towards his inevitable rise to power.

At that point of the movie where he drinks the blue water.  He was completely lost.  He was afraid to face the fanaticism that surrounded him, and he is basically told by the spirit or whatever is lingering by Jamis, that he needs to see clearly.

It does feel super anti-climatic, sure, but I think that's the point. In the first movie I recall Rabban executing a lot of soldiers who really can't do shit besides wait for their deaths, he never came across as an actual, intelligent capable fighter.


> The emperor didn’t really feel menacing or powerful at all.


I think that's the point, he's just someone with too much power and influence who's growing more jealous and suspicious as he grows older, hence the whole strike against the Atreides as well.


> Important people being on the front lines all the time were lame. Whether gurley or Paul.


Paul had to absolutely be on the frontlines and prove himself at each and every turn if he wanted the Fremen to see him for who he really was, that was absolutely essential to the story up until this point.


> Sardaukar being weak was lame but I read many comments it’s the same in the book. The Fremen and desert power is underestimated.


It's not that the Sardaukar are weak, as there's a lot of things to consider. For one, the Baron/Emperor were lead to believe that there were only roughly 50k Fremen (I think that's the number) in the whole entire planet of Arrakis, when in fact there were millions of them, and as it turns out, they're an even greater force than the Sardaukar themselves.


The other thing is that they never expect for atomic warheads to be available/used by Paul/the Fremen, as their usage is forbidden which is something that absolutely caught everyone off guard and destroyed their defenses, which allowed a straight path for the unthinkable number of Fremen to flow in along with the desert power that only they have tamed.


With all of this in mind and who knows what else I could be forgetting, it's no surprise that things turned out the way they did.",2024-03-13
">why was Chani so upset at the end?
>I get it on an emotional level, but if you look at it logically

You're asking us why a character is ""upset"" (an emotional response).  A reaction like that isn't governed by logic alone even in real life; Especially not in situations as extreme as what these young characters are going through. Having said that, here's my take:

Paul seizing religiopolitical control over her people using the fake prophecy (with the help of his eugenics-given powers), is EXACTLY what he had been promising Chani for the entire film that he *wouldn't* do. ""I don't want power; I'm not the Mahdi; The Mahdi should come from the Fremen; I just want to fight beside you; I would like to be your equal"" etc - these are what Paul used to tell Chani, so everything he does after taking the Water of Life was a total betrayal of all that.

I agree that Paul didn't have much choice except to seize power AFTER Sietch Tabr was attacked (& then post-Water of Life, seeing how every other remaining possible future at that point led to their annihilation). BUT Paul had never told Chani that ""this was the only narrow path to their survival"" (only Jessica was present when he explains this). So ""according to her""/from her perspective - he really was going against everything he had promised her, solely to gain power over her people for HIS personal revenge against the Harkonnens & the Emperor. Another instance of poor communication & self-centredness on Paul's part which made ""Chani upset in the end"", was how - unlike in the books - he didn't explain to her that his marriage with Irulan would be a PURELY strategic one. Talk about adding insult to injury.

Her entire culture as she knew it being changed into one of bloodthirsty religious fanaticism, the man she once trusted & loved seemingly dishing out one major betrayal after another - Who WOULDN'T be upset in her situation?!🤷🏽‍♂️ Heck, even if Paul had tried to explain things - she would still have been rightfully angry imo... Because even the best case scenario *at that point* (which is what happens in the rest of the film) is all of her people getting turned into blind followers of this manipulative foreigner, & going off to kill BILLIONS across the galaxy.  

 It's even arguable that the more honorable way at that point was for the few MILLION Fremen (plus Paul) to just fight as best as they could & ultimately die (note how this is how the Fremen usually think anyway - having so much water from their dead saved away, but never drinking them even when dying of thirst, etc).


> If you want the liberation of the Fremen, then Paul chose the only correct path 

Also, you seem to be under a misconception that ""the liberation of the Fremen"" was Paul's primary goal here. Think back to Part One, after House Atreides got wiped out - Paul & Jessica speaking to Liet Kynes... he had already seen visions the previous night of there being a huge risk of a horrifying galactic war being fought in his name; AND YET he says out loud that he plans to become the Fremen's fake Messiah in order to use them *for his revenge against the Harkonnens & the Emperor*. Not one word was spoken by him about wanting to ""liberate the Fremen"". 

Even in the beginning of Part Two, he tells Jessica that they must convert the non-believers in order to *disrupt spice production, as the only way to reach the Emperor* . Again, no mention of liberating the Fremen. While he DID eventually decide against this plan after getting to know & genuinely care for Chani and the other Fremen, by then the events leading to Jihad were already set into motion (even accelerated by Jessica). Such is the tragedy of this antihero. 

BUT make no mistake, there *was* once a choice mentioned in these films, by which he could have led to a FAR better outcome for all parties involved. Instead of prioritising so much on his revenge (his father didn't believe in it; perhaps Paul did because of the Harkonnen in him), he could have simply taken the L and escaped the planet using the smugglers instead (which is what even Jessica had suggested at the very end of Part One). This was surely the right thing to do after seeing how seeking revenge could lead to SUCH a horrifying, galaxy spanning Holy War.

 He didn't care about liberating the Fremen at the time; Fremen themselves, while somewhat oppressed -  were still surviving relatively well against the dumb brute Rabban (remember, it was Paul's more frequent & severe attacks that led to Rabban being replaced by Feyd, and Sietch Tabr getting attacked in the first place). If Paul hadn't joined the Fremen to selfishly seek revenge despite the risk of Holy War in the first place, NONE of this would have happened.

 The first film had begun with Chain's voiceover ending with the question ""Who will our next oppressors be?"". The damage that Paul & his mother did to the Fremen (turning friends into followers, sending them off to kill & die for him on OTHER planets etc) is arguably far worse than whatever Rabban could have done. The Fremen aren't ""liberated"", they're just being ruled by another  lying foreigner now.

He’s so much more than that now. And the same is true for Paul. The man who woke up and took control of the Fremen is not the boy she fell in love with. Hes something different now.,2024-03-19

Chani never wants to Paul to seek the throne. He promises to reject his role as “messiah” and just be a fighter. But then he rises up and takes power, and takes Irulan’s hand in marriage. 

Chani is characterized as a skeptic of the prophecy and to see Paul use it to take over the imperium and take another woman’s hand… her running away heartbroken is the only ending that makes sense and was perfect to me

>and it’s kinda boring to me how without exception every Harkon is just a straight evil dude who loves being bad for badness sake. The trope of “ILL EVEN KILL MY SUBORDINATE” is so played out and happened like 6 times, only with the Harkons. 

agree 100%.  I was looking forward to more Baron and Rabban.  There's a whole subplot to Baron's schemes in part 2 of the book that they left out that shows his cunning and deviousness.  Instead it's just killing your highest advisors because you can't implement a PIP.  It leaves them far less interesting.  

 
> damn combat spins

Again, part of the difficulty is the book.  Part of the BG training is the 'weirding way', which is this hyper control of the body that allows you to move with great speed (think super ninja/Jedi).  That's how Jessica bests Stilgar and Paul bests Jamis in the first movie- totally outclassing them to the extent that Stilgar says the boy is toying with Jamis.  Bearing in mind, Jamis is a great fremen fighter, and the fremen in general are better than the Sadukar.

He focused more on the Bene Gesserit and set them up as the antagonist for the next movie.

It became one when all the trees were cut down and there was nothing to trap the water. It’s also not only water from the dead, at least in the books. They collect moisture from the air with wind traps.  

Secondly, the Fremen have contact with the spacing guild who control all interstellar travel. The guild depends on spice, and the Fremen bribe them with spice to not allow satellites over Arrakis, to help them stay hidden (that’s why there’s so little intel on the south of the planet).

But when Paul finally goes south and accepts the future, he turns into everything she hates. He's leading the fremen on a religious jihad and reinforcing their faith in prophecy and tradition. Sending the fremen out in the end is the last straw, where she storms out in disgust at what the fremen are now.

He's cruel and violent, and while he's not cunning, he's not *really* stupid. Or at least, he's smart enough to notice he's losing badly. In fact, he's the only Harkonnen in the movie who seems to be actually terrified of Muad'Dib... and proves to be rather right about that, isn't he?

Anyway, the ""power leveling"" of the fremen kind of requires that previously formidable obstacles become inconsequential nuisances. Sure, a big fight between Gurney and Rabban might have been cool, but (just my personal opinion) I thought it was pretty badass to show him just get punked. Maybe Rabban's off his game from his loss in power and favor, maybe Gurney is just built different.

"Other than the Fremen going off to war, the ending is quite different from the book:

* The Emperor genuinely liked Leto and wouldn't have called him weak. The reasons for attempting to end the Atreides were 1) they were becoming too popular among the people, and 2) Leto was a cousin with male heirs, while the Emperor had none.

* Lady Fenring's husband, who is a master assassin, declines to kill Paul. He's a failed attempt at creating the Kwisatz Haderach and feels kinship with Paul.

* The other Great Houses that arrive at Arrakis are the ones who *do* accept the transition of power. The ones who don't show up are who the Fremen go to war against.

* Chani is much more of a passive character in the book. Paul and Jessica assure her at the end that she will be his wife in all but name. Chani in the movie is a device to show the audience that Paul isn't a hero.",2024-03-15

I think Paul could’ve easily told her the future and all he foresaw so she would be less angry, but it might screw up the future he planned around.

Because she didn't believe in the prophecy herself, she felt (accurately) that him claiming to be the messiah was manipulative - that he was using religion to control her people, in ways that went beyond just earning their trust with his fighting skills. 

Early in the film, she talks about how all the Fremen are equal to each other, and he promises he wants to be equal to her. Declaring himself a messiah (let alone Emperor of the universe) obviously goes against that. 

More generally, she thinks that the Fremen should liberate themselves, and that the fundamentalists are weakening themselves by counting on an external messiah to swoop in and save them. Since Paul initially denies being the messiah, she thinks they're on the same page. But after taking the water of life, Paul embraces his role as the ""messiah"", which makes her deeply uncomfortable.

Some of the Harkonnen troops notably do have rifles (like the one who nearly shoots Paul in the first fight of part 2), probably because they've adapted their battle strategy to account for the unique conditions on Arrakis. The Sardaukar are outworlders and have not adapted to fighting without shields, which is why they only carry blades. Seems a little far-fetched that the best fighting force in the universe wouldn't prepare for that, but to me that can be explained by their own hubris at never having been defeated in battle.

That was also the dream of Kynes, she mentions it in the first movie (and really in depth in the book), but that dream was put on hold once they discovered the Spice.

Not to spoil much of the next part of the story, Paul does start that process of terraforming Arrakis once he becomes Emperor, so it's not an empty statement, but at that time he is simply saying what he needs to say to have everyone proclaim him the Lisan al-Gaib.

"Power in the Dune universe is a balancing act, while there obviously is an emperor, there is still a balancing act with the Spacing Guild (monopoly on space travel), Bene Gesserit, and the great houses where power is shared. 

Paul doesn't just become the emperor, he gains full control over the spacing guild as he ends up exerting full control over spice production (he who can destroy, controls a thing). The guild not only needs the spice for space travel, but the navigators are addicted to space without which they would not live. Additionally, the Bene Gesserit also require spice to a lesser degree. 

By gaining absolute control over interstellar travel and commerce, you can imagine the great houses feel incredibly threatened with effectively all their power being removed. 

Also the use of atomics in the Dune universe is a huge no-no. It's established in the novel that if a house were to use atomics against another, the offending house would be wiped out by the rest of the great houses. While Paul uses atomics against the shield wall and not people, it wasn't a good look.

The Kwisatz Haderach is the prophesized male who could undergo the ritual.  Paul then unlocked the genetic memories of both the male and female family members.

Thing is, no one expected or even deemed it possible for atomic warheads to be used, because their usage is outlawed (although they were used here in a loophole kind of way because they didn't target any actual humans directly), which is what blindsided everyone and utterly destroyed their defenses.

 There are Maula pistols, which fire poison darts and are used alot on Arrakis by the fremen, who don't use shields. But the fremen use hit and run tactics, and benefited from the empire always underestimating their numbers and capabilities. It's just not worth the effort to ressurect an extinct technology that may not make a difference in hit and run attacks.

"1. In the books, they slide off the side of the worm or exit from the tail. Also the worms get tired and stop eventually.
2. As implied earlier that scene, the emperor did not know how many Fremen there were, and he certainly never dreamed they could overwhelm his defenses as well as defeat his Sardaukar in open combat. The nuke, which took out his shields –and the worms– would have been a surprise as well. You might say he was punished for his own hubris.
3. ""The slow blade penetrates the shield,"" as explained in part 1. Fast objects such as projectiles have a harder time piercing through, so sustained pressure is necessary.
4. ...the armor does seem ornamental, all things considered. Which wouldn't be too weird considering the myriad displays of symbolic military tradition already present in the Dune universe. I guess it's better than nothing if you're not using a shield?",2024-03-02
"> How did they take the emperor so easily?

Another commentor largely covered it, but in the movie they didn't portray Paul's threat to wipe out the spice as important as it is in the books. The spice is used to extend life and those that use it enough are addicted to it and will die (or at least face very adverse consequences) by being unable to use it any longer. The Bene Gesserit get their abilities from the spice. The Spacing Guild navigators, who provide the ability to travel in space get their abilities from the spice. So Paul threatening to destroy it all wrecks all of that. So much so that the Emperor has to consent to Paul marrying his daughter and stepping down from the throne.",2024-03-02

""Part One"" and ""Part Two"" is intentional.  They're best thought of as a singular story.  In that way a lot of the elements in the second movie are grounded in the first, so they don't feel unjustified.

It really worked for me.  I love slower, dialogue, character driven movies as well (The Holdovers is one of my favorite recent films).  But there's nothing wrong with an accelerated plot if it has a purpose.  Birdman (2013) has a widly rapid pace, and that movie's fantastic.",2024-03-21

She's clearly not happy about the Irulan thing, but I don't think romantic jealousy is her biggest issue. So it's a difference from the book, but I think it makes sense for her character as it was changed for the movie to be more anti-colonialist. Even if Paul had still been willing to marry her, I think she'd still be angry at how things played out - Paul marrying Irulan is just the unhappy icing on the cake for her.",2024-03-01

It's right after he opens the message from Muad'dib (which we also speculated was asking for more cowbell)",2024-03-05
I believe Shaddam IV was paranoid that Leto would try to overthrow him. Leto was more popular than him and had the most powerful military of all the Houses.,2024-03-01
"He was concerned that House Atreides was growing too powerful and Duke Leto too popular and saw them as a threat to himself. I think they talked about this in the first movie more, but the book also goes way more in-depth.",2024-03-01

It assumes you have seen the first movie and doesn’t bother explaining much of anything about the world. You should watch the first movie.,2024-03-01
You really need to watch the first movie. A lot of stuff will be referenced and not explained and you’ll feel very lost.,2024-03-01
"You could probably watch this one having just read the wiki summary of part one, but it'll be a much richer experience to see that one first.

That being said, the first Dune can be a little bit slow at times because it's doing a ton of world-building and setup for this second film.",2024-03-01

"When the Emperor gets the metal pipe thinf that has writing on it and he drops it and Irulan picks it up and reads it, remember that? 

The message is from Paul (I think) and him being alive is a threat to the Emperor because he orchedtrated the destruction of House Atreides and the other houses would get mad at him if they found out so the Emperor realizes he must go battle Paul",2024-03-02
"Paul being alive meant the Baron dropped the ball and either didn’t know it or was keeping stuff from him. 


The situation was pretty much getting desperate with the Fremen destabilizing the spice so Paul being alive in the mix meant that he needed to get a better handle of the situation.",2024-03-02
Was definitely in the first movie as well,2024-03-02
"He changed tunes because he took the water of life. He has all the knowledge of his past ancestors and all his future visions are made more clear. He’s literally a superhuman after that.

Him learning his true lineage was just more of an interesting wrinkle. It doesn’t really change his actions.",2024-03-02
His part was cut,2024-03-02
"""you die like an animal"", it's Paul referencing the box scene from the first movie. Baron was driven by desire and impulse his whole life so he died like an animal just like anyone who fails the gom jabbar test.

"I don’t think so- while the new “Dune” movies are visually stunning, great special effects, costumes, etc, they lack the sense of fun that “ Star Wars” did when it was new in 1977.  With  “Star Wars” you wanted to see it again as soon as it was over, because it was like nothing you had  seen before ( I was 15 in 1977). The “Dune” movies by nature of the story, don’t seem to me like something I would rush out and see again right away. 

The only recent movie viewing experience I can think of that was like “Star wars” in 1977 was “Avengers: Endgame” on opening night with the entire theater audience so excited to be there to the story conclusion of the MCU movies at that time. There was  so much to take in during “Endgame” , I ended up seeing 3 times the first week it was in n theaters.",2024-03-02
IDK about that visually I agree it is beautiful but from a story telling perspective they are definitely missing details and this film has alot of wasted potential,2024-03-02

"Alia (Anya Taylor-Joy) was exposed to the Water of Life in the womb, they showed it as blue fluid coursing everywhere. This had the impact of essentially making Alia a Reverend Mother while still a fetus.

In the book, Alia is born and talks to Fremen as if an adult from age 2.",2024-03-02
"When they drink (and survive) the water of life ceremony,  it imparts into them all the knowledge and wisdom of their female ancestors. This isn’t something they allow everyone to do, only a very select few. 

If they are pregnant, this imbues all that knowledge and wisdom into the fetus. It becomes conscious. This is seen as an abomination among the Bene Gesserit because they have no way of knowing if this person was worthy. It also could potentially dilute or sabotage their lineage of reverend mothers with a rogue thought process.

BG are the ultimate control freaks. Anything that can disrupt that is seen as an existential threat.",2024-03-02
Its definitely something that should have been explained in the film which the books and even the dune mini series from 01 explains. Definitely an important plot line,2024-03-02

I'm almost disappointed in how little of the emperor we see. Trailer made him look so imposing and calculating but what we got was pretty limited,2024-03-02
The movie is frankly terrifying.  It was kind of funny at first with Stilgars blind devotion and you want to see the Harkonnens punished but by the end the fervor is totally our of control ,2024-03-04
"The scene before, too, when he just says “take the prisoners in the other room, kill the Sardaukars” and we don’t even see these elite fighters get taken off, and likely the Sardaukars didn’t even understand the order since it was given in the Fremen language. We’re just left at that, left to imagine the chaos that must have ensued. Brilliant",2024-03-09
">  I think I prefer this over little psychic toddler with a safety pin as a weapon

I've been thinking about it and it honestly fits better narratively to have Paul be the one to kill him. Paul's entire life has been ruined by the baron, there is much more narrative tension between the two. Meanwhile Alia wasn't even born when the shit went down. She just kinda drops into the second half of the narrative randomly in the book for Frank Herbert to get rid of the Baron because the character doesn't matter much anymore by that point in the book, since the Emperor has more or less taken over as main antagonist by this point.",2024-03-04
It's funny the early trailers made it seem like the battle will be drawn out. But they took them down real quick,2024-03-06
"Small correction that I found weird that no one corrected, so much so that I'm now doubting if I saw it right, but I'm pretty sure he stabs the Baron in the neck, seemed like through the spine.",2024-03-10

"He practically married Irulan in order to have legitimacy to the throne. Purely political. Had he not done that, the Imperium would have resisted him more and more violence would have ensued.

It was the “slim path” but also the “least violent” path. The movie didn’t show it as much, but the books constantly reminded you the torment Paul went through from his visions. Any step or deviation from his destiny meant more suffering and worse things to happen, both to him and everyone around him.",2024-03-02
"In the books it’s a purely political marriage so he can have a legitimate claim to the throne and it’s made clear that while he’s marrying Irulan Chani is still his actual love, just like how Jessica was the Duke’s even though she was never married to him. They basically went a completely different direction with Chani characterization this entire movie (which I think was good choice since in the book she doesn’t do much beyond just blindly loving Paul and has no other real traits which would have come across extremely bland on screen)",2024-03-04
"Speaking of

Drax still 0-2 vs Thanos in hand to hand",2024-03-03
"Oh man, you’d get a kick out of reading the next few books 

The final line of book one which was concluded with this movie was Lady Jessica telling Chani “history will remember us as wives” 

It is a triple loaded statement. In book one we know that the histories will be written by Princess Irulan, she writes with great respect and empathy for Paul but makes it clear they have a loveless marriage and he is still fixated on Chani, among other things. Second, it’s a reference back to Duke Leto whose dying regret was not marrying Jessica and emotionally neglecting her for the sake of politics. Lastly it is in that forgiveness of Leto an acknowledgement Paul is repeating the sins of his father. ",2024-03-08
"In the book he takes Irulan as his bride and Chani as his concubine, much like Jessica was to Leto. Chani bears his children and Irulan gets the title (also, she raises the children after Chani dies).",2024-03-03

"No perhaps about it I thought that was pretty clearly what was going on, otherwise why would he do it",2024-03-06
"In the book, Chani and the Emperor’s daughter very clearly understand what the arrangement is, and it’s very clear Paul is marrying her in name only but will be staying with Chani as his real partner. 

This change was the only thing I didn’t like about this movie, honestly. This understanding (in the book) gives it one of my favorite moments and favorite lines, when Reverend Mother Jessica- who had herself “merely”, as far as title was concerned, *only* been his father’s concubine- pulls Chani aside and reassures her “History will call us wives.”",2024-03-17
"In the books it’s blatently explicit that Paul marries irulaian for politics.



   He says something tot he effect of we will be married but you will never know my touch, my love, or my interested.  I married you to control the throne. Oh and btw Chani over there is my actual love and we are going to have more kids despite your dad killing my son.",2024-04-01
He married her because House Corrino has led the Imperium for generations. Marrying Irulan legitimizes his claim to being the Emperor. Chani getting mad and running away is actually an awful change to the story.,2024-03-03
Perhaps?  He literally says he’ll do what he has to do to take that slim path. Everything he is doing is to further that goal.,2024-03-28

"Yeah but you'd think Chani would ""get it.""  Especially being a Fremen, where you do the best thing for the group instead of for yourself.",2024-03-02
"In the books it’s obvious because each chapter begins with historical texts written by Irulan telling us about her husband, Emperor Paul Atreides.



In the movies they had to plant that idea in our mind early, so Paul basically spelt out a version of this to the Fremen Planetologist in the first movie. People who are surprised by this turn of events probably missed that line (which to be fair, did go by pretty quick, she just laughed off the idea a boy who just lost his whole House still planned to become Emperor).


Also I haven’t read enough of the book to know if a similar scene happened there.


But the idea is, you don’t need future vision to know marrying Irulan is the quickest way to the throne. Future vision just helps Paul plan things better, the principles don’t change.",2024-03-05
"I don't think it’s necessarily fair to depict Chani as depicting Herbert's views, rather than his conception for a science fictional society of Buddislamic desert nomads.

Edit: he didn’t start to insert his weird views on women until god emperor. lol.",2024-03-02
"It pisses me off too if the movie set us up for believing Chani was betrayed, even if he still loved her by all appearances she was no longer going to be in his life. She has to accept his destiny was taking him in a different direction.",2024-03-05
Lady Jessica never married Duke Leto and had Paul and alia for the Duke. The Duke never married lady Jessica and kept the option open for political reasons. She was his concubine and yet he loved Jessica more than anything. This is how it was reconciled with Cheni. Paul has to marry the princess irulan. It's political for the emperium. Cheni is his love and concubine. My recollection of Dune Messiah is foggy but I think I remember he distanced himself from irulan after a while. She wanted to get pregnant but he wouldn't touch her but I may be misremembering.,2024-03-03
Tell her that in the books Chani wasn't even mad,2024-03-04
"Well I think he was essentially apologizing for what he was about to do. And emphasizing it was something he had to do, not what his heart wanted.",2024-03-02
"Yeah the film didn't do that part of the book justice. 

In the book, Paul says to Chani that Irulan will be his wife but she shall have no touch, no desire, no love, and no children. And Chani will be his concubine. And then lady Jessics comes up to Chani as well and reaffirms that Paul will only ever love her.",2024-03-02
Yes that's the point of that scene.,2024-03-03
"Quite the opposite, that was the point.

Best cinematic experience I've had.,2024-03-05
I like my Cinemark on the XD screen more than the local imax,2024-03-02

"Just going to warn you, the series doesn’t really hold up after book 2 imo. I stopped after book 3 because I had lost all interest at that point. 

Absolutely worth reading at least the first book though.",2024-03-04
What were the biggest changes?,2024-03-07
Your mom rocks ,2024-03-08
Having a simultaneous streaming release didn’t help,2024-03-09
It was definitely because of Covid. WB simultaneously released all their movies that year on streaming so none were really box office successes.,2024-03-12
"I saw this as Paul understanding Feyd was the kind of person who would relish the moment of death, and used that as his only opening. He had to take a mortal wound to bait Feyd into a careless flourish",2024-03-01

"Paul making that move pretty much furthered the legend of him in front of everyone who witnessed the fight, especially now that he's heading into the holy war against the Great Houses",2024-03-02
They even prepared you for this with his fight in the stadium. He's full of arrogance and hubris and fights accordingly. It is on brand for him to get the winning blow and then gloat about it.,2024-03-02
Also lines up with the ornothopter earlier where they could only attack it when it was attacking them.,2024-03-02
I was expecting that scene to be another vision. Then it goes back and the fight is only a few seconds before Paul stabs him in the face. Showing how he can view different timelines so clearly now.,2024-03-03
john wick chapter 1 moment,2024-03-01
Was anyone else confused by Feyd's ability though? He basically slays drugged up combatants and is nearly bested by some ordinary tech guy who isn't drugged.  But Paul deeply struggles with him? I didn't fully buy it!,2024-03-03
">Paul lets himself get stabbed in a non-lethal (but very NEARLY lethal) spot so he could go for the kill.

He was stabbed in the stomach first then kills Feyd Rautha with what looks like the same exact wound he already shrugged off",2024-03-04
And Gourneys first training scene seemed to reflect the same moment in Dune 1,2024-03-03
"That fight was rigged from the start, Paul can literally see the future. It was still an amazing fight scene though",2024-03-04
"I think he just did it so that he could kill Feyd with his own weapon -- the emperor's weapon, therefore being twice as boss.",2024-03-03
That's the ending to Samurai Champloo xD,2024-03-03
His shield only drops when he fires ,2024-03-09
"This part confused me a bit, because earlier Feyd nearly died in the colloseum-esque arena, if he didn'thave his shield. So to me he didn't feel like such a difficult opponent to Paul.",2024-03-06
He kinda does that twice lol,2024-03-06
"Very ""Our Flag Means Death""",2024-03-08
">Edit for names

Absolutely nobody cares why you made an edit",2024-03-22
It’s also a total callback to that scene in part 1 when he’s training w Gurney,2024-03-05
"It's also a payoff for his training scene with Gurney in Dune: Part 1, where he gets stabbed in the same spot",2024-03-04

"Honestly emperor and Harkons were beyond fucked from the beginning lol 

Path to Victory is insanely busted and always will be.",2024-03-02
"> so clearly Paul knew this was coming and how to win.

"Feyd killing the Atreides guy in the arena played out similarly too, he let's his opponent's blade push forward to get leverage to strike.",2024-03-04
"Yep, which is why he took the duel to begin with, despite the protestations of the others. The film at that moment even has Gurney Halleck say ""Why is he so reckless?""

Because he's not being reckless at all. It's all part of the plan.",2024-03-03
Paul has a vision in Part One where Chani kills him during an embrace in this same way.,2024-03-05
"Non book reader here

I was so convinced the vision he saw was that he needed to die in that fight for his people to win the war, and that he was going to die in that fight.  Breathed a sigh of relief when he didnt.",2024-03-07
It's also the same move he used on gurney in the first movie,2024-03-02
And the bene gesserit explain this about how they can control him.,2024-03-04
I just rewatched it and it looks like the blade in his stomach is still there but it also doesn't make sense that way so maybe I was seeing things,2024-03-05
"Why did feyd stick his blade into Paul's shoulder though, and not his heart?",2024-03-27
"But why the second stab Feyd did was to Paul's shoulder? Non lethal?

He should've gone for the throat or something, Paul was weak",2024-03-05
This! It's not exactly the same but it's definitely a call back to Gurney training where he teaches Paul about the surprise attack. I thought of that immediately.,2024-03-01
"The movies parallel each other, the finale of both is a well-planned surprise attack on Arrakeen, then Paul participating in a 1v1 duel to the death.",2024-03-05
"Oh good point. I was thinking ""damn he's gonna grip a bare blade?"" But yeah no shit the dude already tolerated the box test",2024-03-01
I love how it shows how both Gurney and Duncan trained him for this. Duncan even pulled a blade out of himself in part 1 to continue fighting.,2024-03-01
"He was initially stabbed in the side of his stomach. That blade stayed there. Rautha then gets control of Paul’s knife and Paul grabs it with his hands and deflects it into his shoulder. While that knife is in his shoulder Paul removed the blade from his side and kills Rautha with it. Then removes the blade from his shoulder

The whole point, which is explained better in the books of course, is that Paul sees the only way to win is to play into Rauthas weaknesses. Paul lets him think he wins the fight by allowing himself to get stabbed in a non-lethal place which makes Rautha relax for a split second. This was foreshadowed in the way they destroy the ornithopter by attacking it when its shields are down as it fires, and in the first training scene fight with Gurney

Also it kind of echoes Rauthas own fight where he lets his opponent control the knife in the gladiator fight to toy with him",2024-03-03
"Yea the way they introduced Feyd was so fucking bad lmao. Shielded up strongest bad guy with 2 weapons actually struggles against a random prisoner fron house Artreides but somehow he almost wins against Paul, who is shown to be one of the best (if not the best) fighter in the series. Also, what does Feyd even add to the Story that Rabban couldn't? Just replace Rabban with Feyd from the start of Dune 1, skip the horrible Feyd introduction and nothing changes.",2024-03-31
"I was really looking forward to him in this movie, but then I remembered he died taking down some Sardaukar in the last one and it was Thanos who survived.


I forgot what happened to the family’s Mentat, did he die in the last one, too?",2024-03-05
Idk if you’re trying to be funny or not. Paul’s own dagger is in his side that he was stabbed with. He removes this as he’s being stabbed in the shoulder and kills Feys-Rautha.,2024-03-01
Where did you get that?,2024-03-01

"In combination with the other comment, Arrakeen is also protected on all sides by natural and / or artificial walls that protect it from sand worms.

"God I wanted him to kill her too. I had a little Arya Stark Kill List for the characters in there.

- Baron Harkonnen: Gut him and feed him to worms.
- Emperor: Bitch slap him, let him live as the court jester.
- Reverend Mother: Killed on sight, promote one of her underlings on the spot.
- Feyd-Rautha: Duel to the death",2024-03-09
"There’s a line that got cut from the books where he says “this is my don jabar” referring to her box and poison needle test. He has put her in the position she had him in the beginning, the BG order must now endure however much pain he says they must or he will destroy them.  ",2024-03-08

"I thought he called Jessica an abomination, which is a reference (easter egg?) to Alia being called an abomination for having awakened before being born, but that scene cannot be used here since in the film's timeline Alia is not yet born during this part.

  
I don't know why they made Alia not yet born in the film. I wonder if Villenueve thought having a smartass 2 year old with space magic powers would lessen the impact of the climax.",2024-03-01
"It's so fucking good in imax.

It rumbles through you.",2024-03-02
"When Jessica told Chani to ""Do it"" with the Voice it was like getting stabbed in the ea. Such powerful sound design, made better by being on IMAX.",2024-03-02
"Just came back from a screening and the sound design was amazing. Felt every single vibration in my seat, and the Voice gave me shivers every time.",2024-03-01
I just got out of seeing this in Dolby and the rumbles were so strong during that scene. It actually took me off guard for a brief moment. That was perfect to what she was feeling. I am so glad I was able to see it in Dolby for the sound balancing too. So good,2024-03-03
I LOVED THAT! Brilliant call to the book while still keeping in line with the movie's story plotting.,2024-03-02
Reverend Mother is calling Alia an abomination and simultaneously scolding Jessica for creating such,2024-03-01
"My theatre cracked up, it was perfect.",2024-03-02
This is the first movie I've seen in IMAX and I could literally feel the impact of the sound of the voice through the speakers. It was freaky.,2024-03-13
That’s supposed to be Alia she calls an abomination. Denis seems to have decided it was impossible to not make Alia look stupid so he skipped it.,2024-03-02
I wish they would have included the spice orgy. Nobody ever points out the darkness in Paul that they feel and fear. They just kiss in the desert after Stilgar nonsensically sends Paul out into the desert alone. And Chani disobeys and follows him because she is wiser than everybody else in the story and knows best.,2024-03-01
Tbh his expression screamed i wanna fuuuck this guy more to me lol,2024-03-12

yeah I was totally waiting for it,2024-03-12
"I also caught that Butler nailed the Baron’s accent, which added a level of creep to the character. Well done",2024-03-18
"I don't think that line really made much sense though. In the book she's screaming abomination at Alia, and has to nearly be removed from the room for freaking out so much. But with the movie not doing the 2 year time jump, it doesn't fit as well for her to be calling Paul an abomination.",2024-03-03
Scared to death. Scared to look.,2024-03-05
I assume he also thought it would make his legend greater.,2024-03-03

"There's also the part where we actually see color is in the interior of the stadium, which then grays out once they go outside. I found it impressive how they were able to combine artificial and real color simultaneously.",2024-03-02
The working theory is that the weird spider mutant was actually the Dr’s wife… which was a result of the Baron experimenting/torturing her.,2024-03-02

We also got the Dukes healers and Feyd's 'girls'.,2024-03-02

Basically the Crayfish monsters from Thief 1 and 2.",2024-03-03

">What I missed was those weird spider mutant pet things from the first movie, I wanted more weird stuff like that. 

Having not read the book, I also wouldn't have minded some more creatures. When Stilgar is sending Paul off on his first journey and tells him to keep watch for giant trapdoor spiders and centipedes, I thought we might get some more creatures but nay. Not a big criticism though, it's fine without them.",2024-03-18
Same with Giger reference. I have to imagine the design team and Denis used those designs as reference.,2024-03-03
"That perfectly captures my characterization of the film. It feels absolutely breathtakingly fresh, even in the modern era of CGI and sci-fi films. Like every scene felt like a brand new experience. Completely blew me away.",2024-03-11

Great Britain,2024-03-03
Yeah that was def a bit on the nose still a good scene tho,2024-03-01
There were a couple unsubtle scenes and snippets of dialogue throughout that I didn’t love yeah,2024-03-02
I thought it did a good job of showing the Harkonnen's renewed efforts in subduing Arrakis. Feyd's getting this massive invasion force that Rabbon didn't have.,2024-03-10
"You can tell it’s not a flashback because when they show the characters going from the interiors to outside in the scene, they transition from colored/lit to monochrome. I thought it was such a unique transition.",2024-03-02
"They commented on it in the dialogue, saying something about “our black sun.”",2024-03-01
"Think about camera exposure, the more exposed to harsh sunlight the more things becoming radically black or white.",2024-03-02
"In the establishing exterior shot before Feyd encounters Margot in that hallway, you can see that the fireworks are being shot up from the ground",2024-03-03

Plus I was annoyed by some of his pacing in the final scene.",2024-03-05
"So you smiled for 6 minutes total?? 😅 not hating, but I wanted more of him.",2024-03-04
"Has Denis ever given an explanation as to what drew him to casting Walken as the emperor because my headcanon is it's entirely due to the Weapon of Choice music video, and Denis had to wait 20+ years to see this vision come to fruition",2024-03-03

" > She took on an ominous, almost villainous presence in almost all her scenes right after she drank the Water of Life.  

I had a moment during this where I realised what exact itch was being scratched in my mind, and it was that _this_ was what the SW prequels should have been like in regard to Anakin's fall to the dark side (being an increasingly powerful and radicalised ""prophesised one"") with a powerful figure on his side pulling the strings in the background (Palpatine).  

It felt like all those times you wonder about what if _[insert good guy]_ actually takes up the bad guy's offer to join forces.",2024-03-01
"She became just like Mohaim by the end, and the transition made total sense. Paul’s resentment of her for her meddling hurt her deeply in Part One, but in this one the grand plans have taken priority",2024-03-01

"Denis Villeneuve doesn't believe in bonus deleted scenes. From IMDb trivia:

> Denis Villeneuve said he will not release any deleted scenes, explaining, ""I'm a strong believer that when it's not in the movie, it's dead. I kill darlings, and it's painful for me. Sometimes I remove shots and I say, 'I cannot believe I'm cutting this out.' I feel like a samurai opening my gut. It's painful, so I cannot go back after that and create a Frankenstein and try to reanimate things that I killed. It's too painful. When it's dead, it's dead, and it's dead for a reason. But yes, it is a painful project, but it is my job. The movie prevails. I'm very, I think, severe in the editing room. I'm not thinking about my ego, I'm thinking about the movie.""

"That scene where she's talking with Chani and isn't wearing all of her usual raiments was a little jarring because she's just dressed normal like the rest of them, but her face is COVERED in tattoos.

Symbolic for the character, she wears the trappings of her position but is not trapped by them.",2024-03-04
Fremen language I'd say,2024-03-03
"I agree, but I feel like this is portrayed terribly in the film. One conversation with Jessica is all we get. I feel like they really lean into the Paul as a “villain”, whereas I always read the book as he was a reluctant/ tragic hero.",2024-03-04
"Paul: “fuck, the least deaths I can possibly manage is like 60 billion, the universe is such an a-hole”",2024-03-05

they want to do more. and this is already on track to make profit. third will easily be Messiah.,2024-03-02
"Yes, DV said he's almost done with the script but doesn't want to rush anything. I just hope that means it's not longer than 2 years, cause I can't wait that long.",2024-03-02
"Its confirmed but its not set in stone exactly when. 

Don't listen to anything the trades and such say, the actualy conversations are done in secret and happened in 2022 or early-mid 2023. Rumors already indicated part 3 was a done deal when Part 2 was tracking high for its original 2023 release, they just aren't making official announcements yet as these are complicated shoots and scheduling for all the people involved -- basically they have all sorts of options and stuff in various contracts and have to execute the options and are working out the details to do that and time it right for public release.

Legendary (who owns the Dune rights) will make the film. There is no chance the owners of Legendary don't take the money.",2024-03-03

"The empire thought there were only a few thousand Fremen, there are actually millions.",2024-03-04
"Forget the numbers, how do they have the competence to attack all the great houses? Their power came from the home field advantage, they can use the sand worms, hide under the sand, and yeah, they’re good fighters too, but in Arrakis. 

I haven’t seen much that would convince me they could fly spaceships across the universe to attack other, sandless, planets. They seemed fairly backwater, actually. Well adapted to their environment, but no great technological innovations or anything. Great house should just be able to pull back and shell the planet until they’re all gone.",2024-03-04

Like Paul and Chanis kid. ,2024-03-02
"This is the main reason why, while I love these two films, I still think that a miniseries (or a full series if they adapted all books) is the best medium to adapt Dune. Especially nowadays when tv series look as good as films (House of the Dragon looks almost as good as Dune).

Edit: Do people here only watch films once and solely in IMAX? IMAX theatres ain't exactly common outside the US either...",2024-03-01
In the book he joins with the Baron cause he distrusts the Lady Jessica for something that was cut from the first movie. Makes sense to just leave him out and we should have seen it coming since they didn't cast an a-list actor like for everyone else,2024-03-01
Oh the books had a whole subplot with him being captured by the Harkonnens and then trying to take them down from the inside.,2024-03-01

They managed to look the scenes on Geidi Prime really alien despite them being humans. Obviously great visuals as well with the lack of colours and the NPCs being clone-like and their weird applauses,2024-03-01
"Everyone on Giedi Prime being bald was super funny.

Is it a mandate from the Baron? Do they all love the Baron so much they do it out of solidarity (doubtful)? Is it genetic? Does the black sun cause hair loss?",2024-03-01

"Agreed.

 I thought it was refreshing she was skeptical of the prophecy, and less passive in regards to Paul's strategic marriage to Irulan.",2024-03-01
The syfy mini series (which I love even if it's low budget) covers those points.,2024-03-06
"Additional changes, the emperor was originally sad at killing Leto Atreides and acted all depressed.

"I agree with the other commenter where I love Chani's change in the movie. She's basically Paul's lapdog in the book, and let's him walk all over her. I also like how in general there's at least ONE Fremen individual not fully onboard with how things are shaping up. Having it be the one closest to him is that much more meaningful.",2024-03-19

It's mostly in the contextual details - who she is with, who goes from ""challenger"" to worshiper, who guards her, how many handmaids she has. She becomes the spearhead of Paul's cult, and we see it play out with startling effectiveness in real time. 
  
At the end of it, they've converted a people into an army ready to commit (and successfully carry out) an interstellar crusade, weaponizing their hope of a green Arrakis to do so.",2024-03-10

"I remember reading somewhere that Butler in this role reminded Villeneuve of Mick Jagger. When I saw the trailers, I thought, ""Hmm, he kind of reminds me Billy Howerdel from A Perfect Circle if we were going to compare rock stars (obviously due to the shaved head and general build),"" but when I saw the movie, I got where Villeneuve was coming from. 

All respect to Sting, but Butler killed it (no pun intended) in the role.",2024-03-06
I saw Elvis for the first time the other day and didn't recognize him here (or hear that he was supposed to be in this) at all,2024-03-04
I could only see Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luther when he was in that bald cap ,2024-03-08
Was waiting for him to say thank you very much since he claimed he simply cant shake the elvis accent instead of admitting he just wants to sound cool,2024-03-01
I really thought he was Bill Skarsgard the whole time. I didn't know until the credits it was Elvis.,2024-03-01
According to Austin Butler he based his voice off of young Stellan’s performances.,2024-03-10
"i didn’t look too much at the cast beforehand, honestly was like ‘is that bill skarsgard??’",2024-03-14
"Man, I’m surprised people liked Feyd’s voice. It screamed 1984 Dune weirding module to me",2024-03-01
Felt like I was genuinely watching Stellan’s son. He was scary good ,2024-03-01
"My big problem with him in Elvis and Bikeriders was he's supposed to be this super likeable guy that everyone is inherently drawn to, but he's just a pretty face.   Like there isn't any charisma or anything that endears you the audience to him in the same way all of the characters are.  



As Feyd Rautha, however, that vacancy really lends to the character's sociopathic nature.",2024-03-01
He’s a fucking incredible actor.,2024-03-01
He was so scary and those closeups they do and you wanna look away but also want to stare? I am glad they showed his coming of age thing.,2024-03-01
"there was a shot of him, I think it was when paul kills the baron that they cut to his reaction and legit looks like he comes in his pants right there and then watching it happen",2024-03-03
honesly any doubts people might have had about him after Elvis should be washed away by this performance.,2024-03-01
"""Mama... they're taking me to Arrakis""",2024-03-02
"He put in *so* much work. The script gave him almost nothing, he had to build that character practically all on his own, and he *did*. Like as much as I respect Zendaya's work in this movie she was given so much material. They gave Austin nothing and he made everything with it!",2024-03-04
The editing of that movie really took away from his performance. Second half of Elvis is a acting masterclass,2024-03-06
I feel like there was a hint of Sting in there too.,2024-03-16
"i really don't get it, seen so many people say something similar. he's perfectly fine in this but idk why that performance is praised so much",2024-03-01

He’s also incredible in Masters of the Air.,2024-03-04
Dude was channeling Bill Skarsgård from It.,2024-03-01
"Totally, there were a few scenes where it felt like I was looking at a lion on the Sahara about to kill its prey.

Him absolutely loving having that knife so close to his face was great.,2024-03-03
I thought of that too when i thought he was giving snake-vibes in the arena fight. Someone else said lion,2024-03-03
My only big criticism of the movie is we didn't get enough of the Harkonnens in general.   Like I would've been more than fine with trimming some of the fat off Paul's story in the beginning to give them all more screen time.,2024-03-01
"I think the unhinged psychotic type villains are the most fun to watch. He really nailed it, you could tell he put WORK in to make that character the best he could but still had fun with it.",2024-03-09
Honestly I’d say he’s better than the original idea too (Sting butt ass naked),2024-03-01
Bill is the only answer,2024-03-02
Yes I was very confused to hear space Elvis when he was presented to us and then for that to disappear completely,2024-03-01
SAME!!! That first line sounded exactly like Elvis,2024-03-03

"Wasn’t Keoghan first rumoured to play Feyd anyway and then replaced with Butler?

Yeah he kinda plays the same Elvis character in Masters of the Air. ,2024-03-10
"I thought he was Bill the whole movie, until I checked the cast. He really reminded me so much of Pennywise.",2024-03-05

Feyd would probably think his body being eaten by the desert was pretty badass too.,2024-03-01
"I actually kind of love how he didn't seem upset at all. He clearly respected Paul and was happy that it was someone great like Paul who killed him. The way they played his character and scenes was brilliant because it honestly felt like he would have been disappointed to win.

"Also he’s barely of age and Lea Seydoux is already pregnant with his daughter. One might say he died before his time, but he might say he’s just doing speed run. 100% speed run, even, as I’m sure he was technically the head of House of Harkonnan for like 15 minutes before he died.",2024-03-05

"I was worried about Austin Butler, because I've found him too boybandish in previous movies, but I'm happy to say I was wrong. He played the role well.

I like that all Harkonnens have a growl to their voice.",2024-03-04
He was my favorite. I must read too much dark romance because I found Feyd-Rautha exceptionally attractive. My toxic trait is thinking I could change him.,2024-04-02
"He was predictable. All his story beats were boring, and it didn't make sense that he was able to beat the drug free prisoner ",2024-03-01

"Have you read the books? The Harkonnens are meant to represent the absolute worst in human decadence and depravity, which is meant to contrast against the Atreides being paragons of honor and integrity. They even toned down some aspects from the books, such as the Baron being a pedophile. Being shocking is kind of the point.",2024-03-03

what does that even mean?,2024-03-03
"I legit teared up during that scene. It wasn't sad, more like .. triumphant and intimidating? But emotion definitely welled up.",2024-03-11
"Absolutely loved that switch from ""I'm not the Madhi, guys"" to ""Bow before me, for I am the end times"".",2024-03-02
Probably my favorite scene in the entire movie. Because it's when he commands the fear of God into every tribal leader and also avoids having to   follow the rules by killing Stilgar. You can feel the power he wields in that scene just from the audio and cinematography. Fantastic,2024-03-02
"It was his best scene in the movie, he was absolutely captivating. I knew it was, y’know, an omen of the coming bad times but I was smiling so big",2024-03-05
"Great scene.  Throughout the movie I couldn't help think at times  Chalamet is kind of scrawny rather than a tall slim bad ass.  I'm not buying him as a great warrior.  But after that scene,  LISAN AL GAIB!!!",2024-03-04
"I legitimately teared up. Wasn't expecting to, but something hit me there.",2024-03-11

">perhaps Chalamet deliberately leaned into the boyish, humble portrayal extra hard

100% yes. In one of the scene where they're waiting outside of cave, see his body language. He was standing there awkwardly like doesn't know what to do with his legs, he moves around and get closer to Chani and friends. We instantly feel that nervous energy because we've all been there. So, very deliberate indeed.",2024-03-02
"I mean yeah, Dune is a coming of age (and coming into superpowers) story so that does seem very likely. It's just good acting to do that",2024-03-01

"My exact thoughts, by having him seem so “sincere” and innocent, it really highlights the contrast of him taking control of the Fremen and accepting his role as their leader/messiah and forthcoming Emperor of the Known Universe.",2024-03-02
In the book there is definitely a shift after he crashes the ornithopter,2024-03-02
This was 100% by design.,2024-03-03
"That was the biggest thing Denis said when making the first film, he liked Tim's boyish quality.",2024-03-03
"Pretty sure he did. I watched the King before Dune part 1, and he looks a lot older in the former. When watching Dune I was surprised he looked so young and boyish.",2024-03-04
"Going into the first movie I had originally thought it was a really dumb casting decision. Oh, how wrong I was",2024-03-12
"Yeah, the first movie makes you forget that this actor is pushing 30 only for the second one to hammer it home. He doesn't look any less young and twinkish but he suddenly carries himself with such force and authority.",2024-03-01

You would think a theatre kid like him would have clearer diction!,2024-03-03
"I had the same feeling sitting in the theater. Like I haven't seen an epic fantasy done this well, on this scale, since LoTR. Both thought to be unadaptable. I'm SO ready to see the epic conclusion to the trilogy.",2024-03-08
"In some ways yes and in some a hard no. Dune will lack the light-hearted parts that will make people include it into their day to day life. Of course it will be pop-culturally important, but to imbed itself as deep as LotR? I doubt that.",2024-03-11
"LOTR released at a time where movie going was at an all time high. Dune pt 1 went to streaming first cause of a pandemic. I remember rumors pt 2 might not have ever happened, whereas LOTR was a calculated gamble that filmed all at once.

I had a group of Zoomers behind me in the theater and they were just as engaged as any millennial / gen x / boomer that was in the theater.",2024-03-04
"People forget that LoTR had plenty of FUN characters too that you could root for and have a laugh with. In Dune like 95% of everyone is an asshole trying to kill each other. 2 wildly different stories and just because their scale is similar, it doesn’t mean you could say they’re equals or have the same cultural impact.",2024-03-07
"Agreed. LotR was a genuine phenomenon. Dune is very popular, especially in “film bro” circles like Reddit & Twitter, but I would argue it’s not as wide reaching as LotR was. The box office has been solid but it’s not even as big as your average peak-MCU film.",2024-03-04

Yeah for real that slap sound must’ve been added in post because no shot he didn’t even have a mark after that one,2024-03-03
I think I can make a steelman arguement for why that makes sense. Jessica says his vitals are so low they're practically unnoticeable. Maybe he just doesn't have the blood flow that soon coming out of the trance.,2024-03-11
He absolutely deserved that slap. He lied to Chani and was manipulated by his mom to make Paul what he said he wouldn’t become. He’s a dick.,2024-03-05

"I think it would have been hard to portray Alia as she is in the book without running into a CGI Renesmee kind of issue. Like it's maybe a bit hard to do without being cheesy or cringe. I guess they transferred 'people being weirded out by the all-knowing baby' to Chani getting creeped out by the level of reverence for Paul, and general 'non-believers'.",2024-03-02

"In Dune sometimes people are born as “abominations”. When Jessica transmuted the Water of Life she gained the memories of all the reverend mothers before her + the memories of all her maternal ancestors. Because Alia was in utero when she gained those memories Alia also gained the prescience, powers, & memories that Jessica got. In addition to knowledge of the voice, fighting style, survival skills, etc.

Just imagine for a minute how fucking creepy it would be to make baby noises at a newborn only to have them quote the book of revelations at you in perfect English. Now tack on psychic powers and supernatural knowledge. Additionally abominations are vulnerable to being possessed by their ancestors so if the baby happens to be a descendent of Genghis Khan? Whole new level of terrifying",2024-03-01
"People already gave you the answer, but I'll add the the fucked addition that there's a passage where alia described how frightened she was during the ceremony because she was suddenly filled with consciousness while still trapped in rebeccas pitch black womb and had no idea wtf was going on or why she couldn't move at first",2024-03-01
"It was because she drank the water of life (blue juice) while pregnant. Alia (the baby) was basically jump started into consciousness in the womb while simultaneously gaining all the millennia of past memories from previous Reverend Mothers along with Jessica, minor spoiler coming up for the next books but I don’t know how to do the block out thing










She also gains some prescience of her own but not at the level of Paul’s",2024-03-01
The baby gained full awareness and the memory of all her ancestors while still in the womb.  You're not supposed to do it while pregnant because babies that get all that power and knowledge usually don't turn out well,2024-03-01
"In an instant the undeveloped mind of a baby gained millennia of knowledge and had that be its first experience of consciousness, essentially a god in human form.",2024-03-02
"Your ""self"" is the summation of all your memories and experience, the baby has none of that and now has like a thousand generations of old lady memory crammed into it. The baby has no base to fall back on to float and is swamped by all this other crap from predecessors. It is overwhelming and a unprepared/weakened mind is at the mercy of strong memories. Its not a stable combo",2024-03-03
"I also love how Bardem's portrayal of Stilgar as the movie progressed became more and more fervent and fanatical.  He started the movie as *""Eh, maybe you're HIM""* ultimately to **""LET ME OFFER MY LIFE TO YOU JUST SO YOU CAN SPEAK IN THIS GATHERING""**",2024-03-01
And it's so grim a scene in retrospect,2024-03-01
"Right?! I love that portrayal, like a boomer leaving a facebook comment lol",2024-03-01
"Only the true Madhi denies his own divinity!

Well what sort of a chance does that give me? Alright then, I *am* the Madhi!

He is! His is the Madhi!",2024-03-01
"When he did the ""mind blown"" hand gesture was the funniest part of the film",2024-03-01
"I think there was a hard cut to that too

Paul: I’m not Mahdi

cut to

Stilgar: He’s so humble! Such a Mahdi thing to say!

Fundamentalists: I know right?!",2024-03-02
"*""He's not the Kwisatz Haderach, he's a very naughty boy!""*",2024-03-02
"Really did a great job of characterizing a religious genetic and not making them a bumbling fool or intangibly evil/cruel. 

Braden gave such a humanity to the character",2024-03-01
"Absolutely. I've read the first book, and for some reason it didn't totally click that they're basically space muslims but his portrayal really drove that home.",2024-03-03
Bardem with the unintentional incredible comedic timing on those line reads.,2024-03-02
"Same, the whole crowd cracked up and looked around at eachother! Great moment!",2024-03-03
I lost it at that. Didn't think there'd be much humour in the movie.,2024-03-07
"But Stilgar isn't always that way in the novel.  He's slowly converted from an independent leader to a 'creature of the Lisan-al-Gaib', and it's one of the things that makes Paul afraid.",2024-03-06
"I got a dirty look for laughing at that line hahaha 


I had liked the movie but my theater audience made me feel like things I was laughing at weren’t intentionally funny and in my head made me question if the lines weren’t meant to be funny and therefor kinda bad. 

I’m glad I had my initial reaction reaffirmed here lol",2024-03-18
Except stilgar was not one of the blind fanatical. He later holds Paul's children in his hands and entertains the thought of murdering them. ,2024-03-04

I don’t know. It’s terrifying but I think it’s still often played as a joke. It was just ridiculous to the point of humor but because it was still believable it made it also scary,2024-03-02

"And of course the cinematography! That scene right at the beginning with the Harkonnen dropship contrasted against the sand and the sky might as well have just said ""buckle up for almost three hours of this"".

But we already knew it'd be like that.",2024-03-01
The last one after he kills Rautha was one of the funniest moments I've seen in a while. Stilgar seemed so eager to just spurt it out and not let the moment pass.,2024-03-01
Kind of reminded me of 2016 as well how it all started as a meme and then the guy actually got elected.,2024-03-01
"That scene was portrayed as something sinister and terrifying, and it was incredible. Chalamet did a good job. Instead of sounding cocky like a kid, he sounded angry ""you want me to be your messiah?! Fine, I'll be your messiah and bathe the galaxy in blood!"". Ferguson's Jessica expertly paved the way too.",2024-03-01
"I haven’t read the books but I think he is not the Mahdi/Lisan Al Gaib BUT Kwisatz Haderach. As I understand, Mahdi was made up by the Bene Gesserit to keep the Fremen under control, while Kwisatz Haderach is actually *real*. So later on he is using the Mahdi prophecy to reach his purposes.",2024-03-02
Its probaby hard to be humble when you can literally see all futures and how to get to them.  You truly would be the one with the know it all shit.,2024-03-03

There were so many scenes that the trailer gave us an incomplete version of. Like the assassins line from the Emperor. And indeed Chania being comically pulled down right after a weighty line,2024-03-01

I’m just happy he overruled that stupid “kill the leader to be leader” tradition haha,2024-03-01
His voice when not speaking English was genuinely so commanding. I wanted to follow him to battle,2024-03-01
"Yeah, that scene gave me chills. I did not expect that from him at all.",2024-03-01
Watch The King if you haven't. He already showed he could be a master at these types of character arcs.,2024-03-01
"I’ve rewatched his speech from The King 100 times, I love his performance there. This one jumps over it, his delivery weaving through both languages gave me goosebumps. Probably had goosebumps for the last 90 minutes of the movie straight to be honest.",2024-03-02
"My partner and I were talking about that as we left the theater. When he finally decides to wield the religious power he’s been offered, it’s kind of shocking how quickly his entire presence transforms. When he starts giving violent speeches in that booming voice it’s hard to believe it’s even the same actor. Really impressive performance.",2024-03-03
Walkin through the crowd of fremen with a presence like he was about to drop the hottest album of the year,2024-03-02

"Totally, he's developed as an actor in these movies. I was skeptical at first but damn he's proven himself",2024-03-03
Same that was the main thing I was tentative about; can Chalamet reach the level intensity needed. Thought he did a great job.,2024-03-03
"I think that's what makes that scene so scary. He's Tim Chalamet, the most baby faced young dude in Hollywood. When he starts calling people to war it hits more than if it was a more traditionally rugged actor.",2024-03-03
I was sold on him as a  ruthless leader after watching The King on Netflix. He cooked so hard in this film.,2024-03-04
He’s good in The King playing a similar role if you enjoyed him in this,2024-03-05
You should watch The King. He was fantastic in that,2024-03-06
Honestly when he spoke Fremen(?) it reminded me a lot of how much presence Emilia Clarke had when speaking Dothraki. Loved it.,2024-03-10
yup,2024-03-02
The film helped him but he sure did step up. I also didn't think he could show intimidation but it worked.,2024-03-03
Definitely did not. But his robes helped. ,2024-03-04
"100%

"See I’m not entirely sure all that talk about not going south wasn’t just performative. He started out saying he had to sway the non-believers, and it looked like he chose the path of “reluctant hero” to manipulate/win them over.

They’re not really in the book though?,2024-03-05
"That’s just how “the voice” works in the books.  It’s one of the things that makes Dune so hard to adapt to film.  

The books sort of explain that it’s not some superpower, it’s just being so incredibly articulate and having such an incredible command of rhetoric that you can basically force people to do anything by simply saying the right thing in the right way.  The book explains that everyone ultimately does it all the time.  It’s basically the purpose of language.  

I could probably “force” you to punch me in the face if I insulted you in certain manner.  I could “force” someone to fall in love with me if I understood them and said the right things. 

“The voice” is basically just comprehensive perception combined with a total command of rhetoric.  The people who are really good at it are simply clever people who have been trained to understand the subtleties of verbal communication to the point that it’s essentially a superpower.  It’s easier to explain that in a book than on screen.",2024-03-01
"I'm a movie only guy but just started reading the first book.

No warranties on decades old memory, though.",2024-03-01
"Yeah, the movie provided a visually appealing sand ride, but not one that makes sense like the book explains.  Basically the worm slows on the surface, so the first one up steers the worm back to the group, who climb up the side using their hooks like mountain climbers(In Lynch's, they drop ropes).  As for getting off, it's the opposite.  They climb back down and jump off.  Only the first on is different, and runs towards the tail as the worm burrows and then jumps off.",2024-03-01

Doctor Sleep. Rose the Hat. One of my favorite King villains,2024-03-02
Silo is great with her,2024-03-02
I could not take my eyes off her whenever she was on screen.,2024-03-02
"ReeeEEbecca FergusooooOOOOoon, she dips beneath the ~~lasers~~ _cooling torus_",2024-03-01
Without spoiling anything I do worry how silo will go when there's massive amounts of story to be told that doesn't involve her character at all.,2024-03-02
Rose the Hat does it for me,2024-03-03
As a Swede it's so fun seeing Swedish actors act their ass off on a stage this big. Both her and Stellan Skarsgård are amazing,2024-03-04
You see it,2024-03-01
100%,2024-03-03
That's actually my favorite MI movie for that reason as well and I never tire of it!,2024-03-10

Oh yes. I have. Hottest villain ever?,2024-03-01
Rose the Hat is one of my all-time villains. Ferguson embodied her so well.,2024-03-01

"Same, but I was confused.  I've read the books and every scene with Stilgar in it was furthering his character down the path of religious fanaticism.  It didn't play humorously for me.  I even asked my brother why people were laughing.",2024-03-03
"> I don't know if that was the intention but that was the one time my audience let out a quiet laugh.

Absolutely was, Stilgar is funny af in this movie. Not much humor to be had in Dune, so it's a good departure from the terrible.",2024-03-16

"Remember how the hooks pull up a segment of worm flesh / scale? If I recall correctly, the worms don't want sand to get into the wounds, so they stick to the surface, and they automatically orient themselves so the wound is pointing up, as far away from the dunes as possible",2024-04-02
"As a non-reader, this really struck me as an odd thing too but everything else is so good I can look past it.

How do they steer these things? I guess using a beacon-lure for where they want to arrive, but yea how do they not just dive underground.",2024-04-01

Why do Apple Watches have a microphone 🤣,2024-03-04

Maybe in the fact that he’s a warlord,2024-03-21
It’s Paul thinking that the entire time in the books. He does everything he can to avoid the jihad and then rejects the golden path.,2024-03-01
"I don’t exactly remember, but in the book, I don’t think Chani is concerned at all by Paul’s decision to marry the princess at the end (I haven’t read Messiah though, so maybe it’s addressed in there)",2024-03-01
"I loved the feeling of dread in the movie like on the book. Of the inevitable death and negativity that feels unstoppable. 

Really flet that feeling in the book, and the movie imo really convays that.",2024-03-01
"> I love how Denis made Chani an actual voice of reason.

I actually love the changes to Chani in the movie. In the book she was too complacent, but being the part of Paul that wants the prophecy to not come true was really well made.

I feel like her leaving after him ascending might set up for a good way to end Dune: Messiah adaptation.",2024-03-02
"Yeah, Chani's opposition to the messiah prophecy improves her as a character, makes their relationship much more interesting (in the book she's barely more than a womb for carrying Paul's kids), and improves the story as a whole.",2024-03-02
I feel like the book has a bigger emphasis on fate where Dune 2 is focused on the individuals making their own decisions. It’s a dynamic that I’m sure figuring out if I like or not.,2024-03-01
I agree. I love the books but I really appreciate how Denis made Chani into a character and that tries to center Paul,2024-03-01
"Same. Another reason I prefer Denis' take to Herbert's. So, ***SO*** happy that Chani remained loyal to her beliefs till the end... even if it cost her the love of her life.",2024-03-01
It's Paul in the book. He's in a constant internal struggle about it but that doesn't really translate to screen well.,2024-03-02
I agree! Film Chani > Book Chani in my opinion.,2024-03-01
Paul is the voice of reason in the novel. As is Jessica. And Stilgar and Gurney. They are all wise people who can consider the pros and cons of action or inaction. Jessica is not an evil witch who leads him to Jihad. The movie really abandoned the character motivations and relationships from the book in the second movie.,2024-03-01
Chani’s entire face going “what could possibly go wrong!?” was hilarious,2024-03-02
Radical Athiest Chani was awesome to watch,2024-03-01
That’s a genius decision tbh. It was the emotional core of the movie imo,2024-03-02
I'm trying to remember if Chani had any other role in the book than being Paul's... true love despite marrying the princess.,2024-03-03
Yeah pretty much every change around Chani and there are a lot is an outstanding choice. Absolutely love everything they did with the character here.,2024-03-04
"fully agree! it's a good change for the character

""are we the baddies?"" energy. lol",2024-03-05
"Eh Paul’s mother is pretty reluctant to have Paul go down that path in the books, she sees the necessity of his actions but knows the consequences ",2024-03-09
"Leto is also the only one who is content with Paul choosing his own way, and who doesn't need him to be anything other than his son. ",2024-03-02
"And no more silent worried hand-wringing for Jessica. She doesn’t hope, she plans.",2024-03-02
Did she assume the knowledge of all previous Rev Mothers of the Fremen? What exactly has she plotted that's to advance the interests of the Fremen?,2024-03-05
"Another quick one I noticed: the first shot of Part 2 is of a Harkonnen soldier using a flamethrower to burn a pile of Atreides bodies. Near the end of the film, after the Fremen defeat the Harkonnens and Sarduakar, there is a brief scene of them using a flamethrower to burn their enemies’ bodies.",2024-03-06
"As far as Gurney is concerned, Atreides are all already destroyed. They have nothing to lose. It is a pure act of vengeance.",2024-03-01
"In the book, >!the emperor says as much to Paul. But Paul retorts that using weapons directly on humans is what is actually outlawed, and that he instead used them on the mountain to “make a path through the storm.” People definitely died in the blast/rock fallout in the movie, but the closeness of the explosion is intentionally meant to be up for debate in the book; Paul splits hairs on a technicality. !<",2024-03-05
Except the only vioce of reason here is Chani and she might not even know. Wouldn't makes sense for Gurney to bring that up.,2024-03-01
"Man, you guys are going to LOVE the third one when it's eventually made, lol.",2024-03-01
I think it makes a lot of sense considering how she treats (SPOILER) Alia in the next book.,2024-03-01
"Her facial expressions throughout the final knife duel were amazing, all of her reactions to what Paul said or did displayed so many different emotions at once.",2024-03-06
"So that means they're starting the war with the other houses like, RIGHT NOW. Are those ships they've got capable of out-fighting everyone? I know how it turns out in the books but it seems a bit much from just the short shots we saw.",2024-03-02
"Oh it was even better: ""Lead them to Paradise. """,2024-03-03
"i love the delivery. it's the final ""send them to paradise"" in the film and it stands in direct contrast to all the ones before it. the sense of dread and unease paul says it with. he knows exactly what's coming. those words do not hold the same meaning for him, as they do for the fremen; they are false. there is no forthcoming paradise.",2024-03-03
I loved how psychotic they made him in this. Fucker was ready to ***kill the EMPEROR*** right then and there... all for petty revenge. Galactic geopolitics be fucking *damned.* Everyone can stop trying now. *We have found nerddom's Michael Corleone.*,2024-03-01
"Some book purist are upset about it. I like it for a film adaption because it ties together to Paul more personally in a very not personal book. Paul avenged his father. It’s easier for the general audience to take that win. 

I did the like the glimpse we had of Alia. I only wish it was longer. I could see a scene for the actress talks to Paul longer. Maybe takes his hand. “I love you, brother.” Was a good scene however brief, but I wish we could have seen more.",2024-03-01
"While Alia not being born is a little weird (that implies everything happens in less than 9 months which is weird as it's several years in the book), it's probably a good choice, the adult behaving baby/toddler would be weird as fuck on screen.

For that specific part, Paul killing him makes more sense to close the revenge arc for his father",2024-03-01
And gurney getting some harrkonan revenge,2024-03-01
Yeah I love Alia killing the Baron bc of where her storyline goes in the novels but translating her to film like that would’ve been a disaster. Renesmee from Twilight comes to mind when I try to picture it.,2024-03-02
"I think the best way to adapt it would have been to have Jessica do it at the urging/encouragement of the unborn Alia. Being the one to kill the Baron is an important moment in setting up Alia's story and, while they'll be able to write around it, it feels like a missed opportunity.",2024-03-01
"Yeah, it might've been a step too far for some audiences, having a creepy little toddler running around and then murdering her grandfather. I think it worked well, having Jessica just communicate with her in the womb instead.",2024-03-02
"The entire way they handled Alia was the right decision. Having Paul be the one to kill Baron was icing on the movie-version cake, though. One of the best adapted screenplays in a long time, IMO.",2024-03-02
Yeah it worked for me. The only issue I take is that it compresses the narrative a bit. The back half of the book takes place over several years which is a bit more plausible than the ~7 months or so the second movie takes.,2024-03-02
It’s way better imo,2024-03-02
"The part where Alia kills the Baron might be my favorite in the entire book, but I totally get why they changed it and it worked very well. Paul's line to him is so fucking cold.",2024-03-02
They could’ve had Jessica kill him too at the will of Alia. Imagine her stabbing him and Jessica speaks with Alia’s voice: “For my Duke.”,2024-03-04
Not me. I thought it was an incredibly interesting death.  My theater literally booed at the entire end confrontation and I have to agree with them.,2024-03-01
"Someone pointed out that in the first movie, the blow Paul lands to kill Jamis is a bullfighting dodge.",2024-03-01
lol same. The coolness was lost on me,2024-03-01
I thought he said “For my father… you die like an animal” for that same reason. Music was loud af,2024-03-01
"I watched it twice, and i didn’t get the line each time. Only now realizing what it was. 

I think it’s the only line I found hard to hear in the movie.",2024-03-01
I watched it in IMAX and it was loud as fuck but the music being louder is only half the problem. The actors don't goddamn enunciate.,2024-03-01
Agreed - I caught it barely  I was shocked they didn’t tuck the score back a hair for such an impactful line.,2024-03-01

"I agree about Austin, but Timmy is just on a completely different planet right now",2024-03-02
He was good in Wonka too tbh,2024-03-10
My favorite part in that is the subtle end where he gains his footing with the massive crescendo. That was the moment I thought Timothee would lead them to paradise ,2024-03-01
That's totally different. I've done both and riding the sandworms was much harder. I'll never forget my spring break trip in arrakis.,2024-03-02

Surfing is exactly what I thought of! Then I immediately remembered how tough wiping out is and imagined doing it on a fucking 200ft dune.,2024-03-02
I love the ‘80s movie but when Paul rides the worm  it gives off major “teenager getting his drivers license in a coming of age movie” vibes. Stakes were much higher here even if you ultimately knew he would live,2024-03-01
I thought my first time standing up as well.,2024-03-01
I actually had a similar feeling but around my memories of whitewater kayaking!,2024-03-02
same. in the theater like “gotta pop up dude”,2024-03-07
That scene made me think of surf movies to compare it the Lynch version. 60s surf scenes of guys wobbling in front of a rear projected wave are to actually filming a guy in the water as '85 Dune is to '24 Dune.,2024-03-03
"Dude same!! That's nuts. The sound changing as your head goes under and up from the water felt like paddling out or taking a set on the head. And then he launches off that giant dune with the worm, i had that rush you get when you pop up on a big wave.",2024-03-14
Agree! I had flashbacks to wakeboarding.,2024-03-07
"For me, it's emerging from the water on a wakeboard for this first time.  When you don't know what the downforce feels like.",2024-03-25
"The shot of the worm-gang pulling up on the Emperor was so wild (im regards to scale), it felt like they were filming from god damn Low Orbit in order to properly fit them on screen.",2024-03-01
My jaw was literally open lol. Probably the best battle scene I've ever experienced from the scale to the cinematography to the soundscape,2024-03-01
Every time they rode one I kept hoping they would show the deboarding process,2024-03-01
I’m kinda mad I didn’t see it in imax,2024-03-01
I assumed they just stepped off like a boss after the worms goes under the sand.  Easier that way I guess.,2024-03-01
"I’ve pretty much made my ticket purchases based on the sandworms, and have yet to be let down. More sandworms!",2024-03-01
Something as small as the worm going under and popping back up and Paul changing his position accordingly was such a cool detail,2024-03-01
"In the book, riding the worm is 3/4 of the way into the book, and Paul has proven himself time and again, so him calling a big worm just adds to his legend.",2024-03-01
Loved how the sandstorm just added to the dread of the worms approaching.,2024-03-01
"I saw this movie specifically in 4DX because I knew there would be sandworm riding, and holy shit, I’ve been on theme park rides that are less intense.",2024-03-11
I think the books couldn't do the war justice but I think we'll bare minimum get some shots of bombed out planets and piles of skulls.  This movie did a great job showing the horror but the next one *really* needs to hammer home how awful Paul has been for the universe,2024-03-01
"There isn't much action in Dune Messiah, so if DV wants to keep the interest of the general audience alive for his next film, especially after delivering the war epic that is Dune Part 2, then he'll have to show some scenes of the actual holy war in it.",2024-03-01
I think that's why Denis Villenueve ended the movie like that. No Alia and a cliffhanger. Messiah is a short book so my guess is that they will have the war while they jump or mix the plot of Messiah in there. It could happen since Messiah goes by really fast,2024-03-02
"Just a montage of Paul faceroll everyone 

Dude literally has Path to Victory and control of spice, so it isn’t so much of a war and more like extermination",2024-03-02
"Whatever *Dune: Part Three* will be, it will include more than just what's in *Messiah* if only because there has to be sufficient time for Paul to win back Chani and thus make way for >!the *Children*!<.",2024-03-02
"It’s because Dune isn’t about the war, really.  The war is happening in the background all the time, despite Paul’s best attempts to stop it.  We can have an offshoot movie or story about it if people find it important, but Messiah should stay as is.",2024-03-03
"With seeing how Denis adapted the second half of Dune and make it changes, I think he’s going to make changes to Messiah as well. Can’t wait for Dune 3",2024-03-02
The books (at least the first two) skip most of the combat in general.,2024-03-02

Something out of a video game,2024-03-01
"It's pretty sad because he's pretty goofy and optimistic Paul is is the Lisab al gaib. He's like a very caring Uncle that cheers you on.



Then the end of the movie happens, he is willing to get killed by Paul so he can have a voice in The Fremen officially, acts far gone to be a total Zealot charging towards the ships offworld to seemingly go kill some other Imperials that oppose Paul. (In order to go to green lands and ocean water they say, but it's to go kill those who oppose paul)",2024-03-01
He was my favorite. Wasn't expecting him to be as funny as he was.,2024-03-01
"I was surprised my whole theater kept laughing when he spoke, but also I get it. Dude had a great role",2024-03-01
"I love seeing his eyes change through the film. He starts off as a kind of uncle figure and mentor, then curious but pragmatic, into a full blown fanatic. Reminds of the book so well, the part where Paul mourns the loss of his friend for the birth of this religious zealot fighting for him.",2024-03-01
"Absolutely the best casting, he IS Stilgar",2024-03-01

"> Because in a way she is unsure if Paul did came back or something else came back wearing Paul’s skin

I mean, there's nothing to be unsure of. Our memories make up who we are, our traumas, our worst and best moments. And Paul now has access to millions of timelines, to memories and futures. Who could come back from that unchanged? Nobody.",2024-03-16
Stilgar is the only cheerleader Paul needs. I was laughing at basically every line from Javier Bardem in this movie. Every time another bit of the prophecy comes true [he's like](https://giphy.com/gifs/wwe-vince-popkey-7FyMQm2vBiTjG),2024-03-02
"I'll have to wait to see Messiah but I like the book version better still. The changes resulted in taking away some internal conflict from paul and placing it onto Chani. Nothing wrong with a character being there in part to support another.



 Also I don't understand how they are going to have Paul and Chani stay together like this.


 If your reason for liking a change is because otherwise an actor doesn't get to show their chops, then the actor should be changed not the story. But, it could end up still working out in Messiah, so I'm reserving judgement.",2024-03-03
"Isn't her opposition more because Paul is becoming less of the person she fell in love with? She doesn't care about him fulfilling the prophecy - she just wants to be with him, while everyone else grows more and more fanatic and he is pushed towards the prophecy and away from her.",2024-03-03

Villeneuve I believe intended to cover the Paul atreides story line from the first 2 books in his movies. So here's to hoping lights turn green for the third movie!,2024-03-01
"2 movies for the first book, and another one for the second book which is shorter than the first and serves as a *very* important epilogue for the story of Paul Atreides.


It's absolutely essential for understanding the true themes of the story and Herbert's intention for writing it.",2024-03-01
He's in the process of writing the script but nothing greenlit yet. And honestly I expect it to be a good 5+ years or more before the next one. ,2024-03-01
"So Frank Herbert wrote Dune, then he wrote 2 more books on Paul, completing the Paul trilogy, as it were. Then he wrote another 3 books in the universe. Then his son plus another writer wrote a bunch of prequels and sequels.


Dune and Dune part 2 by Denis Villeneuve are an adaptation of *only the first book*.


So, assuming the same rate of progression, it would take 6 movies in total just to get Paul’s story finished.",2024-03-05

"Yeah agreed on your ratings. Beautiful film. I found the omissions…. Frustrating in that I think they could’ve been achieved without that much screen time. It made all the antagonists fall a bit flat for me. The Baron/Thufir/Na-Baron/Emperor are all far more capable than portrayed. >! The omission of the planet being akin to the training of the sardauker, and the emperors perception of that threat. The guilds control over the emperor/houses. The intention of the Baron to send Rabban as a way to enable Feyd-Rautha. Etc. !< I think a bit more of all that would’ve made Paul’s ascension feel more satisfying and that he overcame a true threat. Just my noise for the ether haha",2024-03-01

"Well, it didnt hit as hard, because that third Atreidis had him killed if he wouldnt have use that shield device first. This lessened a bit his quality as a fighter for me.",2024-03-01
I think the way it was setup was Paul was trying to get both of them killed. He seemed legit disappointed when he gave the order for the Jihad to go ahead,2024-03-01
In his first scene he was pissed the dude wasnt drugged. He thought the baron tried to kill him,2024-03-01
Feyd's black blade in the coliseum fight was poisoned in the book right?,2024-03-02
I wish he mentioned killing the last of House Atreides to make it more menacing and emotionally charged but otherwise no notes that was awesome,2024-03-01
Not sure how much honor it added. He slaughtered those women pretty unfairly in his first scene lol.,2024-03-06
"It's totally out of character for Feyd tho, because Feyd is not an honorable character in the book -- and his sadism in the book would not lend itself to honor either. Frankly the whole fight was weird because Paul -- the love child of the training of the best of the Atreides, the Bene Gesserit, and the Fremen -- was hardly better than a random Atreides soldier kept as a prisoner.

The reason the final fight in the books works so well is that although Paul is the superior fighter, Feyd is cunning and Paul's reticence of his tricks and feints levels the playing field; Paul is so caught up in predicting Feyd's trickery that he even avoids a feint that Feyd wasn't even making and puts himself in a compromised position.",2024-03-03

"So Paul gets stabbed in his lower left side with the first blade, and lets Feyd approach.  He lets Feyd stab him in the upper right shoulder with the second blade, but makes it a struggle, so that Feyd doesn't notice Paul pulling the first blade out of his lower left side.  Paul uses the first blade to get a clean kill shot to Feyd's lower chest, and tanks the two non-fatal knife wounds.  Paul wins, becomes Emperor and the holy war begins.

hopefully this helps",2024-03-02

"Agree!  I try not to be that ""book"" guy, but I just think the movie crams a lot of events into less than a year >!(ex. defeating the Atreides, restoring the spice production, Paul being accepted into the clan, Jessica becoming RM, guerrilla warfare on restored spice production, etc.) into a very short time frame.!<  Still, its a fun movie in a franchise I've loved for decades, so I'm happy!",2024-03-03

"From what I've read on it, Dune is unique in that it's pre-Star Wars and that's important because you can tell Rebel Moon is trying too hard to be Star Wars along with most Sci Fi works post-Star Wars. But Dune calls back to an older era of Sci Fi where the core idea and concepts are the focus and the setting and even the characters and story are just there to explore those concepts and ideas.",2024-03-03

"This is one thing that bringing in a bit more from the books would help with. In the books using atomic weapons on people results in the rest of the Great Houses being obligated by law to completely annihilate the planet/offending house in a mass annihilation.

Looking at the Kwisatz Haderach breeding programme, eventually a BG would produce a son and that would be their human superweapon. The fake prophecy wasn’t specifically about Paul, it would have applied to any Kwisatz Haderach they chose, ensuring he’d have a personal army whenever he was born.



It also links to what Leto told Paul about Arrakis, and how its harsh conditions are primed to produce warriors who could rival the Sardaukar (I don’t remember if this was in the movie). And that’s another reason why the BG propaganda targeted the Fremen: the new emperor will need a new Sardaukar.",2024-03-06

"I think you’re misunderstanding Chani’s motivations here. It’s not really about whether the prophecy is real or not. It’s about her people being used as a tool to fight a Holy War.

It’s about not knowing whether Paul is still Paul or something else came out of the spell of that Worm Water. In her view, she’s lost the Paul she’s fallen in love with perhaps forever.

Chani is not more supportive or understanding in the book so much as she’s just a nonexistent, useless presence imo. Here, they give the character actual beliefs and agency. And she also gives the Fremen more depth than just being some blind fanatical rubes.

Without Princess Irulan being given more intelligence and Chani given an actual personality and beliefs, the film would be giving off a vibe or message that women are only evil witches that is sadly present in the books. You have to give counterpoint to that to prevent that.

In that sense, I feel the film improves on the book by fleshing out the female characters and making them more complex.

As for the Emperor, it’s meant as an “Emperor has no clothes” moment. He’s a puppet for the Bene Gesserit, who are the real overarching villains of this universe.

And no, his army was never that much more powerful than any of the Great Houses. The Bene Gesserit deemed him Emperor as he’s most useful for leverage purposes and thus, he is Emperor. There’s not much more to the Emperor than that really.

Finally, Chani’s position in this film is also to better illustrate the themes of Dune, which is about the dangers of charismatic leaders and cults of personality and how they use the stories of culture and myths and religion to further their own ends. Paul is not a hero and the Bene Gesserit are evil incarnate and that will only be made more clear in Messiah.

Also, Rabban is not that badass in the book either. He’s a spoiled crybaby who whines when he doesn’t get what he wants and isn’t really that impressive once you get past the imposing physique. That’s another underlying theme is that the powerful are not that much different from us. They’re not impressive or badass. They merely give the feeling of such which works as a useful armor as long as you don’t see through it. Which is why everything goes to shit so quickly like a house of cards.",2024-03-18

That would satisfy some of the action that audiences would like or want, but the really good stuff about dune is the political religious stuff. Although the action of Dune 2 was good, My favorite scenes of Dune 2 were when Jessica and Paul were becoming religious figures to the fremen. Dune 3 is going to be a lot more about that especially with Alia thrown into the mix. This mixed with the conspiracy with the other factions, and peppered with action scenes from the holy war, I think could be a movie a lot of general audiences can get behind. !<",2024-03-02

I get that Fremen are superior combatants. I just felt that the final battle lacked a bit of dramatic heft. It was over so quickly that I didn't really feel the impact of seeing the culmination of 2 movies of build-up to this moment.,2024-03-02
"There's a lot of exposition in Part 2 as well. I didn't find that to be a problem in either film tbh. It's funny you say Feyd added a new dynamic to the Harkonnens when he too was a one dimensional psychotic villain similar to the Baron. 

The romance angle didn't work as much for me. Somehow I felt Zendaya's friend (the one who is killed by Feyd) stole every scene she was in, completely overshadowing Chani. Paul does grow into a better character in this film so agreed there. 

I just felt Leto Atriedes and Duncan Idaho were better characters than anyone introduced in Part 2. Also Paul's dynamic with Jessica is way more interesting than the love story with Chani. I'd have liked more Paul-Jessica interactions in Part 2.",2024-03-02

I disagree except with the Baron, especially where in the book he was a cartoonishly, mustache twirling villian, yet in the first, he's this cunning, reserved and menacing foe who loves showcasing his power.


Other than that, all of the other Harkkonen are weak impulsive. They were constantly losing to Atraedies until Sardukar came to help. And the ones who kidnapped Paul and Jessica got played easily. When Paul is fighting with the freman in the very begining and during mining skirmishes, it really seems like they're fighting against a more technologically advanced army. Paul was very narrowly almost killed several times by them. ",2024-03-02
"Yeah, but not everything is a political message about race, ethnicity, etc. While those are critical conversations today, Paul is a political arsonist.

 They're no longer a rugged people protecting their home and nature. They live and die for a prophet that had manipulated them for his political ambitions.


It even ties back to Chani's speech to Paul. Fremen are no longer equals fighting for their people, they are slaves fighting for their prophet and God-emperor.",2024-03-03
"I think the Stilgar character needs to be seen as a whole, from beginning to end. Yes he's comic relief for a good half of the movie, but that really plays into his shift by the end. You're not laughing at him anymore from a certain point onwards. You see his transformation, he's ever growing fanaticism. By the end of the movie, what he has become is definitely not funny anymore: a pure fundamentalist blinded by faith and belief in prophecy, who lost his humanity and is ready to go on a jihad, boarding the ships whilst being completely euphorical, ready to commit violence. 

It's one of those cases where yes its all fun and giggles until s\*\*\* hits the fan. I think his initial comedic role, besides getting some laughs for us viewers, actually served to show how blinded faith can transform someone so wholesome and ""human"". 

To me this was the point. You laugh at him a the start, possibly ridiculing his blinded faith. But by the end you're not laughing at all, seeing what he has become.",2024-03-05

"Frank Herbert himself stated that he wrote Dune Messiah as a counter to all the people who read Dune and thought Paul was the hero and had ""won."" Which kind of makes sense. At the end of Dune Paul:

- Becomes Emperor and ruler of Arrakis

- Marries a princess

- Has Chani love him

- Has all the Fremen as blind followers

- Has all Harkonnens dead

- His mother is a much more supporting figure.

I think Villeneuve decided to make the change to Chani's character to head off any similar conclusions people would have walking out of Part 2. And to really drive home the point that by ""winning"" Paul has lost something that truly matters to him. Yes, Part 3 will be based on Messiah, but I think *a lot* will be different. Which honestly, might be for the best.",2024-03-01

She supported him because she does want what's been for her people but can also see things are getting out of control.  

She doesn't care about thrones just prosperity for her people, and now he's back to making deals with the foreigners.",2024-03-01

"Can you speak more on why you feel Oppenheimer was a better adapted screenplay? 

To me, as someone who has read both, American Prometheus was a lot easier to adapt to the screenplay for Oppenheimer than Dune was for Dune 2. Denis had to make choices that could've been fairly polarizing for the audience (inclusion of Alia, Gurney's assassination, etc.). I dislike the scenes in Oppenheimer with Einstein and how Gene Tatlock's suicide was portrayed however cannot really think of a single stylistic change I disagreed with here so in my view I would have given Dune 2 the award for adapted screenplay. 

I would have to do more reading on technical production to understand the work that went into both. A lot of work went into making Dune appear real whereas Oppenheimer was shot as real as it could get. There's a distinction here.

I do agree about CM being a better lead in Oppenheimer than TC for Dune 2.

Best picture is a wholly subjective award and I'd have given it to multiple of the other movies nominated over Oppenheimer and Dune 2, even if Dune 2 had come out last year.",2024-03-02

I think the movie needed a character that while close to Paul clearly sees through the Messiah bullshit and realises that this is a scary ending.

Yeah, I wasn't really a huge fan of the way Chani was completely changed. I can get the complaints that her character wasn't that fleshed out in the books, but I would have rather seen the base idea of her expanded on instead of just being a completely different person that fulfills a different role entirely.

"Yes, it is common. There are enough German speakers in the world to finance a high quality dubbing industry. If you're used to watching dubbed you don't even notice the flaws it has. It's just minor stuff here and there that annoys me.

Another issue I had was some German voice actors did not speak convincing Fremen. They sounded like foreigners who recently learnt the language, not natives. Especially Stilgar.

I would've watched in English if I'd been on my own. And it's becoming more and more common that theaters offer both versions.

May I ask, where are you from? Do you watch foreign movies subtitled in your language? Or does everyone speak English?",2024-03-10
"Yeah [Dune was also greatly inspired by Lawrence of Arabia (Star Wars as well) as it came out in 1962 and Frank Herbert wrote Dune in 1963-1965](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_\(novel\)#Origins).

> Frank Herbert's Dune was partly inspired by The Seven Pillars of Wisdom by T.E. Lawrence, also known as Lawrence of Arabia. Herbert was influenced by the story of Lawrence's involvement in the Arab Revolt during World War I and the ""messianic overtones"" of his character. In an early version of Dune, the hero was similar to Lawrence of Arabia, but Herbert decided to add more layers to the plot.",2024-03-17

Maybe. It's been a while since I've read the book. I can recognise some of the changes though like Chani being given a much more adversarial role to Paul when in the book she was almost entirely with him. I think the Emperor was equally minor in the book but I'm not sure and it feels like they could/should have fixed some of that but it also feels like Walken is very miscast.

And the Fremen have been living in the desert for thousands of years and are a very advanced civilisation forced to be resourceful conveyed through their development of the stillsuits and the wind harvesters but none of that comes across as well as it could have.

"You're not a sucker lol. I'm glad you enjoyed it. I responded to another comment with some likes and dislikes of it so I will put those thoughts here: 

  What I liked about Dune 2:

The soundtrack was sick. Hanz Zimmer killed it as always. And I loved the sound design(saw it in IMAX)

Some good acting performances. I thought Chalamet, Brolin, Austin Butler, Lady Jessica(forgot her real name) all did well.

I'm not one to harp on visuals, but I do have to admit it was a good looking movie. That doesn't increase my score at all though.

What I disliked:

While the story is interesting, I thought how it was done was boring. I think the same story can be done better and not nearly as drawn out.

Many of the scenes, while they were nice to look at, were made as drawn out as they could have been and didn't provide much to the story. (I got a Zack Snyder Justice League vibe which I also didn't like. And I love DC characters)

Both one and two have a big problem with the audience needing to brush up on lore and backstory. I didn't even understand the first one when I saw it the first time and upon second viewing, I got it, but it wasn't all that great. I look at movies like the Lord of the Rings series or the Harry Potter series where those are based off of books, but don't require someone to do any research to enjoy the movie. Sure, they can be *better* knowing the lore and such, but it is not dependant on it.",2024-03-02
"He also said he didn't push the emotional elements of Dune 1 enough, and vowed to improve that in Dune 2.

"I have not read the books so I appreciate the insight! What you said makes sense, and I'm sure it is more fleshed out in the books, but a lot this stuff isn't laid out very well in the movie imo. 

>The Fremen weren’t confident in themselves until they had Paul as their prophet.

The Fremen we see in the north are split on Paul being a prophet, and it seems that Paul is just assimilated into the group rather than influencing them outright. Are there any scenes with him directing or advising them to do something? I know he made that comment about moving north as you pointed out but there was certainly no enthusiasm for the idea.  

>The only thing stopping the Fremen was resources.

Does Paul provide/contribute to them obtaining these resources initially? From what I understand the northern Fremen already had weapons and equipment, and knew how to use them too. Resource wise it seems they were fine until the southern war when he provided the family nukes.

>Pretty much, when you take their shields away, have superior warriors, and now have a leader who understands how to beat these people.

Can you explain the shield thing. Are you talking about his information to Chani about the aircraft's shields?  Besides that though I'm not sure what differing strategy or important pieces of information that Paul gave to change the outlook of this war. 

I think a scene or two showing Paul's actual influence rather than him learning their culture would go along way in establishing his leadership abilities and how he sparked a civil war.",2024-03-02
Of course I understood what happened. That's not the point. The point is that the way the scene is stitched together is quite jarring.,2024-03-05

Finally someone who prefers the first one over this. I felt that some portions were given too much time - the entire first act of Paul becoming a Fremen - and some were rather rushed - the entire third act. This made the finale seem rather unearned and didn't let us reflect upon what Paul's actions have resulted in.,2024-03-01
">no time to breath

You DO realise that many people were complaining that the first one was too slow, right? And if there's one thing Denis would have learned from Blade Runner 2049 & Dune Part One, is that when making a big budget film these days, if you give it more than the bare minimum time to breath, the sizeable attention-deficit section of the audience WILL say they ""fell asleep 10 minutes in, lol"". 

At the end of the day it's already 2hr 45 minutes long, most people seem to like it (even saying the pacing was much better), and if they had made the pacing any slower the film would have been 3 hours+. Your ""Michael Bay"" comparison comes off as baity btw.

>The Emperor was also a let down - didn’t seem threatening or menacing at all

While I can agree with your point in another comment about the death of his son, I don't necessarily think his motivations are THAT strange considering he is basically forced to rise to the occasion after the destruction of Sietch Tabr.

The liberties they took with what to edit or cut out of the movie seem mostly justified to create a more grounded story, especially considering the source material is not the easiest to deal with.

"Man I fucking love this comment. I felt like I've more or less understood the story pretty well (seen the movies and a few hundred pages into the first book), but you really nailed some things down for me that I was still struggling to place.

One thing I struggle with, though, is when you say

> if he hadn't selfishly picked this path for personal revenge at the end of Part One, despite knowing the risks from his visions. 

Weren't the visions that Paul had for some time on Caladan and also Arrakis, basically evidence that Paul's path *did*, indeed, lead to the desert? Meaning, isn't it in some way ""pre-established"" that he would assimilate with the fremen and learn their ways / meet Chani?

Like, if he had simply decided to flee the planet with Jessica, would his visions of the fremen just have.. stopped? It always seemed more significant and set in stone than that.",2024-03-21
"Awesome comment, and makes a lot more sense, I particularly appreciate that you recognise how he clearly is shown to actually have good intentions when he ""takes off the ring"". 

I agree that he starts off seeking revenge, and that this is a bad thing - but the film obviously shows an arc of a character, and I think that arc is much better described as showing him becoming a true leader of a people despite starting from selfish motivations, than the arc of a villlain fulfilling his villainhood. 

The reason I don't think anti-hero is particularly clear either is because it's not shown that he actually does anything wrong. The scene where he drinks the blue worm juice shows that he has a premonition and realises that he must go to the south. There's no reason to believe that's because he realises he wants to conduct a galactic genocide, but that he's foreseen that it's the only way for the Fremen to survive against a clearly evil enemy. It's not remotely clear to me that he hasn't had actual premonitions when he drinks this magic blue juice. He tells Zendaya he will always love her just before marrying Florence Pugh as a sort of means to show that his heart is pure, and that what he's doing is for the sake of the premonition, not because he just fancies being emperor.

>None of this is because he's an actual hero of prophecy though - Paul's abilities are the result of him being the endproduct of a millennia long eugenics program by the Bene Gesserit (the Kwisatz Haderach). Paul & Jessica are essentially posing his science-given KH abilities in front of the Fremen as 'fate given', making the latter believe that it's because he's the Lisan Al Gaib of their fake prophecy, so that he can seize religiopolitical power over the Fremen, primarily for HIS goals.

Do you only know this because of the books?",2024-03-21

"> Isn't the reason obvious? It was to make sure that audiences didn't leave the theatre thinking that they witnessed a hero's great triumph

There’s about a hundred more interesting ways they could have got that across rather than just showing Chani being upset for the 50th time. It also sends mixed messaging since she seems more upset that she got dumped rather than the whole “galactic jihad” thing, which only hurts Chani’s characterization in my opinion.",2024-03-20
">Isn't the reason obvious? It was to make sure that audiences didn't leave the theatre thinking that they witnessed a hero's great triumph - but instead, dwelling on how Paul had in effect wronged, betrayed & hurt Chani (though we know that after a certain point, he had very little choice in the matter).

But the film has also ***just*** shown us that he's had a very strong premonition that this is what he needs to do, with no indication that he has decided he wants to just kill everyone for the fun of it. I think if you haven't read the books, and don't realise who Paul actually is, the film simply does not demonstrate that what has happened is bad. I don't even know who the other houses are!?

The movie attracts a certain demographic which is ironically the message of the movie. (Which is very difficult to see because it's not the sequels),2024-03-03
That doesn't happen until the sequels,2024-03-03
"There were some parts that did feel disjointed. Like for example when Paul and the Fremen ultimately decide to flee South when Feyd’s forces came. Suddenly, we see Chani’s friend on her knees surrounded by Hakonnens. I was like “whoa when was this decided? Did I miss something?” And then Paul suddenly ending up at the temple to drink the Water of Life. It’s little things like this, which aren’t a big deal but the way it flowed felt fast and sudden at times. Overall, it’s a 8 or 9 of 10 for me.",2024-03-03
"I liked this film a lot and thought it was a spectacular experience. I didn’t mind the changes and think some were needed. 

That being said, almost every character you named is better written as a villain protagonist or anti-hero *(though most of them are not anti-heroes at all; they are simply villains in the protagonist role)* than Paul Atreides and I don’t think they need to be rewritten to handhold certain parts of the audience who are incapable of seeing how morally corrupt they are. Some of the best discussions around T.V. and film I have ever had were about those characters. 

I also have to admit that I have read *Dune* and I am not a fan, especially of the sequels. I much prefer this film to the books themselves. I will explain why.

To put it simply, Hebert never truly subverts the “white savior” trope, >!as it turns out that the galacial genocide is supposedly for the “greater good” and that Paul’s superior bloodline will save the galaxy. Chani is complicit in his galacial genocide in the books and wholeheartedly supports him.!< I’m sorry, but I can’t roll my eyes harder at that, as the message ends up being that >!the genocide of billions, if not trillions, is justified, as Paul and Chani’s offspring is meant to save the world.!< There’s a reason why the sequels to the first Dune are rated less favorably and the overall message is actually revolting and cringeworthy. 

The changes they made to Chani in the film make it hard for me to see them faithfully adapting *Dune Messiah* without undoing the characterization they built for her in this film, as her returning to a genocidal monster “out of love” somehow makes her an even worse person than the Chani of the books who worships Paul and is another one of his brainwashed cultists, as she is aware of what is happening and what is being done in his name. 

To be clear, though, I do *like* the changes they made to her character in this film. I think they were needed. The problem is that depending on how they move forward with this to perhaps stay faithful to *Dune Messiah* will undo that characterization for the sake of reuniting them. We will see, though.

"> 4) This is a big plot point that the movie omits completely. There isn't satellite surveillance on southern Arrakis--the Spacing Guild is preventing it in exchange for massive spice bribes from the Fremen. That's the reason why the Harkonnens so vastly underestimated the strength of the Fremen.

naib to a creature of the Lisan al-Gaib, a receptacle for awe and obedience. It

Feyd complained about it, though, and while Lanville was a good fighter, he did not fight on optimum terms. Maybe Feyd from the book would have complained that the Atreides fighters were too weak for him and he was ready for more.

> Also, plot wise he’s really important to motivating Paul to go south which is what kickstarts he messiah ascension. Feyd starts bombing the sietches

From Paul's point of view the Harkonnen are destroying his Fremen home, and it doesn't matter who's in charge.

When Feyd finally meets Paul, Paul only sees him as an obstacle rather than a true nemesis. Feyd wasn't in Paul's visions and Paul never thinks about Feyd in significant terms, as he did with Jamis, even though Feyd is a carefully designed Bene Gesseritt product.

There is no tension in the movie that Paul was supposed to be the daughter that Feyd would have the Kwizatz Haderach child with.

His presence is there tbf I just wanted more of it but back to the actually being a threat part.

 To put it on a hierarchy, Harkonans<Atreides<Sardukar<Freman

Feyd kills in a quite lengthy duel against a Atreides, albeit a high ranking Atreides who's been captured and lets be honest probably been in the worst condition of his life so let's say Atreides<Feyd. Paul manages to not only kill but ""toys"" with a Freman, Freman<Paul. So Feyd seems to be on Sardukar level at best who were easily dispatched by Freman so how could Feyd possibly be a threat to Paul in that moment? If Feyd did kill a Freman, again totally not in the books or canon ik, you could at least give audiences the tension that Paul might not survive the fight when it finally comes to it. The fight is sick it's a nitpick from me but say Feyd beats that Freman girl in combat hell even show that the girl is getting the upper hand on him but is sliced somewhere with his poison blades and eventually loses the fight but to Feyds annoyance he didn't get to toy with her more so ends up burning her instead for example.

"1. about the swords and shields and whatnot: the invention of a personal shield, which prevents anything that moves too fast from passing through, had made projectile weapons obsolete and energy/beamweapons way too dangerous to use. so back to fighting in melee it was, in this universe. only exception being arrakis, cause the shields attract and drive worms into a frenzy. but nobody has been really using projectile/beamweapons anymore anyway, for decades now, and they wouldnt start to just for arrakis. i guess in a way it technically makes sense, but i totally understand how it wouldnt make sense for people watching it without having it laid out and explained to them thoroughly.

2. in the books, theres an uneasy peace between the emperor and the great houses. the houses have their armies, the emperor has his sardaukar. where the sardaukar are coming from, why they are so fanatically dedicated to the emperor and how they become such fearsome fighters, all that is a mystery at the beginning of the book. if the houses joined together, they could defeat the emperor. but the sardaukar are still powerful enough that some of the houses would be completely annihilated in the process. now house Atreides has secretly been training troops specifically to fight against sardaukar and be able to match them in combat. emperor Shaddam was threatened by this and wanted to get rid of Atreides before they get to a point where they can realistically stan up to his sardaukar. to keep the peace, he however cant move openly against them. so instead he brings atreides into position, lends his sardaukar to harkonnen (in secret) and lets them annihilate the atreides. the blood feud between atreides and harkonnen is well known. no one would be surprised if harkonnen attacks atreides after they lost arrakis to them. this is something that is explained in the first book, so it shouldve been shown in these two movies.

"It is not a war against machines. That happened quite a few thousand years in the past, during the Butlerian Jihad, in which humanity made the resolve not to create any machine with the capabilities of a human mind.

(This is, by the way, why the Bene Gesserit use the gom jabbar to test future rulers. The rational, machine-like response is to avoid needless pain and suffering. Human beings can override their rational response for a higher purpose.)

In this movie, Paul says that with his future sight, he can see a ""narrow path through"" possible futures of horror and bloodshed. He is trying to guide humanity forward in a path that doesn't lead to countless generations of darkness. But though it evades the worst of it, it is not a gentle path--leaving countless billions dead--and it delves into some seriously *weird* territory.

Like, the 3,500-year imperial reign of a human-turned-sandworm kind of weird. The kind of weird that has countless clones of Duncan Idaho resurrected over and over again to foster a rebellious culture against endless imperial rule.

"I guess I was in the army and studied military history a lot that commanders are never ever charging in the front. Even being in the vanguard unit is crazy but literally the first person leading the charge? Lol, no. Just takes me out of the movie. Even the most daring military commanders who fought alongside men were never the first person you would see. Gurley leading the suicide charge or Paul charging into Sardaukar lines as the first guy, it's so unrealistic to the point that it takes me out of it a little.

Sardaukar felt weak. I understand logically what you're saying but when watching it this time they honestly felt weak to me. I wish we would see some scenes where they would take 4-5 Fremen and then got overpowered or something. We only see them lose. Again, gripes. I felt this could've been so easily fixed with one scene of Sardaukar dominating and then the stuff you've said were a lot more impactful. Also... The nuke usage being forbidden thing wasn't really established in the movie from what I understand. I could be wrong.

We haven't seen millions of Fremen outpowering Sardaukar, we've seen Fremen easily take them on 1-1. What you're saying would makes sense but we really haven't seen much fight from the Sardaukar at all. Correct me if I'm wrong.

Even still, once Siech Tabr was attacked the choice wasn’t so easy. He could give up and flee the planet, and then all the Fremen would die at Feyd Rautha’s hand. Or he could intervene. Intervening would save the Fremen and grant him revenge, though it might lead to the Galaxy-spanning genocide.

What we *do* know is that he wants power and an army. He doesn’t want to have the same fate as his father. I just started the book, and you also get a deeper sense in the book that he really loves his mother, even despite the things she gets him into. So protecting his mother is also a motive. He wants revenge against the killer of his father and the Atreides. He probably also wants to protect Chani, though we’re left with a bit of a cliffhanger there. We don’t know whether he is really all that interested in the Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh's character), or if they’ll fall in love. As far as we know *right now*, it seems he just plans to make *use* of her to further his agenda. We don't know if he’ll try to get Chani back after disappointing her so much, or if Paul and Chani will reconcile.

We also don’t know if he’ll start to get a significant god complex and go power mad. It seems that's we're it's going so far, but it *could* all be an act, or he might just be caught up in all the emotions he went through. In the beginning of the books, we get a possible sense from the Bene Jeserit (spelling. lol) that he might be some special, once in a lifetime kind of person who will be able to be a leader amongst leaders. The Bene Jeserit aren’t sure, but they kind of hint in the book that the Jeserit are wondering if they can use Paul as a tool to further their agendas.

Part of the reason for this is that Paul is trained in fighting against shielded opponents. So every opportunity where the Fremen see that Paul should be cutting or killing Jamis his reflexes instead have him slowing down at the last moment to pass the non-existent shield and Jamis dodges. This makes it look like he's making fun of Jamis going ""could have killed you there, could have killed you there, could have killed you again"".

Over 20k years, even...  
  
Dune is set in 10191 AG, ""After Guild"", and the Spacing Guild was founded around a century after the end of the Butlerian Jihad.  
  
The Butlerian Jihad itself lasted for a century, and there were roughly 11000 years between the start of deep space exploration and the Jihad.  
  
If we use the Pioneer 5 (first interplanetary space probe), that's 1960 + 11000 + 201 + 10191 = 23352 years in the future.  
  
Of course, there's also the problem that the Standard Year in Dune is roughly 20 hours shorter than our ""primitive year"", and we have no idea when it switched, so you'll have to remove a few hundred years and can't know the *exact* number.",2024-03-06

"Yeah I remember most of that and I can more or less understand why Denis would cut it or change it, but Chani is diff imo. I prefer how the book left you w more or less a relatively hopeful ending that despite the coming jihad Paul still has Chani as his tie to humanity making the status quo at the beginning of Messiah and the events thereafter more of a shock & tragedy while also hammering home much more powerfully Herbert’s central theme of beware powerful, charismatic leaders, prophecies, and religious fanaticism, etc etc as opposed to how the film tries to dash that flavor on right at the end making Chani’s departure bold & immediate, esp considering he didn’t include them having a child to strengthen their bond even more. Again, I’m curious to see how he adapts Messiah now. Will the film open just assuming they stayed together but Chani just isn’t as ride or die as in the book, lessening it’s impact? or will Messiah also be 2 parts with the first focusing much more on expanding and strengthening their subsequent relationship before the conspiracy initiates?

">!The Great Houses would recognize his claim because the Emperor himself has abdicated and seemingly named Paul his successor. I'm not sure how succession usually works in the Dune universe but that seems fairly legitimate. Even more importantly, they would accept his claim in order to avoid war. Plus, Paul is holding the Emperor and his daughter hostage at this point. Great Houses should know that refusing to accept his claim would result in their death.!<

>!Which brings me to my next point: If the Great Houses refuse Paul's claim it would suggest they view the Emperor at the legitimate ruler. In that case, Paul should immediately execute the Emperor and his daughter as they would represent the greatest threats to his claim.. Start a new dynasty with Zendaya instead!<

>!But did Leto move the entirety of his family and military forces from Caladan to Arrakis? I imagine they would govern both, similar to how the Harkonnens were clearly still inhabiting Giedi Prime despite controlling Arrakis for 80 years.

"It's not a lie, it's more nefarious than that. The reason she becomes even more cold and calculating AND the reason Paul becomes more cold and calculating after drinking the water of life, is because it allows them to see past and future clearly. They are fully aware of what has happened and what will happen sort of. They can see a possibilities of the future and therefor can try to do things in a way to get the future they want. It seems to be not exact. The prophesy is real because the Bene Ges of the past saw the possible futures and implanted plans to create the prophesy and foretell things they knew would happen. Then they spent the years carefully making those things happen and setting up multiple Messiah possbilities because they didn't know for sure who the Messiah would be that would make their ""prophesies"" that they created come true. Paul and Jessica know this after drinking. They know how nefarious it is and they know it's all a calculation to get a specific future. They see it as a necessary evil because the other futures are worse. So Paul plays into his role as does Jessica. The thing is, there are multiple paths that could have come out of the prophesy and the other Bene Ges wanted one of the ones where they had more control over the Messiah figure so THEY had all the power. Jessica had a son and prepared him and the Fremen for making Paul the Messiah so she and Paul would hold the power.",2024-03-28

"Somewhat hard to not understand that, but maybe it was even slightly too heavy handed. 

It’s a bit less clear in the book, and it sort of slowly arises out of the context and then in messiah it sort of makes you re-evaluate what you read before and to me it was part of what I loved about reading it, probably more than the first book. 

I think when you expressly end the 2nd film saying ‘these guys are bad’ and then everyone on social media goes ‘all you guys celebrating Paul are missing the point’ are lowkey ruining part of what makes Messiah great, and the retroactive effect it has on Dune ? Also maybe that they’re not necessarily bad, just morally complex? Or bad but not for why we think. Etc etc

"Wife and I talked about it after, and we thought that the suit is designed to preserve and retain water, so it probably staunches his wounds automatically.

Otherwise, he would have.",2024-03-25
Drum sand was a thing in the book. Very dangerous on a planet with giant worms that are attracted to noise.,2024-03-09
Deck Chani,2024-03-21
Abomination! Their use of the voice was great,2024-03-09
"Using the voice in that moment would have defeated the weight of the Emperor's decision. He wanted the Emperor to kneel on his own accord, not by his voice.",2024-03-11
Sound design needs an Oscar holy shit. You could see the entire theater flinch at that.,2024-03-11
"I really like IMAX sound but I hate it when they, IMO, exaggerate it, the Chani slap was also really fucking loud.",2024-03-10
It was a bit tooo noisy in IMAX sometimes almost painful ,2024-03-10
"I saw it first in IMAX, then regular AMC theater, then IMAX again.",2024-03-10
You thought he would use the voice as well to make the emperor kiss but it was a demand not forced. Fantastic,2024-03-09
"This is what I used to do with my bike for some reason when I first learned how to ride it…I would stand on one side of it and then jump off when I was done. Hit somebody’s car in the apartment complex one time. All that to say, I could probably ride a worm",2024-03-03
"LADY JESSICA, IM GOING TO UNTIE THE BASKET NOW",2024-03-20
Imagining Lady Jessica just rolling in the sand in her worm cart.,2024-03-20
[Wasted],2024-03-21
"This is the correct answer. In the book, Fremen will describe the distance of a trip like “it is a 20 worm journey.”

Meaning, you have to ride a worm until it’s so exhausted it quits, and then do the same with 19 more worms.",2024-03-07
"Yeah for sure, but I kept thinking about it when Jessica was in the carriage thing. How did they get on there too?",2024-03-03
"Well put.  What are your thoughts on these supersonic worms in this movie? This is not how I pictured worm travel, when I was a kid reading these books over and over.",2024-03-14
Yeah specially when they had Jessica and that whole crew of people on it.,2024-03-03
"It's actually something I noticed in House of the Dragon that also applies to Dune 2. They never showed anybody dismounting from a dragon, probably because it might look awkward and cost more for the CGI. 

Easier to just suddenly show them off of it.",2024-03-06
I watched this movie in IMAX… I should have been fully engaged in the experience… this kept gnawing at me lol,2024-03-11
"Yeah, you shouldn't think too much about that lol",2024-04-07
"Agreed! She needed more screen time, and so did Anya!! Blink and you missed her.",2024-03-06

she does bring a certain presence to it though

I absolutely love her performances, shes super versatile",2024-03-04
"The ornithopter scenes were on another level, sound-wise.",2024-03-03
"As I get older, I appreciate the sound experience I can get from a theater more than the visual experience.  Even the 30ft screen I saw this on really didn't take up any more of my vision (or look sharper) than if I was sitting at the proper distance from a 80"" 4K TV, but the soundscape felt like something that would take $10k to even remotely approximate at home.",2024-03-10
There were like a dozen or so times where the sound just overwhelmingly pulled you in.,2024-03-16
Just got out of a Dolby showing myself and came here to say exactly this. I can see this being a heavy contender for best visual effects and sound design at next years' Oscars,2024-03-04
"Black and Chrome*

Haha sorry for being pedantic but I like the distinction George Miller made. The whites are a little shinier and such, but I don't remember the exact details.",2024-03-09

Furiosa probably gonna clear.,2024-03-05

I hope so since she's carrying the only(?) Harkonnen child now,2024-03-09
"I mean, have you seen that one time her on-screen boyfriend ended up drugged and sewn within a bear? Or her married life to Harry Styles in another movie? Weird relationships are kind of her brand now",2024-03-07
"I didn't watch Dune part 2 to see Florence Pugh in chainmail, but, like the sound design, it greatly enhanced the viewing experience.",2024-03-05
Ironically it really reminded me of the Joan of Arc costume Zendaya wore to the Met Gala,2024-03-10
Is it duty free?,2024-03-05
Feyd was just calmly observing everything transpiring around him as if he was contemplating what side he wants to take,2024-03-03
"> Hell, Austin Butler was perfect in every scene.


He certainly nailed the accent, whivh I presume was an immitation of how Stellan Skarsgard talks.",2024-03-03
"Austin's face when Paul kills the Baron is epic! Impressed/Pleased and possibly a little aroused, he looked like he was gaging for it. I thought he played psychotic sadist perfectly! I wish there was a bit more screen time with him, he was the most memorable in every scene he was in and well if we were to get a House Harkonnen mini series in the future I wouldn't be mad at it.",2024-03-03
"*...Baron Harkonnen gasping, crawling up to a thrown his fat ass will never sit on...*

Feyd: *(Fucking casuals...)*",2024-03-03
Austin butler was perfect as feyd. The final fight was literally exactly how I pictured it reading the books.,2024-03-04
Also love that the Sardaukar walk into the dust and just immediately disappear without so much as a fuss.,2024-03-11
"That was Austin Butler?!


I thought it was one of the Skarsgaards 😅


Ok, that was an impressive performance after underwhelming in Masters of the Air ",2024-03-08
agree - I would not have minded more Austin Butler screen time.,2024-03-07
I really liked everything about feyds portrayal except the voice tbh lol,2024-03-03
"Although I'm a little sad we didn't get to see the mini Abomination, I agree that this was the right way to do it onscreen",2024-03-03
He barely rates in the books to be fair.,2024-03-03
"never watch trailers, they only ever make your movie experience worse

usually directors, writers, etc have little to no input in trailers. trailer authors can fuck shit up",2024-03-04

">but by the end the fervor is totally our of control

""Lead them to paradise.""",2024-03-05
As is written. ,2024-03-16
"I was legitimately saddened by the ending, because Paul initially appears as this curious yet lost boy who tries to find his purpose and way in life while desperately avoiding bloodshed, and by the end of this he's commanding his army of religious warriors to fight against the other houses and nuke them if necessary. It's such a fucking downer ending to see him so consumed by vengeance and his acceptance of his role as messiah, to the point that he won't accept anyone challenging his new title as Emperor.

It's a great ending, and showcases the horrifying consequences of religious extremism, blind faith, and hero worship, but man, I was just kind of silent and depressed after finishing it.",2024-03-18
As someone who is 1/3rd of the way through the third book it kinda seems like it sets up for later to have Alia do it.,2024-03-05
Why would Paul show mercy to the Emperor but none to the Baron?,2024-03-07
I'm glad the battle in the film was over quickly. It was that quick in the books too. Because it isn't really a battle when you have giant sandworms on your side and your leader is literally someone who can see the future and already knows the outcome of it. So it was more like a slaughter.,2024-03-10
He did. He didn’t slit his throat,2024-03-15

It was their first time meeting, though.",2024-03-04
oh yeah those elite commandoes? idk kill them or something,2024-03-03
"Her not being included made sense, with the side effect of Pauls entire rise being reduced to <9 months, as opposed to a few years in the book. 

i also liked Chenai's role as seeing through the religious manipulation of her people. in the book she just goes along with it IIRC.   


also no spice orgy? boo.",2024-03-04
Yeah I was super worried about how they were gonna handle it and they did it perfect which is just leave all that crazy shit for the third movie.,2024-03-03
Anya Taylor-Joy threw me for a loop when she appeared in the dream sequence. I'd forgotten she appeared on the press junkett and I'm glad for it!,2024-03-04

Maybe Windex ,2024-03-02
I actually had bought a Gatorade for myself at the theater before the movie started.  I got the blue without realizing. lol.  I ended up taking a swig everytime they showed the Water Of Life lol.  Powerade blue would be closer in hue tho.,2024-03-03

Someone needs to make a cut of the movie with a lot more 'LISAN AL GHAIB!'s thrown in after every other scene,2024-03-04
Yeah the brothers Agamemnon and Menelaus were called Atreides because of their father.,2024-03-22
"I didn't see a smile, I saw a groveling despot in utter shock at his death, Paul's survival, and the revelation that he's his blood",2024-03-04
“And people told me sleeping around was a bad idea.”,2024-03-05
"Speaking of, he pulled the “pound your own chest to vibe” move that Jamis did during their duel. It reinforces how Jamis and him are best friends in another timeline and the impact of that on Paul.",2024-03-05
"Very cool. I also liked the shot of the Baron laying in the sand covered in ants. Paul had very little respect for his grandpa, LOL",2024-03-06

"fr javier is actually so funny in this film lmaoo

"Having grown up evangelical, I’ve seen this type of person pretty regularly.",2024-03-04

So you dont understand the power of faith changing how people act,2024-03-07

"It's not just comic relief though, it's also a good example of the kind of fanaticism Paul fears for most of the movie which ties in well with the overall plot.",2024-03-14
You say that like it’s a bad thing lol. You need some levity in a movie to make the dramatic stuff hit harder. It’s why people are connecting with this movie more than the first one.,2024-03-07

You have to reread the books lmao,2024-03-03
"Nah, he was in Messiah and seemed a lot less comfortable about Paul there.",2024-03-03
What are the biggest things that have been changed and did they affect/alter the overall story?,2024-03-04
"Yeah, I was very surprised tbh. I'm still in the middle of book 2 so I don't know the implications of these changes but maaan, so many differences.",2024-03-11
Not to mention they literally brainwashed an entire planet several hundred years in advance in preparation for this exact moment so they would see him as a messiah.,2024-03-05
"No, Stilgar should be a wise Fremen who acts in the best interest of his people, teaching Paul to do the same. Making Stilgar a one-dimensional zealot from the beginning completely removes his character arc. In the books, it is a large moment when Paul realizes that he’s changed Stilgar irrevocably, weakening him. This comes after a decade long Jihad, a gradual loosening of the old ways to accept the new. And thats not who Stilgar was. Stilgar acts as a representation of the planet as a whole.",2024-03-01
"Yeah, Feyd's characterization was great in this movie. He genuinely had a sense of honor to him despite being a complete nutcase. Paul was offering an honorable duel, and Feyd wanted to match him and play by Paul's rules. ",2024-03-03
Totally agree it was a respectful copy,2024-03-03
Yes!! His little smile when he delivers it is fucking perfect.,2024-03-04
"That’s how I took it too, he was actually impressed and said it out of respect",2024-03-08
"He emphasised ""Thy"" very clearly though.",2024-03-19
"This. As someone who fences, you’d be surprised how quickly you tire out. I spar for 2 hours regularly but it’s about 5 minutes of a bout, then 5 minutes off the strip. I’m in great shape but if I tried to spar for 30 minutes non stop I’d be completely spent.

Thats why anytime I see a battle scene like in Braveheart, or the Battle of The Bastards in Game of Thrones, where it’s at least 2-3 hours of unrelenting sword fighting, I’m like ‘that’s great and all for a movie, but there’s no fucking way that works in real life without at least a 5 minute water break and a bite of a power bar.",2024-03-13
"a few days late here but if you haven’t seen The King on netflix, also with Chalamet in a leading role, they do the whole realistic fatigue from melee combat really well.

couple minutes fighting in full plate armor and these guys are straight up huffing for oxygen",2024-03-17
"And Paul got tired first, because he just fought through an army to get there.",2024-03-23
That triple horizontal twirl was fucking awesome.,2024-03-03
"You right, the 1 second thing totally ruined the entire fight",2024-03-03
"Thank you for pointing this out, so dumb",2024-03-21
That’s the significant of the Feyd/Paul fight.  Who ever wins gets the throne.  The difference is that Paul has become the KH by the time of the fight.,2024-04-01
Dune is pretty clunky all the way through,2024-03-04
Joe Abercrombie pulls it off nicely. Give his stuff a go if you haven't.,2024-03-06
I'd rather buy a big OLED TV. Better contrast and brightness. More expensive tho.,2024-03-14
Wish they would do that but the previous one didn’t. Say what you want about Zack Snyder’s Justice League but I thought the aspect and framing was one of the more enjoyable aspects (pun intended),2024-03-05
Isn't it exactly what the old lady told her would have to happen a few scenes before?,2024-03-03
"“Be honest, is he good in bed?”


“I ain’t telling you shit, girl.”",2024-03-05
"Not having read the books, this was something I was already thinking about. Chani is pissed at him, the Emperor wails at him, the nuns call him an abomination, his mother hesitates for a moment when he goes up to the fremen and screams at them, and none seem to understand that he can now literally see EVERYTHING. It has to be both a blessing and a curse. He can probably even see his own death, and his line to Chani that he'd love her untill the day he dies is less a platitude and more a simple fact. The moment he drank the poison he became an outcast surrounded only by zealots, enemies, and the need to secure the safety of his loved ones. No one to confide in or understand what he sees or thinks. If there was anyone that did understand his position, it was his unborn sister.",2024-03-02
"This movie brought home to me how much of Paul's conundrum is sort of a giant trolley problem. Because he probably could also have chosen simply not to be the Mahdi. To settle down as a fremen with Chani, maybe even keep fighting the Harkonnen, but not set himself up as a leader. And that might have been worse for the galaxy in a way but the death wouldn't be directly on his hands and definitely not in his name. But he makes the choice to go south and pursue revenge and power.",2024-03-04
I was confused by the ending to be honest because it sure felt like the marriage plan and just about everything else was pointless because all of the other houses refused to acknowledge him and began attacking anyway. Did I miss something? ,2024-03-05
"The way I understood it, is that it was a slim path but also a thorny path",2024-03-03
"I dont know the books, but both movies told me that Paul kinda has something going like a bootleg version of the timestone.

He sees visions of the future, that are probably most realistically happening, but it changes with each decision he makes. Finally when he did drink the blue water, he was able to use those visions properly. He is now ""in the Endgame"". It will still be cruel, same for Dr. Strange. People will lose their life, a lot of other people will be hurt and damaged, even if the best case happens.",2024-03-04
Then he gives it all up in the end anyway and abandons the path.,2024-03-05
It reminded me of Game of Thrones a bit.  ,2024-03-04
All I can think about here is when Morty had the crystal that told him the path to Jessica ,2024-04-05
"I haven't read the books, but Chani gets pregnant a couple of times, right? How are they supposed to continue on with that next movie, seeing as she seems like doesn't want to be around him currently? You think she'll go back to Paul, just like that?",2024-03-28
"I've read a few comments like this, and I do think she's upset by it.  But I think she's much more upset and horrified by the holy war path he is choosing to go on, using her people to fight it.  It's more of a betrayal than wedding another woman.",2024-03-03
Chani being a person with her own thoughts and feelings about Paul and the prophecies and the jihad is a good thing. I look forward to seeing how they reconcile.,2024-03-03
youre a joke lol,2024-03-18
Dune: Messiah opens with Chani eating a family sized bag of Starbursts and watching the BBC's Pride and Prejudice for the seventh time until she falls asleep.,2024-03-02
"I didn't think it was funny, I thought it was very sad. Chani is shown from the beginning to be proud of her people and her culture. She was one of the people that said the one to free the Fremen should be the Fremen.


Her people and her culture are being used as tools by an outsider who she trusted and loved. Paul went from wanting to be like the Fremen to basically becoming a coloniser who stepped in and took over everything and made it his.


They're not even just Fremen anymore, they're Fremen-Atreidis. Look at the flags they carry.


Her tears are for more than just Paul.",2024-03-07
She shouldn't waste her water on him.,2024-03-03
"Not going to lie, the last scene in the film being that was a little disappointing. I already understood that she left, and for a film and story that was clearly so Paul centric, I would have preferred they ended it with a shot of him and his family.

Just a small nitpick though, goddamn fantastic movie.",2024-03-03
It’s sad as well cause like who is she going back to. Where is she even going?,2024-03-07
Me too. I just thought she got mad she got cheated on and now she's waiting on her Uber to get home xD,2024-03-22
She called a Uber-Hulud.,2024-03-05
Paul does foresee her chilling out over it,2024-03-03
I didn't interpret it as Chani being mostly upset about Paul wanting to marry Irulan but that Chani didn't like the general way events were unfolding. Chani was already skeptical of Paul being the Messiah but now he was also claiming lordship over the entire galaxy.,2024-03-06
"I think she can understand why but still be upset over it. That's just human. We are not purely logical creatures, at least besides mentats.",2024-03-15
"I wasn't saying anything about the Fremen generally, just Chani's love for Paul as portrayed in the book vs. the movie",2024-03-02
"I feel like any sense of betrayal she has stems from Paul actually choosing to become the Messiah and leading her people into war, not the marriage stuff with the Emperor's daughter.",2024-03-10
"That's correct.  I don't think it's even implied if I recall, it's basically outright stated in Irulan's internal monologue that Paul never touches her.  It's basically an open secret to the court too, that Chani's his ""real"" wife.",2024-03-03
And also that Paul never had sex with her and promised that he would never and he also 100% dedicated himself to Chani.  Such a ridiculous plotline to make her go against him when in reality she was probably the only person truly who wanted the best for him the whole time and didn't see him as a Messiah or as a pawn but as a loving partner.,2024-03-09
"Yeah he didn't lie to Chani, but he recognized the politics of the situation.",2024-03-03
I feel like it was quite clear that this was exactly what Paul was doing.  He was reassuring her that regardless of what was about to happen that she was the one he loved.,2024-03-06
"Considering that Paul can see into everything everywhere all at once, it feels less of an apology and more of a statement of fact that he does love her till his last breath.",2024-03-03
"Until I saw in the comments that Feyd was one of those people who could obscure/confuse future visions, I didn’t know why Paul (who’s basically Nicolas Cage from Next now) was losing to him, and legit thought he made sure to get stabbed twice right next to Chani so she has to feel sorry for him, to compensate for the shit he just pulled.",2024-03-05
"Ehhh, I personally feel like that would be too heavy handed and starts to get into ""rules explaining"" dialogue. You sometimes need it for books, but it can be way more subtle in a visual medium.

Like, just watching the movie, I wasn't confused on what Paul really wants. He clearly still loves Chani, but he has to marry Irulan for political reasons and to survive.",2024-03-03
"This is my only problem with the movie. I want so desperately to hold the book up to Zendaya and be like, ""No, it's OK! See?!""",2024-03-04
"For sure, still appalled though.",2024-03-16
Agreed. I was a bit confused by how the holy war is going so intensely by the start of Messiah in the book,2024-03-03
Hardly. Chani and Paul have children? omg what a surprise!,2024-03-03
Dang I kinda feel spoiled now. Nearest 70mm screen is 15 minutes away. The picture takes up your whole field of view if you sit in the 4th-5th rows and you can feel the bass in your chest. Can almost smell spice in the air,2024-03-02

The thumpers holy shit.,2024-03-02
"For real. This movie really made me realize just how good IMAX is. Especially after rewatching the first Dune on my TV lol. I couldn't believe how pathetic it was compared to my memory of seeing it in IMAX. And I have a pretty nice TV! It's mostly the audio that you can't quite match (or in my case even get close to, because no surround and neighbours).",2024-03-05

Dolby Atmos over LieMAX any day of the week. Screen size is not the big with LieMAX anyways.,2024-03-04
Just saw it in Dolby and it was incredible. There were several moments where I had to catch my breath,2024-03-04
"Yeah Alamo wasn’t the move but the way I saw it as well, seeing it again in imax/dolby this week",2024-03-04
Saw mine in Atmos and the worm riding scene alone was more than worth the price of admission. I knew I had chosen wisely.,2024-03-03
"I cant rave enough about Dolby Atmos, and I hope it becomes more widely available as time passes because I hardly see people mention it and it seems like **the** definitive way to see blockbusters. The picture and sound systems are just unbelievable.",2024-03-03

The sound and the vibrating seats! I've never been so immersed in a movie,2024-03-03
Yup. The “LieMAX” sound system is atrocious. Not like real IMAX. Saw this in Atmos and fucking loved it.,2024-03-04
"As long as it's good sound quality and loud, i don't think i understand what Dolby Atmos offers more than a theater without it. I mean if you didn't tell me if it was Dolby Atmos or not and i had to guess afterwards, i wouldn't know what it was. I honestly may go watch the movie again **without** Dolby Atmos this time and try to notice the difference, i guess it's the only way i wil find out.

I hope they do a rescreening before Dune: Messiah like they did with the first movie before this. Rewatching Dune a couple of weeks ago made me love it even more,2024-03-01
"BR 2049 is my favorite movie. I saw it twice in theaters, and haven't seen it since. I know it won't feel the same at home. Recently I went from a 55"" to a 75"" TV, and I'm planning on getting a better sound system. I think I'll rewatch it after that.

On another note, I saw the first Dune on hbo at home and felt very meh about it. I watched it in parts over two days and that might have been part of the problem. I'd give the first a 7/10 and part two a 9/10 or 10/10. It felt amazing to see part two in theater. Very close to how I felt watching blade runner",2024-03-03
Yeah sadly home releases very rarely use the IMAX ratio which is dumb because it would fill up the TV more making it immersive,2024-03-03

It gets extremely ridiculous after Messiah which is probably why Denis is ending it with that,2024-03-05
You’re bugging bro. 1-4 are amazing.,2024-03-05
Sorry no God Emperor (4) is the best book and changes everything about the first three ahaha,2024-03-07
I personally enjoyed Children of Dune way more than Messiah.,2024-03-14
I've heard similar things from those who actually read the books. A lot of them say that Messiah onwards is just off. Probably because everyone is/was so invested in Paul's success and then to read and learn that it was all for nothing in Messiah - onwards.........,2024-03-21
"Book 4 was legitimately incredible imo, it’s just much more a slow burn and in a somewhat different direction.",2024-03-29
So tired of seeing this warning everywhere. Just let people discover it for themselves! For all you know they would have loved it. Now they may never even read it because their perception has been coloured before they could even start.,2024-04-07
"Without spoiling too much of the book, the biggest was a rework to the timeline.

The movie takes place over the course of about half a year going by Jessica's pregnancy where the book takes 2 years including a time jump. In that time jump Alia is born and Paul and Chani have a child. Because of the time rework many of the story beats in the movie happen in a different sequence to the book, but I think it works.

Paul's child provides a motivation for some of the things he does later in the book. Alia, being a reverend mother's  mind in a child's body plays a prominent role in the last battle. 

There are several other key characters and even entire factions from the book missing in the movie. The largest faction being the spacing guild that uses spice to navigate interplanetary travel in the empire.The guild controls all commerce and movement, and even the emperor can't move troops unless the guild allows it. Spice is basically galactic oil. When Paul threatens to destroy the spice he's threatening to destroy any and all galactic trade and travel. I imagine we'll be introduced to the guild in Messiah where they're more integral to the story.

Other than that many of the cut characters were involved in more of the ""game of thrones"" political side of Dune, with a lot of the ""plots within plots within plots"" being streamlined or removed.",2024-03-07
"Personally the first movie had bigger changes like the whole traitor plot being reduced. In this movie a lot of Feyd-Rautha got cut or reduced, like you meet him very early in the book but he isnt in the first movie at all and get more scenes with him in both halves of the book. Thufir got reduced in the first movie and cut from the second entirely.  Things were a bit out of order too. 

That being said this adaptation was really good because it was concise. You see everything you need to see to get the story",2024-03-09
"Chani.   

in the book she little more than a cardboard cut out of a perfect wife.  Indeed the final show down in the book is after the emperor’s sardaukar have killed chani and Paul ‘s son.  

in the movie, they move a lot of Paul’s internal ethical debates concerning the fanatics at his disposable over to the out loud debates with chani.   It allows the debate to be voiced but still with the characters motivations.",2024-04-01
"Yeah the book really eloquently lays out the thought process. It's entirely a read on his opponents character. 

I'm only thru Book 3 but that's a pretty common theme. One of the reasons why they are timeless!",2024-03-01
"Which is exactly how Paul and Zendaya take out the attack helicopter, shoot it when it’s attacking",2024-03-03
"Well I think there's multiple angles for that. He also keeps looking at Chani. He knows if he gets closer to death he'll bring more emotions out of her. He still does love her and needs her to really cherish his existence. Not going to spoil, but she still has a part to play. As he kept saying, it's a very finite path he has to walk to make everything plays out the way for the ultimate goal.",2024-03-01
"In the book Paul notes that Feyd-Rautha is too confident and proud about small victories or somethingl like this, so it fits pretty well.

On another note, is there a continuation error, I saw Paul getting stabbed on his left side abdomen but when he pulls it out later its higher close to shoulder on his right side. I saw it twice and noticed the same thing",2024-03-01
"""I will bend like a reed in the wind.""",2024-03-02
Just like when they rocket launcher’d the helicopter. The only way to hit it is when it’s shooting 🤔,2024-03-06
"Well it's less ""understanding"" and more ""foreseeing"". Paul at this point has nearly completely sight into the past and the future, so he foresees all the ways the battle can turn out and picks the best option. We actually literally see the dagger in his side in a brief vision after he drinks the Water of Life to illustrate this.",2024-03-04
Damn that’s so clever and the movie doesn’t make that clear at all,2024-03-08
"After Paul wakes from the Water of Life, it would have been amazing if he caught Chani's hand from slapping him.",2024-03-02
does the wound kill Paul?,2024-03-04
Mortal? You sure about that?,2024-03-06
"I saw it as: he’s a guy with perfect future vision now, he should have been able to kill any guy without taking any damage. However he’s just majorly pissed off Chani, and that’s how he saw he could get her to feel sorry for him, so he took them stabs.



Getting stabbed twice for Zendaya is…very understandable.",2024-03-05
I'm so happy they didn't do that in the film. It would've ruined the pacing and emotions of that scene. One of the things I love about Villeneuve is that he generally lets the audience figure out or interpret what happens on screen. That fight is no exception.,2024-03-10
"Something would have been better than nothing. I had no idea until now that it was a chess move on his part to get stabbed. Point of view angles, the use of the Kuleshov effect, slow motion and facial expressions are all visual tools they could have used, and these are just broad suggestions I came up with in two seconds. An experienced and gifted director like Denis could have come up with something better if he had given it some thought. It is about embracing the challenge to make creative decisions, but they didn't even try and opted for the most predictable duel beats. Skillfully executed, I have to admit, but not particularly unique. You always expect the bad guy to win some leverage initially, but you don't expect the main character to be so superior he feigns losing.",2024-03-02

"That Atreides who wasn’t drugged wasn’t just an ordinary soldier though, he was one of their highest ranking fighters. It’s never explicitly stated, but in Part 1 you can often see him near Leto/Gurney/Duncan and he even has some dialogue with them. I remember reading this in an interview a few years back after Part 1 came out. 

And the guy who plays him is Roger Yuan, who was responsible for all the fight choreography in both movies so I thought it was cool how they gave him a badass role in universe that justifies his prowess in the Giedi Prime arena against Feyd. ",2024-03-03
"This says more about the Atreides' soldiers than anything. He beats a single random undrugged Atreides and everyone thinks hes a hero.

Part of the Emperors reason for wanting to destroy the Atreides is that their soldiers were becoming even better and more loyal than the Sardaukar!",2024-03-03
"The soldier who wasnt drugged was the 2nd in command of the Atreides army, under Gurney",2024-03-04
The Combatants were drugged up to weaken their capabilities. That is why those 2 are slain so easily whereas the non drugged combatant puts up a fight. It's why they tell the Baron to cancel the fight upon realizing one is not drugged and cld pose a legitimate threat. Like the bene gesserit said it is all for show. They are drugged to be easily killed for the spectacle. Feyd then calls out Baron after the fight that he had tried to kill him bcuz he knew the 1 fighter wasnt drugged.,2024-03-04
"What about Feyd's last opponent made him come off as ""some ordinary tech guy"" other than the fact that he was Asian and not as hilariously buff as the other two?

The guy was shredded, moved with confidence and purpose, and even had a badass line when the Harkonnens entered his cell before the fight.",2024-03-07
"Interestingly enough, that's actually not true for the book, the movie makes it far more ambiguous so I'm not totally sure. 

In the book that is the main issue actually -- Paul knows THAT he gets into this fight but he cannot see the actual fight clearly. Most probably because Feyd-Rautha is also a candidate for Kwisatz Haderach.

This forces Paul to stay reserved because he doesn't know what Rautha has hidden (in the book he has hidden poisons and needles and such). That's how Rautha is able to really give Paul a challenge.

Ultimately though, in both the book and movie the fight plays out in a way where Paul is making an assessment of his opponents character/motivations and then exploits it.",2024-03-04
"He's not omniscient, he can see possibilities and sometimes even see the ways to make them happen exactly but it's not 100%.

"No he doesn’t. He knows every possible future. He doesn’t know what happens in this fight, even during the fight in the book. At first his visions are near perfect, but throughout the book there are more and more instances of his visions being wrong or imperfect.",2024-03-01

I think the editing is just wonky. It pays like a one motion thing but in actuality it would've been a two motion action. I thought the end to the Feyd gladiator fight had a wonky kind of ending to the edit as well.,2024-03-05
"It was not there. The blade in his side was his own that Feyd managed to turn on him. Paul then pulls this out to stab Feyd while also directing Feyd's blade into his shoulder as bait.

After the battle, he only pulls out Feyd's blade in his shoulder while still holding his own blade that struck the killing blow. The blade is no longer in his side.",2024-03-11
"Oh okay, this makes sense. Feel like two knives in you is too much.",2024-03-03
"I think there’s a third knife, Paul stood up with two knives still stuck in him, while a 3rd one was stuck in Rautha. I guess he always had a side knife, which he never had a chance to pull until he occupied Rautha’s hands with the shoulder stab.


I have a feeling the 3rd knife belonged to Jamis which Paul just had on him, but I will have to rewatch the movie to be sure.",2024-03-05
"He did not, no. The actor shot scenes for the sequel, but said scenes were cut.",2024-03-05
"The scene after shows him removing the one from his shoulder, and his side. There was a 3rd dagger.",2024-03-01
"That’s whats happening. Not sure what you were seeing. The make points that Feyd is a guy that can be manipulated with honor that he cares about and Paul knows that honor and this fighting is the way of the houses. Paul is more powerful than anyone now after he drank the water of life. He can see the possible futures. He already knows what happens and how to win. And he makes sure not to “use” his powers in front of the audience cause then the fight wouldn’t be honorable if he cheated. 

But he took that path to do what he did because he already knew he won the fight. Otherwise he would have taken a different path",2024-03-01
"Right, but that aspect of Feyd was completely left out of the movies. There’s no reason to think Paul was poisoned in his final fight in the movie. Just that he can somehow survive short swords to his torso without much damage, and is able to pull it out and stab his opponent who is face to face with him without being noticed.",2024-03-01
"I dunno, from the adverts I saw it just looked like a typical Divergent or Hunger Games thing, all sparse, shot wide, looked a bit flat, a bit cold- you know- how NCIS, Stargate Universe and loads of other tv dramas are all shot the same, same camera angles, same lighting, same office based scenes, they all look the same.

"> Abomination

Sorry for the digging this up, but I was looking for discussion about this scene and could not really find it elsewhere.

When I saw the movie, I was thinking to myself how they misused the word Abomination. To be an Abomination, to my understanding, one has to be pre-born. Which is when a pregnant woman drinks the Water of Life to become a Bene Gesserit and gains access to Other Memory (ancestral memory), the unborn child(ren) experience this, too. Because they do not yet have fully formed personalities, this poses a potential problem, as the the voices of their ancestors can begin to take over.

Paul is not pre-born, but did drink the Water of Life. Paul was Bene Gesserit trained by Jessica and has developed a personality, so should be fine from Abomination.

Maybe I'm nitpicking but I was a bit annoyed by this. Abomination is kind of a huge theme in Dune, especially Children of Dune. :)",2024-03-11
"Didn’t know this until today…

“Abomination” refers to a person who has been prenatally exposed to the spice melange and, as a result, gains access to Other Memory—the collective consciousness and memories of their ancestors—while still in the womb. This condition is considered extremely dangerous because the individual, especially a child, is at risk of being psychologically dominated or possessed by the personalities of their ancestors contained within their genetic memory.",2024-03-11

Side note: a Dune anime or animated series would interesting.",2024-03-01
"Abomination refers to Jessica becoming a reverend mother while pregnant, exposing the baby to spice and it becoming prescient.

Spoilers below!!!


>! Abomination refers to how the baby will have generations of memories from every other reverend mother in its head. The reason for this being an abomination and Paul not being one is because Paul wasn’t prescient before having his own sense of self. This means he can use the memories and experiences in his head without them taking over him and him basically becoming a vessel for haunting in a sense. The baby will not have its own sense of self and personhood to be able to fight against this and is susceptible to being taken over by some of the people in their memories. !<",2024-03-01

"She definitely said it to Paul, it was in response to his using the voice. 

Probably just took liberties, obviously the abomination is Alia in the books.

Why were more used in the final battle in the north? When shields weren’t being used, why didn’t people use more lasers? In case someone switched them on and caused the double nuke?

In one of the first scenes there’s the harkonen patrol that glides up the spire to escape a thumper (insanely beautiful shot with the score ripping) and they start getting sniped by projectiles. One of them suggests shields and their leader says no. Why? I thought worms can’t get you on rocks? It seems like the perfect time to use shields.",2024-03-06

His soldiers can take the imperial troops one to one or better because they're hardened fanatics who evolved from a hellworld. He has the prescient path forward to perfectly manipulate the other houses as well as troops having troops as good as the sardaukar.

They have the atreidies remnant on caladan, they could sway other house that were friendly. If they leverage Ix then they have a weapons base. Controlling the spice gives them a lot of leverage. As most rulers of the great houses are addicted to give them long life as are many of the heirs. The spacing guild will all die without out it because they depend on mega doses. The Bene Gesserit can be brough on side if they believe they have some control over Paul or Paul is advancing the ultimate goal which is human survival.

I think he's just absolutely nailing it. Including more, or making 4hr films would be great for us fans, but I doubt it'd do well enough with the normies to secure funding to finish the project.

It's still only Peter Jackson who's managed that, by somehow convincing them to approve the whole series at once. Basically by lying and saying they could film them at the same time 😆. George Lucas has famously joked about this, and you can tell he's in awe.

They didn't cover Feyd's poisoned blade either. Again - for good reason. It would've been so hard to do well, and it's just more detail than is needed for the majority of the audience.

Same with the whole lasguns vs shields thing. Us nerds care, and explain to our friends why the combat is so melee-heavy. Covering it well in the movies would require adding a whole bunch more scenes.

And there is additional emotional frustration for the reader knowing that the baron is utilising Thufir to strategise against his own former master. Anyway the film was 10/10 for me",2024-03-02

"I was thinking this too after watching the new movie today. There are so many important themes throughout the book that either don't make it to the movies or aren't as highlighted as others.

It seems like the recent adaptations are primarily focusing on the themes of religion + messianism, environmentalism, and colonialism/imperialism. Religion/fanaticism is heavily observed in the latest film and seems to be headed towards stronger themes of power & politics. 

I think they've done a wonderful job, though. Dune is notoriously difficult to adapt because it is driven so much by internal dialogue and a vast array of themes. It's clear the movies have made careful decisions with their focus and how they want to tell the story.

The mentats and guild, in the book, comment on the dangers of human reliance on technology (something that's definitely on-topic/relevant today) and resource scarcity's role in economics and politics. It's a shame we haven't gotten more of those themes in the latest movies, but, with how good the latest movies are, it just goes to show how important it is to make informed cuts & decisions when making a film. They've done an incredible job.

I appreciate the direction given to the latest adaptations and how well everything has been done up to this point. I genuinely believe the story of the book is too difficult to ever fully-encapsulate in another medium. Kudos to the film team for knowing what they wanted to achieve & portray and executing it extremely well.",2024-03-04

He’s basically the replacement for Paul, and this potential role is kept right up to the end of the film. The absolute peak is when Paul gets stabbed in the duel and the audience thinks “oh shit, was all this grassroots religious movement actually wrong?”

He reminds me so much of Brad Pitt.  They have a similar voice and demeanor.  Pitt has done a lot of cool and or tough guy roles but then he'll do something wild like in Burn After Reading and just completely go for it and pull it off.,2024-03-08

"Same - Hollywood has been pushing him pretty hard and I was starting to wonder if he was actually any good. But I remember seeing him the first time in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and despite the relatively small role, he was memorable and I remember going to look him up.

During the scene when the 3 main Harkonnens were in front of the emperor and he looked up and spoke to the emperor he had very strong Bill Skaarsgard Pennywise vibes. I almost forgot it wasn’t bill in that role for that brief second,2024-03-03
I legit thought it was Bill Skarsgård until my gf corrected me,2024-03-03
I actually thought it was Bill the whole time.,2024-03-01
I didn't know Austin Butler was cast in this and I thought it was Alex Skarsgaard for a second.,2024-03-11
Agreed. At times he reminded me of Bill.,2024-03-05

"> I wonder if they shot his response to the pain test.

It wouldn't surprise me. Tim Blake Nelson was completely cut from the movie even though he filmed scenes, which means he was probably Count Fenring. The entire Giedi Prime sequence had to have been much larger in that case, with a lot of shots for potential material. 

That whole sequence rocked but there are some hallmarks of a rework late in the process. Leá Seydoux walking down the corridor when she seduces Feyd using ""the voice."" It's zoomed in on her eyes and you can't see her mouth. Both of their lines are done in voice over, which makes me think it was a cheap way of changing something.",2024-03-02

"The Fremen value water as a sacred offering to the tribe upon death, hence the great pool of water Stilgar shows Jessica which they pour Jamis' water into. He also tells her not to cry for the dead as it's seen as a waste, as the dead have no use for her water. Paul correctly deduces that a Fremen's greatest source of shame would be giving up their water to those who can't use it, and turns it against the Fremen as a fear tactic to make them believe he can see their deepest anxieties.

One of many examples of Paul and Jessica using the Fremen's own religious cultural beliefs to control them.",2024-03-03

"/u/MyWaYCarService and /u/hulkulesenstein you wanted to know as well:

In the books, “giving water to the dead” means shedding tears for them. This is very taboo in Fremen society because of conservation of water. The movie mentions this when Jessica cries after seeing the Fremen water reservoir. Stilgar catches her tear and says never to do that.

Paul is telling the old man that even though crying for the dead is forbidden for Fremen, he knows the old man enjoys doing it in his dreams.",2024-03-03

"In the books Paul fights that battle in his mind between the two roads he sees, a life of peace and insignificance with Chani or revenge and the Throne if he embraces the prophecy. They didn't want to go excessive with the dreams and thoughts so they made each path personified by characters. Chani was the anti prophecy love path and Jessica was the embrace the prophecy part. If you recall from the book Jessica really wasn't that into the Fremen prophecy, it being a bastardisation of the Benne Gesserit one.

It also made sense to build Paul's embrace of the horrible path he chose around Chani with the marriage proposal to Irulan being the climax of it. Giving Chani a ""prophecy is how they have power over us"" belief ties this together and tells the audience some of what's really going on.

"They simplified this part in particular from the book, where there's a somewhat complex bit of logic he applies, basically convincing them to accept both Fremen logic of leadership and his own Outsider logic of noble titles side-by-side. He is Duke of Arrakis, and he essentially makes Stilgar his vassal, a kind of loophole to how they handle leadership. 

Not a criticism though. The ""I am Paul Mua'dib Atreides, Duke of Arrakis"" sells the concept of it. They have their ways, and he has learned them, but in following him, they have to accept his as well.",2024-03-01

"He asked for guidance from the dead Jamis, had a vision and was then cool with going south",2024-03-04
Adding to another person's comment. Paul was also reality checked by Gurney. Paul's act of severely disrupting spice production would have force the Emperor/Harkonnen down a path of war regardless whether he went South to get an army or not.,2024-03-04
"1) Paul is disturbed he didn't foresee the eradication of their northern sietches, a failure that causes many Fremen civilian deaths. He is told (by vision of Jamis and Bene Gesserit spirits) that he needs to go south to achieve the vision needed to protect himself and those he cares about. This is why Paul wants to go south.

2) Practically speaking, the destruction of the northern sietches means all the Fremen have no home in the north and are heading south to meet. If Paul stays north he's doing it alone, to die in a heroic sacrifice. This is why Chani wants him to go south.

In the end Paul chooses the preservation of himself and those he holds dear over the lives of billions who will die in the war he unleashes, and Chani inadvertently gives him permission because she also values his life and this is the only way he sees to preserve it.",2024-03-09
"And to add to the other two comments, Feyd’s arrival with his more aggressive tactics successfully levelled all Fremen bases of operation in the North, so Paul’s options were suddenly and severely limited. Feyd forced Paul’s hands.",2024-03-05
"Paul used his prescient sight to get advice from Jamis in the alternate future where Jamis became his mentor instead of having to fight him to the death. Jamis tells him he needs to see the past to see the future, i.e. he needs to drink the water of life to unlock his genetic memory, like his mother, in order to be able to fully use his prescience and get the answers he seeks, i.e. how to save himself and his loved ones while avoiding the holy war. After drinking the water of life, he says he sees a narrow path. But in the end, he realises he failed to avoid the holy war when the great houses refuse to recognize his ascendency: either they will declare war on him, or he does. Which is why when he hears back from the great houses, he tells the Fremen to ""go show them paradise"" in a resigned tone: he realises the holy war is inevitable and therefore stops trying to avoid it.",2024-03-04

"I read the books too and what you say is true. But how would you explain when people use the voice to force others to kill themselves? I doubt just saying the right words with the right pitch etc does the trick. So they can use the voice to do nearly undetectable manipulations as you say. But they also can flat out coerce people to do whatever, even kill themselves. The BG even say in the books why they don't do such things, they don't want to be conspicuous and raise any attention to themselves having this abilities. Even Hawat had no idea and he could barely comprehend the power.

Appreciate your thoughts on this.",2024-03-01
"That’s actually one of the things I love about Dune in general - for how trippy and weird it gets, a lot of it is surprisingly grounded. I like how the first book explains Bene Gesserit abilities: that they’re not superpowers, just natural human abilities taken to their extreme by discipline and self-awareness. They’re not good fighters because they’re mutants with superhuman strength or speed, but because they have an almost perfect understanding of body language and the self-control to override panic and act deliberately and logically. Paul’s ascension into the kwisatz haderach is incredible precisely because his abilities are the first to transcend what a normal human could achieve.",2024-03-02
Such subtlety was on screen when Lady Fenring was with Feyd,2024-03-07
"it's a little deeper than that , the complete understanding of ones body and mind down to the molecular level and the complete understanding of those you observe has something to do with it, it;s more than mere suggestion but almost akin to you telling yourself what to do .",2024-03-02
The voice is basically NLP (neuro-linguistic-programming),2024-03-23
">Without spoilers, is it ever explained why they don't use the voice way more?

I would say ''No'' I think, it's not explained, at least not according to your exact question, anyway. They don't address it so directly, if I recall correctly. 

Personally, I think it would be taxing on the moviegoer to have constant Voice use in our ears, in the way that Villeneuve portrays it at its most obvious.

Not to mention that the rarity of a thing contributes to its impact.


I have to stop now because I will just keep writing and writing lol .. I hope I at least provided some sort of interesting reading, if not a disinterested skim.

To me it was what dune was all about on a meta level, how these powerful threads motivate people so much and how it can be used to direct massive groups in the same direction.

I think the movie loses that because of Chani being against Paul and the belief in him, but that doesn't hurt the movie that much.",2024-03-01

"She teaches him to be a fremen, leads his forces, is his companion and only true confidant. Ultimately, Chani is a supporting role, but she's by no means unimportant.  She doesn't have a super loud role, but she's integral to the story. 

I don't mind that they gave her more to do... gotta justify grabbing Zendaya if nothing else. But I'm not a huge fan of the amount of time devoted to their romantic drama at the expense of exploring more of the political aspects of the universe.",2024-03-04
"part 2 completes a lot of part 1, naturally. And this is a prime example.

"I didn't get as much a sense of that in the book. So I dig that change, makes more sense for what happens between books. ",2024-03-01
"He's gonna probably break the goddamn great house system in the name of family, Daenerys-style",2024-03-02
"That was good - although the book only has the Emperor for the ending, I would have liked some more Walken in this one.",2024-03-02
petty?,2024-03-02
What are the negative geopolitical consequences of killing the Emperor? Doesn’t it remove the threat of him usurping it back and secure his position more?,2024-03-04
Surprise Anya Taylor Joy who I didn't know was going to be in this.,2024-03-01
I think trying to implement the details in the book would have made the 3rd act too thick for the plot to come out cleaner at the end. Paul killing the Barron felt extremely satisfying especially with how that room felt. Sardaukar are brought down a few notches and the Barron before the emperor really showed power.,2024-03-01
Was cool just to see Anya Taylor joy if only for a minute,2024-03-01
"I loved the change, the fact that he killed the Baron with a crysknife also meant revenge for the Fremen - they had their messiah kill their oppressor with their most holy weapon, Arrakis itself dealt the killing blow.",2024-03-01
"Reading about the role that Alia plays in this scene from the book version, it would be difficult to adapt that directly to the screen.

This feels like a good change to me.",2024-03-01
It compressed the timeline too much. It's a lot more reasonable that he took over as leader of the Fremen in 3 years instead of less than 9 months.,2024-03-01
Alia is set up for Dune Messiah. Lots of stuff is actually just there for the continuation (Fenrig being pregnant) and of course the holy war started on the Great Houses,2024-03-01
"Book purists are a pain in the arse and don't grasp how film is a completely different medium so what works well in the book won't work on screen. Dune is my favourite book and I'm glad they didn't stick faithfully to how things played out in the book. The only change I've decided I didn't like was the threat of atomics v the prespice mass to destroy the spice, as the latter is a method only Paul would have known out of the Great Houses but whatever, maybe it was just not going to translate well on screen.",2024-03-01
I loved how they handled Alia in this. You really feel like she is an abomination like the Bene Gesserit fear.  It was always creepy when she communicates with Jessica.,2024-03-01
One thing from the book I do wish they kept was Feyd trying to cheat in that final fight. Which I guess they kind of alluded to in the coliseum scene.,2024-03-02
"My only thing about the Alia stuff is I don’t think a blind audience would understand what’s going on with her at all. Lol

Talking fetus ftw",2024-03-02
"I’m one of those purists only because St. Alia of the Knife is relevant in the later books, but I agree for this film that change is better.",2024-03-01
Yeah hard to make a two year-old not look goofy on screen doing what Alia did but having Alia never be born really compressed the timeline a lot.,2024-03-01
"Some things will never seem realistic on film and start to lose credibility. Agreed for film
Adaptation it had to be this way. It’s the reason Ender’s game can never be shown as it really was. Would not be believable on screen for those ages and circumstances.",2024-03-02
"I really hope an extended edition will come in the future, knowing the books I felt they could have had an extra thirty minutes (or more) at the end",2024-03-01
"Sometimes you have to make changes from the source material for it to work on screen. See: the baby in twlight.

&#x200B;

But also, I can't even imagine how silly the mass battle would have looked with everyone fighting in slomo to deal with the Saudukar shields?",2024-03-02
"I figured the death of the Baron being changed was a given, with the prospect in the book just being awkward at best.

What I didn't like was that the timeline around the change just makes everything feel too rushed. Paul spent a few years resisting the Harkonnens before usurping the Empire in the book, and a lot of that sense of scale is lost when you try to fit it all in the period of Jessica's pregnancy. If they had infant Alia running around but still have Paul do the deed, you'd get the better of both worlds.",2024-03-02
I do think that was better for a movie adaptation but I can’t honestly say I didn’t wanna see a little genius Alia running around causing a ruckus.,2024-03-01
Adding in Alia would've added an extra hour or so to the movie. Also it would've looked goofy as hell.,2024-03-03
"Alia in the first book really didn't feel like a connected part of the story. Idk if Herbert had planned out the sequels and put her in to set them up, but I think it makes sense to remove the parts of the first book where alia was out the womb. Still plenty of room to develop her if they make another movie and go for Book 2",2024-03-01
"I agree I think it was a good choice by Denis.  It was certainly one of the stranger parts of the book.  Though I think he could have done a better job displaying how the water of life transformed Paul.  In the book Paul starts to have trouble distinguishing what is a vision of the future and what’s present.

Also I think Denis did a better job developing the relationship between Paul and Chani.",2024-03-05
"the film fixes so many loose ends of the book. the fenring couple show up at the gladiator fight and then again at the end just to deny the emperors call for help. until today i could never know lady fenring was actually doing something meaningful.

and why the emperor shows up on arrakis. i never figured why from the books and upon googling no one has this question.",2024-03-01
"Where? Where are these book purists who are mad about it? 

Nice straw there man, but this entire thread is literally at most just people saying it’s an understandable change",2024-03-03
"I have to lump myself in, as one of those book purists. The first student movie was practically shot for shot with the book and I went in expecting that for the second half.",2024-03-01
Well said.  And in this half of the book every chapter seems to jump ahead in time so I was curious how they would handle that.,2024-03-05
And they didn't even toy with the idea that Rabban could put up a fight against him. Swift justice.,2024-03-02
"I think short of Alia herself killing the baron, having Paul do it is the most powerful. The narrative reason for the title ""Alia of the Blade"" will have to be written around either way, might as well let Paul avenge his father and establish his dominance more.",2024-03-03
Somehow I don’t think that actually happened,2024-03-01
No they didn’t.,2024-03-01
This is the most cringe head canon I’ve read in awhile.,2024-03-01
lol what's the point of getting on the internet and lying about something stupid?  90% of the people in your theater have never read the book.,2024-03-01
100% no doubt in my mind this did not happen.,2024-03-01
"There’s a comment thread further up that I commented this under, but this is a theme with Paul, that he wins by counterattack. Killing Jamis, baiting the ornithopter to fire at him so that Chani can shoot it down, letting Feyd stab him so that he could use the knife for a killing blow. There are probably more examples too. And overall just attacking the Baron & the Emperor after being ambushed and cast out into the desert could arguably count.",2024-03-06
I'm glad most of the movie is subtitled Fremen or Harkonnen language.,2024-03-01
Yes they do. This is why I didn't watch it in imax. The bass is overkill and not worth the extra screen,2024-03-01

"Funny you mention wakeboarding:  When I was watching that scene I thought, ""I bet they made Timothy Shalamar learn how to waterski to practice for this.""",2024-03-07
When Paul was being carried by the sand it was heavily reminiscent of being flipped over in rapids and desperately trying to flip rightside-up before having to bail out,2024-03-05
"Totally.  And I want to see how they get so many people, and items, on one of them at a time too. Like when Jessica was on her voyage in the little tent. It's one thing for a dude to hop on and stick his hooks in real quick but it's not like the worms pull up and stop like a train for boarding multiple people/things.",2024-03-02
"Planning a rewatch with my dad in IMAX for this very reason. Trust me, it deserves it.",2024-03-01

"Yeah I just read Messiah so I'm really wondering how it's going to translate to the big screen, esp after the first two blockbusters. It's more like early game of thrones",2024-03-03
That's exactly how it will go. Each House will have a visually distinct look and feel. Splice the action with ever more wheels within wheels and bring back box office favourite Jason Momoa as a ghola.,2024-03-03

">In that instant, Paul saw how Stilgar had been transformed from the Fremen naib to a *creature* of the Lisan al-Gaib, a receptacle for awe and obedience. It was a lessening of the man, and Paul felt the ghost-wind of the jihad in it. *I have seen a friend become a worshipper*, he thought.    
    
--final chapter of **Dune**",2024-03-01

None of that played funny to me.  I'm surprised people find religious fervor as anything but horrifying.,2024-03-03
"Paul says that she will come back - presumably she comes around. 

&#x200B;

I think the change does a good job of externalizing Paul's internal conflict (which obviously doesn't come across as well in a movie vs. a book), and also helps to reinforce that Paul isn't a good guy (which, let's be honest, is needed in a mass market movie). He isn't saving or helping the Fremen. He is leading them on a path to their own destruction.",2024-03-04
"Yes if this change fundamentally changes Messiah, which I’m struggling to see how it can manage not to, it’s not acceptable imo, even if it’s good for Zendaya and good for Part 2 specifically.",2024-03-03
"Exactly, I think people saying they like movie Chani haven't read it or at least not past the first book. I loved the movie 9/10 but the one issue I had was Chani's character was way too different. Felt like Villeneuve took it upon himself to make her this fierce warrior because it's Zendaya, but left out most of the romance and the fact she always supported Paul. Like the other commenter says, fundamentally changes the story too much.",2024-03-03
"Yeah, I think Chani is the only one who rejects him in the end because she is the one who knows him the best, and she doesn't like what he's becoming as a person 

She also very strongly believes that tying the Fremen to a Messiah is only going to be bad for her people, and she repeatedly tells Paul that. Worst of all, he agrees with her and then essentially betrays her by going off and becoming that very Messiah. She thinks he wanted what was best for her people, and he shits on that completely.",2024-03-04
"That's a fair interpretation, and the moments where that comes out are her strongest scenes (such as when she confronts Jessica upon seeing Paul in the coma) but IMO I felt on the whole that could have been emphasized more (I also didn't really connect with their romance that much tbh -- they're together for a whole six months and half the time she's actively unhappy with what he's becoming, so I wonder why they're even together other than that the script demands it).

As I was watching the movie, Chani came off more like a blatant 21st century audience surrogate to make sure everyone got the point of the movie.",2024-03-04
Yes. And what about him not experiencing the loss of his child that died during the Harkonnen raid? Isn't that a major part of his character development in the books?,2024-03-01
"It’s possible they can explain it away by saying Jessica delayed the birth herself, especially because they were in the middle of war it would safer to keep baby inside. The Bene Gesserit have total control of their bodies.",2024-03-01
Yeah I was really confused by that comment. WHO said the child actor was the weakest part? Why?,2024-03-03
"This. I mean, she was just a kid, maybe one of the last lines when she says ""Daddy!"" To Ian it was like ""Uh, ok"", but I have known people whose child react with that little emotion sometimes so yeah, it wasn't unbelievable lol",2024-03-03
I feel like the only way you could even think of something like that is if you’re specifically looking for some type of flaw in that movie.,2024-03-14

Plus she can lean into acting crazy as well. She's going to nail that role in the next movie.,2024-03-01

I'm honestly just stoked this looks like it'll clear enough to get Messiah greenlit. There are some folks in for a lot of whiplash,2024-03-01
"I figure that subplot is gonna be the first thing cut from Messiah. It was pretty shameless fan-service from Herbert back then, and it's not really Villeneuve's style. Plus I don't think modern movie audiences like that trope all that much; even superhero movies seem reluctant to use it.",2024-03-01
Yeah but they can't wait 20 years for the sequel. Villeneuve wants to do rendevouz with Rama or another project before Messiah to let Chalamet age a bit but at the end of the day it's got to be Chalamet as Paul and it has to be done within a few years. That means you either get adult Alia (using some plot device) or you do the events of Messiah with Alia as a child. You have to change something,2024-03-01

This is my biggest complaint when comparing it to the books. I'm assuming they will have to do some more world building regarding the guild next movie though so it might be fine in the long run.,2024-03-03

"I felt exactly the same, I couldn't fully enjoy the end fight with him and Paul because there was nothing to suggest to the viewer that he was as good a fighter. And more so with the third Atreides almost killing him like you said (although you could argue that Feyd-Rautha was perhaps not taking it as seriously up until that point due to thinking they're all drugged).

Whereas Paul's had training from Duncan and Gurney with Duncan being one of the best, as well as killing Jamis who's considered a really good Fremen warrior.

I'm disregarding anything in the actual book, just taking it solely from the movies.",2024-03-01
He never really wanted to send the galaxy into a decade long war that would destroy entire planets. He was hoping that his ascendancy would be legitimized by the great houses and that bloodshed wouldn’t be necessary.,2024-03-02
"He loved it in the moment because it fueled his adrenaline. After cooling off he was pissed at his uncle, but that’s because he wasn’t prepared for it and I think anger is just the Harkonnen form of fear.",2024-03-01
"Yeah it was supposed to be a hawat scheme but I'm guessing that got cut pretty late and obviously the arena is a huge set piece so you can't really work around that

"Yes. I believe it was Harkonnen gladiatorial tradition to fight with two blades: a pure black blade, and a poisoned white blade. However, Feyd added poison to the black blade to give him an edge. There was a lot behind the scenes of that fight in the books that is lost due to the lack of Hawat.  


Anyways, unlike the movie, honor is not very important to Feyd in the book.",2024-03-14

It might have hit but been a glancing blow. Either way he played it up a bit as a feint.,2024-03-01
One of the most scenes of history of films recent,2024-03-01
I did notice the second time I watched the first film that the Harkonnen and Raban really weren’t great warriors. They have characteristics of a warrior class and maybe Gurney’s warning of them being “brutal” may have been misunderstood as being vicious warriors when in reality he was probably describing their underlying lifestyle and maybe lack the resolve to be a truly elite fighting group such as the Atreides were. None of them except Feyd actually showed much fighting prowess as I think back.,2024-03-02
Don't forget The Batman,2024-03-01
In the book there’s a line that’s essentially “my name is a weapon” and for whatever reason Lynch decided that meant a gun that fired whenever he said his name,2024-03-01
"Because it would have been too expensive to showcase the fremen as superior hand-to-hand fighters back in those days. So the Atreides ""weirding way"" turned into ""weirding modules."" It's dumb but on the other hand, I loved Paul saying, ""My name has become a killing word,"" which for me really jives with the whole uncontrollable jihad thing.

The current movies pretty much threw away the whole weirding way thing which is a bit of a disappointment to me. There's a reason the Atreides and Fremen were courting each other and looking for an alliance. The Fremen were already a super people in terms of fighting ability and the weirding way would have boosted them to being overwhelmingly powerful. There's a reason millions of Fremen could result in the destruction and dominance of billions!",2024-03-01
"He says he's not the Mahdi... which is exactly what the Mahdi would say!

"Well that's interesting to know. I had to watch the movie with German dub (wanted to see it on the biggest screen possible) and the reverent mother in that scene basically whispers ""Ungeheuerlich"" which translates to ""Outrageous"" or maybe ""Monstrous"". Ungeheuerlich is such an old, rarely used and ""dramatic"" word though, that her reaction basically got the biggest laughs of the whole movie.

Seems like that scene wasn't intended to be funny.",2024-03-01
Is that what she said? I couldn't make it out.,2024-03-01
"And Feyd's reaction. *chef's kiss* what a scene. Was waiting for that one, Paul's battle naming, and the worm invasion",2024-03-03

They probably were forced to cut half an hour of material. Film studios are petrified of their main films being longer than 3 hours for some reason. So many epic blockbusters are around 2hr 40min for that reason,2024-03-07
"I wasn't talking about the battle at all, after he drank the water of life it moved in time so quickly, no setup for the fight, barely anything to get the army together, suddenly they are back in the north and planning a massive battle. The entire 3rd act was rushed not the battle",2024-03-10

"Plus it goes to what she says about the prophecy being used to enslave them. They liberated their planet , but not themselves. Instead, believing Paul to be their messiah, they are all turned into fanatics who willingly follow his mandate. Yet with the Harkonnens, they at least could see how they were being exploited.

It’s poignant that the last we see of the Fremen is them rushing to ships to spread a holy war against the galaxy- literally immediately after they’re finally liberated their own home.

Really wish it was rated R. But this felt like it was filmed as if it was rated R but some sneaky camera cuts to not show too much gore let them keep it PG-13. Obviously I get why he had to make it pg-13 but I would've just liked a raw viewing that didn't hold back,2024-03-03

oh I never read the book so I felt like the movie didn’t do a good job connecting a lot of the scenes together. Characters felt like they were teleporting from 1 location to another. This is prob one of those movies which would benefit to be 3 hours long rather than 2 and a half hours.,2024-03-01

"Argyle was great, people just apparently can't have mindless fun anymore lol",2024-03-01

"I see I misspoke from the amount of people busting my balls about my word choice. I said ""Oscar bait"" with much reverence, I assure you. I'm not saying it sucks.

Villeneuves talent seems to be his ability to do adaptations really well. Amongst other things obviously.. but he somehow pays incredible respect to the source all the while putting his own spins / tweaks on it to make it a better movie going experience. Books are not films and he seems to understand that better than any director working today. He’s only getting better too,2024-03-02

The movie was visually spectacular. And was like reading cliff notes,2024-03-01
"It wasn't really left out imo. In his conversation with Lady Jessica after he drank the worm juice, Paul said that the only future where he and the Fremen would win was one where he became a ""Harkonnen"". It could be interpreted that Paul had to abandon his compassion, embrace his messianic destiny, and full-on conquer the empire using the Fremen as his tools in order to ""save"" them.


Fucked up that the Fremen's fate is ultimately to be religious pawns, but I guess (for the moment, before the Holy War) that it's better than if Feyd had come to power and wiped them off Arrakis entirely.",2024-03-02
they didn't really leave that out he actually says he can see one path he just doesn't explicitly state that's what it is,2024-03-03
"Most of the doubts in the book come from Paul's internal monologue and that doesn't really work in a movie unless you do the voice overs Lynch used.

It makes sense to give that to Chani and make her the voice of reason in order to tell the story of this movie, but yes it'll be weird to set things in place for Messiah",2024-03-01
"Yeah, I wonder where they go with her now. I LOVE what they did with her, easily one of the biggest upgrades from the books — but you think back to that future vision in Part 1 where she’s alongside Jihad Paul in that ship above Caladan looking highly complicit — and you wonder how she gets there from here.",2024-03-01

I think the same thing about Chalamet and The King. People were so surprised he could pull off Paul of part two, but he played a very convincing Henry V and that was years ago. I think many people only know him from Call me by your name or summer nights etc",2024-03-01
"Indeed! Same here, but I hope she still plays Chani long into the future.",2024-03-01
"In the book its meant to mirror the relationship of Duke Leto to Lady Jessica. Concubine in name, but for all intents and purposes Lady Jessica was Leto's wife.

"I'm just glad they actually let her be more upset. In the book it's like she's just kinda put off by it until Jessica cheers her up. I kinda feel like that's because it was written in the 60s and it's probably a left-over thing of that time, but I really prefer the movie take",2024-03-01
"> nah you're going to be his consort

Consort implies wife/queen. I think your looking for mistress/concubine",2024-03-04

"I believe he says she will ""understand"" eventually. Not come around.",2024-03-06
"Definitely this. Sure, Chani being upset about Paul entering a political marriage with Irulan is part of it, but she moreso seems upset that she feels like Paul lied to her. He kept saying over and over that he didn’t consider himself their messiah, and that he believed that the Fremen should be liberated and led by one of their own. Then as soon as they head south he starts proclaiming himself to be space Jesus and using her people as pawns in his wider goal of revenge. It honestly feels more realistic and human for Chani to feel betrayed than her just going along with Paul with seemingly no reservations except for internal ones.",2024-03-01

This was my question as well…,2024-03-02

"I haven't read the books and I'm just a little confused at this point, what is Paul's actual motivation at this point? He killed Baron Harkonnen and dethroned the Emperor, so he's gotten his revenge for what happens to his father.

I thought he wasn't power hungry and didn't want to rule, so what's the deal now?",2024-03-02
Not sure who to root for when it was tyrant vs tyrant in the final fight. Perhaps Paul wanted to kill them both so this whole charade ends but then his muadilb side took over 😂,2024-03-02
"I haven't read the book, but Chani mentions her Fremen name to be Desert Spring after the prophecy (which she hates). And the prophecy states that the Messiah will be reborn after drinking tears from the dessert spring.

We don't see most of the big Fremen war with House Harkonnen, we get like one big moment and get told about another.

If he hadn’t smoked out the Fremen from all their northern bases, Paul could have taken his time and utilised the atomic bombs using just his northern resources.

Up until this point, only the emperor and some of his forces even understand that the Fremen are a threat. But even they are nowhere near prepared for the sheer power on display and are shockingly overwhelmed in like 3 pages.

"I hardly noticed it in Part 2. Only in the very beginning, which was the shakiest part of the film. Feyd did add a new dynamic, yes he was still a murderous psycho but at least he had a certain sinister, more calculating effect to him. Not like Rabban who is just a screaming, angry idiot. 

I actually agree with Chani’s friend stealing those scenes - she was great. But I still found that Chani grew into a much more interesting character being the only one that sees what’s actually going on. Her acting when Paul wakes up from the dead and in the final scene after the duel was absolutely perfect.

I don’t agree on the characters at all. Leto Atreides is up there sure, but Duncan? He was just Jason Momoa in the Dune universe. Irulan, Feyd, Margot and even Jessica’s unborn child (Anya Taylor-Joy) were all wayy more interesting new characters to me.",2024-03-02

He only told Paul that he knew she was innocent, so it contributed to Gurney thinking it was Jessica who betrayed Leto, and Jessica thought Leto had died thinking she had betrayed him.

"They were moved to Arrakis when House Atreides moved from Caladan. The Harkonens searched for them when they took over but couldn’t find where they were hidden. 

In the books there’s “The Great Convention” which was a historic treaty brokered between the Great Houses, the Spacing Guild, and the Imperium shortly after the destruction of the thinking machines in a Great War over  10,000 years ago called the Butlerian Jihad. It specifically prohibited the use of atomics against human targets. The great war is also why there are now no computers or robots in Dune. All great houses keep a nuclear arsenal for self defense (I think in the books somewhere it specifically mentions defense in case there is ever an invasion from an advanced hostile alien species). So atomics can be used against machines and aliens (there has never been any contact with alien life in Dune, it’s just a precaution) 

Paul states in the book, “The language of the Great Convention is clear enough: Use of atomics against humans shall be cause for planetary obliteration.” 

Paul only uses the atomics to destroy the shield wall to allow the storm into the city and send the worms into a frenzy. He doesn’t directly use them against the people. This is extremely controversial with the other houses but it comes down to politics and the fact that Paul has so much power at the moment that no other houses can do anything to stop him. And since atomics haven’t been used in thousands of years it helps Paul’s threat to destroy the spice if the great houses attack at the end hold more weight that he would actually do something crazy like destroying the spice",2024-03-03

"another thing that isn't addressed in the movie by neglecting the balance of power is the role of the spacing build in enforcing galactic law or conventions.  Their navigators, and therefore all of human galactic civilization, are entirely dependent on spice to fold space.  However, they also have an absolute monopoly on space travel.  They exert this as a treat to any house that would defy established norms.  For example, in the Lynch 1984 Dune version, he uses the line from the book explaining that there are in fact Harkonnen and Atreides ships along side one another in a Guild transport, but they pose zero threat to one another as any act of aggression would render them permanently banned from the services of the Guild.  Likewise, the use of atomic weapons against your enemy could get you permabanned.  Even the Emperor is beholden to the Guild in such a way.  Again, balance of power.

It's not in the movie, but the idea that the Guild is also somehow behind the Houses' refusal of Paul is fun to think about.",2024-03-09

Maybe not, but the characters are telling us it's different.

I think with many of these things in the Dune universe (including this) is that you're going to find strategic loopholes.  The fact that a lasgun/shield interaction sets off a huge explosion isn't really utilised as much as it should be in a guerilla warfare sense (for example).  While Hebert did think out a lot of how strategy and warfare would work, he obviously didn't quite get it perfect  To some degree you do have to accept it and let it be handwaved away.

In the book, it can be pretty easy to go along with Paul and his decision making, his insistence that he can only see the golden path and more peaceful outcomes are impossible.  I'm sorry but he is villainous.

The great houses would have had to band together to defeat the sardaukar if a civil war broke out. The fremen, with Arrakis being the most brutal environment to live in by far in the empire, outclassed the sardaukar.


So their natural strength plus the religious fervor paul infused them with unleashed a tidal wave that completely destroyed any semblance of the imperial balance of power.

Surely given the spice is used as a way to see what path is safe for interstellar travel, they could use the spice to help fully understand what's happening on this planet.

On the point of resources, how on earth are the Fremen manufacturing stillsuits and thumpers? And water extractors for dead people? The whole time reading the book and watching the movies I had that thought, it never made much sense to me.",2024-04-05

I find myself lacking the empathy needed to really *love* these characters or back the Fremen. I lightly root for them only because that's what the plot told me to do. 

Some reviewer said the protagonists are more chess pieces on a board rather than vitally interesting figures. And Denis said he hates dialogue and I think that's a mistake. Many scenes are too underwritten for my tastes.

You are not understanding why people are saying it's as good as the LOTR trilogy. For example, TLOTR adaption of the books was perfect with some book fans saying it was better. Dune is getting the same reception, fans of the books are saying it really captures the books well and some say it's better. 

The gladiator sequence with Butlers character was one of the best sci fi shots I've ever seen. I was shook. Also, the charge with the worms in the final battle, the action scenes with the spice harvesters, Paul's character arc and change towards the end of the film was EPIC. 

Every scene was masterfull, I was speechless by the end there was so much to praise. Villeneuve is one of the best around. Glimpses in Sicario, Arrival and Bladerunner was just an incredible movie that captured the universe perfectly.

"I think I may have mistook your original comment with just the battle of Arakeen at the end of the movie. Which is my fault but I still believe some of your questions were presented in the film(s). I’ll also try my best to stay away from the book and just Denis adaptation which changes a lot in a good creative way. 

“Are there any scenes with him directing or advising them to do something?”

I saw the screening today so I can’t remember every detail. However, I’m very confident it was met with enthusiasm. The new Fremen character introduced said “he should be Fredaykin.” While everyone around did the Fremen chest pounding. Which I would say answers your question.

I think what you’re asking though is there any scenes in the movie where Paul clearly shows them new ways to overcome the Harkonnens. Which I would say no.

However, I don’t believe this was Denis intention. Denis does a very particular job of visually showing the levels of warriors. Going back to the first movie. We know the Harkonnens are not good fighters. They need the Sardaukar warriors to overthrow the Atreides. Even see them cower when facing Duncan. Since Duncan is the only great warrior we see in Part 1, we can assume his judgment is good when saying, “they sent a warrior out to kill me… and I’ve never been so close to dying. There’s no greater fighter in the imperium.” 
Pretty much what I’m trying to say. Denis set out the warriors from highest to lowest like this. 1. Fremen 2. Sardaukar 3. Atreides 4. Harkonnen

So yes, there’s no scenes with Paul explicitly telling the Fremen of how to beat the Harkonnen. Which he shouldn’t need to. We know they’re great fighters. We can assume that he’s providing leadership and confidence to a group of people who are great fighters that don’t understand how to politically and physically overthrow their oppressors. 

“Does Paul provide/contribute to them obtaining these resources initially?”

No? This is where I’m getting kind of confused with your questions as the atomics are the biggest turning factor in the movie. I can’t tell if your criticism is of Paul’s insertion into the Fremen culture. Or “the Fremen could’ve rebelled much earlier.” Because the atomics show why the Fremen couldn’t rebel earlier. We see the destruction the atomics do to the shield wall. We also see how politically they can be used as no one wants spice to be destroyed. 

“Can you explain the shield thing.”

I was speaking more towards the war as I thought this is what you were critiquing. The atomics and the storm destroyed everyone’s shields so it pretty much evened the battlefield. 

Your last section is very valid. Which is what some book readers have been having criticisms about. In the book, Paul and Jessica have the weirding way. Which is just like a great fighting skill. They teach this to the Fremen which was mentioned in the 1st but taken out of the 2nd movie. 
IMO. Denis goal was to have Paul as just a messianic figure then as something the Fremen learn from. Which is a pretty modern take which I completely respect. I can understand why you would possibly want more time for it though.",2024-03-02
">So we see Paul riding the worm. The next scene he is suddenly inside the chamber, looking at the baby worm. He's then given the juice which he drinks. We then see the juice lady inform Lady Jessica what Paul has done and they are shown walking into the cave. In the next scene we see Chani arrive via an ornithopter (??) and Jessica is waiting for her outside the cave (??).

this whole description reads like you were confused on what was happening. It seems you probably would have wanted the movie to be way longer to convey the same information which I guess but if you understood what was happening and it made sense what else would you want out of it, a long drawn out sequence that showed the same information but way longer and to no additional benefit?",2024-03-05

"> He's not meant to be more threatening or menacing than this - he's supposed to be primarily paranoid, jealous & even kinda weak. Otherwise it wouldn't make sense how he was manipulated by the Reverend Mother.

I think the problem is that Part 1 didn't really give us a good picture at all of what the Emperor was.  We only have two peeks into the Emperor and both gave an inaccurate picture.  The first was his brutal betrayal of House Atreides and the second was the nature of his soldiers.  Both give the perception of a menacing, cut-throat, and brutal character.  I was expecting more of a Harkonnen type just without the torture and complete disregard for life.

Additionally, his characterization as an impotent and weak ruler doesn't fit at all with the Great Houses not recognizing Paul as the leader. (Which I understand is a departure from the books)  Unless it's going to devolve into an X-way struggle for power (which wasn't set up as no one threw in behind Paul and they were presented as a unified front), it just doesn't make a lot of sense that they aren't seeing Paul as the true leader when the Emperor was already a lame duck type.",2024-03-01

Heck, even after Sietch Tabr got destroyed he DOES try to stay behind (that's your 'reluctance' right there!). But when Chani tells him that the others won't leave without him, he looked really pained but says that he would go South & ""do what he must"". Why would he ""resist everything else associated with going south"" after THIS moment when he's clearly accepting that he doesn't have a choice anymore? (can't risk not being able to predict future attacks, the Fremen War Council was about to meet, etc)

He would resist even less after surviving the Water of Life, because he actually saw how in most futures they were destroyed by their enemies, and so he was going to follow the ""narrow path through"" (plus him realising that he has Harkonnen blood in him, which changed the way he thought of himself, & so he says ""So we win by being Harkonnens"" or so).

"He sees visions of Jamis as his friend in the second act of Part One, when this was still a 'possible future' - but in reality he kills Jamis by the end of Part One, so that particular future became no longer possible. 

>isn't it in some way ""pre-established"" that he would assimilate with the fremen and learn their ways 

It just meant that it was a possible future that he would meet her, the Fremen etc. He had also seen Chani stab & murder him, as well as himself doing cartwheels on the battlefield in golden armour, Chani getting radiation burns (in Part 2) etc - none of these came to pass, but were all ""possible futures' at certain earlier points. Essentially, before he drank the Water of Life his prescience was very limited, seeing only visions of random parts of random possible futures... afterwards he was seeing every step of all possible futures (what actions in the present lead to which future etc). 

Also, think of it this way - after his Water of Life coma, Paul says that in most possible futures from that point on, they get killed by their enemies; but by taking the 'narrow path through' (of seizing power over the Fremen etc) they could survive. So if he could avoid the majority futures in which he & his loved ones got annihilated by choosing a particular course of action, then by that same logic, he should've ALSO been able to avoid all the events of Part Two by choosing to forgo revenge, taking the L (for the greater good of avoiding galactic war, sparing the Fremen further religious brainwashing etc), and just leaving the planet when his mother suggested it. 

It's kinda like: At each point in time, there are 'n' number of possible futures. But with each choice being made, there are only ""n minus m"" possible futures remaining, where 'm' is a measure of how many futures that particular choice renders 'no longer possible'.",2024-03-21
">I think that arc is much better described as showing him becoming a true leader of a people despite starting from selfish motivations, than the arc of a villlain fulfilling his villainhood. 

Yup, I've already said that I agree with you that people are being reductive in calling Paul a villain. Just wanted to point out that both films also explicitly portrayed him as an initially selfish, sometimes very manipulative antihero (albeit an eventually tragic one) - so calling him a 'hero' isn't accurate either.

>it's not shown that he actually does anything wrong

Bruh, I've literally quoted the scenes where he's saying out loud that wants to lie to & manipulate a native people using a prophecy he KNOWS is fake, for the sake of his revenge, which he also knows could lead to a horrible galactic war killing billions. 

>reason to believe that's because he realises he wants to conduct a galactic genocide

I didn't say he WANTS to conduct a galactic genocide. I said that he was prioritising his personal revenge against the Harkonnens & the Emperor, IN SPITE of the risk of galactic genocide.

>he's foreseen that it's the only way for the Fremen to survive against a clearly evil enemy

I've already explained how he indeed didn't have a choice at THAT point (which is why it's tragic that he has to go back to manipulating the Fremen into becoming his fanatical followers, despite knowing that it would result in the galactic war). But I've also said that this is still a horrible end result (for even the Fremen, as per what Paul has seen in his visions regarding the coming war), and not some great triumph - AND that things wouldn't have reached this point where he had no other option, if he hadn't chosen to go down this path at the end of Part One, *despite knowing the risk*, for the sake of his revenge alone too back then.

>Do you only know this because of the books?

Has it been a long time since you watched Part One? After the Reverend Mother had tested Paul in that film, she speaks to Jessica, Paul overhears, and then Jessica explains what the Kwisatz Haderach is; She talks about how the BG have been mixing bloodlines for hundreds of years, trying to produce a mind that could bridge space & time, past & future, etc... and that some believe this being is already here. And then in Part Two, Jessica (after becoming a Reverend Mother herself) tells Paul that he would unlock his full potential as the KH by drinking the Water of Life, opening his mind etc. Both films say multiple times that the Fremen's Lisn Al Gaib prophecy was a fake/propaganda planted by the BG to control them - and yet Paul has abilities, he can see the future etc; the explanation for this given in both films was him being the Kwisatz Haderach, a person specifically bred over centuries to have these abilities.

>the film simply does not demonstrate that what has happened is bad

Also, both films had shown multiple times that if the Holy War happened, it's a VERY bad thing - spanning the galaxy, killing billions etc. Part Two showed that even the Fremen themselves would eventually get hit by a Famine or something because of it.

"This is either a troll comment, or your username is checking out lol.

1. The film outright SAYS from the beginning itself that the Fremen's 'Lisn Al Gaib' prophecy is fake propaganda planted by the Bene Gesserit to manipulate them, that the Fremen should only be led by one of their own etc.

2. Lady Jessica is clearly portrayed as malicious in how she fans religious fundamentalism amongst the vulnerable ones among the Fremen. 

3.Paul himself had said it was cruel what the BG's fake prophecy had done to the Fremen, and that if he WERE to seize religiopolitical power over them as their Messiah for his own agenda (revenge against the Harkonnens & the Emperor) or even partly for the Fremen's own good, his visions showed that in the long run it would make things WORSE for the entire galaxy (because of the Holy War it would eventually trigger across the galaxy - the Fremen themselves have no reason & nothing to gain from fighting such a war; they would be doing so ONLY out of fanaticism towards Paul). 

4. From the point when Paul embraces his fake Messiah status, Chani is clearly shown to feel betrayed by him. 

5. The movie even ends with the Holy War - which we've been told repeatedly is going to end horrifically for the entire galaxy - actually starting. All of these were a VERY unsubtle allegory for Western Imperialist powers fanning & empowering religious fundamentalists for the sake of their own agendas with them (stated purpose: ""liberating them with the gift of democracy"" 😇 ; actual purpose: ""the new rulers who we've put in power, will give us all their oil lol"" 😈... Though Paul's agenda is a little more grey - revenge plus the Fremen's immediate survival). No idea how you thought the movie was ""fellating the white savior trope & imperialism"" after all of THAT.

As for how it deconstructs the chosen one trope - the Lisn Al Gaib prophecy itself has been stated to be fake & planted by the BG for 2 movies now. Jessica & later Paul himself, are posing his ""science given"" Kwisatz Haderach powers to actually be a result of him being the ""chosen one of prophecy"". Note that the Kwisatz Haderach ISN'T a chosen one of FATE, but rather the planned eventual product of a centuries-long eugenics program by the Bene Gesserit.",2024-03-04
yep agree. His dune monologue was great.,2024-03-02
"The prophecy isn't real, as mentioned many times - it was planted by the Bene Gesserit as a means to manipulate the Fremen. 

Paul's abilities aren't because he's the Lisn al Gaib ""chosen by fate"", but because he's seemingly the Kwisatz Haderach, the result of a centuries-long, carefully planned eugenics program by the Bene Gesserit to create specifically such a being.

In Part One, at the ecological observatory Paul says that he would become the Fremen's Messiah (even though he clearly knew that the prophecy itself was just very old propaganda that had been passed on & amplified over generations) for the sake of gaining them as a powerful army to get revenge over the Harkonnens & the Emperor (& possibly even the Throne). Jessica starts to support this in Part Two, even more aggressively after she drank the Water of Life & her fetus starts seeing possible futures & communicating the same to her. Whereas Paul himself, after initially wanting to manipulate the Fremen, soon comes to genuinely care for Chani, Stilgar and all the other people of Sietch Tabr. 

Which is why after seeing visions that he would cause a terrible galaxy-spanning Holy War if he were to go South & ""follow his mother"", Paul was SO reluctant to ever go there. But Feyd's brutal destruction & massacre of Sietch Tabr, and the resultant pressure from everyone including Chani (""noone will leave for South until you go with them""), leaves him no choice but to go there & ""do what he must"" (which is yes, to actually seize religiopolitical power over all the Fremen as their Messiah; which is why Chani feels betrayed & even more angry at him from the war council scene onwards - although she was already mad at him for almost dying from drinking the Water of Life, & then his mother forcing Chani herself to confirm the prophecy she hated).

 It's also very possible that Paul intentionally laid there unconscious until Chani had done so - because we know from earlier in the film that those with Bene Gesserit training can neutralise poisons in their body. Either way, the prophecy isn't real, mainly because it had been confirmed multiple times across both films to just have been propaganda planted by the BG.",2024-03-01

Keep in mind I had not read the book yet. I text this with the book to my side as I am just not beginning to read it after watching the movie. However I believe you just misunderstood that scene. He is not complaining. He says that the baron was telling to kill him but they both knew that this would not happen. He doesn’t want to fight drugged soldiers. He wants a real fight 

Feyds character shows respect towards good fighters in the two instances where he does fight.

I think this comes down to an expectations getting into the way. From you reading the book first you expect certain things to happen, or you compare what happened in the movie vs the book. This is why I didn’t want to read the book before finishing the first books content in part 1 and 2

I do agree that rabban was done dirty. He ran and the one time he had to fight he didn’t stand a chance. I was expecting more.

The issue with this is that at this point in the story we already know that Paul is now essentially ""all-powerful"", or at the very least, well on his way to becoming so. It wouldn't be that far-fetched at all to assume Paul had already seen the exact outcome of the fight and/or what he had to do to actually achieve that result.


> That could've further shown Feyd's flaw in toying with his prey when he thinks he's beaten them and also elevated him to Paul level threat


But we did get that.


Remember when he fought in the arena and was cocky enough to remove his shield? And we also know how he's a sadist (we're told this numerous times) and how he enjoys pain, both to inflict and also endure (I think).


And what happens at the end? Paul allows him to get close because he knows Feyd will want to savor victory and his opponent's death because he derives sick pleasure from it. Feyd got too close and that's what allowed Paul to also deliver the fatal blow.",2024-03-12

"> It only raises the question of why aren't the Harks using nukes, or anyone else.


When it comes to the Baron etc, I guess the most obvious answer would be that it could deeply affect the harvesting of spice. When you consider that the harvesting of spice is instrumental in keeping things as they are in the universe of Dune, and without it humankind would likely go extinct, it would make all the sense in the world for using such a weapon anywhere on the planet to be straight up unthinkable, but that's just how I see it (haven't read the books, but have listened to a number of videos which go further in-depth about the events in all the books).


You also have to consider that the Baron (and everyone else) were grossly mistaken regarding the actual number of Fremen on the planet, not to mention how they also firmly believed that the entire south was uninhabitable, so seeing as their estimates were that there were only 50k Fremen or so alive, he just assumed that even Rabban would be enough to find them and wipe them out without needing to break out the heavy artillery.


One more thing that wasn't really mentioned in both films, which I found out shortly after part 1 came out and thought was a really cool piece of worldbuilding, is that when the Harkonnen showed up ""out of nowhere"" on Arrakis and decimated the Atreides' army and whatnot, that unprecedented(?) move was only made possible because the Baron paid an exorbitant amount to the Spacing Guild:


> **You could squeeze arrakis for everything its worth for 60 years and you'd just barely pay back what it cost to bring such a force to bear on the atreides**


With that in mind, you can imagine/understand why he wanted to so quickly go back to business, and to me at least it's as I said, would've been unthinkable for someone in his position to even think about using anything that could affect the amount of spice being harvested.",2024-03-09

Using nukes on people are like one of the biggest sins ever in the Dune universe. In the beginning of the book, when the Harks are planning their attack, Baron Hark says that the other houses might be upset about his attack, but they prob wouldn’t do anything. 

Feyd asks something like “Even if we used atomics?”

And Baron Hark says that that would be the one thing that would provoke severe punishment from the other houses. 

We’re not 100% sure *why* nukes on ppl are banned, but we can presume that this was an agreed upon standard between the houses in power. A line not to be crossed.

Things like him being able to ride the Grandfather worm on his first try were coincidences, & Chani being forced by Jessica (through the Voice) to wake Paul from his coma through her ""Desert Spring tears"" as per prophecy, could well have been him waiting for the right moment to ""finish transmuting the poison via his Bene Gesserit training"" (which he himself had mentioned was what Jessica had done during HER Water of Life ceremony).

"> I guess I was in the army and studied military history a lot that commanders are never ever charging in the front. Even being in the vanguard unit is crazy but literally the first person leading the charge? Lol, no. Just takes me out of the movie. Even the most daring military commanders who fought alongside men were never the first person you would see. Gurley leading the suicide charge or Paul charging into Sardaukar lines as the first guy, it's so unrealistic to the point that it takes me out of it a little.


I cannot speak in regards to military experience as I have none, but what we do know based on the films is that the Fremen are extremely honorable, as seen with the whole Amtal thing where they're ready to die on the spot if that ends up being the outcome, and they also know how their death will only lead to their water being returned to the well.


The Fremen seem to simply be that kind of tribe, not only have they always(?) lived in such an extreme, harsh environment, they've also been oppressed and hunted for decades, and it seems they're a type of tribe where you absolutely must pull your own weight otherwise you're just, quite literally, ""water"".


So with that in mind, I see no issue whatsoever with everyone taking to battle, because they're ready to die for their cause and beliefs at every turn, and this goes for Stilgar and pretty much countless others.


Paul leading the charge, especially the last one, is not an issue at all when you take into account that he can (and has) seen the future, so he knows he won't die then and there and he's free to do whatever he wants.


I think we see him leading the charge for cinematic purposes, I don't imagine him taking to the actual frontlines because that seems like the role Chani took on instead, mirroring his holy war vision late into the first film, where he was the one fighting instead.


So I imagine that the Fremen cleared the path all the way to the Emperor so that Paul could make his way there effortlessly, as that was the primary goal.


Gurley is also an extremely experienced fighter, iirc might even be the best in the whole of Calladan (but don't quote me on that). What we see at the end with him and Rabban, that might've arguably been the very last stretch of the assault on the Harkonnen, he might not have been on the frontlines the entire time.


But even if he was, we already know why that is, he stated earlier in the film how he stayed behind on Arrakis because he wanted the blood, he wanted the fight. He was not gonna let anyone else have Rabban's head if he could help it, and if he died in the process he would absolutely not give a single fuck for sure.


With Paul's case in particular, it's an instance where he has to be the one leading everyone into battle. Not only does he want to, he also has to, especially as this newly arrived Messianic figure, there's just no way around that plot point from the moment he joins the Fremen.


You also gotta bear in mind that when he first joins the Fremen, Paul isn't just a ""regular"" human, he's been trained in a multitude of arts including that of ""mentat"", which is what gives him such a powerful analytical mind that is instrumental to his leadership/warfare capabilities, and all this without even taking into account the prescience that he obtains afterwards.


> The usage forbidden thing wasn't really established in the movie from what I understand. I could be wrong.


It wasn't, but I'll copy paste this from another comment I left before:


> Atomics harbored a pronounced psychological and social stigma, and were rarely used due to traumatic historical events. **Their prohibition was enforced by the Great Convention, which dictated that the offensive use of atomics is grounds for planetary annihilation.**


> The destruction of part of the Shield Wall by Paul Atreides just prior to the Battle of Arrakeen, which led to the defeat of the forces of House Harkonnen and the Sardaukar, and the the Ascension of House Atreides. **By using them on the shield wall, and not directly on the opposition forces, Paul was able to circumvent the Great Convention, paving the way for his ascension.**




> What you're saying would makes sense but we really haven't seen much fight from the Sardaukar at all. Correct me if I'm wrong.


IIRC, the other thing to take into account is that the Sardaukar are wholly unprepared to fight against the Fremen. In the first film, we saw the Sardaukar easily overpowering the Atreides, towards the end of the film, they're easily owned by the Fremen because they're fighting on their homeworld where they take advantage of the sand and all of their environment.


They might appear weak, but they aren't, it's just that the most formidable force in the universe happens to be the Fremen, and the Sardaukar never had a chance to properly engage with them in battle, especially when faced with that unthinkable display of desert power at the end of Part 2. They're just powerless in the face of all of that as they were completely blindsided.


The other thing also, which wasn't in the film, is that I believe that Paul passed on some of his exclusive training, ""Weirding Way"" (you can read about it on the Wikia), to the Fremen, which made them all the more deadlier, a technique that also contributed immensely to them overpowering the Sardaukar and whatever else that stood in their way during the Holy War.

">Even still, once Siech Tabr was attacked the choice wasn’t so easy.

Things wouldn't have reached this lose-lose (or 'lesser of 2 horrible outcomes') scenario in the first place if he hadn't decided to manipulate the Fremen for his revenge in the first place though. 

I've already mentioned myself that AFTER this point, the story is more of an antihero's tragedy (him beginning to genuinely care for Chani & the Fremen in the preceding months, leading him to change his mind about the initial, more selfish plan makes it even sadder), than Paul being a total villain.

>Or he could intervene. Intervening would save the Fremen and grant him revenge, though it might lead to the Galaxy-spanning genocide.

""Save the Fremen"" - if it wasn't for his, Jessica's & the Bene Gesserit's religious manipulation, the Fremen aren't at all the sort of people who would choose a life as ""lesser beings"" (friends reduced to followers, blindly fanatical fundamentalists gleefully killing billions & dying in the millions for a lying foreigner) over near-certain honorable death. So he's only ""saving"" them from the more imminent physical dangers... after dooming them himself to either this or a galactic Holy War much earlier.

>I don’t know whether revenge or love motivated his choice at that point,

At that point, it was more just him choosing the ""seemingly more bearable of 2 horrible outcomes"", and perhaps minimising casualties with super-prescient Kwisatz Haderach Paul as The Emperor himself. Revenge had put him on this path to begin with, at the end of Part One and the first act of Part Two. Love had taken him off of it (and made him fear it), during the second act of Part Two. Post-Water of Life, 'immediate survival' seems to have been the main motivation (he says he loves Chani even at the end, but he immediately follows this up with what is most necessary to maximise the chances & numbers for survival - asking Irulan's hand in marriage).

>maybe he thought in any case he could escape starting the Jihad.

Why would he need to ""think"" that he 'could escape' the Jihad, when he can see all possible futures now and KNOW that he won't be able to do so... Not if he chose this path anyway.

"Yeah, the main point of Dune is that it's a cautionary tale against charismatic leaders and messianic figures, as well as a subversion of the hero's journey. The movie makes this even more obvious than the book did. 

Think about what actually happened in the movie. The prophecy about the Lisan al-Gaib was literally propaganda made up by the Bene Gesserit that allows them to take advantage of the Fremen. The entire movie Jessica is basically just fanning the flames of fanaticism and propping up Paul as a prophet, even though he's actually a false prophet. Paul and Jessica are the ultimate manipulators. They are taking advantage of the Fremen for their own political gain and leading them into a holy war, and using them to establish Paul as the new emperor. 

On a surface level, it's easy to root for Paul, because he is fighting against the fascist Harkonnens, but on closer inspection, Paul is a tyrannical false prophet. He has good intentions at the start, but once he drinks the water of life he loses his identity and humanity, undergoes the spice change, and becomes a completely different person. He is no longer Paul after he drinks the water of life, he is the Kwisatz Haderach at that point.

>The other houses reject Paul, presumably because he basically usurped the throne from the emperor. A man, presumably thought to be dead, shows up at the head of a terrorist army and hostages the most valuable material in the known universe, spice, in order to leverage himself into power. Its not a surprise that the Great Houses refuse to accept this.

The power balance between the Shipping Guild, the BG, the Great Houses (Atreadis, Harkonnen et all), and the Emperor isn't something that's discussed a lot in the movie, but it's a real thing and the entire reason the Emperor tries to kill off the Atreadis in the first place- he fears House Atreadis is getting too powerful and could at some point in the future threaten him by getting a group of houses together.  ""ape strong together.""

So the idea is reasonable that the houses would think to stand together against Paul when he's litteraly threatening a permanent end to the galactic order with the threat of 'accept me or I'll nuke the spice fields.'  Now, in the context of the movie you might think they'd at least negotiate a little, or maybe Paul would slow down and say something like 'listen, you don't really have a choice here.'

And that gets to Nkyaxs' second point about the cause of the jihad in the book: none is ever given.  Thus, in the movie Denis chooses to use the rejection of Paul by the Houses as the spark that starts the holocaust Paul has feared/triggered.",2024-03-06
"> If you could answer one more... why did the other houses reject Paul even though he was a Duke and had the Emperors (forced) cooperation?

--

> Also, what war is there to be fought ?? Hark leaders are dead, and the emperor captured ? Are the other houses just pissed about the whole thing ? I feel like in the next movie (I'm not buying this being the last movie for a second), they have a lot of lore to flesh out about who's the next threat.


This requires a bit of inference, because the movie deviates slightly from the books, so I can't quite assure that this is correct. 

The other houses reject Paul, presumably because he basically usurped the throne from the emperor. A man, presumably thought to be dead, shows up at the head of a terrorist army and hostages the most valuable material in the known universe, spice, in order to leverage himself into power. Its not a surprise that the Great Houses refuse to accept this.

Interestingly, the Great Houses themselves arrived in belief that the Emperor had overstepped his authority and was seizing power from the Harkonnens. They weren't acting in the interest of the Emperor, but in insurance of their own power and survival against the Emperor (or the position of). Paul could also reveal that the Emperor had taken part in the destruction of House Atreides and used that in justification for his revenge of the Emperor, as that is the same issue that the other Great Houses have with the Emperor. In this scenario at least, it seems like that wouldn't be enough to solidify his claim to the throne as the war still goes on.

In the movie, the great war, Jihad, that Paul envisions is almost explicitly laid out as the war between the Great Houses/rival planets and the Freman because of this issue: Paul's ascension to the throne; however, this is not exactly the case in the book. Rather, the Jihad is never actually shown and only referred to in the books as it takes place between books 1 and 2. Honestly, there's always been discussion on what the exact, underlying reason for it, but for the most part, many people agree that a large reason was the consolidation of Paul's power as Emperor. Villeneuve simply highlighted and pinned that reason as the primary cause of the war. Personally, I appreciate the change and think this choice made the most sense narratively, given the slight changes that between the book and movie.",2024-03-06

">specifically chooses the path with the least amount of harm. It’s the only choice he can make morally because he has no agency, he’s a leader completely chosen by fate

Here's the thing though: a Holy War spanning the galaxy that kills BILLIONS is still a ""helluva lot of harm"". It's probably even MORE harm than all Fremen (population of millions) being wiped out, and the BG being in control of 'Emperor Feyd'.

But even MORE importantly: Paul only sees ""every possible future"" from the point AFTER he drank the Water of Life. He (& Jessica) had already by then made a significant number of Fremen into his fanatical followers. The video (& the movies) had shown us that in the ecological observatory scene in Part One that Paul had initially decided to become the Fremen's fake Messiah primarily for his own agenda alone (revenge against the Harkonnens & the Emperor), DESPITE being aware of the possibility of the Holy War down that path. No mention of it being what's better for the Fremen at all in that scene.

It's only after he had spent time with Chani & his friends at Sietch Tabr that he started to genuinely care for them (but Jessica was still converting many into his followers at the time). Note that it was only the dumb Rabban who was put in charge of Arrakis initially too - the Fremen were more than capable of evading attacks from him & surviving. It was only because of the sheer extent of spice production being disrupted under 'Muad'Dib' that Rabban gets replaced by Feyd in Part Two, Sietch Tabr gets massacred, Paul is forced to go South & drink the Water of Life (& seeing that at THIS point, it was either him & the Fremen getting wiped out, or him seizing Religiopolitical power over the Fremen, becoming Emperor & triggering the Holy War, which were the only options) etc.

The point is: in Part One, if Paul had merely left the planet (as Jessica even suggests in the end - asking Stilgar to get them in touch with smugglers), instead of joining the Fremen with the intention of weaponising their faith for HIS revenge, NONE of the events of Part Two would have happened. Fremen would continue to be oppressed, but the majority would definitely have survived in the South at least. Feyd & especially the Emperor wouldn't have arrived at Arrakis. But MOST of all, *billions* of deaths across the galaxy could have been avoided. Paul is considered an antihero because it was primarily his initial desire for revenge that led to it being impossible to save the Fremen (& himself) WITHOUT triggering the Holy War.",2024-03-07

"> why did paul have to drink worm poison? to futile the prophecy?

oh boy oh boy the movie barely scratches the surface of this

so, BG have a ritual where they drink it, then while it is inside their body alter their body chemistry in a way that very very slightly alters the poison in a way that transforms it from a 100% lethal poison to a very powerful psychoactive drug that unlocks a ""genetic memory"" and sort of shared awareness

the fremen religion has the same ritual because the BG taught it to them because the BG basically created their religion as mostly a copy of BG practices so that if a stray BG needed to assimilate into their culture and religious heirarchy they could do it easily

in the sort of ""awareness space"" the water of life unlocks there are some areas that no BG/RM has ever been able to explore successfully

Big Gender Time: the BG are a female only order and rarely teach their skills to boys, but Paul of course has been taught all their skills from birth because he's our special boy. for whatever reason the BG theorize that if a boy could do the WoL trick, he would be able to see parts of the ""awareness space"" that they never could. however, because boys are inherently not as good at manipulating their body chemistry as girls, every time one tries, he fucks up and the poison just kills him. so the BG initiate a centuries long eugenics project to create a boy smart enough that he can actually do the trick.

that's what ""the Kwisatz Haderach"" means... a boy who can drink Water of Life without dying

Paul knows all of this from the beginning of the movie but ""dun want it"". then when Sietch Tabr gets blown up he's like ""welp either I accept all this power or deal with me and my family getting blown up because I could have gotten the power to stop that and chose not to"". 

ps: the most jarring ""no they would not fucking do that "" moment for me in the movie was when Jessica throws up against her will, a BG would not do that

> could he command people with his voice? or could he see visions?

Paul could do Voice back in the first movie, it's something pretty much all BG can do and his mom teaches it to him.

after he drinks the Water of Life he becomes literally omniscient

this *does* have the side effect of making him *better* at the Voice because that ability is based on understanding other people so well you know a perfect tone that will control them, but he could do back in Part 1 already and this is pretty secondary next to the whole omniscience thing",2024-03-04

1. the kwisatz haderach is a goal that causes the  bene geserit’s to treat humanity as cattle, for millenniums.  Their immense plan is literally wrecked at the last minute by Jessica’s having a boy: Paul.  Their literally plan failed because they needed a girl.

What with the massive breeding project, there are lots of potential KHs. Paul is the first to get across the finish line.  Shades of the sperm and the egg really.  Honestly one of Herbert’s best subtle metaphors in my opinion. 

2.  The messianic prophesy.  In the books it is very much more explicit.  The prophesy is there because the bene geserite (BG) have intentionally made sure all the poor people have a messianic story to call upon. Every planet and every culture, not matter where in an entire galaxy, the poor people have a messianic story at the ready. 

it’s a tool carefully and specifically seeded as soon as possible.  The BG literally call the BGs whose job it to seed the messianic story “missionaria protectiva”,  really damn near pig Latin that name.

any BG who finds herself in these seeded cultures, has a range of techniques specifically taught, that allow her to take over the messianic story to her advantage….aka protection.  


to call the messianic prophesy a self fulfilling prophesy would be saying the cold reading was prophesy.   


 The messianic prophesy is left so nebulous that any BG can use the story at anytime and in any way they need. If You the BG, need a Moses, a Merlin, a Christ, a Buddha, a Muhammad, a John smith, a Hubbard, a Jim jones, a Tammy Fae, etc etc… you can manipulate the story to include what you need.

to give a different version of what a successful self fulfilling prophesy might looks like  I recommend scalzi’s “the android dream”  

# tldr

the quote unquote messianic prophesy is literally horse shit. There is no connection to Paul, Jessica, or the kwisatz haderach.  Is just literally a tool built,  to allow any BG to seize control of a population. 

the  kwisatz haderach Is the breeding program.  There are a bunch of people who could have been the KH. Paul is the first over the line.

I think they meant it as a lie. But I think something about the planet or the people of the planet itself implanted the idea in the order.,2024-04-08
They say it in passing in the first movie but I think it was important to get some manipulation on-screen to make it  completely unambiguous to the audience that Paul isn't an actual mystical chosen one,2024-03-04
I think they brought it more to the forefront because a lot of people somehow missed that the whole savior thing wasnt meant to be good. Jessica being more evil and Chani explicitly stating that the religion is there to control them make it harder for people to miss the message,2024-03-06
[deleted],2024-03-06
"I don't think I agree, the prophecy is pretty explicitly a lie.  The entire religion is manufactured to give the Bene Gessert a lever over the Fremen, and Paul seizes the lever and uses it to gain power.

Jessica's role in this movie is to encourage the religion and help it grow, something that wouldn't be needed if this was a true mystical prophecy being fulfilled.  Paul 'fulfills' the prophecy, because the prophecy was twisted by Jessica to make sure it happened.  That doesn't mean Paul is an actual Chosen One.",2024-03-12
Good. That is a major part of the books.  Every thing about the messianic prophesy is bullshit in the book.  Everything about the bloodline breeding manipulation is horrifically true.,2024-04-01

"I think the evolution of Stilgar across the two movies captures that emotion you're describing.

He's a gruff no-nonsense leader in part 1, and then his religious side leads him to being the comic relief in the first half of part 2... but while his delivery never changes the laughter in my theater got more awkward and forced and by the end of the movie it had died out completely.  It's supposed to be troubling to see such a capable human fall completely into blind fanaticism and the movie doesn't pull any punches on it.",2024-03-04
"The first book literally has an excerpt in-universe about how Paul would end up killing families, women, and children for his rise to the throne (among other excerpts detailing other messed up stuff he does). It was very clear in the first book, it's just that a lot of people lack reading comprehension (or glossed over it). He made Messiah almost exclusively because people didn't understand the message unless Paul directly said, ""I'm like Genghis Khan and that other mustache dictator, but way worse.""",2024-03-05

Are there any actual good estimates that put them at 800+ mph?  I just looked it up and saw an estimate that they were going around 75mph, which is fast, but apparently sand that is being fluidized is nearly frictionless, so it doesn't seem that ""unrealistic"".

I guess to be honest, the worm travel looked good I didn't lose suspension of disbelief, although we'll see if I have the same problem on future re-watches.  I did think the one scene were we see Stilgar going seemingly very fast was a bit too fast, but other scenes they seemed slower, so I don't really know...",2024-03-14

Didn’t this film reframe those visions as him communing with (his vision of) his ‘spirit’ through the Spice?,2024-03-05

He was phenomenal. A fantastic comedic bit that was also totally believable in the context of the film and didn’t take you out of the immersion at all. Masterfully done.,2024-03-04

Straight up Life of Brian style too,2024-03-21
This was the first thing it came to my mind when I saw that scene and for the remainder of the movie every time he hyped Paul I would laugh,2024-03-03
Wouldn’t bet against this not having been what inspired Villneuve for this scene.,2024-03-10
"It didn't even occur to me to find it funny while watching, I just found it sad how utterly brain washed he was by the Bene Gesserit, and thinking how guilty it must make Paul feel every time. I do see the humour now people mention it, but you're right it's not just that.",2024-03-24
"Yeah, I'm glad they portrayed both the disturbing cult side and the innate absurdity of the fanaticism.",2024-03-18
"It can be a bad thing. And no, not every movie needs levity to make the dramatic stuff hit harder. .. What kind of Marvel idiotic shit statement is that?


And it can also be a bad thing if its the wrong character to bring the levity. 


This movie is more popular because shit goes down and it has more closure, not because of the levity. ",2024-03-07
general audiences,2024-03-18
Good point. My question still stands as to how they are gonna develop his character from here on ,2024-03-03
"Anya Taylor Joy's character is born during the events of Dune and is basically a genius space witch toddler. She gets kidnapped which is why the Fremen attack the Emperor, also she's the one that kills the Baron with the space witch needle

Chani follows Paul the whole way instead of being opposed to him. Last scene implies she's gonna rise up against Paul which is way off track to the plot of Messiah",2024-03-10
"I mean also the fact that, we dont know for sure that he is NOT the messiah. Why are there so many non-believers in here",2024-03-07
That’s a better argument. Start with that. My comment is specifically on the first part of your first comment.,2024-03-01
"This version of Stilgar is largely present in Messiah, so I'm sure this would be a large part of the 3rd movie.",2024-03-01
"I am bothered by some of the comments I've seen around here seeming, sometimes, to celebrate Fayd as somehow the ""least evil Harkonnen"" (lol?) but, with that said:

The one very interesting thing about him was that he uses a concept of honor to maintain self-control and prevent himself from falling into psychotic chaos (that's my read on him), but because he is in fact a psychopath, he also sees honor as a game, a bizarre funny falsehood.

Him repeating ""may your knife chip and shatter"" gave me chills because he was at once both entering into Paul's (and the fremen's) system of honor, full-heartedly giving respect for what he recognized as a system for maintaining control, AND mocking it as a joke, all at the same time.

And Butler did a really good job letting all that show in his manner and facial expressions.",2024-03-03
And that ending is actually a major aspect of historically combat.   The side that collapses first gets slaughtered.,2024-04-01
"During the spice harvester raid I kept thinking how exhausted they must be from full sprinting and fighting through all that deep sand, that shit is no joke and they were **going**",2024-04-03
Yeah I’m pretty sure I came a little when I watched it today.,2024-03-05
That doesn't contradict what they said.,2024-03-24
Triple twirl was the dumbest part of the entire movie,2024-03-21
"I don’t think the point is that it ruined the fight, it’s that it’s not technical and grimy, and I agree. I don’t know what you are talking about, it was pretty flashy stuff.",2024-03-03
Why are you acting like what he said was wrong. You said it wasn't overly choreographed and he told that indeed it was..... Then act like child when he pointed it out.,2024-03-03
His fights are amazing,2024-03-18
She didn't expect Paul to be the one to suggest it and be so upfront about it. She probably figured she would have to manipulate the situation but the fact that Paul is the one dictating the terms takes away her own initiative.,2024-03-04
"Yes, but not which guy. Took her a moment to recover from thinking she was shacking up with Feyd after he stabbed Paul twice a few seconds ago.",2024-03-14
"“Now, if you excuse me, I have to go ride a different worm.”",2024-03-10
"Not only can he see his own death, he sees countless variations of his own death in different ways. His vision isn't completely perfect however, some of the characters from the book cut from the movie highlight his blind spots and the limitations of his foresight, which he becomes more aware of and tries to work around it as a result.   
For example, an important aspect of his threat to destroy the spice that is made explicit in the book is that without spice everyone addicted to it will die of withdrawal and all the prescience will be blinded. The consequences of his threats are far more devastating and far reaching than in the movie version, even if they would lead to the death of him and everyone around him.",2024-03-02
"The way it builds up over the movie was incredible. He started it falling in love with Chani, saying that what he wanted was simply to be her equal, resisting the prophecy and his mother's words about needing to save himself for a political marriage, then he ended it by fully committing to everything he had originally wanted to avoid and becoming a full blown religious leader.",2024-03-03
"The best mindfuck about his ability in the movies (I don’t know if it’s in the books, I’ve only read a little of the first one) is his relationship with Jamis who’s apparently his best friend who taught him a lot of the Fremen ways, he still thinks of Jamis’s advice when making important decisions.



You know, Jamis, the guy he killed when they first met.



After the Water of Life, his abilities are amplified a million fold. How many friends like Jamis does he have in there with him now?",2024-03-05
"The book does include one person who can understand Paul in that scene, Lady Fenring's husband.

Here is a quote from the book right after Feyd Rautha's death:  
>Slowly, Fenring moved his head, a prolonged turning until he faced Paul.  
>
>""Do it!"" the Emperor hissed.  
>
>The Count focused on Paul, seeing with eyes his Lady Margot had trained in the Bene Gesserit ways aware of the mystery and hidden grandeur about this Atreides youth.  
>
>*I could kill him*, Fenring thought -- and he knew this for the truth.  
>
>Something in his own secretive depths stayed the Count then, and he glimpsed briefly, inadequately, the advantage he held over Paul -- a way of hiding from the youth, a furtiveness of person and motives that no eye could penetrate.  
>
>Paul, aware of some of this from the way the time nexus boiled, understood at last why he had never seen Fenring along the webs of prescience. Fenring was one of the might-have-beens, an almost Kwisatz Haderach, crippled by a flaw in the genetic patterns -- a eunach, his talent concentrated into furtiveness and inner seclusion. A deep compassion for the Count flowed through Paul, the first sense of brotherhood he'd ever experienced.  
>
>Fenring, reading Paul's emotion, said, ""Majesty, I must refuse.""

I would also clarify that Paul doesn't quite see ""everything"":  

The book includes epigraphs before each chapter that are written as in universe historical texts written by Princess Irulan. This one comes while Paul and Jessica are fleeing into the desert:  
>Muad'Dib could indeed, see the Future, but you must understand the limits of
this power. Think of sight. You have eyes, yet cannot see without light. If you
are on the floor of a valley, you cannot see beyond your valley. Just so,
Muad'Dib could not always choose to look across the mysterious terrain. He tells
us that a single obscure decision of prophecy, perhaps the choice of one word
over another, could change the entire aspect of the future. He tells us ""The
vision of time is broad, but when you pass through it, time becomes a narrow
door."" And always, he fought the temptation to choose a clear, safe course,
warning ""That path leads ever down into stagnation.""

"The BG aren’t calling him an abomination, he’s their messiah they’re just pissed they can’t control him. They’re calling his unborn sister abomination.

She’s an amalgamation of every one of them at war in her head at all times, what mind she does have will have to chart this corse. She’s the abomination.  ",2024-03-08

"Is this just a case of manifest destiny / self-fulfilling prophecy? What if he didn't drink the poison and didn't see? Does one of the alternates happen instead - supposedly the paths with more deaths? So since he can see all the paths and the paths are written, how difficult can it be to execute the one he decides is the least awful, since it's pre-destined? This wasn't done well in the film at all.",2024-03-05
This is some Attack on Titan shit,2024-03-10
Jessica even warns him of becoming too attached to Chani early in the film. She tell him to save his marriage for a political purpose.,2024-03-19
"It feels like even less of choice, because he would still have to keep fighting Harkonnens and as we saw eventually they will stop underestimating the Fremen and really come to wipe them out. At some point he would have to stand up and be the guy.",2024-03-04
"Huh, that’s a good view. It seemed odd to me because I was thinking “why didn’t he just fight the Harkonen, let the great houses know about the betrayal, but not try and seize the throne directly.” But if the holy war was the best path, then, well, makes a lot of sense why he did it",2024-03-05
"He doesn’t sterilise every planet in his jihad, some come to his side more readily than others and a part of that is the legitimacy that Irulan provides.

"I wish they would have done it without just making it romance drama, though. 

It took up a lot of time that mught have been spent talking about WHY all of this stuff is going on. 

The time compression also hurts a lot imo. Compressing literally YEARS worth of progress into the span of like, 4 months is pretty insane.",2024-03-04
"I'm coming around on Chani being the characterization of Paul's inner monologues from the books, but the whole marriage vs love thing is still handled poorly. It's a recurring thing in the story. Duke Leto loved Jessica but didn't marry her to keep his political options available.

"Just watched both for the first time this week.

The first movie had nearly zero story. It's like the entire movie is exposition without explanation. Some paragraphs at the start ala Star Wars to explain the status of things before we begin would have helped a lot. 

Characters had zero reason to care for them and then they're killed off. The doctor's betrayal isn't telegraphed in a meaningful way, nor is it satisfying when he gets his instant karma for his treason at the hands of a faction he should *know* not to trust to keep a deal in good faith. Duncan is set up as this amazing warrior and boy was that character wasted given the time establishing him and the vision of his death. The ""voice"" gets these big scenes but has nearly zero payoff in either movie.

The second movie had too many ""vignettes"" of the progression of Paul joining the Fremen without any satisfying character development. Paul is really flat, IMO, until he takes the water of life. That's like 4 hours of film with a character that is barely surface level because, as I understand it, the book does all of this growth internally and doesn't translate without narration.

The films are beautiful, and sound amazing, but it feels like there's an entire iceberg of missing information beyond what we get, yet there's so much bloat of long shots of desert and visions of Chani not speaking. At least the Emperor's daughter gets a journal to narrate her thoughts. Something like that for Paul would have gone a long way to deepening the attachment and growth.",2024-03-31

Children of Dune is entertaining and I would say more entertaining than Messiah it adds to the lore by telling us what happens with Paul's sister and it is somehow similar to the first book. 

Strictly speaking about the film I can see why it would need to end on Messiah. It ends Paul journey and it is a closing to his jihad and aspirations. The rest of books excluding Children I dont think would make a good movie, but who knows.",2024-03-21

"I wanted to respond to this again, especially this part -

> He knows if he gets closer to death he'll bring more emotions out of her. He still does love her and needs her to really cherish his existence.

What emotions do you think Paul is trying to ""bring out""? Why do presume that I don't understand his feelings for her haven't changed? Why do you think Chani does not ""cherish his existence""?

IDK this just reads like some weird red pill rhetoric, like Paul is just using Chani in a cynical sociopathic sort of way like the Bene Gesserit used all the people that led to his creation.

One of the whole conceits of Paul's character is that he's both mortal but cursed with near-omniscience. He just wants to chill with his friends in the desert and be Chani's partner, but instead he is called to walk the golden path in order to break the stranglehold that people like the Bene Gesserit and the Harkonnens had over the galaxy.

Chani is basically the only relationship he can be real in. To suggest that he would violate that by manipulating Chani goes against what I see as fundamental aspects of his character and the overall story vis a vis the duality of contentment and purpose.",2024-03-03
I've read through the first 6 books so I'm aware of where the story goes. I don't remember him ever doing anything from an angle of emotionally manipulating Chani.,2024-03-01

"Denis movies really reward repeat viewings. He packs a lot of detail that is often quite subtle into the films.

This whole fight is setup over the course of both movies in many ways.

For instance:

The first time Paul kills a man, it is in a fair fight where he is almost matched, and he almost dies because he tries to let Jamis yield. Then his killing blow is quick, near-instant. No flourish, death, job done.

This is contrasted with the introduction of Feyd who routinely kills for pleasure against people who are no match to him, and he draws the moment out to both increase the suffering of his opponent and the spectacle of the fight.

As others have noted, the Feyd / Paul fight is foreshadowed in Paul's training fight with Gurney, Paul lands a ""killing blow"" on Gurney's neck, but Gurney also has a ""killing blow"" on Paul's abdomen. In the Feyd / Paul fight, Paul takes Gurney's place, deflects the blow to his neck, and uses the knife Feyd had stabbed him with to deliver the killing blow to Feyd's abdomen.",2024-03-08

"Honestly that's a pretty fucked up interpretation.

He doesn't have perfect future vision. The books discuss, and the movie makes clear, that his visions are only glimpses. 

He was able to kill Feyd only by taking the wound. He saw the dagger in his side in the vision and assumed that was a future where he died, but then in the moment it happened he realized it was the thing he needed to best Feyd.",2024-03-05

"But the Fremen are even better, and Paul is considered one of their best fighters; he has been trained by the Fremen, the Bene Gesserit, and the best of the Atreides.

The fact that a simple Atreides soldier who had been kept captive gave Feyd almost as good of a fight felt out of sync.

"While they never get into what he knows going into that specific fight, they do say a few times throughout how Paul sees *potential* fututes, even using the word branches IIRC.

If you mean Feyd vs Paul, Feyd manages to turn Paul's blade against himself for the the stab into Paul's abdomen,  so he retains his own blade, which Paul eventually deflects into his shoulder to bait him close, while Paul then pulls out the blade stuck in his side, stabbing and killing Feyd in one motion again.",2024-03-11

"The whole point, which is explained better in the books of course, is that Paul sees the only way to win is to play into Rauthas weaknesses. Paul lets him think he wins the fight by allowing himself to get stabbed in a non-lethal place which makes Rautha relax for a split second.

I’m gonna need someone else to chime in, I don’t remember seeing him remove a dagger from his side (because he does it off screen as he’s being stabbed in the shoulder and quickly stabs Elvis in one motion presumably).

The Brian Herbert/ Kevin Anderson books made it Canon that Gaius Helen Mohaium is Jessica’s mother. Although a lot of Dune fans don’t accept their books as Canon.,2024-03-01
I think it's confirmed in the appendices by Ghanima. I think Jessica also refers to her as mother but that happens before she could even know the blood relation and is just calling her mother because she is a Reverend Mother and played a significant role in her training.,2024-03-02

"It’s one of those things you notice the absence of when you’ve read the books, but just looking at the movies, it doesn’t really impact the overall plot. The first movie doesn’t show that much of Thufir, at least not enough to convey how important of an asset he was to the Atreides, and why the Baron kept him alive. At that point in the book he pretty much just helps to develop the Baron’s own schemes to take power.",2024-03-02

"It's kinda hard to convey internal conflict of what Paul wants and how his actions, to him, are the most ""benevolent"".  I wished we had a bit more of Paul being almost bitter about what he's doing post water of life.",2024-03-04
"That’s a good catch and actually I think an important distinction. I would just disagree that it wasn’t intended. It seems that’s exactly what DV intended, and I kind of disagree with that portrayal because we know his internal struggle is greater in the books, or at least he realizes he must embrace it as the best path forward for reduction in cost of human lives.",2024-03-05
So basically he’s seeing like thousands of years into the future and misinterpreting it as an imminent problem?,2024-03-07
"That is true, he definitely wants revenge. Those comments from Jessica about your father would want revenge, and then he said something about not being his father. And ya the war was inevitable after he had helped the Fremen cripple spice production. I just thought he should have had a conversation with his “love” and partner Chani to attempt to explain himself. At a minimum.",2024-03-06
Yeah the Reverend Mother tells Irulan that one way or another her father will lose the throne (unless she marries Paul). War is coming regardless.,2024-03-07
"Definitely agree that it’s much more interesting than the simple hero arc. In my opinion, the books do not do as good a job of leaning into the villain as DV does here. Probably why he very much explicitly has Chani be a vocal opposition, and maybe the lack of guilt and remorse Paul has in the books. I always felt like Paul was sympathetic in the book, that he really doesn’t have a choice in being the savior because he can see the path with the least amount of death and destruction, even though the path still has a lot of death and destruction. Something that wasn’t really explained in the movie, probably intentionally.",2024-03-04
"There are a couple reasons why I think we need a little bit more. 1) Chani is supposed to be his love and partner. But he doesn’t even attempt to explain or talk to her post water of life. They don’t have a single conversation before the final confrontation with Feyd. That’s just unrealistic between two people who love each other. But perhaps it’s because Paul as the KH knows exactly the future so doesn’t feel the need? Idk seems more like the tired plot device of not communicating just so there’s conflict. 
2) Lots of people said Dune pt1 had nothing happen in it, but that’s because it was so dense with information and one line dialogue that’s actually important, but it never breathes and let the information sink or be rehashed. This is common with book adaptations, trying to cover so much story in a shorter time. And I feel like this is exactly what happened here. Like the water of life is the pivotal moment of Paul’s journey, and it’s like at the 2 hr mark already? It’s a sprint to the finish after that scene and I think delving into what the change actually did and means would be more impactful to the tragic hero story.",2024-03-13
I've never read the books and I pretty much picked up on everything the movies had to offer (watched dune 1 and dune 2 back to back) and yeah there are so many small things that the movie never even mentions which don't make too much sense without looking it up online. Like in the movies it's never explicitly mentioned that everyone uses swords because shields can deflect projectiles,2024-03-06
The main issue here is how will you convert soliloquies and internal musings into live action? Very easy to judge and not come up with solutions,2024-03-10
"I felt like the Dune did a good enough job illustrating that Paul didn’t really want a universal jihad. He wanted to survive, and he wanted to avenge his father and kill the Harkonnens, understandable and relatable I thought. And I thought there was enough inner dialogue about his “terrible purpose” and disgust with the BG to satisfy me that things were getting beyond his control. He was thrown into a rushing river, pushing forward and he could only navigate the path he saw as best when he finally understood where the river was leading. 

Honestly, I like Messiah, but it did feel a little self pitying.  Paul is understandably upset because of all the death and the loss of Fremen life, etc. But we/ he never offered or saw another path. I think he is mainly bitter in Messiah because of the lack of real, meaningful choice he had.",2024-03-15
And DV even said that he tried to be faithful to Frank's vision and included aspects from Messiah that Frank put in to clarify how he felt Paul should be viewed.,2024-03-18
"Yeah, his next movie is supposedly Rendezvous with Rama. Then Dune Messiah, which should easily get the green light based on how well Part 2 has been received.",2024-03-03
Pretty sure he said he wants Timothee to age a bit so he's not so teenagerish in Messiah.,2024-03-03
Quite a lot of time also passes between Dune and Messiah. It would make sense to let the actors age up a bit first and give him a break to refresh himself with another project,2024-03-04

"They're leveraging the spacing guild. There might be orbital defenses but there aren't massive fleets. The feudal set up is due to the nature of space travel which is extremely risky without advance system to prevent disasters. They way they have is to make navigators which are humans flooded with spice. They mutate and gain limit future sight to navigate. No spice, then no galactic civilization and every trip is a massive risk.

The machines that fold space means a large fleet isn't that efficient. they can appear behind your defensive lines. You'd need to place defenses around your gravity well. So large fleets aren't that necessary, more planetary defenses. 

Like the mass effect reapers which isolated systems and than concentrated power to take them. That's what Paul will do. Moving from one system to another, burning the opposition and swaying amiable allies. He has perfect future sight, he can't be deceived and he knows which people he can sway and with what. 

He's going to know which area to assault where a planetary defenses is weakest. He will also know where to bluff, where to burn and kill everyone, and where to bait. The book only covers it as a war burning across the stars because it's not that interesting covering an un-defeatable force that knows all possible futures that controls space travel for all.",2024-03-04

The best about having buddies is that they can help you, so why do we see 10.000 1v1s? If they use swords, why don’t they use also physical shields or spears. 

It is a slight pet-peeve of mine, but their fighting is not just unoptimized but bad. I get the distinction feeling that a roman legion with sci fi shields and their normal way of fighting would totally rule the meta.",2024-03-10
"I agree with much of this but the inclusion of the Spacing Guild Representatives in a few of the Emperor's scenes and then the final climax would have been doable and good. 

Could reassert their importance in space travel and hammer home the dependence on Spice for it. 

Without that we have a rather substantial difference in the impact of the threat that Paul uses to take over the Empire.",2024-03-08

"Chani doesn't have as much characterization in the book as in the movie and pretty much is in support of anything Paul says/does. There isn't any anger or running off from her at the end when its determined that Paul will marry Irulan. Chani accepts being a concubine instead who will still get all the love and affection from Paul while Irulan is just a wife for political purposes who will get none of that from him. I was a little bothered by the way Chani ended in the movie at first but upon more reflection and reading things here I think its a lot less to do with the Irulan proposal but rather the fact that Paul went against what he said and is using the Fremen to launch a holy war.

Also a big part of the book that was cut in the movie is that Paul and Chani have a son together who dies as part of a Harkonnen attack. They sped up the timeline considerably here in the movie such that it didn't happen (although to be fair they cut out their son in the 1984 version too).",2024-03-02

The second book starts a little more than a decade after this first book, and she's a teenager. Timothy wouldn't be unreasonably aged for the sequel, especially if they do some more alterations to the timeline for it.

"Not really. Paul was never supposed to be the main character. He was supposed to be a girl so he could be reproduce with Feyd Rautha. 

*That* child was supposed to be the Kwisatz Haderach/main character. That’s why Paul & Feyd both have prescience (Feyd mentions he dreamt of Lady Margot) but Paul’s is stronger because he is surrounded by assloads of spice constantly by the second movie. Paul’s child with Chani ends up becoming the kwisatz haderach whose mission is to lead humanity on a “golden path” that ensures humans will not go extinct. This child fuses with a sandworm (they live for millennia) in order to enforce the Golden Path.

Paul manages because he is already his own person, but a baby isn’t yet. This leaves them open to basically being haunted by someone within their genetic past.

Put a pen in your hands, and you could at least draw a stick figure.  Put a pen in Rembrandt’s hands, and he could do much more.  Those who can use “the voice” are like Rembrandt, but their pen is spoken words.  They’re wield it so successfully that they can literally make someone kill them selves.  

As far as why it’s not advertised… it would presumably lose its effectiveness if you knew that someone was fucking with you like that.",2024-03-01

They are also the results of genetics programs to essentially have superhuman bodies on a very low tier. The later books really hone in on this idea.,2024-03-03
"Is it though?  I don’t remember any explanation of “the voice” mentioning molecules.  

The rest of what you said just sounds like you’re reiterating what I said.

“The voice” functions as what we might consider a superpower, but it’s really just a mastery of perception and communication, being skillfully wielded to make people do stuff.",2024-03-03
"I’ve heard that before, and that’s exactly what it is.  Here’s the interesting thing though.  *Dune* was published a decade before NLP was introduced to the world of academic psychology.  Frank Herbert came up with the idea before anyone tried to turn it into real science.  

Moral of the story, Frank Herbert was a pretty clever guy, which is why *Dune* is such a timeless story, and why the majority of science-fiction is somewhat derivative of *Dune*.",2024-03-23

Just throw her over the side of a dune as the worm cruises past?",2024-03-03
"The hooks fold back a piece of the worm's outer protective skin, and the worm rotates and stays on the sand in order to prevent its vulnerable inner tissue from being exposed to sand. That's the secret of worm riding. Thus, if the flap is left exposed, the worm won't dive. (This part is explained in some detail in the book.)  
  
My recollection is hazy (haven't read the book in decades), but there was some very loose mention of this issue and solution in the books, but it wasn't of the type that was supposed to withstand detailed scrutiny. It felt more like a ""I'll throw this part in there so that readers don't think I've left a crazy loose end.""",2024-03-03
"as someone whos never read the books, going through discussions after watching the two parts back to back, there's a lot of details the movie just never mentioned but after searching it up you find out there's a lore reason in the books.

"Paul spends the first half of the movie rejecting his role and trying to avoid the coming holy war at all costs until eventually even he succumbs to the fanaticism of the prophecy. I’d hardly say he wasn’t questioning it, he was just vulnerable to it. ",2024-03-01
"I feel like it is because Paul had 15 years of life to develop his persona before being exposed to spice and awakening his prescience. He has Chani, who he loves, and is a driving force in his motivations for taking power. >!Leto is pre-born, so really never had a stable singular identity or as much connection to his humanity. That’s why he is able to put it all aside for the Golden Path easier.!<",2024-03-03
"Exactly, he still decides his revenge is worth going down that path but hopes he can avert it. It's a super important part of the character that he chooses to go down a path he knows may cost billions of lives.",2024-03-01
"To use as little spoilers as possible, because everyone should check out the books.   In the books Paul sees that humanity, while spread across many words in the empire, is too interconnected and in a stagnant spiral. Eventually humanity will wipe itself out. There's a narrow path to save humanity, which is referred to in later novels as the golden path. But it requires alot of sacrifice and some very severe decision making. Paul is never able to accept the actions that would go down this path, which forces others to do what he couldn't.


Paul spends most his time trying to reign in the fremen who are off happily wiping out any religion or world that doesn't accept Paul as space jesus. His failure on that front makes him pretty fed up with it all",2024-03-03

Her heartbreak at the end of the film is one of the most striking changes from the book that has really stuck with me and illustrates Paul’s change in identity.",2024-03-06
"Why does she receive the entire ancestral download of the BGs through a Freman Rev Mother? How were we even shown that's what she received? 

The dialogue was that if she were to agree to become the new RM for the Fremens, she'd receive a huge history of pain, which I took to mean she'd receive the entire ancestral record of the Fremans given how they've been oppressed.

Yeah I guess they could have snuck in one line about that via Paul… would make his threats / actions seem better thought out since he only targeted the mountain raining boulders and threatened to target the fields. None that would illicit a retaliation from other houses.,2024-03-01
He could but that's still a lot of micromanagement and communication overhead. It's implied that there are many ways for them to be defeated (although the movie wasn't entirely clear if it meant the upcoming battle in Arrakeen or the fight the empire as a whole) but only a few ways for victory. It's all well and good for Paul to know that but he's still gotta convey the info to others as to how to navigate the jihad.,2024-03-03

She was feeling left out since everyone else who’s in everything had already been cast.,2024-03-03
"Okay, the makes sense. I've never read the books and after seeing the movie I was wondering wtf Anya Taylor Joy was doing there. I thought she was some kind of Atreides or Harkonnen ancestor for some reason. Didn't realize she is Paul's sister.",2024-03-04
"It's been a while since I read the book, but I remembered feeling like the end of the book was a bit too rushed for me, so having no Alia around (beyond visions) probably helps the end of the movie feel more focused, at least for me.",2024-03-01
The only change I'm not sure about is how Paul and Chani's relationship is in limbo at the end.,2024-03-03
I assume she'll reprise the role in Messiah and will get a ton of screentime in that. If it gets picked up!,2024-03-01
Perfect casting though,2024-03-02
Yeah 84 Dune and Sci-Fi channel Dune tried it with limited success. Never mind a small child killing someone but child actors just aren't good at that age.,2024-03-02
I agree but it probably had to do with avoiding the Alia problem if it was going to stay completely faithful to the book. ,2024-03-01
Exactly what I was thinking. I don't mind Paul killing the Baron but with Alia not yet born it compressed the narrative just a touch. ~3 years or so to build a Fremen army is a touch more plausible than ~7 months or so.,2024-03-02
If your sticking point about a movie where a space empire exists because a spice created by giant desert space worms gives the spacing guild pilots  enough prescience to plot FTL  travel paths is that... ... the prescient space wizard Paul took over the fremen in 9 months instead of 3 years then I don't know what to tell you.,2024-03-01
What's interesting is the book doesn't expand on Margot Fenring securing Feyd's bloodline does it?,2024-03-04

"1/1 adaptations don't really work either, at best they tend to be pretty bland. The early 2000s series was quite faithful yet not that great.",2024-03-01

"If anything, the way Feyd hissed at that one guard who tried to help him suggests he wouldn’t cheat.",2024-03-13
"I actually think a Dune anime or animated adaption could make things like that work. I think a medium like that can pull off certain strangeness or else weird ideas to a live action could. I doubt it would ever happen or ever given the kind of budget needed, but it would be something to see. 

For live action? I’m fine with Paul seeing visions of his sister as an adult for now. Gives the actors things to work with, all without any kind of CGI uncanny valley effects. If the films continue then she’ll get her time to shine. And the films get more people to read the books!",2024-03-02

"2 points.

1) I was speaking of a general pattern I noticed in a mixture of social media as well as people in real life. As in, when leaving the theater people were talking about the film and i overheard some conversations. And then with my group (mix of readers and non-readers) we were discussing the film at a bar and a big talking point were the changes from the source material.


2) I was referencing Reddit as well as other social media sites. This thread is not the only place where discussion about the film is had. In addition, look at the time of my comment. A lot more posts were added to this thread then when I first commented.

I still enjoy the film and am fine with the changes.",2024-03-03

"I think Frank wasn't a great action writer, but I also think part of that was to really emphasize that the war was already over before the Emperor even got to Arrakis.

The Sardaukar in the books are built up a lot more to be almost superhuman supersoldiers and they're totally overconfident to the point of it being a caricature.  The fremen effortlessly defeating the Sardaukar in like 3 pages is supposed to be overwhelming and disorienting because that's how it felt for the supposedly unbeatable army.  They lose *fast* and they lose *hard* and they've never experienced anything like that.

I think one of my few nitpicks with the movie is part 1 didn't do the work establishing the Sardaukar enough so it's not as stunning when they lose in part 2",2024-03-01

Peter Jackson decided to cut everything in the book that didn’t progress the story of either the Ring and Aragorn, and he re-tooled the story of Aragorn. 

With Dune, I feel like Denis Villeneuve did something very similar. He pretty much left out everything in the book that didn’t involve the bene Gesserit and Paul’s religion and upcoming holy war. He re-tooled some characters like Chani to emphasize it and ignored time jumps (which Jackson also did, there’s a 17 year time jump in LOTR that Jackson ignored). 

I do think though that both Jackson and Villeneuve made amazing movies from books considered “unfilmable”; they might not be the books 1:1, but they successfully manage to adapt the themes and ideas from the books.",2024-03-01

The one-upmanship of not just the physical reality of the conflict, but the emotional sides of it, really reflected on the rest of the movie as a whole. The Bene Gesserit geopoliticking really running a course through everything.",2024-03-02

Having someone that cares deeply for Paul and knows him on a more, uh, *intimate* level express skepticism about the messiah prophecy (or that the Fremen even **need** a messiah) is a good change, IMO.

All in all I loved the movie, I just wish there were more explanation for Paul’s sudden change in motivation other than “he drank worm juice so he’s enlightened now”.

">Jessica and Stilgar kind of fill that role already.

Jessica isn't really that in this movie. She comes across as way more manipulative and sinister than she is in the book where she is greatly conflicted about Paul's path and how it puts him in danger. 

I agree that Stilgar can kind of fill the role, but he doesn't really in the movie because there just wasn't enough time to develop a relationship between him and Paul. Stilgar's faith comes across as more set dressing and occasional comedic relief than something that really impacts Paul and his path in the story.

>Seems like in the genre of epic, reluctant heroes there needs to be somebody to keep the hero ""true to themselves"".

Chani's support in the book is exactly that though. Paul doesn't want to do what is needed, but Chani's faith in him is what allows him to follow along the ""best path"" despite how hard it still is. Chani believing in him so implicitly is what pushes Paul to accept his role and overall fate despite his reservations.

We don't really have that in the movie as is and the transition from Paul the man into Paul the ""messiah"" of the Fremen feels less convincing as a result. Chani can still be a strong character without completely changing her personality the dynamic of her relationship with Paul.",2024-03-04

"Okay, so basically the shields are pretty much the big thing that changes warfare in Dune. Shields are ubiquitous and can cover anything from an individual soldier to a massive ship and are essentially impenetrable to any projectile weapon, both in and out. So in most of the known universe warfare demands hand-to-hand combat because it's the only effective method of penetrating a shield.

As for why they don't just pave the desert with ordnance: there's more context for this in the books than the movies. The basic explanation is that there aren't enough resources to cover every possible ambush location with tons of air support constantly, and the Fremen actually control the majority of Arrakis' surface. Even the sietches near Arrakeen are well-hidden and are only rarely discovered by off-world forces, and the sietches in the deep desert are essentially impossible to reach from Arrakeen.

The Fremen themselves are better-resourced than expected because they are smuggling spice, largely using off-worlders as intermediaries, and using that vast wealth to both buy supplies, and also to bribe CHOAM and the Spacing Guild to keep Arrakis' orbit clear of satellites. This ensures their true numbers stay hidden, and also ensures offworlders are unwilling to take the risk of landing ships outside of Arrakeen and its surroundings.",2024-04-06

so this “conquering” of both the backstabbing emperor’s entire army as well as recovering arrakeen, which has required Paul to successfully secure and harness the desert power, regardless the fact he’s been realized as the KH, this battle is the epic realization of our heroes’ hardship and journey ….

And it just felt like DV was in a hurry to get through all of it without creating an awareness or investment for the audience in the buildup to the action, let alone how he failed to really create any intensity or drama in the action itself….

I love DV but there was some really important emotional-investment I kind of needed experience through Act 3 to reward my investment in the story from 0:01 of Dune Part One (and also especially needed to reconnect me to the story after that arduous-at-times Act 2)….

"> Bruh, I've literally quoted the scenes where he's saying out loud that wants to lie to & manipulate a native people using a prophecy he KNOWS is fake, for the sake of his revenge, which he also knows could lead to a horrible galactic war killing billions.

Sorry - I meant not done anything wrong post realisation that he wants to fight for the Fremen. I agree that he started off selfish. A classic hero's tale is someone who starts out selfish but realises a greater purpose throughout their arc.

>Has it been a long time since you watched Part One?

Yes, but I've read several recaps.

>After the Reverend Mother had tested Paul, she speaks to Jessica, Paul overhears, and then Jessica explains - what the Kwisatz Haderach is. She talks about how the BG have been mixing bloodlines for hundreds of years, trying to produce a mind that could bridge space & time, past & future, etc... and that some believe this being is already here. And then in Part Two, Jessica (after becoming a Reverend Mother herself) tells Paul that he would unlock his full potential as the KH by drinking the Water of Life, opening his mind etc. Both films say multiple times that the Fremen's Lisn Al Gaib prophecy was a fake/propaganda planted by the BG to control them - and yet Paul has abilities, he can see the future etc; the explanation for this given in both films was him being the Kwisatz Haderach, a person specifically bred over centuries to have these abilities.

It doesn't seem to me like these are inherently at odds with one another, or that just because the reasons behind his prophet like abilities are breeding that this means the prophecy is propaganda planted by the BG. It seems like, in the magical universe of Dune, these two currents could coincide. A being that can bridge time and space could still be a prophet/messiah for a group of people even if he can only do that because another group bred him to be it. 

Basically what I think is missing is your evidence from the film that the BG planted this prophecy in the minds of the Fremen. If I'm Paul, I think I'd probably be like: ""okay yes I understand why I have all these powers, but that doesn't mean I'm not actually a god like figure, since I am doing god like shit and this random group of people I've met have all heard of me and know everything I can do and I can read their minds.""

EDIT: Looking into it further, it seems like there is literally just a scene where she explains the BG planted the conspiracy. My bad on that, though it's a shame my interlocutor deleted their account rather than just explain to me that this was a literal scene in the film.",2024-03-21
[removed],2024-03-21
"> I've just explained in detail under another comment of yours using scenes only from the films as evidence, exactly how & why what Paul does is wrong.

I think these were great, and show how he is flawed at points in the film, but these do not show that him fulfilling the prophecy is bad. It's possible that the film shows a flawed character realising his potential as a hero and doing what needs to be done despite the risk of it being harmful.

>Part Two showed that even the Fremen themselves would eventually get hit by a Famine or something because of it. 

I really did not see this. Again, without the knowledge of the books, the premonitions are quite ambiguous and could mean a lot of things. 

>Also, the whole ""friends being turned into followers"", willing to gleefully kill & die for the sake of a lying, manipulative foreigner who went down this path initially only for his own revenge, despite knowing the risk of such a war etc.

Yes, at first, but then he has a premonition and realises that he actually does need to lead them for their liberation. I think again that the film doesn't compel me to believe that the premonition is strictly false - he really does come back to life, he really is able to read the minds of the people, he really is seemingly able to see the future.",2024-03-21

"Ugh. Read your own link. Nowhere in that link refutes anything I’ve said.

It says commanders -sometimes- led ‘’cavalry’’ charges, not infantry. This is NEVER a Vanguard situation where you are the first person to engage the enemy but after the infantry engages you tactically move in. With HEAVY armor and the best units surrounding you and getting your back. Practically the lowest amount of risk possible on the battlefield.

Also by leading the charge, most likely they were in the unit surrounded by men, not literally the first person engaging the enemy. Even then this was really rare. It is rare to the point that the rare kings/commanders who did it are recognized as remarkable/crazy. But yeah, let’s have the most important person be the first person uphill to engage an enemy, like we have seen many times depicted in Dune. Especially without armor.

I cannot believe I’m arguing how insane this is. It’s like an IQ test.

What we see Rabban do is a lot more realistic. He’s on the front lines but always with his unit and never the first person charging.

I get the storyline logic of not letting anyone get to Rabban but still man, the most valuable people being the first person to lead uphill charges to fortified positions are so unrealistic to the point it just takes me out of it a little. That’s all. The movie was so immersive and realistic on every other point that I really felt it. Usually when I feel I’m just watching a movie I don’t really care that much.

I also feel like nobody really engages the point of how unrealistic Chani is the only person not believing in the prophecy is. I understand in the books she believes 100% and Paul is the one not believing it which makes so much more sense. Again, I understand the reasoning. But still it makes her look so illogical, unreasonable and stupid to process very obvious facts that’s in front of her. I wish Paul had to really convince her to not believe in it.

The book goes into more detail of how the empire works, with their merchant guild monopoly and all space travel being controlled by the spacing guild.

So the spacing guild bows to him, which forces all the great houses to bow as well. Then the fremen have free reign to go out and wipe out any religion that refuses to accept Paul as space jesus.

"The decision to completely remove the Spacing Guild is an area that the 2nd movie really suffers from, and it clearly resulted in a bit of a rewriting of the ending that isn't as strong as the book. 

In the book, Paul threatens to destroy all of the Spice on Dune (not with nukes, but with 'pre-spice mass'). The Spacing Guild is deeply addicted to Spice, and requires it for interstellar navigation (because of Spice consumption the Navigators have a mild form of prescience). The Spacing Guild holds the real power in the universe because they're the only ones who can fly ships between planets. All houses are dependent on the spacing guild.

In the book the great houses do not resist his ascension to the Throne. Paul, through holding the Spice hostage, essentially force the Guild to only allow his Fedaykin to travel between planets. All other great houses are stuck on their planets. From there the Freman spread through the galaxy on their jihad and it leads to billions of deaths. 

I think the director and/or the studio were a bit reluctant to make such clear (and intentional by Frank Herbert) parallels between the Fremen and Muslims and a jihad. I think the movie instead made the houses resist his rise to the throne so there's a more direct justification for Paul's war.",2024-03-07

">What really is the difference between a “true” prophecy and a centuries long plot to make something come to pass?

I think it matters because it matters if the universe is one where divine pre-determination, as implied by the connotation of ""true prophecy"", is a thing or whether the universe is made up solely of sentient beings like ourselves without some grander ""force"" guiding events. It matters because it influences how we understand free will in the universe.

"Ye I realised that fully in reading messiah and then rereading dune it is more clear. 

As I said I was young when I read it for the first time. I still think it’s less obvious than in the films, and definitely the sort of smug ‘I understand the story better than you!’ is perhaps not conducive to truly engaging with the art and the story ? I’m not sure what I think entirely. 

I definitely never thought of Paul as the good guy, just complex. I think I’ve seen him being painted as definitely bad which i think is maybe ok, but also it’s more complex than that anyway what with what he saw in his visions after drinking water of life and what not, and also it’s more interesting for people to come to their own conclusions about what they’ve seen rather than being told what they’ve seen, and Messiah massively helps that but in a way that is conducive to thought and retrospection rather than like pre-moralisation of a fictional character

The worms have sections. Fremen riders use grappling style hooks that they sink into the place between sectioned. Once in place, the hooks pull back the tough outer layer that protects the worms soft parts from being abraded by the sand. 

As soon as a rider exposes that soft under skin, the worm will immediately begin to travel in a way that keeps the exposed part as far from the sand as possible and will continue as long as the skin is exposed. 

They also use this to make a turn in the worms direction by adjusting The positioning of their hooks. ",2024-03-10

"They generally only stop when ridden to exhaustion. Otherwise, the drivers just 'roll' the worm by moving their hooks down one side or another and people drop off the side.

Even with 5.1 or 7.1 at home, you can kind of feel the ""blending"" of channels to place sounds in between the exact placement of speakers, but in the theater it really feels like the gasps of the crowd during a pivotal moment are coming from 100 different directions around you.

I believe the theater I went to had 60 individual channels.  If you looked around during bright scenes you could see what basically amounted to a sphere or cocoon of speakers encasing the audience.

We were emo squad so I was like ""why tf does my gf want to see a football movie with me? whatever."" I somehow had accidentally missed all marketing for I Am Legend and thought it was a sports movie based off the title. Sit down, first scene is will smith driving a ferrari around desolated nyc, what the fuck is this shit? At one point a lion jumps out from behind a car and I jumped, and my gf didn't, so I asked her why that didn't surprise her, she says, ""I saw it in the trailer.""

The rest of the movie remains one of my favorite movie experiences of my life, and honestly I Am Legend is kinda mid especially with the end, but in spite of that, it was so fucking scary having no idea what was going on, no expectations, walking into it expecting a football movie, I wanted to replicate that for every movie going forward, forever.

After you watch a movie, go back and watch the trailer, It's crazy how often trailers set a completely different tone, will show scenes from near the end of the movie (so if you're not sure if a character will live or not or whatever, you can be like, well, I haven't seen him in this scene yet, so I guess he survives whatever is happening right now), and sometimes they'll straight up go through the first half of the movie's story beats.

Well ok I think I was unclear here.  She does believe he's the Messiah in the books 10000% but in the books she's also 100% behind him always and is more submissive to Paul in the sense that shes culturally accepting of him as the leader.  She always supports him.  Her character was wildly different in the movie.,2024-03-10

">I've read a couple comments here saying Atmos sound is better

Both the picture and sound are both noticeably better, but the latter specifically is what the real selling point is. The sound systems are unbelievable.

As for the volume question, I'm probably the wrong person to ask about that. I like things really loud, and on top of that I've probably got a lot more hearing damage than most people my age so I'm not as sensitive to volume.

Personally I've never found IMAX to be too loud, and Dolby is probably a bit louder. In recent memory both John Wick 4 and Dune 2 had me geeking out from how deep I could feel the bass in my chest.",2024-03-17

They dropped the whole Feyd using poison thing. In the book he gets cut (not intentionally) and then neutralizes the poison like he did the water of life but acts poisoned to trick Feyd.,2024-03-04
In the book Feyd has a poison pin thing on his hip so he basically pelvic thrusts Paul at one point. Definitely didn't miss that part.,2024-03-05

...he literally limps over to the Emperor, slowly. I just came back from it.",2024-03-19
"I think Paul spends a lot of time justifying his imperialism in his own head, and then consistently makes whatever move gets him the most power anyway.  He does a lot of angsty thinking about how there's no other way, but then routinely acts in his own self interest.

I'm not sure I'd agree that he just wanted to live alone in the desert with Chani.  I think he totally could have done that and instead chose to destroy the universe for his own power.  The Jihad *was* avoidable right up until he did everything to make it happen",2024-03-03

Nah I kind of agree that the exact shots in that scene could’ve shown the turnaround better without being too  overt. No big deal.,2024-03-02
"My issue is that it feels a bit of a clichéd ""both groan but who killed who?"" fakeout. Plus the fact that there were way too many callbacks here -

1. Paul getting stabbed in his abdomen was a callback to how Jamis got stabbed. Jamis died from it but Paul didn't.

2. Feyd getting stabbed was callback to Gurney's lesson

3. Feyd's callback to his own line earlier in the movie, ""well fought, Atreidis"". Felt a bit weird that he was so accepting of death and not more angry about it..

Now, I'm not saying these things were wrongly represented. Paul may have become OP after blue worm piss but it wasn't made clear, and Feyd might actually have been an honourable warrior, but it wasn't shown to be that and not arrogance (although it was told by Seydoux's character).

Minor nits in the grand scheme of things but the climactic duel of the movie not being the most memorable thing in the movie is a slight minus mark, nonetheless.",2024-03-03
"That's good to know it was foreshadowed at the very least. I didn't mean to say it was not a deliberate choice to let the scene play out objectively like it did, but I just thought he could have conveyed that point within the scene itself. That's merely my personal opinion and I'd trust he would be more than capable to express it visually (within the scene) if he had decided to approach it that way. I stand by that opinion because most viewers would not remember a small detail from a movie they watched two years ago, although that may just be the nature of part 1 and part 2 movies. Having said that, for fans and observant viewers it seems perfectly clear and set up, and I respect the attention to detail.",2024-03-02
"Honestly I remember thinking he looked pretty adept, like he had a very loose fighting style that seemed adaptable and efficient. I could be way off with that assessment but that was the feeling I got. I guess if I am in fact not correct about that it could also be explained by just being malnourished/tortured in Harkonnen captivity etc. ",2024-03-03
Keep in mind Paul is still a young royal where as that guy was a seasoned veteran ranking just below Gurney in arguably one of the best fighting forces in the whole setting. They trained Paul but they still had decades of experience over him. So Feyd slightly struggling against him but not necessarily against Paul can work.,2024-03-10
"True! I am probably connecting those dots in my head having read the book. Its a cool fight in the movie but is definitely missing that Dune ""plans within plans"" that is so present everywhere else (including in this very fight in the book with all his hidden stuff).",2024-03-03
This is spot on. It didn't feel realistic that it was such a close call battle for Paul considering he's supposed to be the 'chosen' one and Feyd struggled against random Atreides although those were grown men.,2024-03-04
"The Harkonnen come into his cell, and he, not turning his back to even look at them, goes basically, “You’ll have to just kill me here. I won’t go out there drugged and die a fool.” Way more gravitas than the other two, who we only see being pinned down and drugged against their will.

And IIRC one of the Harkonnen says, “No drugs for you.” and he gives a surprised look.

Besides, the two big guys were brand new for this movie. The guy we’re talking about, Roger Yuan, played clearly a high-ranking officer in the Atreides army in the first movie (you can see him in a few scenes), so it’s likely supposed to be the same character.",2024-03-07
"The fight plays out differently in the book.  
It's a close call but Paul only gets wounded in his arm, but it's by a blade with a slowing poison on it, and he has to use his abilities to transmute and nullify the poison. Feyd also has a hidden poison needle on his hip that catches Paul off guard leading him to fall to the ground after barely dodging. Since Feyd is then in position to kill him, Paul is tempted to use a Bene Gesserit trick (a triggering word) to stun Feyd but instead shouts out his refusal to stoop to such tactics. Ironically shouting that out momentarily confuses Feyd, Paul reverses and stabs Feyd through the jaw and into the brain.  
It's a very detailed fight, but I guess they couldn't figure out how to make it work like the book and have it clear just how close Paul was to losing without getting knives stuck in him.",2024-03-03
Damn that’s really good. I caught that in Part 1 but didn’t make that connection here. Well done,2024-03-18
They also allude to it when he said he couldn’t predict the Sietch Tabr annihilation.,2024-03-02
"I wish we got a Lord Fenring in the movie, him denying the Emperor's orders to kill Paul and the kind of envy you get from it as he was a failed KH bloodline. Also just throws some weird on the Lady Fenring Feyd-Rautha stuff",2024-03-06
In the books Chani is more supportive of him as a messiah. I think Denis is just leaning into that to provide conflict for the film and to develop Paul as more of an anti-hero. In the book the marriage to Irulan is political and Chani is his true love.,2024-03-01
"The Princess Irulan is relegated to tell Paul’s story. It’s cool how it clicks into place at the end of the Dune book because her commentary leads off each chapter. You see a bit of that in the film, here.

Chani and Paul’s relationship is way different in the book. They have kid(s), even!",2024-03-02
"> I didn't read the books, so maybe I'm off here, but I took Paul's visions of Chani dying to be what might happene if he stayed with her for his Holy War which is partly why he chose the Emperor's daughter at the end, not just out of strategy.

Paul marries Irulan solely for political purposes to become Emperor. He still loves Chani and vice versa. In the movie from Chani's perspective she didn't seem anywhere as accepting of this as she was in the book.",2024-03-02
"Basically Paul knows at this point that the jihad is inevitable and the universe will burn no matter what.  He's seen that no matter what choice he makes the holy war is about to kick off, so he picks the path that keeps him in control in an attempt to mitigate the damage as much as he can",2024-03-02
You ain't cheating you ain't trying,2024-04-02
"He doesn’t remove the dagger from his side on screen, just the one from his shoulder. You’re correct",2024-03-01
"I just finished watching the movie, I remember him after the duel with 2 daggers clearly stuck in him, so there must be 3 blades in total.",2024-03-05
"I liked that the movie made it a closer fight though.

Even if Paul knew he would win, he still had to get stabbed twice for this path. Either because it was a more certain path to victory or something else I suppose.

Also no poison from Feyd leaves a better taste, since he may be a sociopathic monster, but giving a villain a likeable trait is good, in this case his sense of honor. If all three Harkonnens are all completely detestable (and Rabban/Baron certainly are), I find that less interesting.",2024-03-01
"Paul specifically mentions in the book while fighting Feyd that while he forsaw this moment and others, he has no control over the future in the present. He realizes that the fight is the nexus point, and he needs to win for his premonitions to come true, but he is locked in a very real duel to the death with Feyd in that moment and that he can lose. He is not performing.",2024-03-01
"The whole ""lasers and shields interact so that they both blow up"" thing is silly to me IMO. Suicide bombers carrying a one shot laser could easily destroy entire ships and buildings if they wanted to.


It would have been much better if an active shield made any laser(no matter how powerful) would break/fail when it shot a shield from some kind of feedback, and an active shield meant that you can't shoot a laser because the proximity disrupted the laser gun.",2024-03-04
Caladan was boring anyway. Way too much water. Like playing life on easy mode!,2024-03-02

"I guess that's what they went for, but it was not how I remembered it being used in the books. It sounded weird, because it had always been directed at Alia and to a lesser extent Ghanima and Leto II, in the context of them potentially becoming mad.

So I searched online for a glossary of some sort, and that seemed to confirm my feelings:

[Dune Glossary on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bene_Gesserit#Abomination)

[Dune Wiki](https://dune.fandom.com/wiki/Abomination)

At least the Dune wiki does say that it can surface after just consuming the Water of Life, but in combination with psychological instability. For her to call Paul Abomination on sight felt weird to me. But I guess, in theory, there was a chance for Paul to become an Abomination when he underwent the spice agony?

But Paul was never fed spice while in utero. So, he wouldn't have the ancestral (genetic) memory to become Abomination (possessed by the voices of his genetic line), although he had prescience: visions of the future.

And I don't remember Paul becoming Abomination ever being a concern in the books.",2024-03-11

"Dune is the inspiration for a lot other series (Star Wars, bits of AOIAF), and that ripples through time with other media so on and so on. It’s a testament to Frank Hebert that his writing skills that over 50 years after publishing, the story still resonates and entertains.

Bear in mind, Dune is written as a warning about the dangers of following charismatic leaders. It was always written as a critique of a “chosen one”, “white savior”, “hero from nobility.” Paul is not the hero of the story and you get it. 

“The Holy War begins” - literal chills and a few gasps in my theater.",2024-03-03
"I can see that but disagree.

Abomination is a big part of the next couple of books and specifically refers to a child exposed to the spice change before being born. Paul using the voice in the reverend mother showed her the path that they have now gone down, and she’s calling Alia abomination through Jessica. It was less directed at Paul, and more of an open statement to the room for those that understand, aka Jessica.",2024-03-01

"No it’s specifically about someone who is susceptible to the other people in their memories taking over them after going through the spice change. This mostly happens to children and babies.

It's only lightly touched across the films but the reason the Emperor is so powerful is because the Sardaukar are so insanely skilled. Herbert uses the ([false](https://acoup.blog/category/collections/the-fremen-mirage/)) 'tough environments make good warriors' theory to explain the Sardaukar's skill as due to being raised on the harsh environments of planet Salusa Secundus, the Corrino prison planet.

However, the fremen are raised in an even more harsh planet (which therefore according to the book's logic makes them even better fighters) as well as having a population magnitudes greater than officially recorded. Paul uses the fremen's pure skill as warriors combined with their numbers and zeal to conquer the other Houses.",2024-03-05

"It is really interesting where there are some artists who are like: this is the thing, this exact thing, and only this thing.

I honestly don't love that kind of artistic purity, though I have a kind of old-world respect for it.

I want to live in a world where, if you a superfan of a movie, there are like 400 different versions of it that you can see. Like every cut and change made on the way to the final product. I want to be able to read every script rewrite and view full-on AI projections of how those scenes might have played out given the rest of the film.

On the other hand, I got really annoyed the other day when I watched Alien 3 and learned only afterwards that I watched the wrong version of it, because there are two ""somewhat authorized versions"" floating around out there.

I want there to be a ""definitive cut"" and then to have access to all of the previous cuts *if I want to deep dive*, but to never be able to accidentally watch the ""wrong version"" of a movie.

It's tough though, because who is to say which cut is the ""definitive cut?""

Certainly we want to live in a world where if a studio meddles too much we might later get a definitive ""director's cut,"" right? But there are also famous examples of director's fucking up their own movies later: Francis Ford Coppola (The Outsiders), George Lucas (just all of it, man), Richard Kelly (Donnie Darko).

That was one of the angles that I loved from Game of Thrones. All of the plotting and scheming. It's unfortunate that they didn't include that story line.,2024-03-02
"Right after his father's death he has an awakening of sorts. I can't do the passage justice, but it really bothers his mother. For one, she can tell that he's extremely powerful, but on the other hand she's worried because he hasn't been fully trained. So there's a strain on their relationship that's rather unspoken, but I feel like that's extremely important in the context of the overall story that will continue in the next movie.

Right around the time of this awakening Paul continues to struggle decerning between the now, past, and present. He's almost paralyzed in at points in time for fear or doing or even saying the wrong word. In my mind the internal struggle was profound and it added to the laundry list of difficult struggles. As in the second movie they detail the Fremen rights of passage or tests well, which are all deadly. However Paul has to contend with this as well as the possible deaths of billions.

Then there are blindspots. He can't see past or through certain things. Then right before he has the water of life, he realizes his mother is the source of the jihad he keeps seeing. While the water helps him, the process of the water coupled with Jessica doing the ritual with the old Reverend Mother is way more significant IMO. Jessica became significantly more powerful. I'm not fully finished with the last book in the original novel so I'm not sure what kind of issues will arise but I do love that story line. 

It's a hell of a book. It's hard to cram all of the different layers into a movie. I think they did a good job, but I have a difference of opinion with how some of it was done. Like the sister remaining in eutero.",2024-03-03

It's not adequately explained in this movie, but spice is the most important resource in the universe and it only exists on Arrakis. Control over the planet and the spice is incredibly influential over the universe. Going to war with the great houses will cost millions, if not billions of lives, but he can see futures with much greater loss of life if the Harkonens maintain control of Arrakis, or if Feyd Rautha becomes the emperor, or the Harkonens reveal the emperor's betrayal to the great houses, or any other scenario.",2024-03-09
"I think he’s seeing thousands of years into the future, but I don’t think he’s temporally confused, he knows how far off events are supposed to take place.

">Chani is supposed to be his love and partner. But he doesn’t even attempt to explain or talk to her post water of life.

Why should he? This isn't a normal person anymore he's forseen the future. If he forsaw a future where talking to Chani would help at this current time, he'd probably do it. He tells his mother this, when she questions it, and he says she'll see the reason in the future.

>They don’t have a single conversation before the final confrontation

He tells her in a wistful way that he will love her for as long as he breathes. At that point he already realizes there is nothing he can say that will make it any better. Or she has a part to play in the coming future that she needs to perform with her current mindset.

>Lots of people said Dune pt1 had nothing happen in it

Sure, but lots of people also loved the movie, the director takes a lot of time actually not conveying information but setting up shots of the world so it feels expansive. It's hard to do both well sometimes, but I think it does a good job of showing and not telling editing the density of the books into a workable screen play to convey the overarching story without getting too in the weeds of inner thoughts and background story.

It does so through concise meaningful dialog, fever dreams, and other devices.",2024-03-13

So in the books Paul's sister is born and isn't talking to the mom from inside her belly?,2024-03-02
"Right but that means people with lazguns don’t shoot shields. Now given what we know about Islamic jihadists post 1980, it could be argued that the Fremen are more likely to partake in suicide bombing style attacks, but Dune was written 17 years before suicide bombing became a popular tactic by jihadists, and I think it’s some level of problematic to assume that the Fremen would adopt that style of fighting anyway. It would be kind of reductive and stereotyping, plus they aren’t really Muslim, their religion did half descend from it though (and Buddhism). 

So turning on a shield means your opponent won’t use their lazgun cause they don’t want to commit suicide, so I don’t see how this answers the question. Shields make worms berserk but I assumed they were safe on that rock.",2024-03-10

Hell, this was still an effective strategy well into the 15th century, as evidenced by the fact that four Italian ships fought off hundreds of Ottoman vessels by lashing themselves together while trying to run the Turkish blockade during the Siege of Constantinople in 1453.",2024-03-06

"yes, my favorite scene from the book. I hope they filmed it to include in an directors cut or something",2024-03-02
"For the Fremen it makes sense that they fight like that bc they have a heavy cultural focus on honor and individual prowess, plus they rely heavily on ambushes. In pitched battle it can be explained that they want to break up formations and play into their individual strength.


The sardukar are similar I guess.


For the Atreides and Harkonen it makes a bit less sense, but we do get at least one scene of formation fighting in part one.",2024-03-11
"We see some formation fighting in the movies, but yeah - no metal shields.

The thing to remember is that in the books, we see very little actual combat. Battles are basically only mentioned in passing. From my recollection, there are pretty much no scenes describing the actual details of battles. Just who won and how. Usually past tense. Paul's duel's, or various assassination attempts, are an exception.

Combat just seems to be a passing throught for Frank Herbert, in a universe where some characters already know the outcomes beforehand. It's only described/mentioned in the bare minimum way to be able to tell the story. The series is *all* about characters plots and internal schemes, which is why it's been thought to be close to impossible to adapt to the big screen.

That being said, there's probably a reasonably strong argument that could be made *against* metal shields being feasible. Projectile weapons are very strong against anything un-shielded. We're also talking about a culture in which bloodlines and breeding have been huge for thousands of years, and soldiers that are *much* more highly trained than anything on old-Earth. I think a fairly decent argument could be made that metal shields would be more of an encumbrance for soldiers that skilled, and outfitted how they are. I'd put a single Sardaukar up against a hundred Roman legionnaires with shields - easily. From the combat we do see in the books, it's all incredibly fast and skilled.

In the movies, the typical soldiers are made to look like plebs, just to obviously differentiate them from the really gifted fighters like Duncan, Gurney, Paul, Jessica, Feyd, etc. But this isn't so in the books. For example, all the Sardaukar and Atreides soldiers are total badasses. The Atreides becomming so skilled, is one of the main reasons that the Emperor wants them wiped out. Paul's father had managed to train some Atreides soldiers to be almost comparable to Sardaukar - who were usually rated as being a match for 10 highly trained house soldiers. When Duncan kills as many of them as he does before dying, it's spoken of as a legendary combat feat for millenia afterwards.

There's also weird stuff like the Bene Gesserit fighting style basically teleporting around, and it's left a bit ambiguous as to whether it just appears that way due to mental tricks, or whether they're actually doing it. We get a glimpse of this during the 2nd movie at the very start, where Paul and Jessica are hiding at the bottom of the cliff and the bodies are falling. Paul sprints to grab the sword and kill the soldier who floated down. When he's about to get shot, Jessica was suddenly 100 meters away, behind the guy (in the open), and killing him with a rock. There was no way that there was time for her to cover that distance, and that felt like a nod to the 'Weirding Way' - although it broke the rules around the distances that are usually possible.

So yeah, there's lots of weirdness in the Dune series, and Denis Villeneuve has to just scrape the top, as to what will be acceptable to a typical audience. I saw a clip of him saying the other day that he's not sure how to do anything after Messiah, as it goes, 'way out there.' And I agree. I don't think the audience that liked the movies from the first book, are going to cope with movies made from books 3 and 4 🤣.",2024-03-14
"Not really. I love the movies, but to go hyper-critical for a minute:

They explained how the shields work in melee combat during the training scene in the first movie. We later got fight scenes with shielded opponents who were stabbing through shields at seemingly full speed. Not enough effort was put into show-casing the slower penetrating stabs.

That then caused some issues with Paul's challenge during the Jamis duel, due to being too used to fighting shielded opponents. It could've been better explained, and I feel like an uninitiated audience could just assume it was because Paul had never killed, and didn't want to kill Jamis. Jessica even makes this point instead of anything about shields.

That was all fine - nothing blatant enough to be a huge deal.

In the 2nd movie we have a melee attack on a harvester, with a rocket that Chani shoots exploding against a thopter shield. But then during the 'opening' Paul created by baiting the thopter to shoot, the shield has re-activated and yet the projectile is slowly forcing its way through... ok, a bit weird.

After that, we get a few scenes where they just lasgun a bunch of harvesters, making it confusing that they'd ever deal with them differently if they can just do that. But that's a bit of an aside from the shield issue.

What probably bugged me the most (and it was only a bit) is that I don't think they adequately explained that shields attract worms, or that lasgun vs shield = big boom. They even cut the lasgun/shield explosions from the book. My friends were confused by how they were just shooting dudes with projectiles in the first fight scene.

And, lastly, as someone else has mentioned - the first movie nearly ended when they were trying to lasgun the thopter Duncan was piloting 😆.

I can live with all of it, but there's just some inconsistencies that would mean i'd have to go do a bunch of googling afterwards, if I hasn't read the books.",2024-03-03
"They did, but there was still 2 years of pickup shots, compared to like 1yr of initial filming. But the part that was most impressive was how he convinced the studio it'd basically cost the same to do all 3 at once - that's the part i've seen George Lucas joke about.

The Fremen have been oppressed for generations. Paul isn’t colonising them. He’s leading them to greatness. That’s clear not only in the book but in the movie.

But Star wars on the other hand was almost disrespectful to the original. After they decanonized all of sacred texts that the OG fans loved they proceeded to make more and more tv shows and films that just fell flat. Not just one but dozens.

"I'm curious if the book's version is actually better in that regard. Because fundamentally, the Fremen beliefs aren't based in rationality. As someone who didn't read the book, I thought the way Paul convinced them was near-perfect. This is a deeply spiritual, superstitious people who've been awaiting their savior for centuries. Then, in a time of great strife and tragedy, an outsider who fits the prophecy (even if the prophecy is vague) comes and announces himself. 

These people are already emotionally charged in a way that lends itself to an almost dreamlike stupor, or a trance, caused by their religious belief. So when Paul performs seeming miracles (or maybe actual miracles) by seeing deeply into the minds of some of the Fremen, they simply bowed because they believed that he was who he said he was.

I don't think using logic to convince the Fremen would, in my opinion, be better writing. I think the scene using very clearly emotional arguments for a deeply troubled people is analogous to many real life religious and political figures and situations.",2024-03-05

"Paul says he sees a holy war he doesn't want in the future. He doesn't want to lead the fremen, he wanted to join them. 
His mother Jessica kinda acts like Macbeth's wife, especially in part 2 with spreading his legitimacy as a prophet despite him not wanting too. He married for political motives and relegated channi to mistress. 

While Paul leads a lot of this after drinking the water of life, he never wanted to get to that point. So I'd argue that Paul didn't want any of this really. And even then, he didn't want to be duke, he didn't want to go to Arrakkis. 

So while he succeeded in what everyone else wanted, I don't think Paul really got anything he wanted. His dad is dead, his mom became his own false prophet, he presumably won't be able to live solely with channi, he doesn't get to go back to Calladan and put this all behind him.

It could work as just being a subtle coercion or sth if it only was subtle coercion, using what's already there, power of suggestion and generally kind of mix of perceptiveness and a long type of game.

"Yeah so obviously hawat was pretty pissed about house atreides being torn down and getting imprisoned by the harks.  Baron thought he could control him by doing some wish.com version of the 1984 torture sections then pretend to be his friend so he'll start working for him instead.

Obviously hawat is extremely intelligent and sees right through this, pretends to agree to work with the baron but then immediately tries to secretly dismantle harks from the inside doing mentat things.  There's a 2 year time just in the book and when we get back to hawat he's been doing his best to mess with the harks in secret. One strategy was to have the soldier not be drugged and disguise it as a mistake by the battle master so the baron would kill him off, the hope was that the soldier would have a better chance to surprise and kill feyd severing one of the hark lines of blood rights to the throne.

Kind of makes the baron look like even more of a dufus to trust so much into the sworn loyal mentat of his slain house enemy so I'm not completely upset it got axed besides the soldier but would be nice to see his performance at least",2024-03-07

The overall spirit and themes and most of the plot remains intact though. But one of the big changes was making Chani feel more equal to him in the relationship before he turns to Emperor leading a holy war.

- Alia was born in the first book, I remember the child running around stabbing people (although this one was a good change because that definitely would not translate lol)
- They didn’t really go into the worms and how they create the spice (not that big of an issue)
- No Hawat
- Feyd-Rautha gladiator fight he didn’t know about the Atreides soldier not being drugged and there was nothing about a secret word
- Jamis’s wife wasn’t in the movie
- Paul and Chani don’t have a child in the movie (no time jump, at least not a 2 year one)

Christopher Columbus was considered cruel and violent even by his peers, and was said to have ordered his soldiers to practice the sword on random civilian natives, paraded corpses down the streets as a deterrent, and cut off the ears and nose of a man who stole corn.  
  
He also congratulated his brother for defending the family honor, after he had paraded a woman naked down the street and then cut out her tongue for saying Columbus was lowborn.

There's the atrocities of Belgian Congo, where millions were tortured and killed. Cut off and dried hands were used as currency. Cannibalism was widespread, and while officially illegal often used as threat or punishment (kidnap children from a tribe, force them to work, feed their children to your cannibal mercs if they don't meet the quota). Some also fattened up slave children and sold for meat.  
  
That's the *extremely* understated version of the absolute horror of Belgian Congo, btw.

"In the movie it obviously kills people. In the books is pretty explicit that Paul considers this act to be in accordance with the Great Convention because the atomics are not used against humans, but rather against ""a natural feature of the desert"" Frank Herbert is also well known for being very sparse on the details when it comes to action scenes, so the description in the book is very short. I think this is a nice reflection of there not being any witnesses left anyway. If there were people there the great houses didn’t see it, and it’s Paul’s word against nothing. 

So we aren’t told if anyone specifically died directly from the atomics. We can assume maybe some people were there or maybe no one is on the wall at all since the shield wall is basically just a small mountain formation and there’s no reason for people to be out and about out there. It’s not like people go hiking on Arrakis for fun

"Paul’s motivation was always to avenge his father. Once he accomplished that, his other motivation was to provide the Fremen the green paradise they desire.  

His paralysis from doing that was due to his fuzzy visions of what would be the costs and what would be the likeliness of success. Also, they establish in the first movie that Paul has a problem assuming responsibility. He doesn’t really want his father’s throne, doesn’t want to lead the Fremen, doesn’t want to be the KH. Even though circumstances keep forcing his hand. 

In the book, they do a better job because Paul and Chani have a child that ends up getting murdered by the Harkonnan/Emperor. So that becomes the catalyst for his change. They didn’t choose that route in the movie because they had to speed the timeline up.

Edit: also the prophecy was a lie. The Bene Gesserit generated a messiah story for every planet, as a way to insure safe passage for any of their sect in case one gets stranded or imprisoned.

"You're welcome - and thank *you*, for the kind words of appreciation. 

And yes, Dune definitely has more thematic depth & a relatively complex, layered plot (especially in Part Two) despite its cinematic language being that of a blockbuster (the only way it could realistically get the budget it requires, and then profit enough for the NEXT film to get made... A lesson poor Denis had learned the hardway when the excellent, but very slow-paced, Blade Runner 2049 had bombed; Even 'Dune Part One' had received some flak for putting some viewers to sleep).

Most of how thought-provoking you're finding the film can be traced to the book... except for the interesting ways in which Villeneuve has drastically changed (& thereby improved imo) Chani's character. But Villeneuve has added plenty of his own inventiveness into HOW he each part of the story has been visualised & put onscreen - Harkonnen soldiers scaling the mountain using their antigravity gear, fetus Alia, GEIDI PRIME, Feyd himself, etc. I thoroughly enjoyed both books & films alike (partly for the same strengths,  but partly for different ones as well)... and am glad to hear that you're doing so as well. Cheers then👋🏽",2024-03-21
">A classic hero's tale is someone who starts out selfish but realises a greater purpose throughout their arc.

And yet, if the selfish actions of the beginning cross a certain threshold of horribleness, and then - for whatever reason - the person ends up doing & causing a horrible end result (which wouldn't have happened at all, if it wasn't for his initial selfishness)... the description of a 'tragic antihero' fits way better than 'hero', the latter being usually associated in people's minds with a force that's more good, and not THIS dark.

>I've read several recaps

Well, clearly you're not adequately recalling multiple key dialogues, so best not pass judgement this freely based on insufficient data.

>what I think is missing is your evidence from the film that the BG planted this prophecy in the minds of the Fremen

 The film outright SAYS multiple times that it was fake, made-up propaganda planted by the BG. Paul is aware of this too. What more evidence do you need of something being fake than the movie blatantly telling you it's fake, AND there being more sci-fi explanation for the powers, than a 'magical' one? At this point you're just believing what you want to believe despite any amount of evidence to the contrary. Why even waste others' time by coming into arguments with your mind already made up?

> If I'm Paul, I think I'd probably be like: ""okay yes I understand why I have all these powers, but that doesn't mean I'm not actually a god like figure, since I am doing god like shit 

Well, you aren't. And Paul in the film *clearly* didn't think so - ""What you Bene Gesserit have done to this planet is heartbreaking"" , ""So this is how we survive - by being Harkonnens (ruthless, selfish etc)"" , the latter when he decides to embrace the path of becoming the Fremen's fake Messiah, despite the galactic war killing billions that could result.  Btw I can't believe that you keep hand-waving away any war with that level of bloodshed, the religious brainwashing of an entire native people by foreigners etc as ""nothing bad""🙄.

">but these do not show that him fulfilling the prophecy is bad.

My man, a foreign guy & his mother brainwash a native people into believing that he's their Messiah of a fake prophecy, turning ""friends into followers"" primarily for his personal revenge (at least to begin with) and eventually sending them off to fight a Galactic War killing billions (which he already knew from his visions, way back when he actually HAD the option to prevent it, by just leaving like his mother had even suggested) ... and this *isn't* bad to you? The movie outright tells you that this will eventually turn out to be bad for the Fremen as well, through Paul's visions.

All that aside - this is also a clear allegory/metaphor for anti-imperialism, a deconstruction of white saviour & chosen one tropes. Because the real world almost-equivalent of something like this is a Western country empowering fundamentalists in some Middle Eastern country to perform a religious revolution & coup in the name of 'liberation', when in reality this is primarily for the former's own agenda (getting oil in return from the new, more cooperative regime etc). The Islamic revolution of Iran, certain events in Afghanistan etc come to mind.

>I really did not see this. Again, without the knowledge of the books, the premonitions are quite ambiguous and could mean a lot of things. 

LIKE WHAT?🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️ Did those visions of skeletal people crawling & groaning on a cracked desert floor mean anything GOOD to you? Especially when you couple it with Paul's obviously horrified response to it? 

>I think again that the film doesn't compel me to believe that the premonition is strictly false - he really does come back to life, he really is able to read the minds of the people, he really is seemingly able to see the future.

The film outright tells you after Jessica survives the Water of Life scene that ""high level Bene Gesserit are able to transmute/neutralise poisons"". Paul is said to be the Kwisatz Haderach in both films, which is essentially a male Bene Gesserit superbeing 'bridging time & space, past & future' - this is how he is able to survive the Water of Life, see the future etc.",2024-03-21
"Villeneuve made it blatantly obvious how manipulative the messiah prophecy is, just look at how Chani was changed to be disgusted by it and Jessica was made much creepier even outright saying she would turn people into believers, starting from the weakest.

There is no way most people just think it is a white saviour movie unless they want it to be one (whether to criticize it or idolize Paul). Well, it would reinforce the point of the movie heh. Poor Stilgar.

Edit: On your point, I did read an essay on a Muslim subreddit by someone who was discussing ""Orientalism"" and they did try hard to present the Middle Eastern influences in Dune as just that. Made me sad because I think they even did that white saviour argument and sounded like they *wanted* to miss the point. And even FauxMoi (well no surprise) complained about one of the costumes that a Dune actress wore to the premiere because it resembled Muslim attire (turns out it was inspired by an old Catholic nun costume).

">And as much as Chani hates it it’s still unfortunately better than if the harkonnen had control

Can't go into this without spoiling future books though. Heck, but even with what information we already have - while the Fremen continuing to be oppressed on Arrakis is ofc bad, the alternative now becomes them being plunged into a LONG Holy War across the galaxy for the sake of their new warrior religion (which is bad for both the Fremen, as well as everyone else in the galaxy - and if you think about it, not even fully in the Fremen's own best interests alone - That is, if it wasn't for the sake of their new Prophet & religion, why would they ever go to other planets to fight wars? They would have slowly but steadily focused on improving the ecosystem of Arrakis instead, even WITH the Harkonnen nuisance in the northern parts).

In the end, there are no easy 'right answers' in Dune - which is why it's been revered since the 60s to be a great & STILL thematically relevant, complex work of sci-fi.

All of this aside, to Chani - not only is this a betrayal from Paul, but it also changes him, their relationship, her people, their culture etc for the worse. Religious fanaticism has never ended well for any society, or for others around them. Blindly following charismatic leaders, especially foreign ones with their own agenda, is also just as bad - which is the main reason why Dune is said to be a deconstruction of white saviour & chosen one narratives, than actually being either of those things.",2024-03-01

>There’s an animal kind of trick. A human would remain in the trap, endure the pain, feigning death that he might kill the trapper and remove a threat to his kind

This part of the quote wasn't in the movie. There's absolutely no reason why I have to use the book to explain a scene from the film.

>A human wouldn’t just hang out in the trap because he loves the way it clamps painfully on his leg

You're also being pedantic AF here . The Gom Jabbar already puts the subject under more pain than a 'trap' would on a leg - so if Feyd could withstand the pain from the trap & act as rationally/normally as he usually does (even if it's because he finds the pain pleasurable), he's still technically passing the test. 

>Why not just sit on your hand until it becomes numb before you take the test? Then you’d pass easy peasy.

For someone who claims to be ""OH SO bothered!!"" by how they've changed the test & its ""very meaning"", you seem to have no qualms about changing how it's performed for the sake of making your own arguments. Since when is the subject of a Gom Jabbar informed beforehand of the test & it's nature, in order for them to ""just sit on their hand until its numb & pAsS eAsY pEaSy""?

>So the test of Feyd shows that he loves pain and they allow him to live because he can be controlled

The result of the test was simply that he could withstand the pain (regardless of the reason) & stay as rational as he usually is, & therefore a 'PASS'. The fact that he finds pleasure in pain was an additional inference - he's allowed to live because he passed the test (just like Paul was), NOT because he could be controlled (the latter made him a more attractive 'prospect' for the BG).

>but how does the test show he can be controlled?

Jesus F***ing Christ, do you need EVERYTHING spelt out for you? They literally said out loud that ""his levers were desire & humiliation; & that he's sexually vulnerable"". This needn't have been shown by the test alone, but by Fenring's research on him (they did spend the night together afterwards, have sex etc) as well. For someone who claims to have read the book & considers every word of it gospel, you seem to be awfully befuddled by how the Bene Gesserit agents are so obviously portrayed to act & go about their plans in them. 

It's SO blatantly indicated in that scene that the plan was for Irulan to marry Feyd, and while he's Emperor, manipulate him to fulfil the BG's agendas via her taking advantage of his sexual vulnerabilities. Further details of this plan is neither known NOR relevant considering his fate at the end of both book & film alike.

He outright says in the beginning of Part 2 that ""I must convert the non-believers if I'm to disrupt spice production; It's the only way I can reach the Emperor"". 🤷🏽‍♂️

>Paul denied he was the Messiah and wanted to be named after the kangaroo rat. Kinda seemed like he genuinely wanted to become a Fremen.

Him denying he was the Messiah & that he just wanted to be one of them the FIRST TIME - after Jessica's Water of Life survival - was just him telling Chani & co. what they would prefer to hear. But by the time he chooses the Muad'Dib name, i.e. once he had spent some time with & gotten to know Chani and the Fremen better, he did come to genuinely care for them. He changes his mind about his initial plan then (which is when Jessica - or rather Alia - complains that he was getting clouded by love)... but by then, like I've already mentioned, events leading to the Holy War were already well set into motion by him & accelerated by Jessica. 

THIS was his tragedy - that he didn't want to manipulate them anymore after a point, but that it was too late, & fate (brought about by his initial choices) forced him back to his original plan anyway.  Btw, another VISUAL indicator of when Paul is thinking more of himself & his own Atreides interest (and not just what's best for the Fremen) was his father's Ducal Signet. He takes the ring off after falling in love with Chani, saying ""I've found my way, Father"". He puts it back on during the war council scene, with a shot of Gurney's face showing the guy's immense approval of it, when Paul announces that he's ""Paul Muad'Dib ATREIDES, DUKE of Arrakis"". 

Like we've said before, while he is driven more by ""choosing the seemingly less horrible of 2 outcomes/path of immediate survival"" in the latter scene, the act of taking off and now putting the ring back on, are clear visual indicators of when he became just ""one of the Fremen"" versus when he's primarily acting for ""Paul Atreides"".",2024-03-20

">See, to me it felt like Paul's goal was to free the Fremen from oppression

His goal at first was simply just to fight alongside them, which he pointed out numerous times throughout the movie. It's only once he consumes the water of life that he loses his identity and starts to play into the Messiah role. 

The movie also clearly shows his goal is to rise to power, hence why he decides to betray Chani at the end and take the hand of Princess Irulan to solidify his claim to the throne 

>At no point did I get the sense that he was manipulating them for his own ends;

I mean how many times did you need the movie to tell you that the prophecy is literally bene gesserit propaganda and that he that he knows he isn't actually the Messiah? That is the definition of manipulation, he knows the prophecy is bullshit and he is still using it as a means to control the Fremen

>it always felt to me like he was helping them.

He is doing both. He is helping them defeat the Harkonnens and free themselves, but at the same time he is also manipulating them and becoming a false prophet to achieve his political goals. That's what makes him an anti-hero and a morally grey character 

> If the movie was trying to imply that he was going mad with power and actually bad for the Fremen,

Again, this is an oversimplification. He is neither a pure hero nor is he a pure villain. He is a complex, morally grey, anti-hero. While on the one hand he is helping the Fremen, he is also manipulating them and using them. That's part of what makes Dune so great, there is a lot of nuance, it isn't just a story about good guys and bad guys. 

>Fremen, I feel like it didn't do a great job of showing that for those of us who haven't read the books.

The movie actually makes it much more obvious than it was in the books, the movie is much less subtle about it. Chani's character basically spells all this out to the audience, which in the book she doesn't. I think you should give the movie a rewatch and pay closer attention to the details. This is all part of what makes Dune so great, there is a lot of nuance and complexity to it. It has a ton of thematic depth, it isn't just a surface level good guys vs bad guys movie.

> further warfare will claim more lives?

Ya, pretty much. Paul's jihad that he starts at the end of the movie kills a ton of people.

> now I’m intrigued how you can believe that nuclear fallout...

Pre-1955ish nuke created a lot of fallout and it caused terrible issues like the ones you mentioned in Japan. Little Boy (the bomb dropped on Hiroshima) was especially bad for this as it was a crude gun type bomb. As fision type devices these bombs ended up not using all their fissile material and scattering the unused material over the area.

Post 1955 bombs switched to thermonuclear/hydrogen bombs. These use a combination of fission (like previous bombs) and fusion (hydrogen) which means they consume much more of their fissile material. Extensive use of hydrgen also creates less radioactive byproducts than a purely fission bomb. The end result is much less fallout as the radioactive material is used up.

During the cold war the bombs very quickly got destructive enough so the major powers (US and USSR) began to focus on either making them smaller (to allow more to be fit on the same missile), to do weird stuff with them (the russians were really into using them for earthmoving projects like canals) or reducing the after effects (mostly so you can invade the thing you just nuked). The end result is that we got to the point where the only thing really stopping nukes from flying was MAD (which thankfully works amazingly well).

You'll hear some stuff about dirty bombs that intentially spread fallout by including radioactive material that's designed to not be consumed and instead just spread by the explosion. The main examples of this are small theorized terrorist bombs or MacArthur wanting to nuke the entire northern Korean border with cobalt laced bombs making it near-impossible to cross by the chinese.

It’s exactly like how dumbledore was explaining how Voldemort actions created the prophecy itself in Harry Potter. Much confusion.,2024-03-04
"“He who controls the spice, controls the universe.”

Whether it's the BG, the Emperor, the Houses, or the Spacing Guild, each faction wants one thing--power. This is the realpolitik that Herbert reflects in the world of Dune. The BG's plan to gain power is the centuries-long eugenics program to create a superhuman, the Kwisatz Haderach (KH), which they want to use to gain control of spice. 

The purpose of planting the ""prophecy"" amongst the Fremen was because the BG knew they needed to control the Fremen in order to permanently take Arrakis, as well as all the other planets they planted prophecies, so that when they finally DO create the KH the road is laid for them to take control. So the BG controls the KH who controls the Fremen who controls Arrakis, therefore the BG ultimately controls the universe.

This plan is a choice on the part of the BG to manipulate individuals and societies to their will through propaganda, which is very different from a real prophecy which is a matter of divine pre-determination.

Their plan went off the rails when Jessica had Paul who eventually cuts the BG out of the picture--they can't control him. But he certainly used the groundwork they laid to seize power for his reasons. But that's beside the point.",2024-03-21

I mean on a general level he’s definitely freeing them. You can always argue people aren’t free if you look at all the intricacies of freedom. The people were an oppressed native population getting exterminated by the Harkonnens. Now they are leading an imperialistic crusade. ,2024-03-07
How is it a lie? They are completely subjugated by the Harkonnens and the greater Empire for the production of spice. The war is to take control of their own planet. Just because he has additional motivation doesn’t mean the war doesn’t primary benefit them.,2024-03-07
"But the goal of the eugenics plan is to create the Kizach Adarak, which is the prophecy",2024-03-17
The motivation n what sense?  The “prophesy “ is just a story the BG makes sure is around so the BG can take control of a population.  the KH is a breeding program to make a male BG.,2024-04-06
yeah that's what i don't completely get and think the movie did a terrible job at explaining. Are his visions genetic because his mom is Bene Gessiure? If so wouldnt pretty much most BG also see the future? Or is it because of the spice? If spice makes you see the future then why aren't there more people who see the future?

That the 'prophecy' ended up coming true is only a testament to how utterly brainwashed the Fremen were to believe that this white saviour was destined to save them. The prophecy could only come true *because* the Fremen were manipulated into believing it was true; by the Bene Gesserit for their own mysterious purposes, later by Lady Jessica to ensure her and Paul's survival, and then later by Paul himself to weaponize them to avenge his father and fight a war for him.

Even if Paul's intentions were good and the outcome of his actions positive, it doesn't change the fact that he achieved it by manipulating the Fremen through a false prophecy, one he didn't create but did fully intend to take advantage of from the start in order to avenge his father.",2024-03-31

"Is that the whole arc of what Dune / Paul's life is about? I haven't read the books, just seen the two movies and know nothing of the story except what Villeneuve shows. I don't understand Paul's development. Revenge - ok, understandable, got it. Wanting to fight ""alongside of"" the Fremen, since they share a passion for the common enemy - ok, yes. What exactly after he discovers he's half Harkannen makes him go on a rampage and seek submission of the Fremen, and declare himself duke? And his rage, and needing to take the life of the Emperor for it - yes, ok, but then to go on and want to fight the entire galaxy, where did that come from? The storytelling is just not compelling. 

He's never shown any ""ambition"" in that way as a person. He didn't even think he wanted to be his father's heir. He keeps relying on visions - but all things being equal, why follow the visions that lead to war vs. the ones from much earlier on that said don't even go South?

"This is correct, in the book Paul did not know who would win. He did not willingly get stabbed either.

There was undetectable poison on Feyd’s knife that made Paul move slightly slower in a dodge and feyd took him to the ground, and once feyd was on top, there was a undetectable small needle on his hip that was coated in muscle relaxants that he was going to use to help him kill Paul.

"So as the other two who answered your question already said: It one of the Bene Gesserit ""powers"". To quote the wiki here: [""*Physically, a Bene Gesserit could control every muscle and nerve in their body, right down to the individual fibers*](https://dune.fandom.com/wiki/Bene_Gesserit#Powers_and_abilities)"", which in Dune logic apparently allows for ""*Fertility Control: Exercising control over their own menstrual cycle and (at conception) their child's sex.*""

More importantly tho the Bene Gesserit have an (at that time) century old ""breeding program"" going. Their plan was for Paul to be a female and Feyd-Rautha a male and their child should've been the Kwisatz Haderach. Jessica (Pauls Mum) didn't give a flying fuck about that plan tho, because Leto (Pauls Dad) wished for a son. Their might also be some ego stuff going on here, in which Jessica is arrogant enough to think she can bring forth the Kwisatz Haderach herself.

So why is this now a problem: The Bene Gesserit want to be able to have control over the Kwisatz Haderach and with Paul (and by further extend all Atreides born) there is no control to be had. That's also why the Bene Gesserit try to delete the entire Atreides bloodline.

I must have missed the timing of the scene. I agree and your point makes sense but the timing seemed to be so immediately following being knocked back by him that I understood it as a direct reaction to his use of the voice.

"I'm familiar with the books, but in the scene, she did seem to direct it at Paul. However, we were shown the gom jabbar test in the first part, so his use of the Voice shouldn't come as a surprise to her. Perhaps it is because he used it on a Reverend Mother? She probably realizes at that point that Paul is the Kwisatz Haderach, but maybe she's angry that the Bene Gesserit aren't controlling him.",2024-03-01

"Right. But a baby gestates for 9 months. So that’s the maximum amount of time that the second movie can be set across. Consider that she already knew she was pregnant. So she was already a month or so into it at the start of the movie, so that brings it down to 8 months. And then by the end of the movie Alia wasn’t born yet and jessica also didn’t look like she was about to pop at any moment. So probably another month or so left before Alia is born. That leaves at most 7 months that the movie is set across. 

In the books, there’s about 5 years between when duke Leto is killed and Baron harkonen is killed. The chani line is probably just something that came from the books and wasn’t tweaked enough to work with the movie timeline.",2024-03-01

"> Paul is much less vocally conflicted about exploiting the myth in the book. In the book he and Jessica are pretty in tune about the plan with minimal dialogue going over it, all of his hesitations are internal. As such, taking over their religious leadership and Paul playing into the lisan al gaib role is much smaller of a dramatic point.

> 

Even in the movie, he starts off wanting to convert the Fremen.

Even when he throws water on Jessica fulfilling the prophecy, it's easy to see it as cynical (since he explicitly says he has to win over the skeptics and being humble was a way forward).

It's only after he falls in love with Chani - who is much more against this shit here - that he flips.",2024-03-07
"Also, to me it was pretty clear all of Paul’s actions were to save himself and his family. 

“Enemies all around us” and that scene where he describes how there’s one way for it at all to work and the bloodline to survive.

Due to this it makes his actions unquestionable as the viewer. All we know is every action he takes is required for his family to survive, and to do that he needed to marry the emperors daughter.

Bro wtf are you going on about. They didnt turn on shields cause fremen were sniping them from afar. If one of the harkonnens turned on their shields it would kill the rest of the harkonnens including the shield wearer.

"I don't disagree, though something like a directors cut where they adapt it by maybe having the external dialogue a bit more overt about the plotting, reducing the BG instincts other than maybe a glance you see from Jessica or Paul in the background as the plotters talk. Maybe one of the telepathic communication things they've danced on making a ""thing"" in the movies rights as Paul and Jessica think there may be a fight then and now.

Sometimes I remove shots and I say, 'I cannot believe I'm cutting this out.' I feel like a samurai opening my gut. It's painful, so I cannot go back after that and create a Frankenstein and try to reanimate things that I killed. It's too painful. When it's dead, it's dead, and it's dead for a reason. But yes, it is a painful project, but it is my job. The movie prevails. I'm very, I think, severe in the editing room. I'm not thinking about my ego, I'm thinking about the movie.""

On the other hand, without that money we wouldn't be witnessing that spectacle on the big screen. Quite a conundrum. It's such an intriguing universe, but the more I read about it, the more I'm surprised it was greenlit. Like, can a director refuse to continue the story even if it's hugely successful? Studio would get a new director and it would be a disaster, I'd imagine.",2024-03-27
"> I don't think they adequately explained that shields attract worm 

In part one Paul asks why they can't shield the harvesters, and Liet-Kyens explains it:    

""Shield's a death sentence in the desert.  It attracts the worms and drives them into a killing frenzy.""   

So there is some explanation for that portion.  

  Also in part two, immediately before the Sardaukar get hit with the projectiles when they land on the rock the leader says something about shields implying they knew not to use them while on the sand, but they start dying before being able to turn them on.      

The lasgun with Duncan's copter came up a lot in discussions when the first film came out.  There was some theories that the rockets that hit and showed the shields protecting the craft in fact disabled them since they look like they almost fizzle out, and it briefly cuts to an alarm in the cockpit right after they hit...but there is definitely nothing that specifically goes over the lasgun + shield interaction for anyone who hasn't read the books.",2024-03-04
"> In the 2nd movie we have a melee attack on a harvester, with a rocket that Chani shoots exploding against a thopter shield. But then during the 'opening' Paul created by baiting the thopter to shoot, the shield has re-activated and yet the projectile is slowly forcing its way through... ok, a bit weird.

I think the implication here is that the rocket is already partially through the shield, sort of stuck in between layers of it and thus manages to push through because it is going slow enough when caught inside (like the darts in the first movie).",2024-03-04
"Nothing about the greenlighting of the LOTR movies makes any sense but I'm still glad it happened.

> I was working with Tim Monich, who's sort of the godfather of dialect coaches and he helped me to really hone in on Stellan's voice and what he does in the film. It is also just figuring out how his childhood shapes him into who he becomes. When you're raised in brutality, you have a necessity for violence in order to be able to survive, so I think that ends up changing the way that his mind is.",2024-03-05

I definitely got the vibe that the viewer is supposed to be scared how fervent and obedient Paul's followers get, to the point that they're willing to wage a reckless and destructive war in the name of a vague, religious prophecy.

Fenring's brief encounter with Paul where he can't see him was just so cool on my first reading of the novel.

"Nah dude… I’m sorry, but the argument you’re making is silly, not supported by the original novel, and it just sort of seems like you’re insisting upon the way that you prefer to understand it.  

Maybe I did a shitty job of explaining it.  “The voice” *is* something that only special people can harness.  It takes a combination of god gifted talent and dedicated practice… and it certainly *functions* as a super power, but the book explicitly explains that it’s nothing more than a near-perfect understanding of verbal communication.

That’s what makes it so cool.  It’s not like any was bitten by a radioactive spider.  Certain people are just *that good* with their words.  

The idea that no one could be so good with words that they could convince other people to kill themselves is empirically wrong.  It’s happened: Jonestown, that girl that convinced her boy friend to kill himself, etc.

“The voice” is just a theoretical example of how far “the tools of humanity” could go.  

It’s not supposed to be a real thing.  It’s supposed to be something that makes you deconstruct a specific aspect of human progression.  

Once upon a time, humans just grunted at each other.  

Nowadays, we have complicated language, and some people are better at wielding it than others.  Some people can’t speak to a room full of their classmates, some people can stand in front of thousands and convince that crowd to commit heinous acts.

Dune is just asking you to consider what happens if we keep progressing down that path.  It’s asking you to consider the actual function of language.  The only reason you say anything out-loud is essentially to make or convince people to do things, and we’re all capable of “making” people do stuff with just our words.

Again.  I don’t need “the voice” to “make” someone punch me in the face.  I don’t need “the voice” to “make” someone call in love with me.  Say the right shit, and those things will happen. We all do it.  It’s how verbal language works.  

Dune is just turning that grounded fact all the way up to eleven.  So yeah, if we’re talking about a fictional universe in the deep future where generations of people have dedicated their lives to the mastery of rhetoric… I have no doubt they could make someone kill themselves with a few words.

PS.  You clearly misunderstood the Rembrandt analogy.  I wasn’t suggesting Rembrandt could make you kill yourself with an illustration.  I was just saying Rembrandt could do things with a stylus that many people might consider impossible.  We can all pick up a pen, but we can’t all use it the way Rembrandt did.",2024-03-03

Also in the book Paul and Jessica teach the Fremen the 'weirding way' that the Bene Gesserit fight. So they are the toughest men who could previously match the Sardauker now given training.

Because Paul controls the Spice he controls space travel. The Jihad is them picking off planets that resist one by one because the rest of the Imperium can't gather and mobilise.

The Houses refusing the ascendance was a change for the movie. In the books the Houses accepted but the Imperium is just so vast that securing that rule still required killing billions. However that's thematically weird to have so many die for so banal a reason - so the houses saying no worked well to set the stage for said Holy War.",2024-03-01

"> Which makes zero sense. Why would an elite unit bred and raised for battle be so heavily outmatched by sand people who have to devote their lives to surviving in the desert? 

The explanation for why they are so elite is that they live and survive in a nuclear wasteland but Dune is even more brutal and breeds the Fremen to be even more elite. The harsher the challenges, the stronger the warriors and while the Sardaukar face a greater trial than any of the Great House soldiers, the extremes of the Arrakis desert are even harsher.",2024-03-02

Yeah, I understand that now.

I get that now, my mistake. I wasn't trolling, just genuinely didn't grasp what you were saying.

>Btw I can't believe that you keep hand-waving away any war with that level of bloodshed, the religious brainwashing of an entire native people by foreigners etc as ""nothing bad""🙄.

This war doesn't happen in the film, and it's not made clear by the film alone that a war with untold levels of bloodshed will actually happen. It's only because of the books that you know this is true. There's nothing in the film to suggest that Paul's premonitions will definitely come true, and it certainly seems like his premonition after drinking the worm juice has shown him a new piece of knowledge that causes him to reassess his aversion to these visions. 

I accept that religious brainwashing is bad, but he rejects trying to do this until he gets the vision which seems to show he needs to do it. I think it's fair to say that the film implies he has noble intentions.",2024-03-21

"> I have not read the books so I can't really comment on the specifics

You can't really comment on any aspect of whether the movies are successful adaptations of the books, except whether the movies are coherent and intelligible stories in their own rights.

> For the movie, I honestly don't see how this has somehow ""obliterated the themes of the novel"".

Yeah, because you don't understand the novels.

The important thing is that this development now contradicts elements of the movies themselves.  The Spice is no longer the key to controlling the universe, as it is presented multiple times in the films including the very beginning of this film, because Paul seized control of the Spice yet the Great Houses defy him.

More importantly, if atomic weapons were the key to seizing control of the Spice, any of the Great Houses could have done so -- including the Harkonnens, who held control of Arrakis.

Not only was this change a bad idea in itself -- which I'm not going to bother arguing with people who haven't read the original novel -- it creates a massive plot hole.  The Saudarkar mean nothing against the massed forces of the entire Imperium -- that's an aspect of the originals preserved in these films -- and possessing the ability to destroy the Spice is the ultimate motivation to surrender.  Having armies in orbit is useless if the Guild won't cooperate, and the Guild is terminally addicted to the spice.

So why didn't the Harkonnens ever attempt to seize the throne while they held Arrakis in fief?",2024-03-06
"Why, no, it *doesn't* shine through, because all of the elements where that theme existed were removed from the story.

Stilgar is no longer slowly converted from an independent leader and thinker to a ""creature of the Lisan al-Gaib"", he's a devout believer who pushes Paul into a religious role from the beginning.

We don't have the increasingly fanatical Fremen becoming increasingly brutal, to the point that Guerney Hallack is disturbed when he realizes that his former pupil is Muad'Dib the vicious warleader.  We don't get him rebuking Paul for abandoning the Atreides code.

We don't have >!Paul either failing to foresee the death of his firstborn son, or choosing to accept it as part of the price he must pay for selecting a future that leads to victory!< -- that entire plotline is eliminated, as Paul's stay with the Fremen no longer occurs over years but a few months.

In short, we don't actually get any of the elements from the novels that Herbert used to illustrate that fanatical devotion to a leader both religious and secular was a terrible thing.  We don't get Paul's despair at realizing that it doesn't matter whether he lives or dies, the Jihad isn't something he can control.

The greatest overarching message of the novel, explored in its appendices, is that every group and faction that imagined itself in control of their plans and their situations were deluding themselves and were merely parts of a greater plan they didn't even imagine.

Paul's not a villain but he's not a hero either. He clearly has his back against the wall but a true hero probably wouldn't go through with the revenge plot knowing it kills billions.

"I think in both books Paul is a slightly unreliable narrator, which is ironic for an omniscient character.  He does a lot of ""oh noooo I once again have to do the thing that benefits me the most"" type of thinking.  I definitely agree he does a lot of hand wringing about it, but I take that with a grain of salt and think it's partially bullshit.  Paul talks up a big game about how the Atreides aren't like the other houses, and then he plays the exact same game just as ruthlessly as everyone else.

Denis is really doing a good job of making it clear that this is not a happy ending and that Paul is the worst thing that ever could have happened to the Fremen.  I think choosing to shift Chani to the skeptical role was a really good choice and it'll be interesting to see if he can sweet talk her back to his side while he destroys her people in the exact way that she's predicting",2024-03-03
"IIRC from the books, Paul is basically stuck in his role as the savior of the Fremen. He can’t stop it after a certain point and the reasons kind of start to shift. For him at first they have mutual goals, he wants to avenge his house and destroy the Harkonnens, and the Fremen want Arrakis to be liberated; and these happen to be the same thing. He does care about the Fremen though (sort of). 

But because Arrakis is the most valuable planet in the galaxy, the moment he liberates all the political intrigues kick up to gain control over it again. Which means it’s not exactly liberated. Which is fuel for the jihad the Fremen believe in. Without Paul to guide them, the Fremen lose their liberation. Without the Fremen, Paul has no army. Which is the whole reoccuring reticence he has about going South. He ends up being right, since nobody has a shot against his omniscience, so he’s kind of just stuck having to conquer the entire galaxy in order to preserve what he believes in.

Now I’m really rusty (it’s been like a decade since I read the books), and this next part I’m even rustier on, but I believe at a certain point, he kind of grows disillusioned with it. The Fremen are zealots and ultimately they never stop pursuing their goal. Paul gets tired of being this political messianic warlord, and eventually just gives up and wanders off into the desert.

However his kids tho…",2024-03-09
These were my thoughts exactly. I was very surprised / felt it was inconsistent with his character to go south.

"She's clearly going to play the same role despite being a different character. What Paul did was for movie Chani as well as beating Feyd Raytha. And movie Paul that's down the golden path would 100% manipulate because he has no choice. That's my point

Pre-Jihad movie Paul wouldn't care about being emperor and wouldnt care about taking Irulans hand. He'd just go off into the desert with Chani. But he can't because this is the path he has to take. So Pre-Jihad and post-Jihad Paul do different things.",2024-03-02

">Why exactly he's now determined to go to war with the whole galaxy is...not shown. 

It's kind of implied just on how big feudal societies like that work. The spice must flow and the wolves are ever at the gates, weakness of your own house leads to it's death. If the Fremen aren't absolute masters of Arrakis then they'll be made more and more slaves to whoever is. If Paul and the Fremen are going to take the throne they have to go all the way and make the other houses subservient to them.

Obviously just watching these movies doesn't make that explicit but they do allude to it. Especially so with a lot of his father Duke Letos lines about the danger Atriedes is in and how ""He who can destroy a thing has power over it.""",2024-03-10

"/u/MatchaMeetcha is mistaken.  The Reverend Mother literally said she advised the Emperor to wipe out Atreides because they were defiant and not as easy to control.  

In the books it's also explicitly stated that the real reason the emperor conspired against the Atriedes is because Leto inspired love from his people which was more powerful (and more dangerous) than the loyalty-through-fear the less benevolent houses practiced.",2024-03-18
"Part One: 

>Lady Jessica Atreides: Did you have to go that far?

>Gaius Helen Mohiam: You chose to train him in the Way, in defiance of our rule. He wields our power. He had to be tested to the limits. So much potential, wasted in a male. You were told to bear only daughters. But you, in your pride, thought you could produce the Kwisatz Haderach.

>Lady Jessica Atreides: Was I wrong?

>Gaius Helen Mohiam: You're lucky he didn't die in that room. If he is The One, he has a long way to go. His Sight is barely awakened, and now he goes into the fire. But our plans are measured in centuries. We have other prospects if he fails his promise.

>Lady Jessica Atreides: Do you see so little hope?

>Gaius Helen Mohiam: On Arrakis, we have done all we can for you. A path has been laid. Let's hope he doesn't squander it.

This is made clearer in the books\* but: Jessica was supposed to bear only daughters - who could be unified with other houses (Paul and Feyd are around the same age) to bring peace. 

She decided she knew better, had a son and that's what led to the outcome we see - in Part Two the BG basically seem disgusted by her stubbornness, the Emperor is fearful of Leto (especially since he has a son he could marry to his daughter and seize the throne) and the Atreides are destroyed as a result. The BG merely attempt to spirit away Jessica/Paul to a place where they can be controlled as a final hedge. 



\* Books: 
>""You thought only of your Duke's desire for a son,"" the old woman snapped.

>""And his desires don't figure in this. An Atreides daughter could've been wed to a Harkonnen heir and sealed the breach. You've hopelessly complicated matters.

>We may lose both bloodlines now.""",2024-03-18
"Oh right! Maybe the idea was that they hoped Jessica and Paul would, if they survive, flee as exiles and, no longer protected by House Atreides, would become subservient to Bene Gesserit.

Not sure.",2024-03-01
"There's probably some conflicting interests here too, it isn't like the Bene Gesserit control is 100%, even if they're very influential (we do see in later books that there are other strange groups like this). The Emperor himself was very concerned about the popularity of the Atreides with the other Great Houses. We don't get the full sense of it in the movie other than maybe at the very end, but the political arrangement in Dune is perhaps a little more like the Holy Roman Empire where all these houses have significant autonomy and influence, and meet to vote in a large council setup.

Ultimately, for the Bene Gesserit, it's the 'plans within plans' stuff. They have multiple bloodlines going because they can't risk their whole plan on any individual, when those individuals might do silly things like die in sword fights. Another scene we didn't get in the movie is Lady Fenring (the woman sent to seduce Feyd) discussing all this with her *husband* who was himself a 'failed' Kwisatz Haderach. So the idea is always that they have lots and lots of prospects. They'd probably never prefer anyone of their projects killed off if it could be avoided. If, for instance, Jessica had simply been captured during the fall of the Atreides, perhaps she could have been made to re-marry Feyd anyway.",2024-03-01
"I was thinking this exact thing too. I now think that they originally planned to eliminate the Atreides, but in Dune 1 there’s the scene where the imperial court comes to Caladan to oversee the stewardship of arrakis change. There’s a shot where the bene Gesserit is watching Paul. I think that, on this scene she sensed Paul’s emerging powers and sent for Gaius Helen Mohaium to come test Paul. I feel like they change there plans on the fly and after seeing Paul’s potential, they decided that they might be able to control him. Hence why in the following scene she tells Jessica that “a path has been laid, don’t squander it”. And also later when she asks the Baron to spare Jessica and Paul. They also hedge their bets, they gave Paul and Jessica a way out in case they can control him, but wouldn’t really care if they died because they have other kwisats haderach prospects.",2024-03-01
"This is mostly head canon, but it could be simply because the Reverend Mother asking the Baron to spare Jessica and Paul and declaring them to be under her protection guarantees that they won't wind up in Harkonnen hands instead.

The BG and the Emperor are using the Harkonnens for their own purposes, but they're not blind to Vladimir's own ruthless ambition. The last thing they want is him coming into possession of a Bene Gesserit who has basically gone rogue and her clairvoyant son. We've seen what Harkonnens do to their captives and servants after all. 

In the first movie we find out that the Harkonnens managed to get Dr. Yueh to turn traitor against House Attreides by capturing and torturing his wife (and possibly turning her into that fucked up six-legged ant-looking creature who the Reverend Mother dismisses using the voice when visiting Giedi Prime). What goes unsaid in the movie, though, is that Yueh's wife Wanna is actually also a Bene Gesserit member. So if the order are aware that the Harkonnens have previously captured one of their own and done horrible, twisted things to her, possibly learning some of their precious secrets in the process, then they have that much more reaosn to not let Paul and Jessica fall into his hands, even if the BG intend to kill them right after.",2024-03-02
"They wanted to eliminate their power base but probably wanted to preserve the genetic line, at least until they could get Paul to impregnate a BG.",2024-03-03
"I don't remember if that's how the movie portrayed it, but I just read that a few days ago in the book and the doctor (Yeau, I think?) that betrayed Leto to try and save his wife arranged to give Paul and Jessica a chance.

"No, they say it in the first movie that they don't use shields because of worms but that furthers my point. The fremen have built their fighting style around unshielded and using lasguns against unshielded opponents.

The Two Towers especially suffers because there is almost no action for the first half of the movie. You get Gandalf falling with the Balrog and then there isn’t an action set piece until the Warg attack. 

ROTK has a lot of great added scenes. Like Saruman, the mouth of Sauron, the showdown Gandalfs showdown with The Witch King. Gothmog’s death.",2024-03-01

Visual artists ranging from Egon Schiele to Georgia O'Keefe have had *public showings* of hundreds to *thousands* of variations that they have painted or produced on a single theme. Sometimes the exact same painting with that many takes.

And in terms of more of an exact ""behind the scenes/directors cut"" content there are soooooooooooooo many instances of artists whose ""notebooks"" we have (and publicly share!) which show dozens or hundreds of variations on their big artistic works before the final one.

Maybe they hadn't planned to share those notebooks, but in art schools, we *do* share them! Absolutely!!!

It's completely and utterly common with famous artists!!!",2024-03-06
"Oh yes, very well said and laid out. I do see the parallels there. The one thing that the book had in it was the plotting and scheming, in terms of the characters discussing their schemes beforehand. Obviously time is a factor but it was a 3 hour movie.

"So in the books there is actually two years time between the attack on the Atreides and Paul's revenge.

What happens during this time is that Thufir gets captured by the Baron. He gets poisoned by the Harkonnens, who are the only ones with the antidote, thus being forced to serve them.

Still loyal to the Atreides, but also believing that the entire house has been wiped out, he starts to quietly sabotage the Harkonnens, causing friction between Feyd-Rautha and the Baron, and gets his revenge this way. (The arena battle in the movie where one of the Atreides captives is not properly drugged is part of this.)

In the end when the Fremen attack the throne room, he finally discovers Paul has survived. The baron has a last ditch effort to wipe out the Atreides by giving Thufir a poisoned needle to stab Paul with. Paul who has foreseen this, offers his life and gives Thufir this opportunity as reward for his enduring loyalty to House Atreides.

However, Thufir, ashamed of and blaming himself for letting the initial attack happen, instead embraces Paul and stabs himself, giving his life for the Atreides one last time.

It's a very powerful scene, but I can see why it was cut as it would have required a lot of set up.",2024-03-03
"Ah. Sorry!

The other answer is great. But it doesn't speak to something left out of the first movie.

Initially Jessica and Thufir expect that one another are traitors. There's a great exchange where Thufir wanted to make an attempt on her life. What's nuts about this, at least from reading it. It happened right before they are attacked.

Then there's the back and forth that the other comment mentions. I would have liked to have seen that but you don't get a great sense of how important mentants are from the movies. Which again, is something I didn't like but it was still good enough.",2024-03-04

There is the one conversation with Jessica in the temple about the slim path forward, but IMO, that does not adequately convey or justify what he does next by storming into the circle and saying “IM HIM, follow me into battle”. Probably intentionally, it doesn’t show that there is no choice. Why must he embrace the messiah role? Why can’t he use his powers to forge another path? He should have had a discussion with Chani, his partner but also most vocal opponent to the fundamentalists and the prophecy.

"nah you’re wrong, I just rewatched the scene. Paul visually demonstrates it (to warm up he swings his knife at his own arm a few times and the shield activates when he swings fast but not when he does it more slowly).

It’s also heavily implied the explosion happens at both at the shield AND at the lazgun. You both die every time at the minimum, and probably everyone around both of you. There’s no cover or protection from that besides spacing your troops far apart from your laz gunner.

The shield/lazgun setup of the dune universe is a cool way to allow for hand to hand fighting (as well as the navigator ban on space fighting). But it makes tactical storytelling difficult because people end up doing illogical things. There should be way MORE projectile weapons when out in the desert since in many cases using a shield will put you at risk of worms. Elsewhere in the universe they’d be useless because people will just be shielded all the time. The worms change the math.",2024-03-10

Denis Villeneuve is obviously not a fan of exposition, and I really appreciate how he handled things. In two whole movies, it feels like we got 5 minutes of exposition. We obviously got a lot more than that, but it's used *so* sparingly - just a line here or there.

With that approach - and it being an important reason the movies worked IMO - how do you do a dinner scene that is 95% internal dialogue?

The only options I can think of are either through a ton of flashbacks, adding a bunch of cheesy dialogue, or literally hearing peoples internal dialogue. I don't see options 2 or 3 as viable, and option 1 probably results in a 30min scene to be done well.",2024-03-05

And I think book 4 (God Emperor) will be almost impossible. Not sure about book 3 (Children of Dune). Planning to re-read it soon, just going through Messiah again.

Now anybody can hold the spice hostage from space.) is what gives him power over the spice and therefore the Imperium, not the Emperor’s kindness. 

In the movie, the Landsraad refuses to accept his rule, sparking immediate Jihad at Paul’s command. But this is nonsensical. The guild and Landsraad would never do anything to jeopardize the production of spice. And it also shows that Paul was bluffing and his ability to destroy the spice is actually irrelevant because he won’t do it. And the Jihad was not commanded by Paul to gain control of the Imperium. It was launched by Fremen, beyond Paul’s control. The Jihad is the unstoppable death and destruction that Paul fears, though in the movie he is its’ principal instigator.

Jessica on the other hand, just wanted to use the Fremen as a resource for war. Unfortunately for the Duke, that philosophy gets you killed in the Dune universe. Paul only steamrolled when he realizes through his visions that he has to tap his Harkkonnen side. So you are right that the Atreides wanted to use the Fremen as a resource, but not initially. And it is only because of personal revenge, rather than political power.",2024-03-04
"What major Middle East conflicts was the US involved in before 1965? The US was fairly isolationist before the Second World War and shortly after they only really cared about stopping the spread of communism. Recency bias is a form of bias.

I think the point is more the general vibe of the Star Wars vs LOTR commercialization. One has done two unsuccessful adaptions of their source material but you can at least tell they were trying their best.

The other one essentially sold their soul to Disney who’s milking it for every drop they can. Seems pretty obvious to me that there’s a difference but that’s opinion of course",2024-03-13

"More than happy to help!

So I'll only talk about things that are mentioned in the movie or that were entirely left out by this point in the story:

1. Paul sees possible futures, not definite futures.
2. In all of his visions where he and Jessica survive, he becomes the Lisan Al Gaib, and this results in a universe-wide holy war that results in \*billions\* of deaths. He sees that following Jessica ""to the South"" is what causes this.
3. He is trying to find the ""Narrow way through"" his visions, where he and his mother survive but where he \*doesn't\* cause the Jihad. He wants to \*prevent\* the holy war, but without him and his mother having to die and the Fremen remain oppressed on their own world.
4. The reason he goes south is that the Water of Life can \*vastly\* improve his visions, their clarity and accuracy.  So even though he sees that as the first step towards the Jihad, he also thinks it's the only way to avoid it.
5. The problem is that Paul cannot see other prescients like him. They are invisible to him. In the book Lady Margot Fenring (the woman who sleeps with Feyd) has a husband he can't see at all, because he was a failed Kwisatz Haderach.  In the movie it's strongly hinted that Feyd Rautha is also partially prescient, which makes sense since (if you remember the first movie) Paul was supposed to be born a girl to marry to Feyd and their child would be the Kiwsatz Haderach, but Jessica disobeyed her orders and had a son because Leto wanted a son so badly. What this all means is that there are actions by people both living now and to be born in the future who are 100% absent from his predictions. So his predictions are inherently inaccurate.
6. The one important group left out of the movie is the Spacing Guild, they solely control interstellar travel. You cannot travel through space without them. Everyone has engines that cold fold space and move you faster than light, but only the Spacing Guild has the Navigators. Navigators use the spice to be partially prescient and see the future, this way they can avoid planets, suns, space debris, etc. that would just annihilate anyone traveling through space.  This is why the spice is all important. Space travel is impossible without it. Controlling the spice means literally controlling the galaxy. 
7. So this brings us all to why it's horrific.  Paul thought that trapping the Emperor, marrying Irulan (the Emperor's daughter) and taking singular control of the spice would \*prevent\* the Jihad. If the Emperor, the Spacing Guild, and all spice production were under his control then everyone would stand down and it would all be over. Makes sense, right? And that's what he foresaw. Everything that happens in the movie is supposed to be the ""Narrow way through"". The Great Houses were supposed to capitulate at the end...but they didn't.

So now we're in a situation where Paul is trying to prevent a holy war. He's sending his soldiers to go  force the Great Houses to accept him, but he's lost sight of the Golden Path, the Narrow Way Through. He's so certain, at the end of the movie, that getting the Landsraad (the Great Houses) to accept him will \*prevent\* the Jihad that he sends Stilgar and his fanatics to attack them....which is the first step of the \*beginning\* of the Jihad.

"Still, they cannot convince me or anyone to for example buy an ostrich egg by just walking up to me out of thin air on the walkway and saying ""BUY"". 

Excellence in rhetoric can certainly take someone far, but - at the point when you can make someone do something completely against everything they want, stand for and/or believe in by using one word or a short sentence without and previous priming of the target or any preparations - I do not agree that it can still be called just excellence in rhetoric, because you're not using any rhetoric really to achieve your goals.

No one can convince anyone to kill themselves in one short isolated sentence and I thought I made that clear in my original comment - that it's not possible if not connected or without some previous context.

In the same way I cannot use rhetoric in the way some of the politicians or philosophers or people who use the power of verbal manipulation on the daily.

The power of speech is already powerful, as it can literally sway crowds of millions at once, among other things. 

That is physically not possible for any being, there is no frequency that can achieve that, and any form of ""mind manipulation"" requires a lot of time and effort.

EDIT: Re: silly argument not supported by books - I'm saying that if it's described like that in books, then I don't agree with the logic in books and that the book trying to make it seem more logical is making it less realistic ironically, as it opens this ability and it's explanation to reader's scrutiny.

"Yep, the book ends in that room right after Paul claims the throne. It’s extremely abrupt.

Thing is, Herbert really wanted Dune to be about the danger of charismatic leaders and the cult of personality that forms around them, and one of the major vehicles he uses to express that is the religious fundamentalism exhibited by the Fremen when they thought they found their Messiah. 

The end of the first book, I think, is supposed to come as somewhat of a shock. Paul exploits these people, takes over the Imperium, and we can assume that the Holy War in his name occurs afterward. It’s not celebratory, there’s no falling action, and I suspect that was done with intentionality to leave the reader with a feeling of emptiness.

And yet, many regarded Dune as a cool badass hero’s journey white savior story, so Herbert then wrote Dune Messiah, the sequel, to *really beat the audience over the head* with the themes he was trying to convey in the first book. 

The movie ends in the same spot as the book, only with the full 20/20 hindsight of knowing what happens in *Messiah.* So in that sense, the ending of the movie feels a bit more like a cliffhanger than the book does, because it’s actively setting up the future that *Messiah* establishes. 

In other words, Dune Part 2 the movie feels like the version of the book Herbert would have written if he had *Dune Messiah* planned from the beginning.",2024-03-01

>This war doesn't happen in the film; it's not made clear by the film alone that a war with untold levels of bloodshed will actually happen. 

Is this SERIOUSLY your argument? The last dialogue of the film is literally ""The Holy War begins""🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️. The same war that has been explicitly stated (and bits of it even shown in Part One, in Paul's vision at the tent) to be galaxy spanning, and DEFINITELY with enough bloodshed to absolutely horrify even Paul, an heir to a Noble House, so presumably well-educated in the scale of past/historical wars.

>It's only because of the books that you know this is true.

Ok. At THIS point, noone can blame me for saying that you're some troll intentionally making dumbass arguments in bad faith. Cos it's either that, or you really ARE a ""media illiterate dimwit"" (your words, from your very first comment - not mine🤷🏽‍♂️) - because EVERYTHING that I've said so far, I've backed up using evidence from the films ALONE. 

It's not my - or the films' - fault that you haven't even watched the first one (or only seem to recall what you read off some piss poor ""recaps""), OR that you seem to be selectively blind towards everything OUTRIGHT SHOWN & STATED in the films that don't fit with your bewildering obsession with the idea that ""Paul is a 100% good hero according to these movies"". If you prefer believing that, then knock yourself out and say ""the Earth is flat!"" too, while you're at it (you probably haven't confirmed THAT with your own eyes either).

Forget Dune - even in other movies, do you always need *everything* S-P-E-L-T out & spoonfed to you MORE explicitly than this? I mean, What's next?! ""Characters in most visual media are actually incapable of pooping"" because they aren't specifically shown to be doing so onscreen? 

You're literally questioning even the most basic elements of the story here - if our extremely prescient protagonist has seen visions that the GALACTIC (read this word VERY slowly, as many times as you need, to understand the scale of it, ok?) Holy War will be shockingly horrible, then when the movie ends with THAT war beginning, how the HELL are you arguing that ""well gee, uh..., they didn't actually show that this galaxy-spanning religiously motivated war will *really* be that bad""?🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️

>I think it's fair to say that the film implies he has noble intentions.

So essentially your link just says some people don't understand critique and have a controversial take. Yeah sadly they do make the same mistakes with the films as with the book.

Yes Herbert wrote Dune Messiah to make it even clearer what his message was in Dune, but like I said, Villeneuve made changes in Dune Part 2 to dispel notions that Paul is ""saving"" Fremen so that audiences wouldn't have to wait years for a possible sequel to get it.

It's outright stated that the Fremen's prophecy is just fake propaganda planted by the BG multiple times. It would defeat a core purpose of this story (deconstructing chosen one & white saviour narratives) for Paul to ACTUALLY be a ""chosen one of fate"", & for stuff like Chani's ""Desert Spring"" tears - mixed with the Water of Life - to be the One Specific Thing™ capable of bringing him back to life for no conceivable reason BESIDES the prophecy being true.

You are getting quite aggravated, huh?

>The Spice is no longer the key to controlling the universe, as it is presented multiple times in the films including the very beginning of this film, because Paul seized control of the Spice yet the Great Houses defy him.

How is this contradictory? The Great Houses defying Paul despite him seizing control is an example of how desperate the Great Houses are at trying to *retain* that control, because of how valuable the substance is.

>and possessing the ability to destroy the Spice is the ultimate motivation to surrender. Having armies in orbit is useless if the Guild won't cooperate, and the Guild is terminally addicted to the spice.

Possessing the ability to destroy the Spice **shows who has the real control of it.** Holding the Spice hostage is not done to make everyone surrender, it is done to demonstrate that Paul and the Fremen **have the real control of the Spice**, and it is them who decide what happens to it and how it's used. Based on how the Fremen want to terraform the planet and change the face of Spice production, the Great Houses have no choice but to defy Paul and the Fremen.

">The greatest overarching message of the novel, explored in its appendices, is that every group and faction that imagined itself in control of their plans and their situations were deluding themselves and were merely parts of a greater plan they didn't even imagine.

That is not an overarching message or a theme or anything, plus it's in the movie.

>We don't have Paul either failing to foresee the death of his firstborn son, or choosing to accept it as part of the price he must pay for selecting a future that leads to victory

Paul clearly foresees bad things, including personal cost (Chani), and accepts it. You are essentially saying it's not enough, but that's not for you to decide based on having reading the book. It's for the audience to decide.

>In short, we don't actually get any of the elements from the novels that Herbert used to illustrate that fanatical devotion to a leader both religious and secular was a terrible thing. We don't get Paul's despair at realizing that it doesn't matter whether he lives or dies, the Jihad isn't something he can control.

I think you are overrating how much these themes are actually present in the novel Dune. They are not developed very well. Paul's despair is barely there. I have read many novels that made me feel despair; Dune is not one of them.

"The BG plan was for Jessica to have a daughter and then that daughter would have a son who would be the KH (one they conceivably could control better), but Jessica skipped ahead a generation. It violates the plan overall, but you're right that Paul (uncontrolled by the BG) becoming the KH still works with the much looser and interpretive tool of ""prophecy"" that was laid down as one component of the plan.",2024-03-28
"That's the point of Part 1 and why they didn't kill Paul even after he passed the test. Because he still qualified for the KH. Supposed plan was to have Jessica give birth to a daughter who then would marry a male Harkonnen (say Feyd for example) who then would go on to have the prophesized KH male heir. 

The thing is, BG knows the KH is a male and that's why he will be strong they are controlling the prophesy because they are also purposefully having BG control their body so that only females would be born and only when they are ready they would have a male on purpose. BG are still superhumans in that they can control others, their bodies and even whatever they consume.",2024-04-07
"Yah great question. The way I see it is the prophecy-believing Fremen are like a great power sword (and ofc with great power comes great responsibility) that the BG has crafted on Arrakis, for the KH to one day wield for the BG's designs. Paul's whole hesitation about going south is his visions telling him that if he picks up the power sword that is the prophecy-believing Fremen, he inevitably will be directly responsible for the horrific crusade that will sweep the galaxy under his name. So he's very reluctant to go south, because if he goes south, he knows events will require him to pick up that sword. It's not until the attack that he realizes he has no choice but to go south. So the scene rallying the Fremen is act of Paul picking up the power sword. He is stepping into the role of muad'dib to fulfill the prophecy-story laid by the BG by demonstrating his KH ""seeing"" abilities, thus making the prophecy-believing Fremen his devoted crusaders. He doesn't want to pick up this sword because of what comes after, but he knows it's the only way he can defeat the Harkonnens.

The BG don't want Paul doing this because they don't control this. They wanted Jessica's daughter's son to do it because they planned to have control of that KH.",2024-03-31
"Late but this is basically how it is, if Paul goes South (even by killing Stilgar) he would convince others that he was their Messiah. He can foresee parts of the future and him going to the south would mean he would bring millions (and even billions) to death.

Him speaking at the circle was him using his power to see the past. Remember KH can see all things past and the future.

"I'm only just starting to read the book, but it's what I've gathered from explanations of the lore from other book readers. The Bene Gesserit had been trying to carefully breed the Kwisatz Haderach along a number of bloodlines (the Harkonnens too). They thought they were very close to achieving it with the Atreides bloodline, which IIRC also had other advantages compared to other bloodlines that I don't remember.

To culminate their plan, Jessica was supposed to birth a girl that they would marry to Feyd-Rautha, producing a Harkonnen-Atreides Kwisatz Haderach. They were sure this child would be a Kwisatz Haderach, and it would also end the centuries-old feud between the Atreides and Harkonnens.

Jessica however was in love with Leto Atreides who wanted to have a son, so she desperately wanted to give him one (Bene Gesserit can choose what gender they give birth to). She also felt that, even though it was not what they had planned, she was already capable of birthing the Kwisatz Haderach if she produced a male. So she disobeyed her orders, produced a son, and gave him the proper training he would need from birth to be the Kwisatz Haderach.

As we now know, she was right. Paul had every capability that they had imagined the Kwisatz Haderach would have. The only thing he didn't have was the planned bloodline, but he did have the genetic capabilities. He wasn't literally produced in a lab, but he wasn't a miracle either, he was very carefully bred by the Bene Gesserit over the course of 10,000 years. A product of pure science.",2024-04-06

Paul was stabbed with his own blade somewhere on his left side below his chest.

The camera shows only a chest up shot of both, so we don’t see Paul’s right hand or his own blade that is still in his side at this point.

My understanding, and I’m pretty confident this is how it went down now, is that in one smooth motion, Paul directs Feyd-Rautha’s blade into his right shoulder/chest area using his left hand. His right hand (we don’t see this) at the same time removes his own blade from his side and deals the fatal stab to Feyd-Rautha.

"I think the confusion stems from the biggest movie/book change, which was the removal of the 10 year jump in the books that allowed Alia (Paul's sister) to be born and grow up into a 10 year old. Without that jump, we don't see what Alia becomes and why she is considered an abomination. 

BOOK SPOILER >!I understand why Villeneuve avoided the 10 year time jump but we miss two important book moments because of it: 1) The loss of Paul and Chani's first child in a Sardaukar/Harkonnen raid and 2) Alia's birth and growing up, in the book she kills the Baron herself by pushing him out of the ship.!<",2024-03-01

The Reverend Mother is the only reason Paul and Jessica are alive at all. If she hadn't said anything, they'd be dead. 

You'd have been better off sticking to movie canon. The books do say what you say, but they are also much clearer that Jessica's mistake of making a boy instead of a girl that could be wed to Feyd (as opposed to being a match for Irulan which makes the Atreides even more dangerous) to bring peace is a huge part of the problem. It made the vendetta unmanageable so the BG did the best they could and tried to save Paul.

*In the film* the BG say they *decided* (as opposed to made the most of a bad situation)  the Atreides had to die because they became ""defiant"" about the breeding program. And Jessica deciding to make an executive decision and  give rise to the Kwisatz Haderach had no part in that?",2024-03-18

"Thanks for the link, guess I missed that. But it's not like any of his movies have been much criticised for having bad dialogue. I think what he did with Benicio Del Toro's character Alejandro in Sicario is a good indicator of his actual stance towards dialogue rather than that quote from the interview which doesn't explain much and seems a bit devoid of context. He took a character that had a lot of dialogue and voiceover in the original script, and stripped most of it away to make him more of an enigma. Letting you discover who he is through his actions rather than the character telling you.

So I take it as him saying ""show, don't tell"" in a bit of an extreme way, with perhaps an unnecessary dig at TV lol. But getting back to the point, I don't think this movie would've been better off with a bunch of more dialogue. Especially since Part 1 is a bit more dialogue and exposition heavy, this movie having a healthier balance towards action makes viewing them back-to-back flow much better. 

I do understand and respect your PoV though, I haven't read the books yet so I can't comment on whether the dialogue left out was vital. His acceptance by the Fremen felt pretty organic to me, that's all I can say.",2024-03-02

I jump into a thread just to add-on to someone’s comment about “the voice”.  

Then I end up spending several comments clarifying my point to someone who clearly misunderstood what I was saying, clearly just wants *someone* to tell them they’re right, and clearly didn’t even read the book… which is clearly what my original comment was referring to.

Oh, you don’t think a specific detail of *Dune* is realistic?  Good for you.  It’s science FICTION.  

NOBODY is saying anything here is “realistic”.

You say no one could convince you to buy an ostrich egg… again, good for you.  You’re wrong though.  At the very least, you’re wrong to think your personal convictions mean that *no one* is capable of convincing *someone* to buy an ostrich egg.  You’re literally just describing sales-marketing, which is a very real thing, and you’re acting like it’s a ridiculous concept. 

Let me try this one more time….   “The voice” is a vague and theoretical “talent for making people do stuff with spoken words”, maybe even stuff they never would have done before hearing it.  That’s it.  The movie plays it as if it’s a Jedi mind-trick/superpower because that’s the way they chose to depict it.  The book doesn’t.  The book deliberately explains that “the voice” is nothing more than a comprehensive understanding of interpersonal perception, and a complete control of verbal communication.  The thing Frank Herbert was asking you to do is consider how powerful language is, how we use it to varying degrees of excellence, and how in a theoretical deep future… some folks might manage to get *really* good with it… yes, even to the point that they could make you kill yourself with a few words.

You’re trying to argue against someone’s explanation of a science fiction novel that you didn’t even read.  I’m not saying your opinions are wrong, and I’m not saying anyone could make you buy an ostrich egg… I’m just saying your argument is wrong, and I don’t understand your motivations in making it.

It’s like if someone referenced Tolkien’s work to explain why Gandalf was so weary of wielding The One Ring, then you roll up, having never read any of Tolkien’s work, to say they’re wrong… because Gandalf would definitely want the ring.   It would be such a confusing incorrect, and pointless argument to make.  

Like it’s not up for debate.  It’s in the book.  And the book is a fantastical allegory for generally grounded ideas.  If you’re hung up on how certain aspects of the allegory are unrealistic, then you’re missing the point of the specific allegory, and probably what an allegory is in general.",2024-03-03

">so why not just equip the imperial forces with guns to lay waste to them?

Because they were absolutely not prepared for fighting the Fremen. The predominant idea is still that there's just a handful of them living in the more habitable areas of the desert, and most of them must have gotten killed by Rabban on his campaign of extermination (Rabban, to his credit, does realize the potential of guns on Arrakis, which is why the ornithopters have them). 

But it's worth noting that the absence of shields is very distinct to the desert, because there they attract worms. The idea of waging war against people without shields is something nobody was really prepared for.",2024-03-14
"Yes and No. The Emperor's position is tenuous and requires juggling the needs and ambitions of the Houses. The Houses arent a single block. Each will act in their own interests - many seeking to claim the throne for themselves if possible. Having the Emperor alive and able to tell people 'I stepped down and my Son-in-Law is Emperor now' would greatly strengthen Paul's position. Which is how the book ends - with the Houses reluctantly accepting that Paul is emperor- for now (though they will 100% try to remove him from the position if the opportunity arises). The films emphasize that Paul is now an unknown factor with unknown goals who just committed a violent coup. It's fair that the Houses could be united in rejecting said claim. 


The politics of the Houses and the Throne is why the Atreides were sent to Arrakis in Part One. They had become diplomatically powerful enough that they could have potentially made a push for the throne - especially if after the Emperor's death if he had still failed to produce a male heir. They were seen as capable administrators and were very  popular. They were essentially close to a Civ Diplomatic Victory. Many of the Houses would happily see them in power. A succession crisis could see them empowered by wave of popular support to rule.

Meanwhile the Harkonnen's had become immeasurably wealthy during their stewardship of Arrakis. This had allowed them to amass a sizeable army. What the films didn't really introduce was that interstellar travel is managed by what is known as the Spacing Guild. A supposedly impartial corporation. The Harkonnen's were wealthy enough that they could and were bribing the Spacing Guild to favour their interests. It was plausible that given another generation on Arrakis they would have been wealthy enough to try to take the Imperium by force, bribing the Spacing Guild to strand opposing Houses and cut off trade to force submission to any coup. The Baron was aiming for his nephew Freyd to eventually be able to make a play for Emperor.

There were two Houses on the cusp of possibly usurping the throne. Giving Arrakis to the Atreides set the two Houses against each other. The conflict would greatly weaken the Harkonnen's who had to spend a fortune to first relocate off the planet and to then covertly return with an invasion force and reestablish themselves. The conflict itself would reduce the strength of their forces. Provided the Atreides were fully wiped out the two greatest threats to the Emperor would be pacified. However should the Atreides survive they would be in a much stronger position than ever - which is why the Emperor lent extra troops to the Harkonnens to ensure their victory.

The book spends plenty of time inside different characters' heads to explain the machinations of each faction, which is hard to translate to film. As a book reader all this felt represented on the screen - but the film doesn't dwell on or overly explain all of it.",2024-03-04

"Yeah, that's actually the reason I didn't like Messiah. It basically just says ""Paul is bad."" Over and over again for a couple hundred pages. I thought the visions of billions of people dying in a holy war were more than enough to understand where this was all going and the themes the author was trying to get across. Messiah just felt like it was written out of frustration more than necessity. But I guess since some fans STILL think Paul is cool, I kinda get why it had to happen.",2024-03-03

It'll be interesting if Villeneuve does adapt Messiah as that book is basically just one giant internal monologue of Paul saying he doesn't want to slaughter billions of people or the repercussions of that happening and the end of Part 2, he seemed to accept it more.",2024-03-02
"I've only read the first two books so I don't know all the details about the Golden Path (I believe that is really dealt with in book 3 and 4 when it starts getting really weird), but the way it is presented in the first book is that Paul realizes humanity is proper fucked with his godlike abilities, for reasons that are pretty weird and esoteric and probably wouldn't able to be transferred to film. It's described as a greater ""race consciousness"" of humanity growing stagnant and seeking turmoil on a grand scale on a genetic and downright sexual level. So when he goes to fight Feyd at the end, he's seeing increasing darkening and blindness of possible futures (in part because his threat to destroy the spice would lead to the end of prescience), but those that remain are that of the jihad. And he realizes that any attempts by him to change it even slightly at that point were futile, the jihad would happen even over his dead body.   
The movie changes Chani to being the one who is deeply disturbed by all of this happening, but in the books it is mostly within Paul's internal monologues that he hates his own role in it despite going along with it. But the mess he's gotten into is far greater than any personal desires for revenge or power, even if his earlier actions were based at least in part on those motives.",2024-03-02

"Good lord. I see that you really don't understand fhe point that Frank Herbert makes in this whole story. Paul is not a ""Messiah"", he is just a man that has ""powers"" that are human in this world. According to the books, the Kwisatz Haderach will be a male Bene Gesseret (BG) with the abilities of a Mentat, Space Guild Navigator, and BG all in one. Their ""ultimate power"" to be able to subjugate and control the universe as they (the BG) see fit since they will be able to ""control"" him as well. They fed this Messiah story to the Fremen to pacify and subjugate them for centuries as they ""wait"" for him to be born due to the BG's centuries of genetics manipulation. Why? Because of the Spice Melange, which is the single greatest commodity in the entire Dune universe.

The Spice Melange is EVERYTHING in this world. It's like if you had something in our world that could slow down aging to a crawl, extend your life for centuries, give you access to space travel, and was also Heroin all in one. The whole economy is based on this substance and it's only on ONE world that the Fremen also live on. Oppressing these people was the entire point of this economy, so they did it anyway they could. This was the one method that was wholly effective but it backfired on the BG because Paul didn't appear when they forsaw and was outside of their control.

""And Paul is not a ""charismatic leader"" , he is the messiah who can see all past and future... How can you now bow to that?"" - Except that's exactly what he was and he didn't want to do it at first because he knew what would happen if he used the Fremen to exact revenge on his enemies. If you rewatch Dune Part 1 & 2 again with this mindset, you will see that he says over and over again that he isn't their Mahdi and that it's ""heartbreaking"" what the BG did to these people in order to pacify them and gain access to the Spice Melange. He only finally does it because he wants revenge but he also sees that the Fremen Jihad is inevitable and cannot be stopped no matter what, even if he dies, it will still happen. 61 billion people dead and 90 worlds sterilised. In Dune Messiah, he even says that he cannot stop them, even if he tried, he has seen that they will kill him and continue on.",2024-03-08

"This is unnecessarily rude when I'm showing a strong amount of deference to you and am just trying to get a greater understanding of my interpretation of the film. I think you're overrating your ability to definitively know what is meant by the film, case in point below:

>then when the movie ends with THAT war beginning, how the HELL are you arguing that ""well gee, uh..., they didn't actually show that this GALACTIC war will actually be that bad""?

Because the film does not show that thing that begins will actually be what Paul's premonitions show it to be (some characters believe it to be the holy war, but why are we supposed to believe that they are infallible? Particularly when Paul appears to have had a premonition that shows him a ""narrow path"" that he must follow.) 

If Dune 3 were to come out and Paul uses some part of his premonition to effectively quickly win the holy war with minimal bloodshed, that wouldn't be some totally incoherent shift in the narrative, it'd be completely congruent with what has come before.

">How is this contradictory? The Great Houses defying Paul despite him seizing control is an example of how desperate the Great Houses are at trying to retain that control, because of how valuable the substance is.

How does refusing to acknowledge Paul as Emperor retain control of the Spice?  All that would do is ensure the Spacing Guild would refuse to transport their forces and their trade.

>Possessing the ability to destroy the Spice shows who has the real control of it. Holding the Spice hostage is not done to make everyone surrender, is to demonstrate that Paul and the Fremen have the real control of the Spice, and it is them who decides what happens to it and how it's used.

...and the only purpose to demonstrating that the Fremen have the ability to destroy the Spice is to force people to surrender and capitulate.

What, do you think it's to *impress* the universe into believing Paul's worth following?  The Fremen are holding a loaded gun to the universe's head, because the entirety of human civilization is dependent on the Spice, and the people who control that civilization are lethally addicted to it.

>I think you already answered that:

Nonsense.  That point reinforces that the Harkonnens could have seized control themselves, given the situation the movie presented.  If the Harkonnens had merely threatened to limit the production of Spice, the entire universe would have united against them.  But if they had the ability to *permanently destroy the Spice*, that wouldn't be possible.

Ergo, suggesting that the family nukes were sufficient to destroy Spice production means that the Harkonnens could have seized control directly and simply.  THIS IS A PLOT HOLE.",2024-03-06

"So the Harkonnens always hated the Atreides. It was more like the mutual goal of them, the Emperor, and the BG to destroy House Atreides.

The thing about Paul that’s tragic is that he never wants any of this. He never wanted to go to Arrakis. He never wanted to lead the Fremen. He never wanted the throne. But the events and characters keep pushing him to embody this constructed prophecy, except it’s not fake, because he goes and makes it real.

He did want vengeance. Which was pretty valid. But basically Paul had two options: go live in the desert as a hermit (not even with the other Fremen) or lead a galactic jihad. Those are the only two he ever truly had from when he was born. That’s where the Bene Gesserit fucked up. They got the wheels turning and finished their prophecy.",2024-03-10

">Is the water opinionated? Is it supposed to possess them and change them? Or is it neutral and just acts as a psychotropic? If the latter, then it can't make them anything.

One theory I have seen is that since the Water gives people a psychic connection to their ancestors it changes how a person thinks. And it seems to have amplified Paul's visions. And all of this has caused Paul to give less consideration to individual people and focus more on the overall state of the galaxy. Which also makes him more willing to sacrifice others.

>What exactly couldn't he accomplish in terms of revenge with a combination of war heads and the northern Fremen? Gurney was amazed what they had been able to do with 200 Fremen. Did Paul go south because it allowed him to gather a larger number of Fremen for fodder?

It the story was actual a pretty realistic look at asymmetrical military conflicts. In terms of weapons and manpower, the 200 Fremen were much weaker. There is no way they could beat the Harkonnens in direct combat. So, instead, the Fremen used guerilla combat striking at the weak points of the Harkonnens. With the most obvious target being Spice production. The Harkonnen had to get Spice but it meant going into Fremen and Sandworm territory. Paul at the spice production to slowly weaken them. But, in conflict guerilla combat alone rarely wins wars. For example, while the nascent American nation was famous for guerilla combat this didn't win the war alone. It weakened the British but the war was won through battles like Saratoga where the American Army engaged the British in a traditional battle. 

And in this same way while the Fremen were doing significant damage to the Harkonnens this wasn't the same as actually beating them. And even if the Harkonnens eventually lost the Empire's favor and had Arrakis taken from them it would just mean another Great House for the Fremen to fight. What Fremen and Paul needed was a significant direct victory against the Harkonnens that would drastically change the status quo.

And this is where the going South came into play. Paul's actions had drawn the Emperor to Arrakis but the Harkonnen's city was still secure. And while Paul could have theoretically just nuked the city killing the Emperor and the Baron this would have also just been a temporary victory. The Great Houses would have selected a new Emperor and one or more Great Houses would have invaded Arrakis again, this time being aware of Paul's atomic weapons.

So Paul needed to capture the Emperor alive to gain negotiating power. And he also wanted to capture Harkonnen and Imperial equipment which would have been destroyed in a direct nuclear attack. The Fremen don't have ships which would make fighting the Great Houses difficult.

In order to capture the Emperor Paul needed more soldiers. he would be assaulting the main Harkonnen reinforced by elite Imperial soldiers. The Emperor wouldn't have traveled to Arrakis without enough manpower to protect himself against either Paul or the Baron. With just 200 Fremen Paul would have lost the battle, they just didn't have the manpower to take the City. But, the Fanatics of the South greatly boosted his soldiers.",2024-03-06

"But people don’t use laz weapons against shields. It’s one of the conceits of the story. There is a huge sense in making yourself a live bomb if it’s infinitesimally small chance it will go off and the alternative is getting a bullet to the brain. 

The shields exist, they are used in the movies. People don’t ever suggest they don’t use shields because they are afraid of getting blown up. They don’t use lazguns because of the blow up chance. If robots existed in the universe (which they don’t because of the Butlerian Jihad) you could have a remote laz gun turn the patrol into a bomb. That would be a good use. But we don’t see the Fremen doing suicide tactics. 

The patrol was getting slaughtered, a soldiers suggests shields and he is ordered not to. It doesn’t make much sense. And that’s okay, I loved the movie. It’s tough to make concepts gel sometimes when you’re juggling dozens of threads and want a certain visual to occur.

Given his father's popularity, there's no reason the rest of the galaxy would really be that bothered by the Corrinos being overthrown, especially when their crime of conspiring with the Harkonnen came to light and with Paul marrying into the family. 

Denis , I think , made it all make more sense. Irulan is *much* more hesitant to marry him, clearly is afraid of him, and does so only under coercion. This much better explains what she does in the next books. 

With the Landsraad refusing to accept him, the war starts right then and there and it makes perfect sense why it starts and we see in people like Stilgar and his fanaticism why it's going to get so bad.

Besides that, this isn’t a big plot line. If this is considered a big plot point, why wouldn’t you explain how a crysknife is acquired? Why wouldn’t you explain why there’s only worms in certain parts of the desert? Why wouldn’t you explain why they have to use spice to navigate? Why do you lace your boots differently?

"> Good lord. I see that you really don't understand fhe point that Frank Herbert makes in this whole story.

Well, considering he wrote the second book because people were not ""understanding his point"", maybe he didn't really make his point well. And I have only watched the movies (although I now started the book, super excited to see this world fleshed out!). But let's get to what I think is the crux between me and you:

> . Paul is not a ""Messiah"", he is just a man that has ""powers"" that are human in this world.

Don't you see the contradiction in this? How is he ""just a man"" when he has powers that no other man has ever had? 10000+ years, hundreds of billions, maybe trillions of people in all of history... and only him has ever managed the seemingly impossible feat to achieve all those powers! It might be orchestrated by the BG for centuries and what not, but the fact stays that he is the only one who has ever done it! He is the definition of super human, he transcends humanity... he is a God! Maybe the Messiah to some who were waiting for such figure? So let's get to the second part of your post, about the prophecy.

Yes I understand that those are all lies to keep the Fremen docile and easily exploited. But what happens when those lies actually happen? What happens when the prophecy becomes the real and the Messiah appears as predicted (in those fabricated lies)? They stop being lies.

This whole convo was born because I disagreed with someone calling Stilgar ""blinded by faith"". I stand by that point. All those  ""purported"" lies are not lies anymore. They are just reality. He absolutely is the Fremen Messiah, no matter the terrible consequences of that.",2024-03-08

Feyd is a different character from his book counterpart. Your suggestion is for him to have say the artedies are weak but that scene was not depicting a weak fighter. You want him to boast but what does boasting accomplish, other than weakening the character that was shown to value honor.

MOST importantly - are YOU seriously saying that the Fremen's Lisn Al Gaib prophecy, which was outright stated multiple times to be fake, is TRUE lol? Because if you're saying that it was ACTUALLY Chani's tears that helped wake Paul up - HOW? The only explanation for why this random Fremen woman would have such an ability (on top of having the secret name ""Desert Spring"" that's specifically from the fake prophecy, & in relation to exactly such a situation) would be the prophecy being true, Paul actually being a true Chosen One, etc, which goes against some of the most important themes of this work.

You've GOT to understand that Villeneuve has made changes in the film specifically to AVOID people confusing Paul to be a real chosen one of the Fremen's prophecy. He's even said it himself in interviews! Herbert himself regretted that so many people misunderstood Paul in this regard after reading the first book as well.

">How does refusing to acknowledge Paul as Emperor retain control of the Spice? All that would do is ensure the Spacing Guild would refuse to transport their forces and their trade.

Again, I don't know how things go in the novels, but as the movie portrays it, The Great Houses *and by extent,* the Spacing Guild would 100% be onboard with defying Fremen leadership and fight back against Paul and Fremen for the same reason that they are addicted to the Spice! I don't see this as a contradiction. Less nuance than in the books? Sure!

>...and the only purpose to demonstrating that the Fremen have the ability to destroy the Spice is to force people to surrender and capitulate.

Exactly! But in this Universe they did not choose to do that and for logical reasons as I explained above!

>What, do you think it's to impress the universe into believing Paul's worth following? The Fremen are holding a loaded gun to the universe's head, because the entirety of human civilization is dependent on the Spice, and the people who control that civilization are lethally addicted to it.

Again, exactly that! I could not have said it better myself. Control of the Spice can't be given to the Fremen who absolutely *loathe* the Imperium.

>If the Harkonnens had merely threatened to limit the production of Spice, the entire universe would have united against them. But if they had the ability to permanently destroy the Spice, that wouldn't be possible.Ergo, suggesting that the family nukes were sufficient to destroy Spice production means that the Harkonnens could have seized control directly and simply. THIS IS A PLOT HOLE.

I think the movie is making the argument that absolutely NO ONE would hinder Spice Production, but the Fremen. Which is why nuking the entire planet is an OK substitution than what is used in the novels.
