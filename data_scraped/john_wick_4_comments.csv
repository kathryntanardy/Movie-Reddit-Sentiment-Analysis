"For such a long movie I though it was incredibly paced. It got a little exhausting leading up to the final confrontation, but then you were rewarded with the one two punch of the dog peeing on the main goon, and the best exchange of the movie:

“Remember your daughter”
“Fuck OFF”",2023-03-24 02:39:37

"Sometimes John Wick worldbuilding is like: 

""there exists an old tradition of duels against the High Table - to challenge, you must need the blessing of a crime family, but if you are labelled excommunicado, you must first receive a new crest symbolizing your loyalty to said family"" 

and sometimes John Wick worldbuilding is like: 

""his name is Caine because he has a cane""",2023-03-24 02:04:22
"Seeing this in Dolby was incredible. That theater was *shaking*. 

Also I wasn’t bummed or sad when John Wick died, I was honestly just relieved this man finally got his peace",2023-03-24 02:22:14

That top down dragon’s breath sequence was an all-timer,2023-03-24 02:19:20
"No but seriously:

-John Wick staying super quiet while Caine is holding a gun in front of him was a phenomenal break in the action.

-Berlin was brutal.

-Place de l'étoile being such a mess of a fight is what John Wick was made for. Crazy, brutal fight scenes. Get hit by a car, bit by a dog, shot by John Wick. Hell, this was a wild ride. 


The Marquis was one of the best vilain in this franchise. ""Nobody"" kinda steal the show emotionally.

Caine was just plain surprising. ""Let me guess, 5 of a kind?"" was a funny line, but man, Donnie Yen is just so physically present in all those scenes that I preferred his actions scenes above all else. 
Very fun movie.",2023-03-24 07:26:47

Caine using a pencil to stab Tony Robbins was a nice touch. Love the mutual respect between Caine and Mr Wick.,2023-03-24 03:34:16
That scene of John Wick vs Nobody and then hesitating when he saw Nobody's dog in danger to make that split second decision was PERFECTION,2023-03-24 04:12:18

The cinematography in this movie was absolutely incredible. The still of John Wick with the Cherry Blossom tree at the Osaka hotel might be one of my favorite wide shots in recent years.,2023-03-24 04:00:41

"An almost 3-hr wild ride

- Killing the Elder felt like a leftover plotline from the 3rd movie
- Didn't expect Charon to get killed so fast after Lance Reddick's death 
- Japan sequence was honestly amazing! The nunchucks takedowns were so fun 
- Rina Sawayama had a great debut. I am more interested in her character than the ballerina spin-off
- 2nd act is probably the weakest as it had to lay a lot of exposition
- Arc de Triomphe sequence on foot was exhilarating. The extended overhead shot of the kills in abandoned house felt like a video game
- Audience were shocked and winced when John Wick rolled down the stairs all the way to start and audience was pumped when he teamed up with Donnie Yen
- Night time cinematography is perfect in this!
- Final duel was intense as hell and the final shot by John Wick was immensely satisfying! 


A insanely satisfying conclusion with 10+ action set-pieces!",2023-03-24 02:07:29
"The soundtrack is SOO GOOD 

We got the OG LED Spirals song from the first movie in a sequence that will go down in history.

And then we got Genesis from Justice on the stairs fight?

I have to watch it a second time just because I was gushing so hard the first time",2023-03-24 02:14:49
I’m sad that there isn’t more appreciation for Fat Scott Adkins beating up John Wick,2023-03-24 03:39:09
Donnie Yen’s character was a treat to watch on screen. The combination of martial arts and gunplay was so fluid. It allowed Donnie to use his background and expertise while still feeling like he belongs in the John Wick universe. Him being blind was the cherry on top.,2023-03-24 02:28:34
"Bill Skarsgaard even ties his tie like a dickhead. 

There might be more action in the last act of this movie than in the previous 3 movies. Thats how insane it was. The overhead shootout with the dragons breath rounds was *Chef’s kiss*. Donnie Yen was such a natural addition to this universe and I really enjoyed Shamier Anderson’s character as well. Keanu Reeves proves he’s as gifted a physical actor as there ever was. Just a fantastic action flick.",2023-03-24 02:18:23

"Few things I was thinking of during the movie (in no particular order):

- “It’s been an honor, my friend.” :(
- Tracker’s dog pissing on the dude’s head got insane laughter in my theater.
- The characterization really blew me away. A lot of these characters could have been one-off scenes but they played into the story a ton and I loved it and seeing their dynamics.
- The action, holy goddamn shit. On paper, it should be exhausting, but it never once got tiring. Was never too short or stretched thin, it was the perfect length. The aerial shots, the NUNCHUCKS, all of it. Beautiful.
- That “FUCK OFF” from Donnie Yen was quite amazing.

All in all, I really loved this and it’s the best one in the franchise imo. Can’t wait for Mission: Impossible to give us more great action this year.",2023-03-24 03:20:30
Scott Adkins was fucking awesome. Damn near jumped out of my seat when he did that roundhouse kick on wick lol,2023-03-24 05:29:10
"I loved the fact Caine's blindness was actually a marginal impairment to him. Had to actually check where he was walking and missed a few shots.

Those arrow kills were freakin narly.,2023-03-24 02:07:42
"This is basically three climaxes, in a good way. Each of the action sequences -- Osaka, Berlin, Paris -- could top off another action film, but they all feel different for their moments in this one movie. Osaka has two armies going at each other with elements not seen anywhere else in the series (look at Keanu, making nunchucking look easy), the music gives Berlin an otherworldly atmosphere and the lighting is amazing, and Paris just goes balls-to-the-wall with the bombast. John shooting bad guys while driving? Fistfights in traffic? Incendiary rounds? Someone changing sides just because John saved his dog? Hell yes. This movie was great, and while it felt long, it definitely wasn't *over*long.

Random thoughts:

* Charon dying was bad enough, but after Lance Reddick's passing... Rest in peace, both of you.
* I saw this in Dolby Atmos. The movie doesn't have bass, it has ***BASS***.
* Winston tightening his fist is one of his most emotional moments in the franchise.
* I wish we saw more of Akira. I liked her fighting style, ~~but her feud with Caine doesn't really mean anything since it's her last line in the movie~~. (Did some Googling. Apparently she's stalking Caine in the post-credits scene, which I didn't stick around for. Neat for the next movie, less so for this movie.)
* Speaking of Caine, I like the way his blindness does hinder him in some ways. When he fights John in Osaka, there are several times where he aims at John's head and misses simply because he can't see that John's ducking. I also feel like he doesn't use the environment as much as John; John might slam his enemies into railings, lampposts, or walls, but Caine largely uses his own skills. And at the same time... doorbells? Awesome.
* I actually like that after Mr. Nobody gets smart with the Marquis, he gets his hand stabbed to a table. Why do wiseasses never get slapped and/or shot by the bad guys for mouthing off? And it gives Nobody a chance to put his money where his mouth is.
* If you're in a club and see John, just leave immediately.
* The radio station: WUXIA.
* Alongside *Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning Part 1* (Jesus, that's a mouthful), this is one of two movies to release in 2023 to have a car chase with all the doors ripped off the car to clearly display it's the actor doing their own driving.
* I feel like the traffic fight and people getting thrown into cars is the filmmakers' way of taking the piss out of John getting hit by cars so often.
* John doing donuts around mooks and just unloading into them made me cackle like nothing else.
* ...Until those overhead long shots with the Dragon's breath rounds. Holy shit.
* I want to see Mr. Nobody team up with Sofia as elite assassins with attack doggos, only for them to not vibe at all and split ways almost immediately.
* Falling down four flights of stairs in one shot? Damn.
* >!John dying at the end!< is... weirdly satisfying? It's like there's no other way this could have ended and >!makes the entire series into this impressively melancholic tragedy!<.",2023-03-24 02:05:50
"As of right now that entire action sequence in the Arc de Triomphe is the one to beat this year. That whole section was spectacular.

One criticism I did have was that this is probably Keanu’s worst performance as John. The way he delivered lines felt like an alien speaking English for the first time. Very odd. But his physical performance in the action sequences was great as always.

Anyway, I really liked the movie. It’s easily the best of the John Wick sequels.

Also loved The Warriors homage with the lady at the radio station.",2023-03-24 02:09:04
"I couldn’t help but be reminded of the days of laser tag when people would cover their weak spots anytime someone covered their face with the Kevlar suits.

"This movie was a fucking vision. Just got out of a Dolby screening

1.	Donnie yen…what a fucking badass. The blindness felt real even though it would be crazy in the real world to assume he could do any of this. 
2.	the Osaka fight…fantastic seeing new fighting styles and weapons (lots of blades and bow/arrows. 
3.	Clancy brown - that’s all. Always great in everything. 
4.	Lance reddick - what a badass. Gone too soon both in the series and in life. RIP. 
5.	THAT FUCKING OVERHEAD VIEW FIGHT IN PAROS - stunning. A revelation. Something new. Truly felt like watching a video game in the best possible way why staying very grounded. 

I’m intrigued to see where they go after this. Is there a 5? Is it just spin-offs? Will lionsgate finally be the studio to let a main franchise series die? Check back in in a couple of years I suppose.",2023-03-24 02:16:05

"The stair scene with the explosive rounds. C’mon dude. I was in a delirious state of laughter from just sheer awe. When the camera started to float up I mean it was just sheer brilliance. And what a perfect moment for “John Wick Mode” to kick in. 

Chad Stahelski ascended to the heavens as a director with this film. Keanu has been there as an action star but after this he too ascended. Double ascended. 

This shit is a masterpiece. I can’t get over how beautiful it was in story and action.",2023-03-24 03:40:28

"Take any 1 hour segment from Terminator 2. From Aliens. From Die Hard. From any Hollywood action movie in the last 50-60 years that you’d put in the usual “greatest action movies” list. 

The final hour of this movie rivals those. 

For many, this would be the defining action franchise of the generation. I’m so fucking glad these movies exist. I don’t think I’m in some tiny minority when I look at older films from the 80s and 90s and feel “they don’t make ‘em like they used to”. Whether or not that feeling is rooted in reality or not is irrelevant. It’s just a feeling one gets from watching a certain kind of movie that you know will never be replicated again. There may be better movies, but it wouldn’t be this kind of movie in this kind of way. To me, that’s what “they don’t make ‘em like they used to” means.

20 years from now, many will look back on the John Wick movies and this movie in particular as a certified “they don’t make ‘em like they used to” relic.",2023-03-24 05:55:45

THEY REUSED THE NIGHTCLUB MUSIC FROM THE FIRST FILM AND IT WAS GLORIOUS,2023-03-24 03:37:12
"That was the most thrilling action film I've seen since The Raid 2. That single take action scene is one of the best action filled scene I have ever seen. It was just beautifully done.

It's like they took everything of what worked before and injected steroids. We even had the same iconic soundtrack from Wick 1, the club scene. The additions to the cast were STELLAR, and the cinematography was top level.

My entire theater was laughing but not in a bad way, like in ""this is awesome"" kinda of deal. And as corny as it is when it was done a lot of clapping.

That shit was awesome.

I'm firmly in the ""John ain't dead"" camp. His dog looking at the distance, John got the same wound he gave to Caine, and what better to way to completely cut ties with your former life if everyone thinks you died?

But I get thats left ambiguous for a reason.

What a great franchise. Couldn't say enough of it.",2023-03-24 02:19:20
"In my humble opinion, one of the greatest action movies ever made. The action, the cinematography, the music. Everything was on point this movie. 

Unlike the desert sequence in JW3, there is not a single part of this film I would remove. Also Donnie Yen played a blind fighter so incredibly well. 

I think the single take shootout in the building after Arc De Triomphe is one of the greatest action set pieces ive ever seen. I had a massive cheesy grin on my face the whole time. Only interrupted by grimaces at the sheer brutality of those Dragon Breath rounds. 

What a film.",2023-03-24 05:06:26
"My favorite out of the 4, it was excessive, in the best way possible. I almost don't even want them to make a 5th because I kind of just want it to end on a high note.

I can't believe Donnie and Keanu are almost 60.


Loved the usage of the three cities...the bouncer from Berghain having a cameo cracked me up.

"Chad Stahelski has really become a great director.
Perfectly paced, innovative cinematography and a good story! 
You gotta see this film, especially if you're a fan of the franchise. 
 
Edit:  Though I was confused as to why the weapons of choice for Berlin night club henchmen/bouncers were identical axes. 
*shrugs*  Axes, really?",2023-03-24 03:30:43
"Early front runner for best action movie of the year, I loved the top down segment it was very hotline Miami esque. Rina Sawayama was a real standout as Akira, I think I knew a song or two of hers passively (edit: Ive had *who's gonna save you now?* in my main playlist for who knows how long) but this will certainly be her spotlight introduction for a lot of people. Donnie Yen was also fantastic, I can’t believe Ip Man and Neo have a duel while Pennywise watches.

The timing was incredibly unfortunate in regards to Lance Reddick and his role here. I saw a screening a few days prior to his passing, so I’m unaware if they added anything in post for him. I hope they did",2023-03-24 02:13:49

"I was really worried going in, just based on the run time and the fact that these have gotten sillier with each entry, that this would finally cause it to buckle under the weight of its world building. In fact it's the opposite. This is the most cohesive the world of Wick has ever felt and goddamn it, it just may be the best one so far altogether. 

I loved everything about this and really think I'd put it at the top of the 4 followed by the OG,3, and 2. Everything I disliked about 2 and 3 still exists here but the way it is handled just worked so much better imo.

Donnie fucking Yen, man. What a God. 

I think I'd be comfortable giving this a perfect 10/10 as far as action epics go. It's basically the best I've seen since Fury Road. Wow.",2023-03-24 02:16:00

"I swear this movie has given me the biggest dopamine rush I’ve ever had, I don’t think crack itself would make me feel the way this movie made me feel. An absolute 10/10 for me and easily my favorite in the series. Love the John Wick series so much and Keanu so much more 🖤🖤",2023-03-24 03:14:38

With every new John Wick movie they always find ways of keeping the action sequences fresh and original. Very much enjoyed the Donnie Yen sequences/moves.

Winston to John towards the end (duel), “Just have fun out there” got a huge laugh from all of us in our showing.

"I'm going to try and get through this review without being too hyperbolic, but if you'd allow me one gushing superlative, I think between this series and Mission: Impossible and The Batman we are in an era of elite action. And I think I just saw the best action film of that era. 

I'm really high on this series. I remember seeing the first one opening night having no idea how good it was going to be or what would be born of it, and looking back now and rewatching them all like I did this week it's hard not to be just totally impressed. Not only by the many ways they've found to expand this lore and keep the fights fresh and fun, but also at the singular idea that was so clear in Chad and/or Keanu's head from the first movie and the way each movie has evolved and been slightly different but also exactly what I've wanted from them. 

This movie just fucking rocks, as does this whole series. While I appreciated Parabellum's focus on action and loose narrative strength, this movie seems to find a great balance between character and build up and action. Whereas Parabellum starts with 20 minutes of pure action, after the initial and quick horse fight there is basically a 20 minute wait before we see a fight here. And when it comes it comes huge with the Osaka Continental fight. This movie is less about constant action, and more about building up big set piece fights with proper dualogue and weight and it works so well. This three hours flew by and I can't wait to see it again. 

John Wick 3 was a lot about the commerce of relationships. When John had nowhere to turn, he turned to those that couldn't turn him away. These movies don't hold our hands, they don't always explain the backstory to us. In classic Wick fashion, a lot is conveyed with few words. But in this movie we see just how deep some of those loyalties go, and to an extent what it is about Wick that garners such loyalty. He is as cold of a killer as you'll find, but he somehow still finds ways to do the right thing. 

**Worth noting I'm about to get into major spoilers.** 

This is really well shown by the end of this movie. The conundrum of Wick has always been, how do you keep topping them, how far will they go, how much can you defy the table and still live if they're so powerful? And in the respect of all those questions, I absolutely loved how this series wrapped up. I'm not saying it's impossible to bring Wick back, but if this is truly how his story ends I think it's a fantastic end. Not only did he find a way to free his old friend and save Yen's daughter, but he was killed without the table imposing any will on him and by his very deserving friend. It was in an act of self sacrificing kindness. It just felt so right. 

And can we talk about Donnie Yen? What an incredible addition to this universe. I loved all the new characters, but Yen's physicality was unmatched. He moved like he was conducting a symphony and played the character like no one else could have. I loved how he wasn't some Daredevil esque super powered person. He was clearly very blind and still a force of death. Also loved how this movie was comprised of three assassins, all with different angles, all representing the ways you could serve or defy the table. 

I haven't even gotten to the really good stuff. The tightly choreographed and high quality action. I mean there's just too many great moments and fights to name. The Osaka raid was an amazing sequence. The Kingpin (I've been calling the poker guy Kingpin) sequence. The Arc De Triumph car combat. THE DRAGON BREATH SHOTGUN. Like holy shit, for the fourth installment of a series that has minimum an hour of action per film, they still aren't out of gas. My entire theater was hooting and hollering at the balls out and hilarious physical combat. 

I don't think I'm crazy to say this is a 10/10, and even if you can find something to dislike in this movie, this is one of the most consistent and well delivered trilogies/quadrilogies that exist. I have no idea what they'll do from here on out but they've built the foundation for an amazing universe and I just hope Chad Stahelski keeps directing a lot more even if he's done with this IP.

"Why did John decide to visit the Osaka Continental? I don’t think he got anything out of the visit and all it did was bring destruction to another establishment managed by a good friend of his. I find it hard to believe that after all the trouble that John brought on Winston and the NY Continental, he thought it would be okay to show his face at another friends hotel. John had sought refuge in the Bowery safely before, so why not go back there? Although the action scenes were entertaining and it was great to see Hiroyuki Sanada kicking some ass, were those the only reasons for this story arc to exist in the movie?",2023-03-24 02:50:56
"Man I absolutely loved the movie. Felt very proud as an Asian gal to see Rina Sawayama kicking ass in such a gorgeous ensemble. I freaking loved the characters of Donnie Yen and Hiroyuki Sanada, they had so much character and you felt for them despite them being introduced in this fourth installment alone. This is quite particular but I love that they have the actors representing their native ethnicity - Donnie Yen speaks in Cantonese (which I understood!), Hiroyuki and Rina in Japanese, and if you guys remember Yayan Ruhian and Cecep Arif Rahman in Indonesian in JW3. Just small details like this are awesome and I love the representation. Cinematography was amazing and stuck out even more in this sequel... the scenes in Tokyo and Paris were stunning. I just went to Berlin last summer and love that they had an action scene in one of their clubs.. I got rejected from one the most famous in Berlin - Berghain - and I heard some people had died inside and that drugs were huge. The scene of Charon passing really hit me with Lance Reddick passing last week... RIP :'(.",2023-03-24 06:29:32

"I think the ending was perfect.
By defeating the marquis, John essentially deafeated the high table as he was chosen by the table as a collective to stop Wick.
So, now he has no one else to beat. Instead of just having him battle another agency or group of some kind, having his story end by him beating the foremost authority in the crime world, brought his story to a complete end.
He got out, and this time he doesn't owe anybody anything, like he did in Chapter 2.
He is free, and he won against the very system that made him, he beat the high table.
Plus, dragging his story would have been worse.
Atleast, now the 4 movies are perfect for his arc.

"This movie has me extremely conflicted, especially when I see so much love for it in the comments and I don't fully feel the same.  
  
There's just so much I want to talk about, this'll be a very long post, but I just have to express it all. If you will comment or downvote, try to read it all beforehand.  
  
Where to begin... For starters, I liked all three movies before this one. 1 and 2 seemed like the most focused and, while 3 seemed to go off the rails a little, it still managed to keep the vibe and brand of action that made 1 and 2 so good.  
  
Now, some people found issue with three particular scenes in those 3 movies, but I'm here to talk about two of them in particular:  
  
The scene in JW2 where he gets side-hit by a car and gets thrown across the room and the ending of JW3 where he falls from a building and falls HARD. Some people thought those scenes were ridiculous in terms of what damage Wick can take, and they're right to an extent. But suspending disbelief for two little scenes is fine by me.  
  
So here comes the first issue I have with John Wick 4: you have to suspend disbelief massively throughout the whole movie. Not only in terms of the action, but also with the VERY BAD CGI on display in the last act of this movie.  
  
In terms of the action, it feels like the creatives behind the movie saw the complaints and decided to double down, almost out of spite. John gets ran over by a car at full speed like 5-6 times. And he falls from the second/third floor of a building AGAIN, going as far as to fall side ways against a car below and hit the floor.  
  
That is just too far. John gets fucked up THE WHOLE FILM, sometimes in very big ways and he brushes it off immediately. This DID NOT happen in the past movies, not to this extent. He doesn't even have a bruise on his face throughout the whole movie, it's ridiculous.  
  
It sucks to say this because I liked a lot of the action too. The hotline Miami style scene in the abandoned building in Paris, with the camera above, was incredible. The way Donnie Yen fights as a blind man is some of the best I've seen for his type of character. So cool and so charming. The meticulous reloading and gun action is still KINDA there. But it's just not enough.  
  
In terms of the CGI, it pains me to say it's really REALLY bad in the Paris act. It seems like they threw out realism and bad CGI due to budget just to make a cool scene... And that's some generic action movie thought process. Again, this is NOT like the other movies, where realism and meticulousness was key for the movie to work.  
  
I get you can't cut transit or make a scene like that in the real arc de triomphe, but it was ridiculous. Drivers inside of cars disappearing. Cars still driving MINUTES after a shootout has started to take place. CGI blood all over, CGI dummies, cars, motorcycles. It just didn't even try to look the least bit real... And that's not why I got into the John Wick franchise.  
  
But it doesn't just stop there. The whole final scene of the movie is ridiculous. They're absolutely standing in front of a green screen and it's obvious. Having the tracker character sitting with his dog out of frame was so weird too? Like he's supposed to be there but isn't. It's clear they filmed them separately for some reason. I just could not pay proper attention, because of how fake everything around them looked.  
  
And another complaint... There's some weird comedic moments here that were barely, if at all present in the past movies? The big fat guy's face being so goofy after he dies. The way that the marques' body guard dies? He's supposedly shot with a shotgun point blank and we see his face without even a large bullet hole. And then the dog pisses on him? And everyone in my theatre laughed? Even before that, John falling down the stairs was framed as comedic, people around me laughed. It's like the people in charge don't want to take this movie seriously either???  
  
And the movie was too long... The Japan action set piece went on way too long. By the last portion it's like enemies kept on showing up and things just wouldn't end. The coolness of John Wick 1 was how easily John could dispatch the people after him. In this movie everyone for the most part is wearing armor or special suits that make it so they get shot 100 times and don't die until they're properly killed. Which would be okay if the fighting didn't drag out for so. Incredibly. Long.  
  
The nightclub scene was kinda cool but pointless. I get they stumbled over their own rules and what John does in the first movies, but it's all so convoluted and ends up feeling like nothing really matters?  
  
I thought in this movie John would take on those at the high table or whatnot. But since this is now a franchise with spin offs, they can't just end it all now. But then it makes the events and the ending of the movie feel so pointless?  
  
Why does John go to Japan? He literally gets a ton of people killed. Why does the blind man kill the Japanese Continental owner if he spares his daughter? Why not just fake he escaped? What's the point of John winning and liberating himself in such a specific way if he's gonna 'die' afterward? And if he's alive, why are we faking his death? He's got nothing to hide for, he's out of the game now, finally. Technically no one would be going after him since Bill Skarsgard's character is dead and therefore the 30 million bounty is null.  
  
Who is the tracker character exactly? Where does he come from? How did he get the information he has? Does he only want money for the sake of it or does he have bigger motivations? When he initially saves John, he's like ""we're both in this now"" and I get he had aspirations for the biggest payout possible. But like... Why make a 'deal' of sorts? His 'deal' applied to everyone. He asks for a 30 million raise but that just means anyone could kill John and get that money. I get he initially wanted the money for information, but then he starts bartering and keeps trying to kill Wick for money. His motivations are just weird for me.  
  
Why does Wilson just let John pass out/bleed out on the stairs after he just said he'd help him get home? There is literally no one around as he's dying.  
  
The marquis was an interesting character but his lack of action scenes and pathetic death just made him a waste. So the high table sent him to kill Wick or something? With all their support behind him? If that's the case, why is the high table so chill about Wick winning and getting away with everything? It almost felt like Clancy brown's character was glad John won for some reason.

The ending just makes everything pointless. What was the point of Lance Reddick's character dying and the continental being blown up if it's all going back to normal in the end? What was all that killing for? The high table is still active and nothing has changed, so it's not like John made any impact. What about staying alive to keep the memory of his wife and those who died alive with him? 

Just an overall weird movie. Almost like the people in charge were just trying to prove a point. That they can lower the effort and push up the ridiculousness and sloppiness and people will just be fine with it.  
  
Just really disappointed with this movie.  
  
And before someone says it: no, John Wick SHOULDN'T be a 'turn your brain off' kind of movie. It was one of the better action franchises... And so the expectations were and should be high.

Makes me feel like an insane person because of the insane positivity I'm seeing everywhere. Lots of things people are complaining about with movies nowadays but seem to ignore here. So weird.",2023-03-24 02:36:53

"Saw an early screening of this a while back and while I don't remember exactly everything, here's the things I noticed were changed.

Japan sequence was a bit shorter. There was a scene in the final cut that had a soldier falling down an escalator. That was the end of a fight that they cut if I'm recalling correctly.

The nightclub scene had a scene of John Wick sneaking past Caine and the water made it hard for Caine to recognize him. There may have been an extra fight between them or at least more of Caine killing grunts in the club.

My friend I watched it with said the staircase scene seemed shorter but I didn't notice anything different so who knows?

This change is expected but I thought it was cool how they turned what was an empty parking lot in my screening into the Arc de Triomphe. It was always supposed to be the Arc, but still cool to see it finished now.

The biggest change I noticed though was the post-credit scene. Instead of cutting to black, the version I saw definitely had the daughter getting revenge and killing Caine or at least hurt him really bad before slipping away unnoticed. Caine didn't even realize what happened, fell down, and he never even reached his daughter. She did notice the commotion though of civilians surrounding Caine.

Movie is still just as good as the first time I saw it.",2023-03-27 09:54:19
"Loved it, the third movie had me apprehensive because it seemed to wander and had too much gun-fu for my tastes.

"AMAZING movie, but the movie (rather series) sure has some huge holes lol.  


1) Where are the police?

2) Where are the other High Table members?

3) How the hell an ordinary man jumps out of a building falling to the ground not breaking bones?  


Again, the movie is AMAZING for it's action scenes, but plot sure doesn't make ALL the sense to think about lol",2023-03-24 23:26:49
"Everyone is mentioning the action (which is phenomenal ofc), but can we talk about how IMMACULATE the cinematography was in this? Every frame legitimately a painting, with a ton of variety.

Also, that final duel sequence was executed perfectly. It was like you knew what was going to happen, but didn't know how. ""He didn't shoot yet"" registering with the audience right as it does with Skarsgard was my favorite moment.",2023-03-25 13:03:57
"I think i’m in the minority when I say that shit was WAY too long. 

Other than the movie being long I enjoyed it. Donnie yens character stole the show for me, every scene he was in it was just soooooo fucking sick. He’s really a legend. 

I just with they cut out like 45 mins of the movie for shortness sake lol",2023-03-29 09:08:57
"I have to be honest man, suspending one's disbelief has always been a part of these movies, and I think the 1st movie hit the perfect balance in terms of realism for me. 2nd and 3rd kind of pushed it, but this one went to far, especially in the Osaka scenes. I'm not being one of those ""*b-b-but it's not realistic!*"" people, I just literally had trouble staying immersed when so many times John was up against 3-4 people, he'd knock one down, and then when he had his back turn the enemy would get up, only to zone out completely and forgot how to bring down his blade that he already had held high... like.

Look all I'm saying is, I preferred the way the fighting in the 1st movie was - it was about him taking the fights one by one when possible, and when he was injured he actually needed medical help from the doctor. I understand that each movie has gone more in this direction, and I don't entirely hate it, it's just too much for me, especially with such long fight scenes as Osaka.

I'd give the movie about a 7/10 personally, if the first was a 9/10 for me. Not just due to this reason, but it's the leading one. Second and third are about a 7.5-8/10 for me. 4 had a bunch of really good aspects too, don't get me wrong.",2023-03-24 04:04:12

"Maybe I had a Wick overdose from watching JW3 the previous night but I was kinda bored throughout the first half of the movie. I could appreciate the difficulty of the action set pieces but they went on so long that it lost it's effect.

Fun movie! But let’s be honest this franchise is basically fast and furious now lol fun action and effects but a nonsensical story and reality,2023-03-27 02:04:05
"I guess I'm alone here, but this movie did nothing for me. It's just extended action sequence where John Wick kills a bunch of nameless goons, then they take a break to visit a new place and explain some new rules, then another extended action sequence where John Wick kills a bunch of nameless goons, followed by a break to visit a new place and explain some new rules, ad infinitum. 

It all felt so basic and meaningless to me. Nobody had any depth. Nobody had any arc. And I guess I shouldn't expect that in a John Wick movie...but four movies deep, the endless action is getting stale. The rules feel like they're constantly changing or can always be bent. 

Now everybody has bulletproof sports jackets and getting hit by a speeding car isn't even a flesh wound. 

I just don't think I have an eye for good action choreography and cinematography. I loved the first John Wick because it was all fresh, but every movie has just been diminishing returns for me. 

Though yes, that top-down sequence in Paris at the end was awesome on every level.",2023-03-24 03:38:49

"loved the movie overall, but the whole time I was thinking ""this is a 3 hour movie...""

the pacing of the first act is pretty meh and the 3 hour runtime was screaming at me in the back of my head every time they let scenes run on too long

the third act is almost perfect, though it falters a little at the end.

Didn't the marquis say that seconds are killed if the primary loses? so why is Caine still alive?

keanu's delivery was all over the place. it felt like they taught him his lines phonetically.

Charon dying for no reason was kinda dumb, but at least we got a sort of memorial for Lance

I think i got tired of the nunchucks mid way through their first scene. then he just keeps using them to do the same ineffective moves over and over again against armored guys who he's not hurting.

It was hard to keep track of who was armored throughout various fights. I thought Akira was wearing armor during the hotel fight but apparently she wasn't? so it was just a neat looking suit she wears around all the time?

the soundtrack had decent moments and good callbacks but a lot of it was generic dubstep which fell flat for me.

8/10 movie. super fun",2023-03-25 18:56:40
"Somewhere along the way these movies turned into live action anime and I'm 100% on board with it. Every fucking thing in this movie is over the top stylish, from the settings, the outfits, the weapons and fighting, even the dialogue is corny and esoteric. It's so god damn silly it comes back around to being cool as hell.

This movie has got: 

- John wick vs. armored super soldier ninjas in a Japanese hotel fighting alongside an army of Yakuza and sumo wrestlers using swords and bows, and Hiroyuki Sanada being a literal samurai daimyo

- John wick vs. fat German gangster and his hatchet wielding goons in a packed raving nightclub while avoiding a cowboy bounty hunter and a blind guy with a stick who are all trying to kill him, all so that he can get a brand on his arm and re-join his old crime family.

- John wick killing over a hundred assassins and fighting through the streets of Paris in a 30 minute non-stop finale action set piece that changes locations four times and includes the previously mentioned cowboy and blind man, an attack dog, a car chase, a dragons breath shotgun, and the funniest shit I've ever seen (the stairs sequence)

- John wick fighting an old school pistol duel at sunrise and finally finding peace.

This movie has it all. Holy fucking shit.",2023-03-31 02:53:48

"Definitely a spoiler here, I know I'm in the minority for sure, but I don't believe the ending is what most people think it is, I do genuinely think it's at the least ambiguous enough to be open to interpretation. With the little quotes including clinging to death can bring life, the fact that John's said he wants to live to remember, the fact we don't see a body, nor anyone else at his funeral, we see Winston and Bowery King have a small ambiguous exchange about John's where abouts, we get John's dog (who I'm assuming he would want to live for!) Looking off screen to where John could be, and then there's people that are saying the wounds are similar to the ones inflicted non lethally to the doctor, with the exception of the gut shot being on the symmetrical right instead of left. All in all, I just don't feel like this send off was entirely right, we can't forget a 5th movie was green lit, but couldn't get filmed, and both the director and Keanu never outright ruled out John returning, just that they were taking a break. At the very least, I could see John returning in more of a supportive role for his allies in a later movie, with them as the protagonists, and then giving him a true definitive climactic end when it's appropriate, or maybe just him finding peace, and going back to his normal life, fully out of the game. Sorry for the long rant here guys, I'm an over hopeful fan that wants just one more movie.",2023-03-25 18:55:22

"Interestingly, I seem to have quite a different opinion than most people and critics. I find John Wick 4 to be easily the worst movie of the franchise. Not horrible by any means, but it took everything I disliked in 3 and made it worse.

Starting off with the action scenes, literally the most important thing about John Wick. Yes they were bombastic and overall well done but they pale when compared to the last three movies. Less detail and focus on choreography, lack of new concepts (expect for the awesome top-down shot) and the complete removal of any last ounce of realism. This was a trend that kept getting worse with every movie, but 4 often requires a complete suspension of disbelief. Which is a shame as especially John Wick 1 didn't make Keanu feel invincible, he was simply that much better than everyone else. Also what happened to the directors counting shots and making sure John actually reloads in accurate intervals?

Story wise it was, meh. The first 5 minutes cover such importance that it could have been its own movie, and the next 1 1/2 can be summed up in one sentence. Luckily, the second part of the movie gets back on track and delivers a really good and suspenseful ending.

Cinematography was great.

Overall 6/10. Not a bad movie, but a disappointment after the amazing first three entries in the franchise. Feel free to counter my points, I'd love to hear other opinions.",2023-03-24 02:52:41
I felt the tracker character was kind of pointless. take him out and the movie doesnt really change much. They could have combine his character with Donnie's  and gave him the dog since you know.. HES BLIND!,2023-03-24 04:16:02
"I had very mixed feelings going into *John Wick 4*. I got bored during the second half of *Parabellum,* mostly because it felt like a series of loosely-connected action set-pieces that went on for far too long and were largely there to show off what the fight choreographers could do. And it absolutely was that, but the introduction of the Elder left me with the impression that the writers would just keep moving the goal posts back to make it impossible for John to achieve anything -- all while he became increasingly one-dimensional, mostly there to wear suits, shoot people and say ""*yeah""*.

I felt the same way about fifteen minutes into *John Wick 4*, but then the masked assassins were introduced and everything suddenly clicked for me. I realised what the entire series is about: this is John's ongoing struggle against a world that has decided who he is and everything that he will amount to. By covering the faces of the assassins, the filmmakers presented them not as people, but as an extension of the will of others. They're everywhere and they just keep coming and they won't stop until John accepts what somebody else has chosen for him or dies. And that's when everything made sense for me. John's entire backstory is that he never got to make his own choices, but now he is trying to assert his own agency. The only way to get ahead in this world is to master a series of obscure and archaic rules that cannot be learned; if he somehow learns part of them, then the rules can be changed to yank the carpet out from under him. The process repeats until he either dies or submits. >!The whole thing was encapsulated perfectly by the scene where he gets kicked down the stairs: just as he starts making progress, the rules change and he is forced to start all over again, trying to do the same thing until something changes because that's all that he can do.!< I found it surprisingly deep for a film series where the main character has to have a kill count approaching 500.",2023-03-25 06:53:16
"I swear it's like I watched a different movie from everyone else. 

The first JW movie was the best. Loved it. Was really hoping this one would recapture that. What I got instead was a neverending gun battle. I mean yes there were some gorgeous action sequences (that running overhead shot of him clearing room by room with the Dragon's Breath was amazing) but ffs... there has to be more to the movie than 50,000 trigger pulls. They needed to cut about an hour of people shooting at each other out and replace it with some actual story telling.

And the bulletproof suits. I cannot roll my eyes any harder at how overboard they have gone with those things. They're basically magic at this point and I just looks ridiculous to have people running around with one suit flap held up in front of their face like the Phantom of the Opera.

Then we have the dance club battle. Most dedicated dancing partiers on planet earth,  people being massacred left and right right in front of them and they just keep going like they were hired to be the background in a music video and they think all the people dying are part of the act or something.

And yeah it's fun and cool to have the blind warrior character... if it's even slightly plausible. They started off trying to get there, the little doorbell sensors etc giving him a realistic means of knowing which direction to shoot at people were well done... but by the end of the movie he's just dropping people left and right at a distance in conditions where there is no way he knows where the people he is shooting at are. And then to have him as the chosen champion in a dual *with pistols*??? If John was actually trying to beat him he just takes one silent step left before the first shot and it's game over, who is stupid enough to make that call??? That is a guaranteed loss if John wasn't deliberately trying to draw the Marquis in.

Etc... I was just really disappointed and unless everyone else was only in it to see if they could set a new ""how many people can John kill in one movie"" record I don't get how this movie is getting the ratings it is.",2023-03-26 06:06:46

I can't believe how they just consistently top themselves time after time. Despite 2,3,4 feeling like they're in completely different universes than the 1st, this franchise has somehow became one of my favorites of all time. It really felt like this movie was the creators just laying all their cards on the table, leaving absolutely nothing in the tank, and trying to make the most batshit insane action filled badass film they possibly could. 

The lore can be a bit confusing but the action makes up for any of that.",2023-03-26 03:31:50

"Definitely the best of the series. The fights in 3 were great but I felt that there wasn’t any personal stakes or connection to the antagonist. Glad that changes for Chapter 4. 

All the new characters were amazing, loved Caine and Nobody. Caine & Wick’s friendship really made this film imo. Both men trapped in lives they didn’t want. The inevitable clash is tragic. So many nods to Greek Mythology throughout. This is the most visually spectacular film in the franchise imo. 

I also like how Caine feels like an actual blind character? It’s not like daredevil, he actually can’t use his other senses to “see” and needs motion sensors.",2023-04-09 07:48:09
"Comments making me fall insane. Felt this was the worst entry to the series. Japan sequence felt way too over the top, slapstick movements of the marquis forces was too much. Entire first half was unnecessary and poorly paced. Until the end, after like the 20th car hit him, Wick didn’t appear to be getting hurt at all, I guess they couldn’t find a place to fit him reacting to anything in the ridiculously long runtime. The kevlar suits really removed any danger. Hotline Miami sequence was fantastic tho.",2023-03-25 13:14:25
"Did i enjoy it? A bit. Wanna preface this by saying I enjoy the franchise and think we need films like this. Not exactly like this, but sorta. I love Donnie Yen, Keanu, basically everyone here. This is not a ""bad"" movie

 That being said...

Should it be considered critically acclaimed? Absolutely not. It was objectively the worst of the 4. The action scenes got repetitive. I was kind of shocked they went with the whole ""gunfight in a club"", ""fight on the stairs"", ""quietly shoot each other from close range while walking in public"" ""dog sick balls"" shit all over again. They did a really good job in part 3 of adding some innovative fight stuff. This movie we had a couple things with Donnie Yen and then just a lot more of the same. 

Drink when john wick, in the middle of fighting 20+ people, does a jumping judo tackle only to eventually shoot them in the head with the gun that's In his hand the whole time. 

The amount of lore that pops up and then goes unexplained has finally caught up to me and is now annoying. They may make some more films or shows in this universe that ties some of this up but if not this is going to be a never-rewatch for me.",2023-03-24 02:59:30
"Never been to this sub before. I just feel like I'm going crazy or missing something about this movie and it's driving me wild. I'm probably gonna get down voted to hell, and I will definitely struggle expressing myself fully yet, but I think a lot of this movie was cut before release. There has got to be an actually coherent ""Schneider cut"" under here somewhere. I loved a lot of the action set pieces and new characters but most of the other stuff didn't really make a lot of sense to me. 

I'm gonna talk a lot about the plot and you might say it doesn't matter for a JW movie and that's fine but this movie spent like so much f-ing time on the plot. So I feel it's an important thing. I was totally fine with this movie being SUPER long, it didn't even feel THAT bad watching it; but a lot of my problems are how they used the time, not the time itself so please keep that in mind when replying. 

I don't really understand why they went to Japan, in movie terms. Of course I love the action and I think it's a very fitting location for a JW film (better for this movie than Paris imho), but I am unsure as to why they went there in the first place. None of the characters which needed to be set up there had any lasting impact on the actual film whatsoever, and other than that there were no important elements there to my knowledge. It was really disorienting for me when the only surviving character who needed to be set up there just disappeared once they left. They spent like an hour setting this character up with a whole personality and tragic backstory in a dope setting- she also had some ridiculously badass action scenes. And they just dropped her, it had no bearing whatsoever on the rest of the movie in any way shape or form and it felt completely separate and kinda confusing. Totally pointless, and if it's setup for another movie, that's an atrocity!! Everyone and their mom dumps on the MCU for doing that even when it's way less egregious. There was literally no purpose to her character, and that is such an absolute shame. It was just so jarring and it felt like the team forgot about her and the entire Japan thing.

Furthermore, the killing of the high table elder was so shoehorned in, it was absolutely disorienting and served very little purpose. It felt like a quest in Skyrim that you never ""checked in"" to finish, so the marker has been sitting on your map for days and days until you finally fast travel there to talk to the NPC and watch a cutscene to officially complete the quest.

I think the entire club scene was super lame, and the slow motion was very corny and I think inherently goes against John wick, even if it's not being used for direct like heavily choreographed combat. There wasn't really anyything to make the fight interesting in any way, and it was all the EXACT same setting in multiple previous movies, just done in a more bland and boring way. The slo mo absolutely ruined it for me too, and the stupid indoors exaggerated popcorn action rain which mixed together made the whole thing look like a scene from a cheap TV show- they are better than this. I hated that whole scene. Probably my least favorite action scenes in the whole series by far. 

I also didn't like how much time was spent undoing the events of the previous movies. It doesn't feel like an evolution of a story or even like anything at all changed. They spent a solid like 45 minutes just resetting the charm or whatever for the ruska roma, just to complete the larger goal of resetting basically all the events of the past 2 movies. I think this is really bad writing, and I get that they wrote themselves into a corner and they didn't want to go the route they had seemingly considered (overthrowing the high table), but you can't just spend a whole movie just resetting everything that happened in the other ones and set the whole thing back to how it was before just with like nearly everyone, including the main character, dead.

If you've read this far thank you. I was kinda disappointed they simultaneously didn't bring back a single character from the old films and introduced so many new ones. I understand of course that most of the actors might not be available, but I was really hoping to see Hallie berry or common or the Indonesian guys from the Raid or anyone honestly. It's okay that nobody was available, I won't hold it against the movie, but I thought it was very disappointing that they did introduce like 5 or 6 new characters, many of whom had very minimal actual impact on the movies story or characters itself, as a way to possibly make up for nobody being available. Most were SUPER SUPER cool characters, but this whole thing could have had none of them and it'd be the exact same- no dog hunter, no one from Japan, replace the aristocrat with anyone, hell even just remove donnie yen and replace him in the dueling scene with the Frenchie and the ending is literally the exact fucking same. I wouldn't care about this at all if they didn't KILL John wick, and doom these characters to spinoffs AT BEST.

Anyways, I think there must be another cut of this movie which actually makes sense out there, even if it's 5 hours. I really wish I liked it as is, I really do. I certainly love the action, especially frogger, nunchucks, and of course hotline Miami dragons breath - honorable mention sticking people to things with arrows.

"I seem to be on an island on this, but I was driven numb by this movie. I have found the JW films to be increasingly OTT as they've went on, but still enjoyable. But halfways through Chapter 4 I began to fucking hate it and it carried through to the end. I am genuinely confused at how anyone can watch this 2h49min unwieldy torture device of a movie and come out satisfied and not pummeled into submission. The action in it is like finding yourself in that ever-repeating hallway in Thor:Ragnarok. You're just subjected to Keanu awkwardly dodging a point blank gunshot and shooting someone in the head over, and over, and over, and over, and over. This must have happened at least 150-200 times. There are a few bright spots and inventive moments in the action sequences (nunchucks, axe, flaming shotgun), but 95% of it is some variation of that gunplay. After a while it just becomes white noise. I was left livid that something that felt so fresh in the first couple of movies has now been reduced into a gunk that's gorged down our gullets like we're foie gras geese. If I had a time machine I would find the screenwiter who have the idea of bulletproof suits and smother them in the crib.",2023-03-24 07:40:40

"I don't understand the praise this movie is getting, I went in blind and was very disappointed. I think the writing was incredibly off, which makes sense now that I know there was a different writer than the previous 3. It felt like a Marvel-fication of  the John Wick-series. Pointless fighting that dragged on for way too long. A blind man somehow fighting effectively and capable of noticing the exact number of enemies like he's Daredevil. John Wick taking ridiculous amounts of damage with no consequences, which felt even dumber since you know he wasn't going to die in the middle of the movie. Every new piece of assassin lore was dumber than the last. All the locations felt so cliché, as soon as they mentioned Berlin I knew there was going to be a stupid rave scene, and Japan must always be some neon hell cityscape for some reason. I don't get why they introduced so many new characters that I didn't care about. If Caine died I would have felt nothing, nor did I feel anything when Koji died, I only felt bad for Charon, whom I think deserved a better death. I don't think I'll see whatever is next, it feels like they're just going to milk it for as long as they can from here on out.",2023-03-25 22:12:48

"It's good, but not as great as the first three. I got the feeling John Wick was trying to speed run a lot of those encounters with how many groin shots there were.

I loved all the references especially [The Warriors radio DJ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfzSkJvK5PE) and the radio station being WUXIA.

I'm not completely sure on the exact reference, but the boat that John is ferried in is called Hortense which is Latin for Garden. It kind of felt like he was being ferried across the river Styx to the Underworld. Could have been fitting if Charon were there to drive the boat.",2023-03-25 03:22:02

"Keanu reeves is an enigma of some sort. He is not a particularly good actor but he is in a lot of my favourite movies. Somehow that stiff facial expression works well as a narration to all the chaos that happens around him. 

But in John wick 4 his acting is just terrible. He is a plastic doll while everyone around him tries to inject some human emotion into the scenes. The few words he utters are so contrived, and his delivery is painfully forced. I’m so shocked nobody noticed. 

The choreography whilst artistic and pretty to watch was unrelenting and repetitive. The rules of engagement has become a farce, Kevlar suits, using forearms to block bullets. The entire action sequences have gone too far. He is basically ducking bullets towards the end as he makes his way up the stairs. The pacing of this movie was exhausting. 

I have no idea why everyone is calling this the greatest action movie of all time.",2023-03-27 20:42:48

"A lot of people in here praising the movie, I guess I’ll be the one that’s a little negative. (Please don’t crucify me)

While I enjoyed the movie as a whole, there were just way too many scenes that brought me out of it, mainly just how much punishment John takes over the course of the movie. Just to name a few examples; John jumping out of a two story window and bouncing off a car before landing on concrete (he’s fine), falling down almost 5 flights of stairs in what looked like something straight out of a loony toons cartoon (he’s fine), getting shot damn near 500 times and he just shakes it off cuz he has his bullet proof vest, which it’s pretty common knowledge at this point that if you get shot twice in a full on vest (much less a thin suit) you’re breaking a couple ribs. 

I’m not some neck beard movie critic, so I’m not gonna write a thesis for it, but there’s a couple other reasons I didn’t enjoy the movie. As a whole, I thought it was just okay.

Edit: I also should have mentioned that this is just my personal opinion on it, I don’t blame anyone for enjoying it, I just personally didn’t care for it.",2023-04-05 21:12:03

"This is likely a relatively unpopular opinion, but I felt super let down.

Wick is basically OP now - he can repeatedly fall out of multiple heights from the building, take a shit ton of beating (okay, always), go rolling down 100+ steps, get repeatedly hit by cars... and still whoop someone fresh.

Plus the addition of the bullet proof suits was ridiculous - it may not let the bullet through, but it's not some magic repellent - it's gonna sting like a fucker!",2023-03-25 01:24:01
"You all are high as a Godamn kite. This movie just repeated the same nonsense in the previous 3 iterations. Same gun scenes, same chase scenes.

To compare this movie to mad max fury road is ridiculous.",2023-03-27 00:25:38

Infinite ammo and no reloads is now a thing. 

Suits have gone from just thin kevlar that’ll still knock you onto your ass into straight up bullet force fields.

Gravity and momentum do zero damage to friendly forces. 

Blind people are totally capable of firing a gun with total accuracy.

Why is 'Nobody' even in this movie for? His character is not needed other than setting up a spin-off or something.,2023-03-24 04:24:41
"I don't know how more people aren't talking about the fact that they just were using their suit jackets as bullet forcefields the ***entire*** movie. All the creativity of the movies went into how can I get the coolest headshot. People hunching behind jackets, taking shots like they were airsoft bullets. It bugged me the entire time.

I am not a person to question realism, I generally enjoy over the top action. But they ruined the movie with the bulletproof suits. I loved the cinematography, I enjoyed the story, loved the characters, but man, the suits ruined it. Ruined the combat, made it so they could 3x the amount of people he fought and where they fought, and it just became the same thing over and over.

Not to mention Keanu was so stiff when talking. It's like they were in a Covid-safe environment and he couldn't act next to actors. I swear there's the scene in the church when he's talking to Caine and they're on opposite sides of the aisle, I don't think they're acting next to each other. I think they're on their own plates and comped in together. And Donnie Yen is being very charismatic and emotional, and Keanu is essentially reading off a paper.

Also, a lot of the combat, especially with Keanu, stuntmen would hit their mark much earlier than him. So they're just sitting there for half a second while he catches up.

I feel like people went in with rose colored glasses and were just rock hard the entire time they didn't stop and go ""huh... That's like the 4th time in a row he twisted someone's arm back and shot them in the head in the last minute"". ""Oh, that's weird, there's a massive fight happening and people look over, freak out, and then just go back to dancing to no music"". There were just so many weird things that were happening consistently, it was tough to just enjoy the movie.",2023-03-24 20:05:32

"I loved it. They've definitely abandoned pretending John is human. There were a few things in the other movies you really had to suspend disbelief for, like John getting shot 3 times in the kidney at the start and being fine for the rest of the movie. There is *a lot* of that in this one, but honestly the movie was so fun I was just ok with it.

My only gripe is that the character of The Tracker seems like it didn't need to be in the movie at all, and the movie was really long. He actually is a nobody with very little seemingly differentiating him from the other nameless goons getting mowed down by Wick, but the big bad is negotiating with him in person and on the phone for 30 million bucks like he's a known quantity like Cain. Then at the end there's a a huge dual with only the high table people and 4 duelists present, but also him for some reason.

Apparently the entire thing was a setup for a spinoff which cheapens the inclusion of a major character that had almost 0 impact on the story.

That's just nitpicking though. Overall I had a 10/10 experience in the theater.",2023-03-24 14:21:12

That was so fucking awesome. The 222 steps fight was amazing but the Paris apartment fight with the overhead camera and dragon breath shotgun was goddamn incredible. My theater (myself included) were whooping at every kill, especially the guy who got blasted upward through the table.

Also, Donnie Yen is such a badass. I did find it kind of amusing that he was blind in another badass fighter role though. He'd be too powerful if he could see, so the universe had to nerf him.

The way almost my entire audience went ""OOOOOO"" when Scott Adkins' character landed on his head was satisfying to the bone.

"Second watch last night. 

It's still very much as insane as the first time I saw it 24 hours prior. 

Cinematography is brilliant. It's crazy to think this is the same movie series from 2014. Every shot is full of colors, and framed really well. 

Reeves dialogue is hilariously basic and sometimes robotic. But the other cast members make up for it. Donnie Yen is still my favorite, but goddamn if Scott Adkins isn't fucking insane. 

I'm a gun nerd and I tried to focus more on the action this time. There's SO MANY stylish dynamic reloads this time. There's magazines flying everywhere. But the detail is still there as he's constantly grabbing mags from dead enemies, checking round count and doing a few reloads with partially full magazines (the elder death scene is the best illustrated one.) 
Also love the scene where Donnie Yen checks the chamber of his own gun to feel if there is round present or one at the top of the magazine feed. 

Dragons breath/top-down scene is still a banger. Really enjoyed LED Spirals being reused. Also, Wick scavenging for new magazines among the dead/transitioning back to his pistol is fucking great. 

Second time around, what really made the movie for me was the relationship between Caine and Wick, the church scene, stair scene, and the duel.

"I really liked whatever came after the Osaka scene, but there's something that bugs be about the things in Japan. 

When they shot arrows, some of them went sqaruely through the helmets, while a dude blocked it with his forearm. Also, when they were on the roof, John was fighting three guys at the same time, and I thought it was not properly choreographed? 

The people who got down on the ground or got pressed up against something always flounder their arms around and not throwing punches or whatever. When John's engaged with the other two, the third could've stabbed him. However, he chooses to wait for John to turn to him and proceed to get killed. I just don't really get the choreography. 

Also, I cannot believe the extent to which they made the suits so OP. They can deflect shotgun bullets? A man can get shot multiple times without having his lungs compressed or get internal bleeding from the shots? They just walk on as if the bullets don't mean anything. 

I understand that this probably isn't everyone's first priority, but to me, for a film that portrays other gunfights very well, I just find some of this very unrealistic. The first two films were pretty believable, because John bled. A lot. He wasn't invincible. But now it's as if he couldn't get hurt at all. That makes it not very enjoyable for me. But still a good movie nonetheless.",2023-03-30 04:54:49

He used to be able to speak in complete sentences and hold a conversation. Now it's mostly just monosylabic responses.

This franchise has gotten more and more absurd.  Loved the first 2 films and the 3rd is decent. 

Despite some great action sequences, which is to be expected with the talent involved, they just went on for far too long. The first film felt so grounded compared to the ridiculous action films we get, which is something that made us love it. Now though John Wick is essentially a superhero. 

Beaten up, shot, and stabbed multiple times (with vest), falls down multiple flights of stairs, hit by cars, and jumps out of a 3rd story window, half landing on a truck. Come on now, this shit is just laughable. 

The audience I saw this with was laughing at the absurdity of it, and I was hearing multiple complaints of how stupid it was.

Having said this, the one novel exception was the fight leading up to, then at, the church, Basilique Sacré-Coeur. Which makes complete sense as I can imagine Stahelski smiling, saying “Hah, take that you Scientologist.”",2023-03-24 02:33:29
"Just came back from the movie. This is probably a very unpopular opinion here but the movie was ok but not as good as any of the other movies in this series. Not by a long shot. Part Three  and one were the best films for me.. this would be the least favourite of the sequels without any doubt. It almost feels like someone tried to make a movie like John wick and succeeded to an extent. 

The movie’s number one issue is predictability. Story lines are usually predictable in John wick but action was not .. except the one scene in the end >!car traffic fight scene!< everything else was repetitive and felt like it was all done before and extremely predictable, except very few action scenes in the end. 

There was absolutely no need for the movie to be this long but I didn’t feel bored too , reducing length wouldn’t have solved the issue , it’s just that they did almost every possible amazing stunt ideas in all of the other movies that this feels completely redundant. 

I also loved the camera angles .. in the end .. no spoiler , you will know when you see it and a special weapon .. was pretty good. 

I still would recommend this movie for John wick fans.. if you like the previous films you would like this one too but don’t go with High expectations.  

I really expected some better action .. in part three, I can remember all the catchy scenes, the book , sword fight , horse , bikes so on and so forth but nothing that memorable happened  here. ( except a couple of scenes )

It looks like like a clear case of one of the two things or both. There has been some change in the creative team or intervention by someone who were not involved creating previous films. 

Simply put this movie is only a shadow of its previous films. Still entertained, Tad disappointed. This is not going to be re watchable for me. So surprised at reviews though, puts the  movie in complete opposite spectrum. You can like this movie sure, but to call this one the best of all is an insult to the rest of the movies in the series.

Edit: downvote me all you want but before you do it please watch the movie. The reviews are coming in from die hard fans rn. Over the weekend I predict some mixed reviews showing up. 

I am right in one thing though. Derek Kolstad the screenplay writer and creator of John wick was not involved in this movie. It clearly shows .. what a poor decision to not involve him in this movie. 

My prediction is long term, this movie will be most poorly rated John wick film in IMDb ..",2023-03-24 05:14:17

Did the series carry on too long? I don't know. While I somewhat enjoyed the movie part of me was waiting for it to be over of the extended run time. Maybe I'll give it another go when it's on streaming.

Also definite overload of trademark fights. 

Highlights is Donnie Yen and the top-down scene.",2023-03-26 00:08:50
"Honestly I’m kindve shocked that I’m the only one who thought this film was so bad. The main villain had the worst french accent and basically couldn’t act. His lines were so basic and boring it felt like he was reading from a script. The blind guy didn’t fit his role either, wasn’t particularly intimidating or impactful fight scenes and his motive and backstory felt so weak. His daughter was basically it, like they could have shown some emotional scene with his daughter in the past or something to make me care about his story a bit. I thought the fight scenes were ok but not amazing except for the cars crashing in Paris part. The black guy seemingly spared John cuz he saved his dog??? But he could’ve got 40million and ripped his hand?? Didn’t make literally any sense. Johns fighting felt pretty repetitive as well, like he would flip them to the ground then shot them, he did that like 100 times, man could’ve tried throwing some kicks or something ?? Bru the homeless king guy was the only good actor and his is always barely in these films why!!?? Also the guy said he would put friend on the guys gravestone, wtf so shit, could’ve had said anything better… the Spanish fighting guy  had better fighting choreography then most of the cast he was decent. The staircase fight scene was the last big fight scene ?? Just going up stairs and shorting people was hella basic and ok he fell off the stairs but soo ?? Not the amazing. I’m probably missed more. But what do you guys think?",2023-03-26 01:24:42

I always have kinda low expectations for the Plot for the John Wick franchise and am willing to look over major plot holes for the sake of mindless popcorn action, on which John Wick delivers.  
But the missing plot logic is getting annoying with John Wick and fails to deliver even the low expectations so much that it distracts from the action.  
Here are my thoughts:

  
\-The arab elder was built up as some major untouchable person, for whom even John Wick was forced to give his finger and now in JW4 not only is the elder form JW3 replace with some other guy, he is killed by JW in a minor struggle.  
\-Why is JW in Osaka?  What was the whole point of him showing up in Osaka? Just to get another old friend killed?

\-The lighting and scenery of the Osaka Level was cool though.

\-They pull a super villain out of their ass in every JW episode. What makes the snowflake Marquis so dangerous? Why is everyone of his goons willing to risk their lives for him? Why not beat the shit out of him and take his family's fortunes?

\-The Guy with his dog was pointless. WHy was this character introduced? Are they trying to do a JW/The Last Of Us spinnoff? His plotline is so stupid. He is build up as someone who is able to get JW in his crosshairs, then goes out to Blackmail/make a deal with the Marquis for money, only to get his hand stabbed by him and let the MArquis get away with this monstrous  act.

\-Why would the JW family take him back? They are all badass murderers, who even manage to capture and torture JW. Why haven't they killed the guy in the club themselves long ago? Why do they need JW to do that for them? money?! Instead they go get killed like flies by the most dangerous assassin of them all.

\-The Berlin Stage had much more potential. The scenery and setup at the poker table was good, nice pictures, but the plot around it is stupid.

\-Why would the JW family take him back? They are all badass murderes, who even manage to capture and torture JW. Why haven't they killed the guy in the club themselves long ago? Why do they need JW to do that for them?

\-As per the duel rules, the Blind guy had to be killed too for being on the loosing side. They broke the duel rules. Also the Blind guy was collaborating with JW. The whole Duel was a dishonest sham. Ergo, Vis-a-Vis: JW has no honor.

&#x200B;

\-I thought they have already filmed JW 4 and 5 back to back. So what is the point of killing off JW in JW4? That wasn't even a real wound. Who are they fooling with this? Is JW5 really canceled?

\-What was the whole point of the JW franchise if at the end his plan ends with him getting killed. WHat has he achieved what he couldn't have achieved by faking his death?!

&#x200B;

In the past JW movies, the action and villains were much cooler and I could live with the lack of plot logic. But with JW4 the action is not as cool as before which makes me whine about the plot logic. 

I give the movie 7/10.",2023-03-26 01:46:09
"Between the love for this movie, and Mad Max: Fury Road, I feel out of touch. I don’t understand the response it’s getting. Reeves looks, and moves like an old man, and it’s almost as bad as watching Deniro fighting in The Irishman.

There’s no filling; it’s all dessert.

It’s the first movie I can remember where the world seems neat but, the story being told within it makes me dislike it.

I understand it’s just a fluff piece for stunt work but, as a movie, it’s a failure. As a stunt reel, it’s overly choreographed.

The trope of the hero never running out of energy needs to die. These people have inhuman cardiovascular systems. Keanu has to walk like he rides a horse all day because his hips are going bad; I can’t buy him as a cardio machine.",2023-03-28 18:32:06
"I fell for the hype (critics and early reactions) and my expectations were not met.  I guess that's on me.

Most of the fight choreography with Keanu looked off (slower and staged).

TL;DR - more of the same

edit - the overhead shootout is worth a look!",2023-03-24 03:31:36
"I feel like im in  the minority but i think this was the most boring john wick because it didnt do a whole lot of new things we didnt see in other movies or earlier in the movie. It seemed like the action sequences dragged on because they just kept killing everyone in the exact same way. I got some nun chucks, let me kill 50 more people with nun chucks, oh there is a lot of cars lets hit people with cars 50 times, oh there is some stairs lets throw 50 people down it. I always liked john wick a lot because of how creative he got with using his environment to kill people whether with his belt, a pencil, a book, a horse, throwing knives, etc. The only part that seemed really unique to the movie was the top down part and the dragon breath rounds which were really cool. Also it seemed like there wasnt a lot of passion in the choreography at times especially with caines character after that initial kitchen scene. He kind of just shoots randomly and hits people or cuts people nothing much more. Ik im being overly critical too but j had such high expectations for it after 3 so im kind of let down.",2023-03-24 09:26:12

"Found myself yawning and checking the watch about 1.5 to 2 hours in; never a good sign.

* Got tired of the action sequences and their repetitiveness. John Wick grabs someone by the arm, leverages it to flip them around, and shoots them in the head. Rinse and repeat 1000x for a movie with a 3 hour runtime. 

* Skarsgard's French accent is fucking woeful

* Keanu has managed to become a worse actor... Somehow.

"When John was on the steps dying and they had the little flashback to their kiss, I was kind of hoping that he’d have a tiny flashback to the original dog, too. When *that* is my only disappointment in the movie, that’s pretty great — entertained from beginning to end! 

I’m also genuinely curious in seeing where that post-credits scene leads to; it’s essentially teeing up to the sort of movie *Kill Bill Vol. 3* could’ve been with Vernita’s daughter coming after the Bride, and I’m here for it. Between that potential film and *Ballerina*, it’s neat that this wild universe can really continue to expand naturally without John, who I was sad to see go but satisfied with how he went out. Really cool that this feels like both the end and a new beginning without either notion undermining the other by stepping on the other’s toes.

Also, goddamn was I shocked to see Charon die so quickly — Reddick has been part of so many things I’ve watched since the ‘90s, from Oz to The Wire to Lost to Fringe and beyond… Really hit in a big way, and eerie that the character death lined up with his passing. Truly a loss from a guy that commanded the screen every time he was ever on it.",2023-03-24 04:45:06

"It's pretty great

Director Chad Stahelski continues to achieve his talents with great dramatic and action moments blended together well as John Wick: Chapter 4 is probably the best installment of the entire John Wick film series. I'm not very big on the John Wick films but I have enjoyed every one of them and this one is my favorite one. The action and fight moments were extremely well executed and there are plenty of gorgeous cinematography shown throughout. There are several sequences of long take action films that are gorgeous and splendid to look at with an amazing climax. Every performances was pretty good as each cast member provides good chemistry and style. The character of John Wick remains interesting and through each film, his character manages to stay consistent and is interesting to observe. With dialogue moments, they are some moments that felt a little of putting but they were well-written, great uses of sounding, colors, and style used throughout and really cool action moments as some of scenes are burned into my head.

Overall, great action film.

"Thought this was fantastic, way better than JW3 and a great sendoff for an epic series of movies. First 20min was kinda cheesy and Keanu is just grunting all his lines but damn, once you get sucked into the world again its just such a fun and wild ride.  

Donnie yen was great, glad they didnt kill him off after they killed Sanada. Mr Nobody was fine, thought they just added him as another chaos element but having more dog take downs was not bad.   

All the action was just topnotch man, osaka fights, berlin, paris, cant pick a favorite but each had some amazing stuff. All the set designs and OST are still amazing. Maybe the final 1v1 fight with yen was kinda anticlimactic with dueling pistols but I guess it was nice that it also slowed down to make it more personal.

"I loved near the end when John Wick says, on his grave he wants to be called a loving husband.

My take on the movie series is its about John Wick trying to get out of the life of being a professonal assasin and live a normal life, which he had done in the first movie. I believe itw as flashbacks that showed he wanted to move on and got married, but they had her killed?

Its been a while since i saw the first movie, but i think what triggers him is when they kill his dogk which for him was the closest he could get to being a normal person. 2, 3 and 4 were about him wanting a way out. In 4 he finally finds a way out but ultimately costs him his life. 

But the way i see it, his scarifice was worth while as it gave Johnathan his life and dignity back, and gave fairness back to the whole thing.

This was also easily the funniest film in the series, the whole theater was losing it for like the whole duration, which is impressive given how long it was.

I was worried IV would suffer since it’s the first one to not have the original writer (not that the writing was this franchise’s strong suit,) but the writing is actually *better* here. not by leaps and bounds, but definitely better. 

not that it matters, but does John’s bulletproof suit help him against spinal injuries? that dude fell on a steel beam like 3 different times and just walked it off every time. I know injuries in this movie only really happen when you’re an NPC or the plot requires it, but I just kept thinking this dude is getting absolutely bent on this rods and nothing is happening!!!!

every big set piece was phenomenal. him falling down the stairs was a lil silly, but I can forgive that for how bad ass he and Caine were together when they went back up. 

the overhead oneshot was unlike anything I’ve ever seen in a movie and was fucking awesome.

most fun I’ve had at the movies this year. I’ve watched 12 new releases this year and while I don’t think this one will stay at 1, I don’t think it’ll leave my top 10. the only threats I see for it in the near future are Mario and Guardians.",2023-03-26 05:22:01

People comparing this to T2, Die Hard etc. are high on something. As far as non-stop fights go, this was quite a ride. Cartoonish skin-deep villains, shifting alliances with foes, etc. it was fun. But this is action to the absurd, somewhere more serious than a satire or parody, but with the same effect. A hyperbolic homage?

One thing I noticed across all the John wick movies is that John makes several trips across different continents without it being explicitly stated how he got there.

"I know it's a small moment but John hesitating to kill Caine in the beginning of the movie was one of my favorite scenes. One of the things I love about John's character is how emotion-driven he is and that scene showed how much he valued his friends.

Also needed more Akira!! Was expecting her to come back later in the film and was kinda disappointed she didn't (aside from post-credits of course). Hard to pick my favorite set piece but I really enjoyed the sequence in Osaka.

Donne Yen was great. That ""fuck off"" had our whole theater cracking up. I loved how his character wasn't like Daredevil either - he was skilled but clearly had moments he couldn't see.

Other thoughts:

- Fucking stairs man lol
- The Marquis getting shot through the head got a big round of applause in our theater
- The Paris roundabout sequence was so much fun
- Lance Reddick dying so early in the movie...hurts man
- The Paris house sequence was straight up out of a videogame and I loved it
- Cinematography and color in this movie, just wow

One of my favorite shots of the whole movie was Winston coming to bring the dual terms. The juxtaposition of him against the painting and the kindof absurdly long take of it was so good. It reminded me of Barry Lyndon for some reason. Amongst all of the fast cutting action and very objective cinematography that shot felt like a weird breath of air.

"Probably in the minority, but I was a bit disappointed. Especially by the action. Sure, there's some nice cinematography, especially in the Paris segment. It looks gorgeous, but it lacks variation in my opinion. Many fights are just the same combinations of shoot-outs and throws. My problem with the shoot-outs is that all of the blood is CG. They just don't feel as visceral as e.g. John Woo shoot-outs with practical blood effects and slow-mo shots. And the magic Kevlar suits take a lot of tension out of the shoot-outs. 

And in the martial-arts segments, you can see that Keanu Reeves and Donnie Yen are almost 60 years old. Donnie is a martial-arts legend. I just watched In the Line of Duty 4 last weekend. The martial-arts scenes in that film are other-worldly. It's a whole other level than what's shown in JW4. Both of them are obviously in amazing shape for their age. But I wonder why there are no action stars in their 20s or 30s? Where's the new talent? Why are all the big action franchises led by actors in their 50s and 60s (The Rock, Diesel, Cruise, Statham, Reeves, etc.).

It's still a 7/10 for me, cause I looove how huge and megalomaniac this film is. It's so gloriously overdramatic and theatrical and it fully commits to its act. And the set design and cinematography are gorgeous (except for the Sacre-Coeur finale which looked to digital for my taste). It's the closest we get to a Heroic Bloodshed film made in Hollywood.",2023-03-30 14:14:14

I really enjoyed myself at this film but I can't say it was a different feeling than any handful of Fast and Furious movies. Both have me smiling, eye rolling, and chuckling at the absurdity. Yet Wick is loved and Fast is hated (though both make a lot of money and are enjoyed by general audiences). It just doesn't feel a lot deeper than Michael Bay types, which I feel has a clear place in cinema.

The story and suspension of disbelief is so deeply stupid in all of the JW movies, but why care? The fight choreography and Reeves doing awesome stuff is easily worth the admission price. This same lens can be appropriated for so many types of movies. It actually makes a lot of Marvel/superhero movies feel much worse - unbelievably stupid or bad stories compounded by inferior CGI boring battles. 

I think it ends up coming back around to discussions like Scorsese criticizing the roller coaster type thrill ride movies as not cinema. He specifically calls out superhero movies, but I fail to see how JW isn't a superhero since he has greater durability than Captain America.

The only reason I point this out is because you can look at some of the reviews from the certified fresh column for this movie and find the same reviewer absolutely dumping on other extremely similar movies where you could interchange the reviews. I suppose the difference is JW just has action that is better and more satisfying than the others, but that isn't the focal point of many of these (seemingly hypocritical) reviews.

Anyway I really loved the movie and enjoyed it. It's dumb fun and Keanu rules. I guess my dumb pointless reddit rant was more about review culture than anything else.",2023-04-04 12:16:23
"Loved the movie, only criticism is that it could’ve been 30 minutes shorter if Keanu didn’t deliver his lines in slow motion.",2023-04-05 00:35:49
I know that everyone in this movie uses bulletproof clothing but given the amount of blunt trauma characters suffer without making them stop fighting makes me think that at this point they all have Wolverine's healing factor.,2023-04-07 00:09:02
"All the shootings and killings, where’s the police, swat team, army ? Nobody called ?",2023-04-07 12:28:54
"a fun ride but i dont think it had to be as long as it did; there were several scenes that could have easily been edited down a bit and with their current length came off as comedic and undercut the tone of their respective scenes. ones that come to mind were them actually fully showing John tumble down all those damn stairs, and Winston taking like 300 years to walk through the art gallery. when it started i made a joke to my friend that the rest of the movie was going to be Winston walking in there, but then it actually DID just KEEP GOING for like a full minute lol.

i also have a hard time suspending my disbelief that the blind guy is just as prolific of a fighter and killer as Wick, even though it is Donnie Yen. like why wouldn't John just duck during the duel, or take a step to the right, or literally anything? idk. Donnie's fight scenes were so on point with the choreography also that they made Keanu look slow in his own scenes but I guess that can be chalked up to Wick just being mad tired after fighting for 4 movies",2023-04-07 14:02:28
"I’m a little late but did anyone notice how Caine didn’t kill any of the people at the Osaka continental? 

The rest of the movie he kills. 

I don’t even think it was about continental grounds since he tries to kill John. But he did NOT kill any of the Japanese henchmen. Just thought that was cool.",2023-04-08 02:13:53
"Just got back and that movie was so fucking epic. I was very wary of the run time going in but I actually thought the pacing was perfect. They did some build up in the beginning and then had some good breaks between the action. Some pretty shocking moments overall in the film, especially the ending. I'm really not sure what exactly the future of the Wick series looks like. 

Overall I was so impressed with the cinematography and the action scenes so much. Every scene they honestly set up so beautifully with the scenery. And the action...I mean I can't even describe how fucking epic all the action scenes were. Donnie Yen also was so masterful in his role, I mean there isn't really much to say. I really can't even say what my favorite action scene was, honestly all the Paris/end of movie action scenes were just so fucking good.",2023-04-08 18:30:06
This movie was so stupid I loved every second of it.,2023-04-09 01:06:36
"It's hard to imagine a more extreme evolution of the direction the JW movies have been going in than this one, assuming we aren't completely giving up any pretense of John being human. It's a spectacle to watch, for sure.

And yet, I can't help but miss scenes like [the bathhouse from JW1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77X1yGjjHvQ). I won't say that the sequels are lacking in visual/physical artistry (the cinematography, the long takes, the stunts, etc. etc.), but this scene has a sort of pacing/storytelling artistry and intensity that it seems has been missing from these movies for a while now. Overall, I think it's just a much more balanced mixture that made it more compelling to me.",2023-04-12 01:21:41
"Overall I really enjoyed the movie, but I’m gonna get a couple of unpopular opinions off my chest here.

I feel like everyone is MASSIVELY overselling the dragon’s breath sequence. The fiery shots look cool for sure, but nobody actually did anything novel with it, even once! I wanted the fire to be used in an interesting major way by both John and his opponents; I wanted the whole damn place to be on fire at the end of the sequence! The camera angle was also a neat trick, but at the same time, it really took me out of the intensity of the action, it made it feel like I was just watching someone play a video game.

Also others have said it before me, but it’s crazy how they escalated the bulletproof suits to be pure magic — now bullets just ricochet off them and don’t even knock, bruise, or affect the wearer at all. In JW2 John holds the suit in front of his face as like a last-ditch desperation move, and you get the sense it would really fuck him up if anyone actually landed a shot there… in JW4 it’s everyone’s go-to move and works 100% great, which feels completely looney tunes.

I also wish they focused more on the logistics of mag counts, reloading, cover, that kind of thing. It’s not like I’m in the theatre counting rounds or anything, I just really appreciate when the movies DO have that attention to detail, and it felt way less present and gritty in this one.

Anyways, you might not believe me but I really enjoyed this movie!! Just wish they handled some of the action differently and wanted to throw my two cents out here.  :)",2023-04-12 02:03:32
My favorite beat was watching Winston walk with purpose for like... 30 seconds wearing the loudest shoes on the wood floors past all those paintings.  It just kept going.  And it was delicious.,2023-04-16 05:37:25
"I'm just not sure how I feel about one aspect of the film, namely that they basically give Wick and select other characters invincible bullet armor that is, far as I can see, not much heavier than regular clothing, but seems to have the characteristics of hard, thick steel.

I will give them much credit for not simply saying ""oh yeah kevlar suit"" and then doing nothing. The choreography incorporated it quite heavily and they clearly put a lot of thought into developing a combat style for Wick that made use of it in the constant grabbing of the lapel, or shielding of the face with the arm.

So as far as (literal) plot armor goes, it was much better done than most films which just handwave it away, but all the same, it meant some people were just unlimited damage absorbers, and by the end, on the stairs scene in particular, it felt way too overused (not to mention, I guess it also absorbs being hit by cars or falling four stories?).

I liked it when it was just a matter of peeping around a corner with his lapel up, but when he was just completely out in the open and functionally impervious to bullets... really wore thin. When they inevitably make his death be a fake out (and/or whatever the spin-offs end up being) I hope they tune it down a bit.

To be sure though, as long as they keep doing a lot of cool gun choreography and (mostly) A+ cinematography, IDGAF at he end of the day.",2023-04-17 02:35:39

I liked the vivid colors and cinematography. Whoever was in charge of lighting did a fabulous job. I liked the grand locations.

I think Bill Skarsgard was miscast. He doesn’t have enough of a presence to be menacing and psychotic enough. Should’ve casted a different actor.",2023-05-28 07:30:20
John Wick’s durability in this movie is MCU-esque,2023-06-04 04:36:18
"So when the duel is about to happen, Morpheus and Swearengine give John Wick a new suit and take him on a ride down an underground canal on a fancy motorboat along with.

Meanwhile, everyone in Paris knows that there is a huge bounty on killing him - including Wick.  Yet he seems to get dropped off at the Arc de Triomphe which is quite a distance away from the Sacre Coeur (location of the duel).

Swearengine shows up at the duel early without any issues.  

Why don't they transport Wick to the Sacre Coeur like Swearengine?

Just stick him in a random car with tinted windows and drop his ass off close by rather than let him... walk in plain view?

That way he wouldn't have to fight off half of Paris to make that nightmare commute to the Sacre Coeur.",2023-06-05 19:45:24
I really wanted to like the movie but I thought it was terrible at parts. The fight scene in the club literally NOT A SINGLE PERSON stops dancing when people are getting killed right next to them. The whole movie is absolutely ridiculous. Talk about suspending belief… at least in the first three there was some way to think he was human. I thought this would be an action movie not some ridiculous Superman fight scene garbage. Terrible!!!,2023-06-10 05:41:15

"I came here, months after it's release, having just finished this monstrosity to say that I think it's total garbage and I haven't seen 5 minutes in the entire series that I've thought were good. 

The standards for moviemaking are total shit. The global audience can't understand enough english dialogue so movies like this and Fast, Furious keep getting churned out to international markets where they don't have to pay attention to anything other than candy car crashes with purple and pink lights making everything look yummy. 

Completely overdone nonsense where no plot is necessary. 

John Wick isn't even a character anymore. He's just a thing that moves though scenes from the beginning to the end so that the credits can roll. 

It has no meaning whatsoever. It's a video game. 

I hated that I complained about the other 3 movies and got sucked into this giant time waste again. 

At least I haven't paid a single dime for anything to this franchise. 

It's elevated trash that lasted WAY too long had way too many action sequences and I can't tell the movies apart the scenes are so similar in choreography it's not even worth it. It's just more kicking and shooting and stabbing and nonsense for 180 minutes.",2023-07-11 13:59:48
Shit movie bad scenes horrible choreography shit music cgi  plot makes no sense the ending makes all the other movies worthless,2023-03-28 17:32:29
"Without a doubt the most dumb and ridiculous action film I have ever watched. Yet also quite fun and entertaining. My only major complaint is a lot of sequences just lasted way too long making the action feel very repetitive. This film would have been better if they cut a good 30 minutes out.  
  
This film doesn't even try to act realistic anymore, I find it hilarious to think the entire world is fully aware of this secret assassin organisation. Just continuing to live their lives normally while there's people having axes buried in their heads less than a meter from them or goons being thrown into the front of their car.  
  
That top down sequence was a lot of fun to watch and probably the most unique and interesting part of the film.  
  
Personally the first film will always be my favourite, it was somewhat grounded and believable. As soon as they introduced the bulletproof suit in the second film the stakes dropped as John became invincible. That's no more obvious than in John Wick 4 where he just survives impossible scenarios and they don't do a good job making it seem plausible at all.",2023-03-24 13:19:58
"An enjoyable movie with some pretty severe flaws. Following the same arc as the Fast & Furious franchise - started out with something gritty and pretty realistic but has turned into cartoonish substance over style.

* Donnie Yen rules. The crowd pop when he said ""Fuck off"" to the marquis, lol.

* But did he have to be blind? I half expected him to say ""I am one with the Force and the Force is with me.""

* The movie is way too long. Most of the action set pieces could be cut in half without sacrificing anything. Like, did Wick really need to fall allll the way down the stairs again?

* Fight/action choreography was pretty good, but not as great as previous movies in the franchise. Lots of ""enemies arriving two at a time"" in the hotel fight, and many instances of bad guys waiting to be hit.

* It's cool that they dedicated the movie to Reddick.

* Skarsgard's attempt at a French accent is hilariously awful.

* Does Paris not have any police officers? A huge shootout around the Arc de Triomphe and no authorities arrive to check it out? A million shots fired near the Sacre Coeur and no-one thinks to phone the cops?

* Having a secret assassin network run from the Eiffel Tower looks cool, but come on - millions of tourists traipse through there every year. Couldn't they find somewhere a bit more discreet?

Part of what made the original movie great was its grit and realism. Now Wick has unlimited ammo (most of the time) and jumps out of buildings and walks away without a limp? It's so Loony Toons I'm surprised he didn't drop an anvil on someone's head.

Still had fun watching it though, it's a gorgeous movie and I get why it'll make a ton of money. It's just not as good as JW1, in my opinion.",2023-03-24 22:51:29
"I rewatched 1-3 Tues-Thurs and had them all fresh in my memory going into 4 (Friday).

Switching writer for 4 with consistent directing was interesting. Absolutely loved the new ideas for set pieces they’ve been obsessing over showing us the past 4 years - especially the one-shot we all loved. Brilliant in all of them.

But the new writer superhero-fied it too much. Halfway through the Japan armored guard scenes, it struck me that I was watching a superhero script without the campy Halloween costumes and instead some tasteful lighting, directing, choreography, and physical acting!

I could have used less mashups of big name characters that convoluted John’s relationships and motivations (especially Donnie Yen completely) and more focus on JW and his firmly established relationship with Winston and their motivations against the high table.

This really hurt a lot of the payback in his “death”. Donnie Yen is not hateable enough for real gripping tension in the duel. He is also not loveable ex-comrade enough for emotionally gripping tension. Even the emotional exchanges with Halle on the couch and the side by side fighting together create a strong connection between the two of them for the audience. Caine’s just an additional mashup guy superhero-style for the sake of being there in the script.

Absolutely shocked when they made that third shot “mortally” wound him. Even if he’s back for JW5, the whole ending payoff was ruined by a guy (to the audience) who just claimed to be close to John taking him out in a pistols contest, which is John’s primary superpower - after we’ve watched him go to the underworld and back laboriously an unspeakable amount of times and heard even more stories in Russian accents that are at best watered down. If at least we knew John’s love for Caine’s daughter or something of the sort, there would be some emotional payoff of sacrificing 3 clean shots to spare a stand-in, rather than have John directly tensely duel Joe Burrow himself.

Super hateable super early on for shooting Charon.",2023-03-25 02:22:38

I miss JW chapter 2. I feel like the whole high table vs JW has taken precedence over JW actually doing a contract and showing how efficient he is at killing the boogeyman. I wish we could get that in chapter 5. I thought chapter1-2 was peak JW.,2023-03-24 12:43:11
"Did anyone else agree with Akira regarding John? She was one hundred percent right. The hotel and everyone in it was in danger because he broke the rules. When you look at it from the perspective of her character, John is a very selfish man. I know they're assassins or criminals, but he's gotten so many ''innocent'' people killed because of his actions. And he barely seems fazed.",2023-03-24 18:44:02
"I just saw it today and I was gonna make a long ass rant about pretty much why this movie is terrible and that there's bad 90's action movies that are more entertaining to watch than this dribble. But I'll just leave my key thoughts on everything. TL:DR this movie was terrible as far as action movies go and the only neat/entertaining part was the over head shot sequence.

The Elder scene was pointless.

What was the point of going after ""The High Table"" when he just focuses solely on the Marchese anyway?

Tracker guy...why? I honestly believe the sole reason they put him in was for the scene where John saves his dog instead of shooting him.

Bowery King. They just completely said ""Fuck this character plot"" other than to give him a suit and a boat.

Akira was basically pointless other than to basically show ""We're gonna do a spin off with this"" hence the end credits, I'd be surprised if they don't.

I don't know if anyone else caught this but they dropped the ball on the choreography. There were WAAAYY too many scenes where it's like 3 v 1. John fucks up two dudes and fights the 3rd. Then one of the two guys gets up and just acts all stunned until John TURNS to him and then guy is all ""Alright I can attack now."" Just awful compared to the first movie.

The ABSURD amount of BJJ. Like we get it, sweeping someone and rolling around and finishing them with a bullet to the head looks cool. But I swear to god that must've been 90% of EVERY. SINGLE. KILL.

And my last complaint. The whole ""Kill this man to get back into the family and get the crest"" was a total cop out and just bad writing.",2023-03-29 22:23:39
"Fantastic action movie, shitty John Wick movie.  I would've likely loved it if it weren't for the titular character because much of the choreography, sets, and location were wonderful.  Unfortunately, Wick himself was basically an immortal superhero the entire film until it was time for him to die.  The fall he took in the last movie alone should've killed him and he took two of those here... Barely a day between them.  Even ignoring the what, seven times he got hit by a car? 

I loved the first film, and to a lesser extent the second, because it really showed why and how Wick was Wick.  He wasn't invincible, he was just better than everyone.  He knew where to take cover, how to sneak to the perfect vantage point, and who to kill and when.  The second movie was less that but still did a few things right.  The third was a major departure, sadly, and this movie seemed to take everything wrong with the third movie and amp it up even more.   

9/10 action movie, 4/10 John Wick movie",2023-03-24 03:13:47
Is Keanu Reeves awful at acting or is that just his character? Every line he delivered was just cringeworthy. It felt like an SNL skit how awful his acting was when it came to him speaking.,2023-03-25 02:22:19
"Me (steps on an ant): Oh no.

"IDK how to feel about this movie exactly. The movie requires a total suspension of disbelief with the ridiculous stuff happening on screen. That I'm okay with on it's own. But then it tries to have serious plot beats (I guess they're serious) like the relationship between Keanu and Caine, or Keanu w/ anyone and it is just so bad. Keanu's performance in this movie, outside of the action, was like a parody of itself in a bad way. Someone in this thread said he sounds like an alien speaking English for the first time and I cannot disagree. The characters make a point to refer to each other as ""brother"" or ""friend"" but it reads like a total cliche with how they're all brand new characters with no chemistry or history. Maybe this movie is meant to parody itself?

&#x200B;

So you have a movie that is over-the-top to the point of it being comedic, and also unintentionally? funny at parts with the action scenes going on way too long with random henchmen strolling in, Keanu rolling down the stairs too long, the blind assassin being a character at all, doing the dog bit too often, characters soyjacking at the obvious bullet fakeout at the end, etc. Add in the terrible drama and Keanu performance, and I'm kinda confused at what this movie is trying to do. I feel like most of the action scenes could have been cut down by two minutes with how long they were dragging on without doing anything new to justify the runtime.

&#x200B;

It's funny at parts, the drama and dialogue/story scenes involving Keanu suck, some of the action is cool (top-down scene/most of osaka) but most of it is long in the tooth. I guess I have to say it's overall kind of bad in the end but maybe so bad that it's good. IDK.",2023-03-24 03:10:05

a) It was too long. I had to pee at one point, left the theatre, was gone for at least 5 minutes, and came back and the same people were fighting in the same area.

Then fighting in the middle of the Arc de Triumph and guys are just beeping cars like its not a bunch of people shooting up the place.

My long time friend was beside me and the shotgun with dragon’s breath was similar to one we used to main in modern warfare, and that just added to my already borderline explosive enjoyment of it.",2023-03-24 14:09:20
I really enjoyed it. The Arc de Triomphe sequence was the highlight of the movie for me. 9/10 from me.,2023-03-24 14:57:24
"I just watched this. I loved it, so much unrealistic but fun action. I would go as far to say it's the best of the 4",2023-03-24 15:43:12
I haven't seen this film yet but how does it compare to The Raid 2? Does this movie make that film's action seem dated?,2023-03-24 15:58:32
"One thing I learned from John Wick, is that all bad guys listen to Techno",2023-03-24 19:12:28
For me the homage to The Warriors leading up to the Paris free for all was the highlight.,2023-03-24 20:12:52
"I know this is a spoiler thread, but 

As someone that hasn’t seen John Wick 1-3, is this one worth watching? What should I know before hand?",2023-03-24 20:34:20
"Funniest moment in theater was when John finished down at all the stairs. Guy in the crowd says “shit, I’m surprised there aren’t more stairs”

Best reaction was the dog peeing on the corpse",2023-03-24 21:47:13
"✨️ *I am Klaus* ✨️

(***WHACK***)",2023-03-24 21:56:25
That disco scene had some Hitman 3 vibes,2023-03-24 22:47:21
The sound in this film is fucking incredible. When it opens to John punching that post it felt like he was punching through you. And that scene fighting on the Rue Foyatier whilst Justice ‘Genesis’ played over the action was sublime. The film was fucking mint.,2023-03-25 00:47:24
"Credit to everyone in the stunt crew, incredible work in all of the sequences and some great music matching it all. 

The villains really carried this movie, but loved the overarching story of friendship with everyone connected to John.

Genesis blaring with increasing tempo with the staircase steps was fucking incredible.",2023-03-25 00:48:40
The set design and visuals in this were incredible.,2023-03-25 02:03:52
"The homage to Matrix with the train station scene was perfect. In both worlds, it's truly a point of no return.",2023-03-25 02:21:50
"Everything about this movie was great, down to the fight scene with Jiminy Glick!",2023-03-25 02:33:55
"Was shocked by the ending but overall just a fun time . Loved Donnie yen in the spotlight , that fight scene in the club had a Tekken vibe for sure.

My one complaint I will say is the amount of damage Wick was tanking was a bit ridiculous. I wouldn’t have minded them introducing some type of drug or enchancer that at least can explain the extreme amount of damage he tanks",2023-03-25 03:09:33
This is the most video game a film can be. Especially the healing factor of John. Loved every overlong action set piece to bits. The stairs sequence and the paris apartment scene stand out,2023-03-25 03:18:07
I think this is probably the greatest action movie since Fury Road. The last hour alone has some of the best action set pieces ever.,2023-03-25 03:21:42
"I got the Cowboy Bebop ending starring Keanu Reeves. That ending shot felt very ""You're gonna carry that weight"" vibe. 

Never thought I'd expect dragon's breath slugs used in a movie, but my GAWD. I NEED MORE!",2023-03-25 04:19:28
"Almost screamed when Genesis by Justice started to play during the steps shootout. Chad Stahelski needs to make a Hitman movie asap. If anyone can properly adapt that game series, it’s him. 

Speaking of Hitman, really love all the video game influences this entire series upholds. The Hotline Miami camera work at that one part was fucking amazing",2023-03-25 05:51:55
Honestly felt weird watching charon get killed with lance passing days ago. Almost like I was watching him actually die.,2023-03-25 05:57:55
Scott Atkins was a stand out: didn’t recognize him until saw it on credits …,2023-03-25 06:10:42
"I think John Wick 4 and No Time To Die are very similar in how the movies in, in that both actors wanted to end the series on thier terms. I dont think Reeves, as great as these movies are, wants to play John Wick forever, im sure he wants to do other things, in the same way, i believe Daniel Craig wanted Bond to die, to make it final.",2023-03-25 07:35:59
Did anyone else catch Scott Adkins as the fat bad guy that John Wick had to kill? I thought it was him due to his voice.,2023-03-25 07:44:11
"I feel blessed that they allowed them to have an almost 3h movie. Everything feels relevant, the characters grow with the stakes, and the action sequences are absolutely stunning",2023-03-25 09:10:28
"Assuming he *actually* is dead, it would be really fun to take it in a weird direction and do a John Wick in Hell.

He’s distraught to end up in actual hell and learns that a man like him can never reach heaven where his wife is. So he makes a deal with the devil to return to Earth with the condition that he’ll be condemned to kill people for eternity, truly becoming **The Babayaga**.

EDIT: Ok I’m having fun thinking about it and I’m imagining what a Hell in the John Wick universe would look like. It would be really interesting to see a sort of stylised hell that fits the aesthetic of the franchise. I think it would work best if it was sort of modernised and sleek, but that’s just me. It doesn’t have to be the traditional pits of fire and endless physical torture. 

I think the Good Place did some really interesting stuff with the concept of Hell. It borrowed from Jean Paul Sartre and his idea that “hell is other people.” I think it would be cool for this franchise to do something similar. But with John Wick’s hell being his endless destructive path. 

Maybe it could be a chance to face the hundreds of people he’s murdered. Could make for some interesting character development to see what’s he’s done. Or it could turn it into some insane 200 v 1 fight where he has to kill them all over again. 

Anyways it’s probably not going in that direction, but it was a fun idea.",2023-03-25 09:40:57
"Unfortunately, the Elder's warning at the beginning proved correct. A sobering ending to the franchise.",2023-03-25 11:16:01
"This is best moment to take a quick bathroom break- 

when John enters the closed off train station.",2023-03-25 13:29:00
"Most fun movie of the year so far. Keanu just kills it as John Wick. The rest of the cast was spot on, especially Donnie and Rina. Unbelievable fight scenes. I loved Rina’s fight scenes especially the stabby parts. Came out of the theater a little deaf though.",2023-03-25 14:13:27
I feel so fucking dumb. I spent the entire movie thinking the Marquis was Viggo's son who came back to life.,2023-03-25 16:05:24
"I’d say John wick isn’t dead, He just changed identity and went to an east European country to continue his life as normal..",2023-03-25 16:33:04
"He can’t be dead yet, not when Aurelio hasn’t finished fixing his car. We’ll see him again, probably Christmas, 2030 😎",2023-03-25 16:47:50
The criteria for the amount of violence needed to run out of a club screaming was really arbitrary,2023-03-25 16:58:49
"Amazing movie, I loved it.

My only complaints is that some fight scenes drag on for too much. 

Other than that, almost perfect action movie. Great action. Amazing visuals.",2023-03-25 19:37:42
"Some thoughts:

1. The bravest thing John Wick did was wearing black in the desert. Yikes.
2. What if the concierge had been wearing one of those bullet proof suits?
3. The guys in the hotel wearing the body armor. That body armor seemed useless. They should have given them the same bullet proof suit John Wick wears.
4. Caine seems like he would be pretty easy to defeat. Throw stuff to the left of where you are, and sit back and watch him attack it. Then throw stuff to the right and watch him attack it. It's like using a laser pointer to play with a cat.",2023-03-25 19:48:37
"This happens within the first three minutes, so I hope it doesn't count as a spoiler, but those horses despawn as soon as there's no rider on them and the camera angle changes.",2023-03-25 21:01:02
"I absolutely loved this movie, i was expecting a bit different of a story of John setting himself up to break the table in a 5th movie.  I do kind of hope that he is truly dead, it seems like the right send off for the character.  The cinematography and fight choreography just chefs kiss, every fight sequence felt unique and had something memorable",2023-03-25 23:02:50
"If I had a nickel for every time Keanu Reeves was the title character in a movie whose first name is John where he had a scene shot from above killing people with a shotgun which set them on fire, I’d have two nickels. Which isn’t a lot, but it’s weird it’s happened twice, right?",2023-03-25 23:47:14
"**Pros:** Really great cinematography, especially the scene with Winston strolling through the art museum, as well as the sunrise illuminating the final shootout duel. Another standout scene for me was the bird's-eye view quasi-video game like shootout in the abandoned building in Paris - those incinedary rounds were literally FIRE, haha. Donnie Yen stole the show in the scenes he was in. I was cringing at first when he first appeared as a disleveled joke but in later scenes he was definitely on or even surpassing John Wick's level. The fact that Cain was blind made his fight sequences even more impressive.

**Cons:** John Wick falls down four stories onto a truck, and then minutes later is kicked down hundreds of steps, all with virtually no injuries. So he's basically Superman! At times the film required a bit too much suspension of disbelief.

**Overall John Wick 4 (2023) rating:** 9/10, go see it in theaters as soon as possible! Don't read online reviews about this film before seeing it, to avoid spoilers.",2023-03-26 00:45:41
"Almost the entire final act started off with “wow cool Warriors reference I think”…then she dropped the boppers line…then “Nowhere to Run” played.. and then he has to battle across town while people chases him and they just kept up with the Warriors homage.

Fucking loved it..now I gotta wonder How JW4 ties into the Iliad",2023-03-26 01:54:56
"I am somewhat disappointed that Marquis Vincent de Gramont turned out to be a rather cowardly bitch by the end. We already had a similar villain in Santino in the second movie. I figured that the duel would have been a conventional one, with guns and melee weapons, rather than a gentlemanly pistol duel. He doesn't even fully commit to the duel, attempting to grab the glory kill when Caine seemed to do all the hard work for him. I'm not too surprised, but I hoped he would have been a prodigy in combat like John Wick, though without the experience to truly match John Wick yet. Perhaps Vincent could have been akin to John Wick when he was younger. Turns out he was just a blowhard. He wasn't really a notable villain to me. A young villain with honor and respect for his organization's rules and history would have been nice. Not a prissy rich boy with a chip on his shoulder.",2023-03-26 03:02:15
"The Japanese daughter was underrated. The way she moved. Ridiculous impressive, had tears in my eyes. Never seen anything like it.",2023-03-26 03:05:14

Dolby Cinema is better than imax if you have it available. the bass IN the chair is great. opening scene with the punches you'll know what I mean.",2023-03-26 03:30:59
"I NEED MORE DONNIE FUCKING YEN!  That man has been gone WAY too long and I didn't realize how much I missed his screen presence until now.  Especially in this role, he was able to play someone who was a lot more fun and witty instead of the usual, stern, stoic, protagonist.  

He's getting old though, we only have so many more years with him.  Hollywood, get this man in everything!  I honestly think he deserves Bruce Lee status at this point.",2023-03-26 03:31:14

the only scene I thought was a bit too goofy in this otherwise fantastic film was him falling down the stairs. felt like [this clip from Family Guy.](https://youtu.be/zKVyliJ4hhg),2023-03-26 04:55:36

I think this movie John killed more people than all 3 films put together and honestly this one is the best in the series,2023-03-26 06:33:42
"It was okay but went on too long, the scene in the club was utterly ridiculous, guys fighting and shooting and everyone around them is still dancing, the club scenes themselves were the weakest of the series",2023-03-26 07:38:53
"Watched 1 2 and 3 a few years back but didn't finished 3 cause it's getting a bit ridiculous, just finished it recently since am planning to watch 4. Dunno what I expected, reading a few comments here saying this one has continuous shots on action scenes had me excited plus the high scores. But man this is painful to watch, bored me to death. There's something about John's invincibility and the fights looking a bit slow for my taste. Seems like the goons are waiting to attack before Wick attends to them to take action. Didn't enjoy it sadly and nearly put me to sleep.",2023-03-26 08:05:44
"All I could think is....

Theres an elevator RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER JOHN JESUS JUST GET A LIFT UP AND FUCK TBOWE STAIRS",2023-03-26 08:07:20
Best movie ever,2023-03-26 09:57:48
"It's not going to get it because JOHN WICK but the cinematography in this movie deserves Oscar nomination, if not gold.  It's some of the best since The Revenant.  The opening, almost barren view of the sun on the horse chase scene, the Eiffel Tower filmed beautifully in day and night, the top down dragons breath rounds fight. Damn. Like you didn't have to go that hard man.  In addition to being bone crunchingly brutal it was gorgeous.  

The final fight up the stairs was brutal and everyone in my theater made sounds of pain and disappointment when he ended up back at the bottom.",2023-03-26 12:11:01
[deleted],2023-03-26 13:22:14
"Fuck I’m so in love with this movie. The cinematography, the music, the choreography, the lighting and colors, it’s a fucking masterpiece of action filmmaking.

All the action sequences were stellar. The Japan arc, The Club in Berlin, the Dragon-Breath/Top-down fight, this movie completely plays out like a video game with small boss battles in between getting to the final boss…it’s so so SO GOOD. 

I’m still so enamored by the color palette though, the fact that a John Wick movie is genuinely one of the most colorful and visually stunning movies I’ve ever seen is so surprising. And the action is so incredibly well choreographed it’s as if you’re watching a dance. This movie was perfect.",2023-03-26 14:32:41
Loved the ending. I don’t know where they can go because TBH the whole “John Wick vs the world excommunication double decker taco supreme” angle is played out. Like does he literally have to go to the high table itself and flip it upside down and set it on fire to end the whole thing or what?,2023-03-26 15:35:15

"While I agree on how this movie shows the culmination of John Wick story, I wish they showed him alive in post credits, living as a free man with his dog and his car somewhere, no more Wick just John",2023-03-26 19:00:48
That fat mob guy was great lol,2023-03-26 21:17:56
"How the fuck hasn’t there been a Wick shooter or action game akin to Hitman, yet?

This was the best video game movie ever made. They’ve finally made it feel exactly like a game. Enemies that are bullet sponges, wave attacks, even the flow of the plot. And I say this all in the most complimentary way possible. 

Great way for the series to go out, if this is the last mainline entry. 

But, they should absolutely make a game. Something RPG-ish (at least, choosing your own equipment and abilities), emphasis on movement, just wanton mayhem.",2023-03-26 21:54:16
W-UXIA Radio was a good little gag,2023-03-26 22:30:45
"They should do John Wick prequels - his backstory, how he got into this business, how his reputation build, his many assignments, etc. Just need to find a young man that looks like Keanu and is good like Keanu.",2023-03-26 23:21:47
"The dragons breathe shotgun scene was incredible. Whatever about the onslaught it looked a single take. 

You know what im tired pretending it’s not. John Wick for me is now better than Star Wars. Just an incredible, enjoyable trip to the cinema everytime I’ve gone and never gets tired watching it multiple times at home. Love it",2023-03-26 23:30:12
"This guy needs to learn how to climb stairs 

Also why leave the safe-house tunnel just to wander around getting shot at for hours, should’ve been a sneak mission or smth 😂",2023-03-26 23:30:19
"Those stairs! Great action, but then I was like, ""Is that... Justice?"" I felt like one of those Berlin clubbers that just wanted to dance in the background of all that mayhem.",2023-03-26 23:46:10
Excellent movie! just sad how the ending went but it was a good one nonetheless,2023-03-26 23:58:00
"I love how ridiculous these movies are. This one is probably the most fun I've had with the series since the first one.  
  
The thing I love about these movies is the world building. They established that all the shooting and violence and such happens inside an invisible bubble where police don't get themselves involved.  
  
I think the only time in the entire series I can remember police even getting somewhat involved was the house check on Wick after he killed all the intruders.  
  
But back to the world building. I love how with every movie, every culture seems to have their own style of killing. The Japanese with their samurai swords, bow & arrows. Wick is well versed in all of these killing styles. Caine's blind man style incorporates more kung fu martial arts in his style. We saw at Gramonts' compound and horse stable there were some equestrian riders I wonder if that was sort of the French style we didn't see for their assassins, riding on horses.  
  
I really loved the Osaka stuff. We know Japanese culture is big on honor and loyalty. So the fact Koji basically shut down the entire hotel to protect Wick over some favor and friendship we had never seen before, said enough. That whole sequence in the movie was arguably my favorite.  
  
On a personal note, I was just in Paris end of 2021. And it was so funny literally seeing them have all the major plot points of Paris at all the places I went to. Eiffel Tower is the obvious one. But I walked those 200 steps up to the Sacre Couer. The Arc de Triumph, etc. Just was cool to be like hey I was there at night time and it looked just like it did in the movie!",2023-03-27 00:12:42
The warriors tribute made my day!,2023-03-27 01:28:34
"Someone in that teach definitely watched Cowboy Bebop when they suggested that end.

I almost expected the ""bang"" at the end.

Donnie Yen seemed like he had an absolute blast playing this role.,2023-03-27 03:54:02
"While watching this movie, i thought to myself: huh it’s wild this franchise has never done a oner before, especially considering how well the fight scenes are shot and how much work and care is put into the fights/stunts. 

shortly after i was greeted with one of the most breathtaking oners i’ve seen in a while lmao this movie ruled",2023-03-27 07:06:07
"I feel like John is still alive given that he was shot in places, similar to the doctor's instruction in JW3.
Only a theory though.",2023-03-27 14:39:32
"I like how the blind guy could do things like fire a gun accurately, quickly cut someone's throat, and stab John's hand precisely, but then would struggle to reach for something right in front of him",2023-03-27 14:43:51
It was pretty good…but the arc de triumph scene was over the top ridiculous. They made it seem like civilian drivers are completely oblivious to their surroundings and a police presence doesn’t exist in Paris.,2023-03-27 15:20:04
"Maybe I missed it due to the adrenaline high I was getting from the whole movie, but why wasn’t John pissed at Winston from shooting him at the end of Parabellum?",2023-03-27 17:32:05
If John Wick really is dead I think it's a cool easter egg that he drew 'Dead Man's Hand' in the card game.,2023-03-27 20:26:00
"My only gripe with this one was the story. I know in a JW film it's more about the action and such, which was top notch, but the whole film felt like it had no direction other than the action.

I swear John never said more than 4 words at a time and delivered every line like he was struggling to remember how to speak. The tracker/nobody guy seemed to serve no actual purpose in the story. We never learned anything about him yet he was given so much screen time. Even Cain seemed randomly thrown into the movie as if we were supposed to immediately accept his place and care. 

In the end John died but for what? He killed some table underling that will just be replaced. He earned his ""freedom"" just to immediately die from a wound that he could have probably survived without too much trouble. I guess for his send off I was hoping for more of a resolution in the story.

That being said the fight scenes in this are some of the best I've ever seen. Sets the bar crazy high",2023-03-27 20:56:21

Also laughed at that 'Warriors' reference during that whole Paris fight, complete with them playing ""Nowhere to Run"". And of course, that entire climax. 

I'm so happy there's still action films with choreography like this. Zero shakey-cams, CG that isn't distracting, and kills and hits that look *painful*. All while throwing so much style around. It's so fucking visceral and over-the-top, I love it.",2023-03-28 16:50:12

"Did anyone else notice ""nobody"" was edited in into the last scene?

Like the fight is going on, and hes making commentary on the fight from a bench with his dog, but when it does a wide panoramic shot, you can clearly see the bench hes watching from is nowhere to be seen.

Action: A+

Score: A+

Cinematography: A+

Plot: what the fuck.  Are we sure that wasn't written by ChatGPT?  Again, even compared to F&F movies this was absurd.

All time excellent stupid movie.  9/10.

Edit: also did anyone keep count of how many times he got hit by cars in that Paris sequence?  I think it was 8.

Edit 2: also I am so happy they let the big boy kick John's ass for a little bit.  I thought he was just going to be a punch line, and then he pulled out real moves.",2023-03-29 04:45:11

"Just saw it today and it was a fantastic experience. This was my first time going to a movie by myself as everyone I had asked to go with me were not interested/doing something thing else/blah blah. I was very anxious at first but after some time as the movie started, I started to smile and enjoy this masterpiece in all it's glory. 

After the movie was over I realised that going to watch it alone was among the best things I'd done for myself recently. I had nobody to think about what they think about the movie, nobody to take my focus away from the movie itself, nobody to share the snacks with.

If any of you here is anxious to watch this or any other movie alone, do yourself a favour & just go to a theatre and watch it and while at the theatre, focus on the movie itself and you will have a very good time. Don't let somebody else deprive you from doing/enjoying something you want.",2023-03-29 19:31:51

"Can someone explain to me, in this John Wick universe, why are is there a worldwide secret society of assassins. Who are all these assassins assassinating?? Is there really that many people out there that need to be killed, that would warrant a worldwide network of assassins?

Okay, so say your an assassin in this society of assassins, someone comes up that needs to be killed, lets say Fred Smith. The bounty on his head is 20 million dollars. Therefore only ONE of these assasins can get the kill and get the money. My question is, how are these assassins making money, earning a living. Do they have normal jobs, say bankers, lawyers etc, and are part of this society as a side gig?",2023-03-31 06:11:12

Also found it funny how they kept reusing stunt men for goons lol, I think I saw that one Asian mook with a mustache die like 3 times.

Also good lord but if this was your first impression of John Wick you'd probably think he has a mental deficiency, Keanu's acting has never been good, but every line in this movie sounds like he's straining out a turd, it's seriously awful.",2023-04-02 01:21:32

"Has anyone noticed an important downgrade on the amount of blood and explicit violence during action sequences? From the first movie, the step up in the amount of brutality in each sequel was noticeable. But in chapter 4, we barely see splatters and spilling, some gunshots targets are cut off screen and, with the exception of some dragon breath (incendiary rounds) targets, there are no memorable deaths in this entry, like there was in 2 with the pencil, or in 3  like the stable or the weapon shop or the library fights. This was a huge let down for me, I know it's hard to use practical blood effects in complex coreographies, but at least some added CGI would have gone a long way. Previous movies achieved a pretty good balance between practical and CGI blood, but in this case, it seems it was an afterthought, and I think this is one of the main draws of the saga.",2023-04-03 12:08:55

Your colleague in New York in a very similar position to my own was just excommunicated and the High Table killed his friend to teach him a lesson, and he actually shot you off a building. My daughter fears this same fate or worse for us, and she's right to think so. Why would you drag us into your wake of collateral damage?""

"Action wise - the final third of this movie might be the most creative, fun, unique, and explosive combat put to screen second only to Fury Road. 

Story wise - it’s rough. Lots of time dedicated to characters and mini plot points that just go no where. Why did we need to see that backpack dude get stabbed in the hand? Why was 90 percent of the first 30 minutes dedicated to characters we have never seen before? Why is so much of the first third focused on combat that doesn’t involve John Wick?

There are long, long stretches of boredom. Story points that lead to nothing, and you feel that in the end. John Wicks death was done right, there isn’t a satisfying way to kill him besides one that he allows. But with a weak story and so much time focused on others, that death doesn’t elicit the emotions it should. However, it’s still John Wick. The action is literally leagues above anything else you can watch. The scenes are honestly exciting. It’s hard not to smile while watching fire endless incendiary rounds in an overhead cam, or fight in traffic.  This movie is awesome and you should watch it. But it’s awesome when it’s awesome, and for a lot of the screen time it is definitely not awesome",2023-04-06 03:52:52

There was a scene where the Japanese hotel manager started fighting the blind guy. The blind guy was like where is  John, i mean he was just in the hotel fighting you why are you asking, the manager doesnt know. It was like let's get these 2 guys fighting.
Then what did it for me was him jumping off the 6th floor. I mean in all the other movies there where some logic but this one just dropped all logic there is.",2023-04-22 08:46:21

- Donnie Yen’s character was completely unbelievable. Great acting though.

- The things John and other characters survive got a bit too ridiculous compared to the rest of the movies. I think realism was what made the first two movies so good; yes, they weren’t 100% realistic, but they also didn’t throw realism out of the window.

- Weak emotional beats. The last duel wants you to root for both characters, but the fact is we only met Caine this movie. 

- Lack of style. Compare the club fight scene with the club scene from the first one. Complete downgrade.",2023-05-14 02:23:28

Or the nunchucks where John uses them like never saw that weapon in his whole life. And only after several minutes does the choreography actually improve to show the character is a master, not a rookie.

This movie was utterly pointless.",2023-06-14 02:52:06
"There is movie disbelief, that is easy to look over that we see in John Wick and other action movies. Like 10 guys firing at him as he's sitting moving slowly in a car with no doors or windows, and everyone misses, or when he's falling 3-4 stories onto a solid piece of iron, then the ground, without anything broken. List goes on and on.

Yet blind assassin that can read cards? Struggle to pick up something from a serving tray being held beside him, yet can shoot, duck, sword fight, dance through new locations, never been to. For me I found it just pulled away from the flow of the movie, it stuck out so badly that I just told myself he can see and forget he is blind. Then the movie became more enjoyable. Him being blind doesn't add anything to the movie for me, and was just breaking the movie world rules too much for me.

I did find the choreography in parts to be badly slow, in that you can see people are waiting for Keanu to hit them, and Keanu is showing his age, as in the hand to hand stuff he's moving very slow and awkward again stood out especially early on in the movie.

Bringing bow and arrows to a gun fight eh... Just give John Wick a gun and let him do what he does best.

The nobody character was pointless really, the dog is cute so maybe they do that for audience approval.

Overall was a very good looking movie, back to more of the rules of that world. Was funny hearing him take the family oath and being all serious, when they had already broken those bonds before. So how seriously can you take it the a second time. 

Hopefully he didn't die and they just made his gravestone. Would be shame to go through all that.

Starting at the motorcycle action scene to the overhead view scene the movie hits its grove all the way to the end. They put in so many nice picture perfect scenes throughout the movie, would want screenshot posters. 

I'd rank the movies from best to worst as 1,4,2,3 

4 over 2 since the action set pieces in 4 definitely are some of the most memorable.

This 4th movie reminded me of guns akimbo, as I was expecting them to put a graphic overlay counter of how many stairs he was climbing... As well as headshots, kills etc...

Fun popcorn movie... Believe the count is 140 kills in this one alone...",2023-06-20 23:36:23
"Just saw it. Great action, but Jesus Christ Keanu cannot act to save his life. 

His delivery is below porn acting levels. 

Don't get me wrong, he's an incredible performer, but unless they deliberately made him give deadpan lines for every single scene and refuse to show any emotion, he's just not good at acting. 

You have monotone, boring delivery from Keanu, across from Ian McShane and Skarsgard. The difference is painfully obvious.",2023-07-08 01:11:37
Liked it didnt love it. Was way too long and the action was starting to bore me. Especially the one in the street and up the stairs. The top down view fight with the dragons breath was cool. I also felt there was way too many characters especially the tracker guy. Hes was pretty pointless. They could have combine him with Donnie Yens character. And the most unbelievable thing was how they kept their shirts so white after fighting all day.,2023-03-24 03:23:22
"I always love a John Wick movie and I really enjoyed this one, but there were several things that broke my emersion.

 * A lot of action that stopped so other action could happen. 
* When he was being chased by 4 cars and 2 motorcycles, but then circled around a group of guys to shoot them. What happened those those cars that were behind him?
* In Osaka he fought 2 armored guys and one of them kept falling and couldn't get back up while John beat the other one down. Just watching him struggle for so long after getting hit with nunchucks was weird.

 * There was a moment when John was rolling down the stairs and he could have stopped. But I understand they needed him to be at the bottom for a comeback moment.
 * Who was telling the DJ his location if he kept killing everyone in the area?


There's also plenty I loved about it, to name a few.

 * I find it funny how after the second movie the bulletproof suits became canon and everyone fights by ducking their head behind their jacket.
 * After playing Hitman, this movie made me realize that Berlin really does have a big rave scene.

"John should have just killed himself at the end of two, would have saved everyone a lot of pain, suffering and loss. 





John seemingly did not actually achieve anything across the last two films - the high table, structure, corruption, system is all in place as it was. John just got some of his friends hurt and killed but didn't actually further any goal. 




John set out to kill them all but didn't do anything. I wouldn't mind if something had changed, but John is dead and nothing has changed except some good people died and some bad people who will be replaced by equally bad people died. 





Also Winston could have raised the idea of the duel at the end of two, would have saved John some time. 





If John isn't dead and it is faked, then why wouldn't John do that at the end of two? If the hightable would still be aware then faking his death is pretty pointless.





Very cool action, set pieces and choreography. Pretty terrible ending that seemingly invalidates John's journey. John could have been free and died at any time.",2023-03-27 08:23:50
"Honestly, I have to say I really didn't like it as much as I wanted to. Huge fan of the series but man this was really lacking for me.

It felt like the actions scenes were very repetitive in this one, coming from 3 where we had the horse kicking deaths, and tactical dogs, and the knife duel, and Boban getting killed by being curb stomped by a book it just doesn't have anything like that for me.

The drone ceiling pov scene was very cool but that was really it, where as 2 and 3 it felt like it was loaded with stuff like that

Also I know Keanu is old as hell now and it aint his fault but it really shows in this movie and some of the fight choreography looks like dudes just waiting on their cue to do something",2023-03-29 01:27:06
"This is not a good movie. Watching an assassin as he fights, stabs, and shoots his foes in a bloody quest for vengeance, despite the fact that the Bible clearly states that killing is a sin.  
We follow John Wick as he battles for freedom from the council of crime lords known as The High Table, a vendetta that shows a blatant disregard for the sacred command the Lord bestowed upon humanity in Exodus 20:13, ""Thou shalt not kill.""  
Despite this crystal-clear commandment, John Wick puzzlingly spends the film's runtime either ignoring or intentionally flouting God's edicts as he guns down his so-called enemies and even pummels his fellow man to death.  
Even without being born-again into the faith of our savior, Jesus Christ, a passing knowledge of the Old Testament should make Wick aware of the divine law against killing that the prophet Moses brought down from Mount Sinai etched into stone, spoken to him by Elohim himself.
Strangely, however, he still repeatedly commits this transgression without once attending confession and repenting for his sins.  
While the character of John Wick does have redeeming qualities, seeing as he never covets another man's wife or creates a graven image before the Lord to engage in idol worship, audiences will likely feel these apparent virtues undercut by his willingness to spill the blood of fellow children of God, as if the love and grace of our Heavenly Father doesn't matter to him at all.  
Admittedly, the film makes some flimsy attempts to justify Wick's sinful nature, suggesting that his foes are also sinners who have strayed out of the light of the Lord, but most film-goers will easily see through this theologically misguided perspective which does not absolve John Wick of his wickedness. As we find in the Lord's word in Romans 12:19, ""Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord."" I mean, how could that be more clear? Killing is wrong.  
Still, while audiences will no doubt be saddened by John Wick's inability to accept the Holy Spirit into his heart while he succumbs to Lucifer's temptations, many will find solace in knowing that the Lord will eventually be avenged sevenfold with John Wick someday facing divine retribution for living in defiance of sacred ordinances, perhaps carried out by the swift flaming sword of the archangel Gabriel, or by St. Peter himself denying Wick entry into the shining gates of Heaven's kingdom.  
Ultimately, one can only hope that any sequel to ""John Wick 4"" follows the character's journey into repentance as he accepts the warm, loving embrace of the Lord and chooses to solve his problems not with violence, but instead by falling to his knees, taking out his rosary, and seeking the guidance of the Almighty God. And if not, audiences can at least rest easy knowing that after he dies, John Wick will go directly to hell.

"It seems I have the complete opposite opinion about this movie than most people. I thought it was WAY too long, lots of boring/repetitive action, and a lot of the movie felt pointless. The Japanese hotel fight scene felt way too long and served no purpose. Why was John there? The action was extremely repetitive and it felt like the same 2-3 takedowns continually repeated. I think that my problem was that the scene felt like 20-30 minutes when it should have been 10. Also, what was the point of Tracker/Nobody? It felt like they wanted a repeat of Halle Berry. In fact, I think it would have worked better if it had been Halle Berry, especially if the Table has found her daughter and was threatening her like they were doing with Caine. I did think that the movie got better when they got to Pairs (except for the stairs fight leading up to the dueling location, which again I thought went on too long and was too repetitive) and also thought the overhead shot scene was amazing. I almost wish most of the movie had been John trying to get to the dueling location. Also I think John's death was pointless (which I guess may have been the point, but that doesn't mean it's good). I have no problem with his death, but I feel like it could have done better. If fact it think it would have been better if the movie started at the Japanese Hotel, John goes to the his old friend/manager to get information about the current location of the Elder. The manager dies, and his daughter blames John way more. Then at the end of the movie Caine dies somehow as well as the Marquis. John goes to visit Caine's daughter to pay respects and the manager's daughter appears to kill John to bring the series's theme of revenge full circle. I don't know why this movie felt so different to me. I didn't have this problem with the other three movies.",2023-03-26 18:53:01

The best parts of this movie were Donnie yen, the Japanese fights, and that dragonsbreath hotline Miami shot, because they were new and creative.

"My brutally honest take is that the series peaked with the first movie. The cinematography in this movie is excellent, but the fight choreography is sloppy and nonsensical. Every single fight scene relies on ""highly trained assassins"" running at John one by one in the open. The fight scenes in 1 were much more grounded and believable, I can't enjoy the action in a movie when the tension is non-existent.",2023-04-01 07:22:43
"some excellent set pieces and top notch action, but i was kinda disappointed. 

the premise of the movie is very thin (especially considering the fact that the preceding movies in this franchise have tread very similar ground) and keanu can’t act to save his life. really felt like the action and villain’s performances did all the heavy lifting. also felt like there were a lot of loose ends/plot holes that became sort of frustrating as the runtime went on. i know these movies are not meant to be analyzed or pored over, but there should be *something* beyond the action that draws you in imo. 

i feel like it’s worth the price of admission but if you’re lukewarm on some of the other movies in this series, you’re not missing a whole lot that hasn’t been done already.",2023-03-25 03:55:31
I sadly did not like it at all. I had very high hopes for the movie but the fight scenes felt worse than the Liam Neeson trying to jump over a fence scene.,2023-03-31 15:10:09

I'm not trying to be overdramatic but this movie deserves an Oscar for sound editing and cinematography.,2023-03-24 05:30:05
"While I loved the creative shots for the final fights 

They really blew there load starting in Japan. I think those fights were the best in the series, it was just awesome seeing bows vs guns and the location was so well used and colorful 

It’s a great film, not as perfect as reviewers said it was. I felt parts were filler for world building and if they made this series a tv show I think the film would have been better paced but it’s amazing moments are so dam good that when the film slows down it’s noticeable only because of how high this film gets 

I can’t decide if this film or the third film is my favorite. But definitely both are some of the best action films ever made",2023-03-24 05:41:11
Lol as a CoD player particular section triggered me lol,2023-03-24 02:20:38
My god. I adored the shit out of this film.,2023-03-24 03:10:19
"Went the other night with two others - we’ve watched all four films together.

This was easily my favourite after the first (which I rewatched after seeing 4, and it is still the best one).

I don’t really know the terms, but the quality of the filming, the vibrancy of the colours etc was all amazing.

As always the action was incredible but if I dare say it some of the action scenes dragged a bit. I feel like they could have chopped a couple of minutes off each of the goon fight scenes (in the Japanese hotel, by the arc de trombone and fighting up the stairs) and not lost much but kept a tighter run time … I feel like it went for maybe 20-30 mins too long.

The scene with the rolling back down the stairs was a bit dumb (like I get the point but people in the cinema were laughing in a ‘that’s stupid’ way).

I really enjoyed the dialogue- focused scenes with Winston, the Marquis etc, some great lines.

The plot of the duel wasn’t what I was expecting at the start - I thought he was going to hunt down the table members and kill them off.

Ending was satisfying too, feeling like a natural conclusion and a fitting end.",2023-03-24 03:56:33
"That Lawrence of Arabia shot in the beginning, chefs kiss.",2023-03-24 05:30:04

"Did anyone else get confused over the lead henchman dying like three times? I guess they were just similar looking actors but I could have swore he died in Osaka where John took the pin off him, then when he fell down the stairs after trying to shoot the minois, and then on the stairs to the church when the dog got him.",2023-03-25 02:30:01
"PROS: 

\-This is PEAK Keanu. He was born for this role!

\-The Osaka Sequence is God-Tier!

\-Donnie Yen is the definition of cool!

\-The Birdseye view sequence covering an entire floor of a building during a shoot out!

\-The Flight of Stairs Sequence!

\-The Cinematography is amazing! All the colors pop!

\-The Pacing and Editing. Doesn't feel it's run time at all!

\-The Duel Sequence!

\-The Ending. Unexpected and Perfect! 

CONS:

 \-It had to end. 

This is the Apex Mountain of Modern Day Action Movies. These films have been an unexpected surprise and the people behind it have gone above and beyond, perfecting their craft along the way, to entertain the audience! In a world dominated by CGI Blockbusters, the John Wick films have been a breath of fresh air, relying on beautifully crafted stunt choreography, fantastic direction, and actors that came to play and who knew exactly what kind of films they were making. Chapter 4 took everything from the first 3 films and amplified it. I don’t wanna spoiler anything here, as this deserves to be experienced first hand. Keanu Reeves was born to play this character and this is his best outing as the character yet! I can't say enough positive things about this film. Pure Action Escapism. 9/10",2023-03-25 19:19:31
"I’m not a huge fan of the franchise but enjoyed the previous 3 films. But this one…..holy fuck it’s an action masterpiece. The cinematography, the sound, the stunts, the locations are incredible….and even the plot makes sense which is quite rare for such an intense action film. I loved it. I’m going again to watch it on the imax",2023-03-25 19:52:30
"The Pros:

1. Cinematography

2. Soundtrack

3. Action

4. Pacing

5. Choreography 

The Cons:

The plot. Im sorry but alot of this shit didnt make sense. The “old law” just allows anyone who is excommunicado to just…stop being that along with any list of terms if they win a duel…? And whats the point of having “excommunicado” if someone cant just…rejoin a family to be back in? 

And Wick’s death was not satisfying whatsoever. The entire movie they hammered home that killing the Marquis accomplishes nothing, as he will just be replaced “before the body is cold” yet alllll of this 4 chapter saga culminates in John dying to kill an inconsequential baddie? 

All of John’s friends/allies who had to die or be hurt along the way, only for John to accomplish what exactly? The 2nd hand man to the hotel is dead, the hotel itself is in ashes, the Bowery King is mutilated, Shimazu is dead, etc. 

I feel the series either needed to end with Wick dismantling the table entirely, escaping with his true freedom again, or dying to right his own wrongs. All he did was create more chaos and death..and for what? It’s established his motivation (other than revenge) was to “remember” his wife. Cant do that now, can he? 

Killing the Marquis was irrelevant to avenging his situation anyways. How was Wick dying at the end of the movie any better than him dying at the beginning?",2023-03-25 21:06:11
"I find pretty much all the “lore” in this series to be very silly and convoluted, but like what is the point of challenging someone from the table to a one on one duel if they can just sub in somebody else? Like that’s so stupid.",2023-03-25 22:18:29
God damn. That has to be one of the worst instances of a character's death and the actors being in sync.,2023-03-26 07:15:46
"The intro was a bit odd.

John rides out into the desert (the pistol-work was pretty lame), and meets the Elder, who is a different Elder, and then kills him. Just seems like a random additional plot-point - why was the Elder different, what happened to the old one, would it have mattered if the JW3 Elder was still there but didn't have the ring? We're led to believe this whole thing is happening over a period of months, not prolonged years, right?

It's not really worth dwelling on as killing him sets off the chain anyway, its just a bit random in a generally quite tight script.

Edit: I should add I don't necessarily disagree with him hunting down the Elder. I just don't know why its a different Elder.",2023-03-26 20:10:32
Whole theater applauded when John shot the Marquis.,2023-03-27 03:05:06
"Looking around on the internet i feel this might be the only negative review you'll read. I don't know if i really liked this movie, i like the jw franchise, and how it often pushes what is credible action, but in this movie i had difficulties believing what was happening. My main problems are:

Guns: guns have become obsolete weapons. The kevlar vest is cool, but people are just immune to bullets in this movie. It felt like swords were more effective weapons than guns.

Action: i felt a strong regression from the action in the previous movies, the camera started to become more shaky, particularly in jhon's scenes, out of all action scenes jhon ones are probably the most generic, with some exceptions (the over the walls shot was amazing, the club scene was also very good looking). The car chase felt cgi-ish.

Jhon wick:  jhon doesn't quite feel like he's jhon wick. He never is truly in control of a situation, he's just pretty much immune to bullets. He gets constantly surrounded, taken by surprise, and he just survives out of his property of not getting harmed by bullets. Also the way he takes out enemies is boring and repetitive.

Weird factor: i like the weird factor of the jw franchise. The kingpin looking guy was great, but sometimes things are just a little too weird, like most of the kingpin henchmen not using guns and using tomhawks instead with no context whatsoever. 

Side characters: side characters are pretty good, the dog guy felt to me like he was more jhon wick than jhon wick. I wish the bowery king had a bigger part in this movie.

Story: the story doesn't really make much sense on itself, and doesn't connect well with the previous movies either. The last movie ended with jw and the king plotting toghether their vengeance towards the table, hinting they are gonna try to dismantle the table system. They kill the regent at the start of the movie, but that didn't really work out. It felt more like a declaration of war but then he just randomly goes to the continental in osaka, and the movie reverts to the plot of the third one. It's the table stalking him, not him stalking the table. Even if the table couldn't be dismantled it would have been ok if they caused so much mayhem that the they would force the table's hand to give up. The bowery plays little to no part in the story. 

The marquis: the marquis is cool, but he isn't even a sitting member of the table, he's just a random guy they tasked with killing jhon wick. He isn't big enough to be the final enemy of the last chapter of the saga.

The ending: while it looked very good, with the very beautiful dawn shots, i don't think the ending is a satisfactory conclusion to the story. Basically jhon lets himself get killed for what? To save Winston and the blind assassin? If he had to die to get his freedom back, he might aswell just have died in the last movie. His death is just dumb and nonsensical, he literally achieved nothing, everyone who died, died for nothing, the guy in osaka sacrificed himself for nothing. It is also implied that even the blind guy will get killed. Just a weird way to wrap it up.

I swear i like the jhon wick franchise, if you could convince me that this movie is actually good i'd be happy.",2023-03-27 10:16:34

"This was one of the most jaw-dropping action films I've ever witnessed.  
  
Haven't felt that way since Mad Max: Fury Road. I now don't look forward to any action film simply because they raised the bar so high in this, I doubt anything in the next 3-4 years (at least) will be able to top or at least match it.  
  
Brilliant choreography and camera work.  
  
Donnie Yen was amazing and stole every scene he was in.  
  
And credit to Keanu for the insane effort he put in his action scenes in this one. I cringe at the fact the most they gave him in Resurrections was a ""force push"", considering what he put on display in this film.  
  
10/10 - easily. I need to see it again asap.",2023-03-24 22:53:26
"I'm sorry but when he got knocked down the stairs at the end, I was pissed. I was like, 'here we go again jfc'. I enjoyed the movie but it was an hour too long.",2023-03-24 03:17:22
"Action wise this movie delivered in spades and had some jaw dropping stuff in the final hour.

Plot wise I was disappointed. Various threads from the first three movies didn't get wrapped up in any way. Lawrence Fishburne did nothing and Winston just ended right back where he started in 1. Who learned anything? 

I was in this to see the whole high table wiped out and a new order established. Instead we introduced a bunch of new characters for a story that was good enough on its own but not satisfying as a conclusion which is what it surprisingly ended up being. 

The guy and his dog felt like they only existed to be a backdoor pilot or something, which is weird because I'd have expected Ana De Armas to be in that slot instead. 

I'm disappointed Common, Halle Berry, and others didn't return if this was the grand finale. and that they didn't really utilize Fishburne or Winston much. I don't like Winston getting a happy ending for himself either, not sure why. 

I was so on board with everything because I thought they were setting up 5 as the conclusion and then when I realized this was the conclusion I was bothered by how it all turned out. 

So as the conclusion to a storyline I had gotten pretty invested in it disappointed but as a 3 hour thrill ride and a stand-alone movie it was fantastic. Could have been tighter without the stuff that only existed to tease potential spin offs but it was still entertaining throughout. The first half of the movie really had John feeling like a side character, the second half of the movie more than made up for it.",2023-03-24 03:58:01

"Objectively, how absurd was it when Wick was kicked down the stairs, and afterwards is still able to walk?

Seriously, in real life your going to the emergency room, and you arent getting back up and moving around.

"I was the biggest John Wick apologist since 2014.  I wasn’t all that impressed with this one.  Nothing felt impactful with a character that has nothing to lose.  At least the second was about them disturbing his mourning period but after that I expected something more satisfying.  Had fun for the most part on this ride, but now I’m out.",2023-03-27 03:34:50
"Man I wanted so badly to like this movie but came out of it disappointed. I really loved the first one, still one of the best action movies of all time in my opinion. However, each movie has had diminishing returns - more action, more spectacle, but less and less story. The action felt so self-indulgent that it took me out of it. My favorite stuff was at the Osaka Continental but then we got to the part where John was just killing dudes with his nunchuks and gun over, and over, and over. Same thing at the club against Killa and his men and then on the stairs.

I always feel like the action should not only look cool but inform the story and move the plot along. There was so much action that could have been cut out of this movie and nothing would have changed. Action for action's sake if you will. The fact that he just takes so much damage and gets up like it was nothing also took me out of it. I liked in the first one after he fights Viggo, he's battered and actually limping. He actually got hurt in the other two JW movies as well but in this one he's basically like superhero just falling 4 stories and getting up like it's nothing. It didn't feel like there were stakes involved whenever there was any action. I honestly rested my eyes at times during the action because there was so much of it and I felt like I didn't miss much.

I love Keanu but man the dialogue and delivery felt so off, every time he talked I was like ""I guess this is just a stylistic choice to talk like this?"" I don't think it felt that off in the past movies.

This has been mentioned in some other comments but John had no real arc. I feel like the movie built up that he would be free and then he just dies at the end, it didn't pay off at all in my opinion. What were these 4 movies for? How many people died by his hand or friends that were killed because of his actions and for what? So he could finally die at the end?

Akira and Koji were awesome. I wanted to just live in that set piece and world and get to know them more.

Hope the movie does well, I freaking love Keanu. Just didn't live up to what I was hoping for the potential end of the franchise (at least for John's role since they have other spin-offs coming).",2023-03-27 06:37:55
"Saw it yesterday, and I liked it.

What I loved: The cinematography was incredible, absolutely amazing. The action was entertaining and well done... mostly. The conclusion of John's story was... believable.

What I didn't like: Jesus fucking Christ, how did John go from more or less, a regular human being who was a skilled killer, to an unstoppable force of nature?! How the fuck is this movie REALLY trying to pass off a BLIND man kicking ass as a believable thing? John Wick getting his ass handed to him by a morbidly obese man with a bullet in his ass who was doing high roundhouse kicks.... no. Just no. And more of that stupid fucking ""danger doggo"" bullshit, Jesus! And the ""don't hurt the doggos"" bullshit, or ""you'll regret it!"" Cringe. And this was def Keanu's WORST performance in the series. Mostly one word sentences. ""YEAH."" or ""CAIN"".

And why was the ""Elder"" recast? Did they not want to bring back Saïd Taghmaoui? Was that just a DIFFERENT Elder, who was talking about someone else when he said ""Like the Elder before me""? And John has family in Germany? When? This shit from the comics that no one has read? And while the action was entertaining, it did drag on in places and was just too over the top in others. John rolling, rolling, rolling, down those stairs after slaughtering dozens of guys and dropping from like 30 feet from a window onto the roof of a car, and he's more or less okay. Even the fucking DOG got thrown into the windshield of a MOVING CAR, and was more angry than hurt. Fuck outta here. And if you told me the final John Wick movie would spend a considerable amount of time of it's third act to referencing The Warriors, I wouldn't have believed you. I don't HATE this movie, but it's my least favorite of the quadrilogy for sure, with the weakest writing, probably because Derek Kolstad wasn't involved with the script. And that fucking post credits scene has me worried they're gonna make a bunch of spin-offs of John Wick.

In case you can't tell, the first John Wick is my favorite.",2023-03-29 14:54:03
I felt like I was watching someone play Mortal Kombat for three hours with an arthritic 57-year-old Keanu Reeves as the only playable character. The background characters behave literally like they are CGI objects. Each ludicrous sequence of him killing the same 50 guys is broken up by some absurd cut scene with the next goofy Dick Tracy villain.,2023-03-30 15:59:20
Can someone please explain to me why they didn’t just duel as soon as they decided to duel? LOL. These movies will give any excuse for an action sequence and it’s kind of hilarious.,2023-04-01 02:21:25
"Lacked the charisma and punch of 2, but overall, a more complete film than any of the first 3.

Objectively, this is the best John Wick film. It is also a fitting end to, what i would consider, an iconic character.

Cinematography was special this go-around. Did notice the use and saturation of blood wasn't as prevalent as it was in 2 and 3.

But I also think that this was less about being visceral and more about utilizing those fight scenes to exercise and transport the relationships John had in the world.

The fights supplemented the story, rather than the story having to navigate the fights.

Also, seeing the run-time scared me, but the pacing was incredibly well-done. I never felt fatigued watching it.

This is an A+ yam.

Like I said - a complete movie all around.",2023-03-24 05:37:20

The staircase scene especially went from oohs to laughs to oh fucks to more laughs to hell yeahs.   Speaking of which, that scene was my favorite in the film.  

I don't care if it's not as real as the first one.  They made it clear they were leaning into it when they made him fall four stories like five fucking times, it was absurd in the best possible way. 

Standout part of the film was that there were no ""final boss"" type characters like in previous films.  The guys that John usually has to fight but has a hard time fighting end up helping him out at multiple points, which was such a good decision and made for really, really cool dynamics.  

The villain of this movie was so well played.  He carried a grandiosity with him that you don't see much these days.  

Some of the shots in here were fucking AMAZING.  My favorite probably has to be the cherry tree shot with John on one side.  Close second is the card scene.",2023-03-24 03:37:44

"I knew leading up to this movie that they had originally planned to shoot Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 back to back but changed plans to only shooting Chapter 4 when Covid happened.

So I went into this movie so sure that this could not possibly be the last one, that there was going to be, at the very least, one more John Wick instalment.

That’s why it was such a shock when John dies at the end! Did not expect that at all! Especially as he won the duel against the Marquis and he seemed like he suffered worse wounds before and survived!

I know that some people are saying that it could be a fake out, that unless we see a corpse, we can’t be certain that he is truly dead. But I really think this might be the end!

John Wick’s story really feels like it is concluded and as sad as it might be that we might not be getting more movies, bringing him back for another movie would feel like they are cheapening his death. I think they ended John’s story in a really nice place.

Keanu Reeves is almost 60 years old too so he might not have it in him to do such an action heavy role again. There might be spin-offs featuring other characters as the post-credit scene implies but I don’t think John Wick will have another movie.

Seeing that this movie is almost 3 hours long, I think it’s possible that when the plans to shoot Chapter 4 and 5 back to back fell through, they instead opted to combine the plot of the two movies into one extra long instalment.

All in all, I loved this movie. I thought this was the best instalment yet and I hope there is more but I really think this might be the end of John Wick and I’m very sad about that. I really thought there would be at least one more :(",2023-03-24 04:39:55

"Yooooo that ending was straight up Spike heading into the building to take down Vicious 

The exploding/incendiary from the Birds Eye was one of the most awesome scenes in action. 

Straight up FPS style but this movie didn’t feel like a video game

What a way to end it. Best John Wick movie.",2023-03-24 06:39:25
"A Hotline Miami reference INSIDE of a Warriors reference? Oh yeah, this one's the best of the series imo",2023-03-24 07:11:05
John collapsing on the stairs in front of the church immediately reminded me of Spike's final scene in Cowboy Bebop.. both ex-syndicates with dead lovers and nothing to lose,2023-03-24 07:22:10
The homages to The Warriors and Hotline Miami made the third act my favorite part of the movie.,2023-03-24 07:32:22

"Cinematography was top notch.
Music was ace. Especially loved the Justice song while going up the stairs.

The action, can’t say anything bad about it, absolutely unmatched. 

The story? The marquess was kinda intimidating at first but in the end he was just a spoiled brat. Hoped for a 1 v 1 fight with Mr Wick.",2023-03-24 08:00:25
Movie was awesome. Donnie Yen was absolutely the star of the film. I hope they make a spin-off movie of the Caine character.,2023-03-24 08:01:23
"Jesus John Wick 4 is peak John Wick. Each action scene could be the climax in a normal action movie. The hotline miami-like sequence??? The Arc de Triomphe roundabount??? The club in Berlin??? All exceptional. A lot of self-awareness regarding John's quasi-immortality, got a good laugh at the staircase falls. Incredible choice of music too. Loved hearing Gesaffelstein and Justice in a theater. Cinematography was also off the chart, especially the club in Berlin and the duel at the end. A beautiful movie all around. This could be the end of the franchise if they wanted to, but as long as I don't see John's corpse I will not believe that he is dead. Props to Keany Reeves for doing so many action scenes at almost 60.
  
Also, what was that post credit scene? A big fuck you to Caine or a teaser for a spin-off?",2023-03-24 08:04:04
Shout out to the foley artists.,2023-03-24 08:05:59

"Obviously a great film like so many have said; the overhead long take shootout was unreal, and the set pieces throughout really were better than most other recent action films _best_ set pieces 

All the ""main"" side characters were great as well, which has been a bit uneven in this series in the past, but Donnie Yen and Lance (RIP :( ) were stellar and actually felt like they belonged in the universe JW1 set up.

But this one definitely felt its length to me. 170 mins, even with everything they wanted to cram in, is just too long for a film where you want great sounding set piece shootouts and nothing else, given the protagonist doesn't really talk or have a personality beyond vengeful dog owner and avatar of gun-death, which brings me to its only other downfall...

Keanu. Who I know is sacrosanct on reddit and esp here, and who I know could never really _act_ act anyway, but this was the worst/most Dracula-Keanu for a long while. He speaks like he doesn't know what words mean and he's sounding out letters phonetically. And they've really dialled up his pauses across these films - in JW1, he was stoic and brooding, now he comes off as a bit slow

Overall, I can't imagine they're going to kill him off for real, esp seeing as this is their best financial performer to date, and _Ballerina_ might need him as a draw, and I'm really hopeful for JW5. But they need to reign it in a little - keep it under 130 mins, and maybe don't lean into JWs personal mythology so much. He was a real, if shallow, character in JW1; its cool that _in universe_ characters, esp villains, mythologise him, but _we_ don't need to _only_ see him as a caricature of himself",2023-03-24 08:34:25
"This movie was such a thrill from start to finish. Obviously the action pieces and sets were all amazing, but i have three smaller comments:

Im so interested what kind of IP it would take to overtake John Wick…

I watched this in a Dolby Cinema theatre and the opening sequence rocked my seat with his every punch.

I could not get over how similar the Marquis looked like Joe Burrow, the quarterback for the Cincinnati Bengals. It was a fun diversion though hehehe",2023-03-24 08:42:34
"i watched a 10:45pm show.  it's 3am, the movie has been done for at least an hour and i am so wired.

**why is no one here talking about Winston, the отец??**

or am i missing something obvious?  i remember long ago around here was the first time i heard that winston might have been helen's father....  but no one i saw ever theorized *winston was john's dad*...  maybe everyone else knew and i'm the slow dummy (which wouldn't be the first time)...

* at the grave, when winston touches john's tombstone, you see a Ruska Roma cross on his wrist.  and he most obviously says, Do svidaniya, my son.

* at the end, john asks winston to ""take me home"" - i know this one is a little weak, but after seeing the gravesite scene, take me home hit different

* osaka continental is run by father and daughter, so it's fair that families could work together

* caine's whole journey is because he has a child.  it's all fathers and their kid

also, **fat hitler** in berlin made me laugh so much.  his ridiculous haircut, his sweaty-ness, and the gold teeth when he smiled looked like his moustache.  i enjoyed fat hitler getting killed.",2023-03-24 10:07:56

"I think the idea is that what happens in Chapter 4 becomes the new “legend” when citing the exploits of Baba Yaga, making the “impossible task” pale in comparison.

"Just got home from the cinema and initia thought are that I have mixed feelings on this one, same as number 3.

The action was great but only really shone in the Paris sequence near the end.

It follows the same problem I have had with every movie after the first, too much plot and exposition.

The first one had a pretty basic story and some cool worldbuilding but theyve just continued to expand on that until now it just feels bloated and a little silly. I’m really glad they didn’t show the high table which was what I was expecting.

A good portion of the movie felt like padding, the Berlin section especially could have been removed quite easily and not hurt the movie in my eyes.

With all of that said, the last hour of this movie was up there with the best action and moments of the franchise (I especially loved the top down house fight and homage to The Warriors) and a fitting end to John’s story.

I just really pray they don’t find a way to continue John’s story, show us another part of this world they’ve made sure, but if they bring John back I’ll be washing my hands of the franchise.",2023-03-24 22:48:58

Will be a day one purchase for me as soon as it comes out.

Plus the film is just beautiful. Very well shot.

An interesting tidbit of the making off: for the cars scene in paris they didnt close any street. That are genuine french drivers on a casual monday night,2023-03-25 00:04:35
"Outstanding movie, loved every action scene especially the one with the overhead shot. Had to stifle a laugh when the fat bad guy at the club toppled over the railings and fell directly on his head.",2023-03-25 01:37:07
Absolutely LOVED this movie. Probably my favorite of the 4. My only complaint: did anyone else notice the lack of reloads during the arc de triomphe scene? I may have just missed the reloads but it seemed like the infinite ammo glitch was on. I know it was a big magazine and I wasn’t counting the rounds but it seemed like he should have reloaded way more than he did,2023-03-25 02:50:39
I thought it was going to be a Yu-Gi-Oh duel when they had those cards on the table,2023-03-25 02:53:29

"A lot has already been said but special shout out to Scott Adkins for doing martial arts in a fucking fat suit as Killa. I love that he finally got a bigger part in a mainstream movie. He killed it!

I was so excited to see this amazing cast do their thing & wasnt disappointed.",2023-03-25 03:25:59
Felt like a Cowboy Bebop prequel. Especially the stair scene. Also at one point it looks like he throws Spike down the stairs.,2023-03-25 03:47:16
The entire stairs bit had me wheezing like hell. my god,2023-03-25 03:49:00

Shoutout them using French techno and electronic music in the Paris fight scenes. Was a nice touch,2023-03-25 04:51:23
"Fitting end for a great action quadrilogy, It's nice that they had an ending planned because doing a 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, etc. would eventually get stale. And even if he's not dead, he's listed as such for now and Keanu and company are done with Wick for a while to give the series a rest, Ballerina notwithstanding.

RIP my dude Lance Reddick, genuine shock in the theater when he was killed, his line had me tearing up. Donnie Yen OFC killed that role and was my favorite side character besides Marquis de Gramont. He and Skarsgard stole every scene they were in, Cain actually kind of reminded me of Marcus (Willem Dafoe) from the first movie as an ally but also he'll get you if he's in a tight spot, Mr. Nobody also reminded me of him. Good to see Scott Adkins kick ass in a fat suit. Probably my favorite of the sequels, but it's honestly hard to choose because for the course of 9 years they've just gotten better and better.

Definitely watching again.",2023-03-25 05:11:01
Legit my favourite movie this year and an incredible way to end the John Wick saga. 9.5 out 10 sooo good I loved every minute of it. Adding Donnie Yen was perfect loved seeing him do his thing. Also if I had to pick one scene that was my favourite it would be the apartment scene in Paris. The used of the top down shot plus the incendiary shotgun rounds were amazing hard to really put it into words. So happy I saw it on opening day.,2023-03-25 05:15:23
"Okay, this dude John gotta be a Mutant or something. Taking hits like a champ. 

Also that top down sequence is the best film scene of the year, christ that’ll be hard to top.",2023-03-25 05:21:49

I never thought I needed a live action Hotline Miami scene in a John Wick movie. Movie was a 8/10 up until that point and is now a 10/10 after that scene.,2023-03-25 06:20:37
So many great scenes but my favorite was near the start when everyone including John Wick goes to Japan. The action scenes in that part of the movie were truly 10/10 especially with the use of swords. It was like watching a real life anime.,2023-03-25 06:27:56

Osaka, The Fight with Killa and his goons, The Warriors homage, the Apartment Building/Overhead shot, The stairs, the duel, etc. *Chef’s kiss!  
  
I really can’t wait to see what Chad Stahleski does next as a filmmaker. I appreciate in this film and the movies and his friend David Leitch’s movies that the fight/gunfight choreography fits the characters. I really think Donnie Yen is blind and Scott Adkins who is a physical specimen is doing wonders and wheel kicks in a fatsuit and I am bought in because Killa is wheezing and out of breath as he does it.

"I was really concerned when they announced a 4th one. Lionsgate’s clearly milking the franchise, but man, Chad Stahelski makes it consistent. Even better, Chapter 4 is the best one yet in my opinion. Literally every set piece is one of the best ever. Keanu Reeves continues to be a living legend. This is the perfect ending, although I’m sure that we’ll get another one down the road, but I’m confident if Stahelski is behind the camera",2023-03-26 04:17:52

"I feel like the movie was about 30 minutes too long. I enjoyed it, but they should have trimmed the fight scenes a little. 

Also a minor gripe for a series that started so grounded, those dragons breath rounds would have melted the barrel of that shotgun after around a dozen rounds, and at the very least the barrel should have started glowing red. Dragons breath rounds destroy the shotgun they're fired from, which is why they're generally used from disposable coach guns.",2023-03-26 04:56:24

"The one thing above all else that I want after this movie is just a movie about Caine, or at the minimum now a montage of all his fights. This is the second movie I've seen Donnie Yen play a blind fighter and both times he's the absolute standout in terms of action scenes. 

Overall a really good conclusion to the whole franchise. I think it dragged a bit here and there but the plot and the whole theme around breaking the cycle and consequences really helped it. 

Minor nitpick though, especially in the Japan sequence some of the kicks that Keanu does look really weak to incapacitate someone. There was one where he does like a stomp kick to someone on the ground and for some reason it felt really weak and didn't sound like it warranted the crunching sound it made. Maybe it's just me. Aside from Japan though the rest of the action scenes were excellent, especially the apartment scene, felt like I was playing an old-school shooter.",2023-03-26 13:39:15

"This franchise is just SO BEAUTIFUL I can’t get over it. The lighting, atmosphere, camera work, music score. I’m obsessed.

Beautifully choreographed! & I don’t think for a second that my man John is dead.",2023-03-26 14:58:18

"Surprised that this wasn't advertised as the end of John Wick's story. A nice surprise to be sure but they set it up pretty hard throughout the movie that this was the end.

That said, the long run time was really felt but understandable. Great cinematography particularly the Hotline Miami shootout towards the end. I also liked the new characters and I hope they do something with Caine and Akira as they teased. I'd also love to see Mr. Nobody again, he was cool (I'd also like to see Sofia again, but I guess the producers don't care about her as much so I look forward to not seeing Mr. Nobody again :( ). Sad that this was one of Lance Reddick's last movies; I loved him and his roles throughout the years.

My audience did laugh when John fell out the window and tumbled down the stairs. Does he have a steel spine or something?",2023-03-26 18:28:26

Went in expecting phenomenal action and a kick ass soundtrack and got both of those. However I did not expect the film to look as good it did. The visuals and the colours were top tier and so was the editing. For a nearly 3 hour film I didn't feel the length at all. It's just really well done from top to bottom.,2023-03-26 19:34:29

The song from John wick 1 with the top down shots were fantastic,2023-03-26 21:20:15
"That actress playing the Radio DJ during the Paris scenes….damn she got a soothing voice! I would’ve watched a whole sequence of just her giving exposition. Such a very small role in a movie filled with much bigger scenes but her sequences left an impact because I just loved her voice! 

The Dragons Breath….damn. Just DAMN. When I found out that those rounds actually exist…that terrifies me lol. 

My theater had some guy who actually said “For fucks sake get on with it” during the stair sequence. Which I agree, it just went on too long. We didn’t NEED to see him fall down every flight….just cut back to Winston, the Marquis and everyone waiting to show their reaction then cut to him at the bottom. 

That end credits scene had me and my friend actually shout “NO…” when it ended. RIP Caine, you kinda had it coming.",2023-03-26 22:23:39
"Genuinely one of the best times I’ve ever had in a movie theater. Saw it by myself at a 1pm Sunday matinee with a half full theater. It was so fun experiencing the room gradually warm up and get super into it, to the point that we were cheering and full on cracking up (in the best way) at everything from the stairwell fight until the end of the duel.",2023-03-26 22:48:22
I got huge mortal kombat vibes from a few fight scenes. Mainly because of what was going on around the fight,2023-03-27 01:35:43
"So I watched all 3 in 36 hours to prep for this. I came away a bit irked. I liked the movie, but considering in 3 we had Sofia burned by The Table, Winston and Charon burned by The Table, and Bowry King burned by The Table it REALLY seemed like we were gearing up for a complete dismantling of the syndicate. I think the lofty hopes and disappointment are my own cross to bear, but what I think is unforgiveable is shoehorning AMAZING characters like Caine and Shimazu, and to a lesser extent Harbinger and Tracker into this movie and saying ""Yeah we've always been here, we're only just now relevant"".

It made Shimazu's death feel hollow (and a complete waste of Hiroyukis talent and screen presence). It made Caine feel like convenient plot device, and Tracker just tacked on. It makes the whole plot of the movie feel like maybe they didn't know where it was going prior.

&#x200B;

I also really wanted the Adjudicator to die, but she just disappeared after 3 as well. 

&#x200B;

I loved the action, that's always on point, but the ""suit jackets stop bullets AND inertia of small and large arm fire, but fully armored Table Operatives get completely dazed and confused by a shot to the chest"" is so shark-jumpy to me, along with John getting hit by no less than SEVEN CARS and walking it all off. EVEN A DOG. I like feel good movies, but good lord, commit to killing a good guy somewhere...and not in some shitty way like they killed off Charon.

&#x200B;

Overall, like 6.5. I enjoyed the hell out of it but man I think they missed a lot of great opportunities with what they already had, and showed more of what they could have done if they had planned a bit better.

&#x200B;

Side note, how does a man who can't walk across a NYC street without getting shot at, and 15+ million dollar bounty have no issue going from the Middle East, to NYC, to Japan, to NYC, and then to France...?",2023-03-27 01:44:54
"This was a double expresso injected to my veins! I’ve only seen the third movie but it was enough for me to grasp the main plot so worry not if you’re not familiar with the franchise.

I enjoyed how this felt like a videogame and moving forward to the next final boss per stage (Osaka, Berlin, Paris). The fights are amazing and imaginative but at the same time some of them felt like a choreography.

All the characters and engaging and interesting to explore but that also makes John appear kinda plain? I don’t know but he felt like doing the same as always and had just a few lines to say.",2023-03-27 02:10:26
"I loved the references/nods toward classics like Lawrence of Arabia (blowing out the match and cutting to a desert) and Zatoichi (Caine).  Are there any others that I missed?

PS please please \*please\* make sure you see this movie in an imax.  I knew when John was punching the block of wood – with the shockwave reverberating underneath my seat – that this movie was going to be special.",2023-03-27 02:12:08
"The fighting sequences were great and I loved the ideas used, the poker table/night club, arc de triomphe, top down apartment fight, and last duel. But tbh I kinda felt nothing by the time 3hrs rolled by. Was entertaining to watch to a degree but not anything I can take away. I honestly enjoyed something like Bullet Train more, despite that purposely meant to be a comedy opposed to John Wick. But the mindless violence was more entertaining in that one",2023-03-27 02:35:47
"I fucking loved this movie. I mentioned to my gf that they definitely had to handicap Yen and Adkins in order to give John a chance lol

My favorite scenes:
The apartment(felt like I was watching a brutal run of metal gear solid lol)

The staircase was awesome, but hilariously reminded me of kung pow.

The highway scene was intense. When that guy gets hit by the car and on the way down, John just unloads bullets at him was so cool. 

John couldn't ever have any nice cars. 

Mr nobody flip flopped so much, his name should have been flip flops lol
This all started because somebody killed John's dog, so it's only right that John saved one in the end.

I really wanted John to retire in peace. He did so much just to right almost everything for everyone else and I don't think I can accept that. My headcanon is that he faked his death. 

I'm ready for the Caine spinoff.",2023-03-27 03:51:26
"Just got back. Loved it. 

It didn't seem as long as it was except I had to pee, but I took a good break with the Bowery King and Winston with the boat under Paris.

The action is so absurd I laughed because it was so exciting.

Only knock is it seems they added a couple characters to build spin offs.  That's fine but I don't know if I'll be as excited. 

Side note, finally used the new MoviePass.  I'm excited to see some movies again.",2023-03-27 04:41:13
"Finally a film that answers the question, would you let someone kill you’re dog for $40 million",2023-03-27 05:54:46
"When Killa knocks John off the 2nd floor and he gets up and the camera starts panning around during the rave, i kept expecting it to pan up and Killas jumps off the second floor towards John to do a frog splash. 

Would have made this the greatest movie ever made if that happened",2023-03-27 08:50:15
"The John Wick World Tour was excellent. Jordan, NY, Osaka, Berlin and Paris. Introducing Rina as Akira just builds more of the world building.
Natalia Tena as the new head of John Wick’s original Belarus house was a good cameo. 
John Wick’s One night in Paris completely destroyed the Parisian Henchmen economy. I wanna see the Kill-count people crunch the numbers on this film. 
The Gods eye scene with the shotguns and the Stairs scene are both technical masterpieces that they’ll still be talking about them a year from now. John taking off his jacket and vest for the duel and hearing all the bullet rounds falling off his shoulders onto the ground. The symbolism of the morning sun over Paris with the clouds making it seem the whole city was under a High Table.
Clancy Brown was right, with the death of the Marquis. He is no longer John Wick but Patron Saint Wick. 
10/10.",2023-03-27 09:50:26
Question - what was the point of the odd focus in the post-credit scene?   Really stood out in contrast to the main movie,2023-03-27 13:23:08
Hotline Miami,2023-03-27 13:34:19
"What's great about these movies is that just about every criticism/meme about them is objectively correct, but it's so awesome that no one cares.

Like mine: I think they overdid the bulletproof suit thing. They introduce the concept in the first movie, but it's still treated as a realistic material where you get hurt if you get shot. In 4, they were all using these suits like magic capes that they could just hold up in front of their face and be good, as if a real bullet wouldn't simply brush the material out of the way.

But still, it's awesome, so who cares.",2023-03-27 14:27:10
"Three days later I'm still thinking about this movie. There will of course be a lot of imitators (like we don't have those already after the first John Wick release), but one take away I hope other movies will take note is the framing of its action and the camera work. Wider angle shots where you can see the choreography and longer takes - they're nothing new, but I hope it continue to popularize that long takes with stable camera work is superior to that bullshit of rapid cuts and extreme close ups.",2023-03-27 15:40:53
"I like that after 4 entire movies, there's still no real answer as to what this hitman society actually *is*. We're shown various elements of it - the Continental, the High Table, the Marquis, etc. But as far as I'm aware we have no idea what it's actual function is, or what all these hitmen do when they're not hunting John Wick. We aren't shown any substantial connections to the outside world, beyond some shadowy relations with underground organized crime. It's like the wizarding world in the Harry Potter series - separate and parallel to everything else.

And I think that's great. It's mysterious. It lets our minds wander. A lesser movie writer would have tried to ground it in reality.",2023-03-27 15:45:57
I just love how they utilized the new cast members. Everyone got their chance to shine and had their own unique fighting style.,2023-03-27 15:54:11
"Some thoughts:

&#x200B;

\- Japan was by far my favourite place in the entire John Wick franchise. I love Hiroyuki Sanada and he didn't disappoint. Sad to see that he dies but he didn't fight on even grounds considering he was already wounded. He also seems to be the most loyal friend to John Wick as he houses him with nothing but downside. I don't really understand why he fought Caine though considering he would have let both of them walk.

\- Caine being called Caine because he has a Cane but also kills his brother John is in typical John Wick fashion both genius and utterly dumb.

\- Overall I felt like this movie had too many enemies. 'Nobody' imo served zero purpose in this movie, neither did Marquis' left hand because we already had Caine. Imo they should have left both of them out. 

\- Caine being blind was a bit too much for me, particularly because his hearing capabilities were incredibly inconsistent. His fighting style was cool though.

\- The doll-house shooting scene in Paris were amazing. 

&#x200B;

Summary:

8/10 a great ending to the John wick saga should it really end there. Could have been 10/10 but felt a bit too crammed for me, I wish they would have focused more on the main plot and cut out 1-2 of the action scenes (particularly John killing half of Paris felt rather redundant.

&#x200B;

Fun tidbits:

\- the Belarus priest is Andrej Kaminsky / a Finish actor who mainly starred in German tv production, but recently I see him all over the web as 'Grim Hustle'

\- The guy who only says 'I am Karl' is Sven Marquardt, famous bouncer at the infamous Berlin club Berghain (where the fight is).",2023-03-27 16:11:03

I cannot believe how hard Donnie Yen flexed the YSL boots,2023-03-27 19:25:48
"This is the first John Wick movie I do *not* consider better than the last one. Donnie Yen was great, the fight scenes in Paris looked amazing, and the choreography remains excellent, but none of it felt as impactful or interesting as 2 or 3.

I know that plot isn't the first reason people come to these movies, but the setup for the movie felt both unearned and meandering. As circuitous as the stories to 2 and 3 were, they at least felt like forward progress was always being made. The ending of 3 and the opening of 4 seemed to set up a new type of soft reset of the plotline, where now John's revenge would be on the High Table itself. But then everything with the Marquis feels like a villain of the week distraction instead, down to killing off a named character to show how powerful the audience is meant to believe he is. Mr. Nobody also seemed to serve no real purpose other than adding in a side antagonist with a dog. The ending especially felt completely unearned as well, resetting the status quo in a way that doesn't feel permanent if another sequel is greenlit.

In terms of action scenes, there are several memorable scenes, but not as varied as the scenes in 3. The scenes with the stairs and the dragon's breath were cool, and *all* of them continue to be well shot and choreographed, but they all felt like action scenes standard for the series, with variations only in a key weapon and the setting. None of them had the sheer variety of 3, where John fights and kills a giant man with a book, builds a revolver, uses a man as a knife holder, and weaponizes a horse, all in the first 15 minutes. The finale in 3 felt like an actual challenge rather than just feeling like an overly long obstacle.

I don't want this to be the last John Wick movie, if only so we can see the realization of the plot that I thought this movie would provide. John tearing down the system that led to this domino effect of death and destruction for the sake of preserving power and order would be a perfect arc for his character. But while this is a very entertaining chapter, judging it against its previous films, it's a middling chapter to me.",2023-03-27 21:16:05
"Randomly... i absolutely love how they lift their jackets to guard the head lol

And i too got a very strong video game energy from this. Also did the Marquis henchmen have upgraded suits cos wow lol.

i loved this though. but i feel perhaps it could have been edited down a bit.",2023-03-27 22:05:30
"I saw this movie today. I watched the first John Wick a few years ago and about half of part 2. I didn't finish part 2 because I honestly was exhausted and bored by it.  First the positives - the action choreography and staging is incredible, the cinematography and music are great and overall the movie has a ton of unique energy. The negatives - it was way too long and as great as the action is the sequences just felt like they dragged on unnecessarily long. I was into the first part of each sequence but it just felt like they ran on and on without any need to. There's only so many times I can see John Wick shoot someone in the head. When he got knocked down the stairs for the 2nd or 3rd time I almost screamed in exasperation because of how long the sequence had gone on for. I understand the action set pieces are the main selling point of the movie and totally understand why so many people love them so maybe these movies just aren't for me. Again I greatly admire the technical aspects of the movie and there were many moments where I was on the edge of my seat but there was a certain point where I had had enough.",2023-03-27 22:41:14

"I have a question about the duel.  Given that Caine was such an efficient killer and that he and Wick exchange some sayings before the last draw, ""Those who cling most to life...""

&#x200B;

Before the last draw, I read that exchange as they had a common understanding that they would cooperate on something.... of what, I didn't know at the time.  (As in more obvious lines:  Wick: ""You thinking what I'm thinking?""  Caine: ""Yeah""...)

It seemed clear to me at such close range someone would surely die, if not both of them, since both are such skilled shooters.

&#x200B;

Did Caine intentionally not kill Wick?  Did Wick know it too?  For Caine is certainly capable of shooting his opponents dead while not in an ideal stance and while the opponent is in motion.

&#x200B;

(By the way, I just came out of the theater.  I thought the movie was amazing.  I'm sad the series is over, but happy that Wick was finally released from the High Table.)",2023-03-28 05:08:17
"I'll be real... I think the ending was absolutely perfect & I think if they want to continue with the franchise it should be in the form of spin-offs. We've already seen so many unique and interesting characters with goals and motivations left unsatisfied with so many opportunities to explore the already established worldbuilding... If they >!bring John Wick back!< it would just cheapen the natural conclusion and suffer from the same fatigue that Dragon Ball has.

The film is long. I'd definitely cut out the desert and Berlin parts. JW2 is my favorite overall, but this one was beautiful. The Paris apartment was done so smoothly. JW3's opening action might be my favorite though.

JW3's ending gave me the impression this sequel would be about John going after the High Table. If they planned the back-to-back 4th and 5th films, I wonder if something changed where they had to change the plot and end it here at #4.",2023-03-28 14:40:00

Also on a side note I swear Cane shot John exactly where the doctor John shot in chapter 3 so I feel he is alive the dog gave it away and Winston was a bit cryptic in the end also he did mention earlier on in the film “Loving husband” on his gravestone 

Also not sure if everyone knows they mentioned they’ll be doing a spin off set after John Wick chapter 4 in the next few months I have a sneaky feeling there’s going to be consequences for Akira, Cane & The Tracker for helping John the high table surely must have kept a close eye on all of this I feel all three of them will be hunted down I also feel the high table won’t be happy about what happened and the deal the Marquis accepted in chapter 4 perhaps at the end of this movie if I’m right when they all about to be killed light cut out and you can hear screaming and bullets going off and through the darkness The Babayaga reappears ready to take down the high table we’ve yet to see these fuckers",2023-03-29 04:04:05

"I watched all 3 before I watched 4.  I had moments where I was enjoying the symbolism of the movie and the dialogue sometimes just as much as the action. Such a great movie.

Rip lance. After your death the scenes referring to you had much more levity to me.

Part of me wishes they reigned in some things for a bit more (a touch more) realism.  It's really my only criticism.  

It's funny to think how grounded and really emotional that first John wick was.  I had forgotten the puppy had dragged itself over to rest near him.  That really hits home for me with my first about to cross the rainbow bridge and my new pup being a bit older than the one in the movie.

The 4th is really the best with the emotional ties of the other characters more.  The daughter of Caine and wanting to just be retired... Akira's loss of her father, the death of Charon.

I don't think there should be a 5th, but definitely a spin off.  If I were brainstorming ideas I feel that going back to their roots where someone drunk and arrogant on their own power fucks with the wrong person.   That's essentially been the formula for just about every single one.  Just tighten the scope for an introduction and fully broaden it with new stories and motives but with other characters.


P.s. I have seen a dog get nailed by a car hard enough to shatter it's headlights and put a massive dent in the bumper only for the pup to shake it off and run back home (shitty owner)",2023-03-30 04:06:13

"I loved the movie, and I agree with what most people are saying. I didn't think there was anything wrong with Keanu's performance or speech. I do think it's strange no one is talking about the blind guy. Cain was great, the actor was outstanding but why make him blind?  Really? Blind!  Yes, it made for some cool scenes. The fight in the kitchen where Cain puts down sensors to chime and find the bad guys. How does he fight everywhere else? Guns going off constantly, yelling, screaming! How can Cain fight when there is overwhelming sound? Just the one little flaw in an entertaining
 movie.",2023-03-30 13:50:11

4 just felt fine. Better than 3 but not in league with 1 or 2. The story is muddled and mr nobody felt like a late addition to the already bloated script.

"Is it just me, or is the radio station in this film an almost exact replica of the radio station from the old film Warriors?

I liked that. Only thing I wasn't too keen on was Mr Nobody, I never understood his motivations, he has this book with all this information, he has values that he is scoring off with $45m as the goal and he won't take less for some obscure reason.",2023-04-01 16:14:11
"That entire like fucking 45 minute race through Paris was spectacular, and is one of the best things i've ever seen in an action movie in my life. At first i though it was stupid that the Bowry King only got John Wick like 200m down the road or that they were going to play off Sacre-Coeur as being close to Eiffel Tower but no it was clearly just something they needed to to have one of the best action sequences I've ever seen in my life.

Starts off simple with just a fight but then the fight in the middle of the arc de triomphe roundabout was insane and the overhead one shot in the dilapidated house was spectacular and then everything about the staircase segment was phenomenal. How this series keeps manages to just put random characters in random places with random weapons and then just making the coolest thing ever with it is something i greatly admire",2023-04-02 00:17:49

"As soon as I saw the length of the movie I had a bad feeling and I was right. After John Wick 3, which I felt was the best installment, they just didn't do enough to differentiate between it and even between different sequences within itself. Too long, too up its own ass, not enough blood/realistic aftermath of the violence. He was shooting heads at close range and barely any blood was sprayed making it feel amost like a PG-13 movie. None of it felt like it had any impact despite being well choreographed. JW3 had a lot of great locales which really made one area feel different from another. In this movie there is barely any visual differences from the Japanese, German, and French locales/sets. Every location is night time with neon lights and panes of glass for people to get thrown through.  It just wasn't inventive enough to justify its own existence and too long to be as fun a ride as the others or even a satisfying conclusion.

Having said that it was very pretty and the sound design was fantastic.",2023-04-03 00:07:48
"Going into the film, I was hoping the series would conclude with John being a free-man and getting a call from Aurelio saying his car is finally fixed up. John then proceeds to drive off into the sunset, playing on the Westerns influence throughout the series, although that would have been pretty cheesy.

Still very pleased with the movies conclusion! Such an amazing installment! I don't entirely buy that John is dead though, but I don't know if there's any reason to keep him around for another installment without it ruining the point of the last films.",2023-04-03 02:44:23

"I'll preface this by saying I absolutely loved this movie and think it *is* the best John Wick has ever been.  


Now, while watching the movie I felt that at times some of the firearm details were seemingly lacking. Of course catching a slide kick is hard to do in the midst of an action sequence with so many guns going off at once. Then I felt like the pistols had a lot more ammunition than they should on the 300 steps sequence. I've since gone back through footage in single frames (trailers etc) and sadly it does look like certain scenes have taken shortcuts on the more grounded aspects and details that made the original film so great.",2023-04-03 04:21:23
The only snag in this movie for me was the nunchuck scene. Just felt like it dragged on for far too long. Nunchuck scenes have got to be done in a very specific way because they always have to display dynamism or it doesn't feel compelling. What i rather would have done is if he had used different kinds of Japanese weapons like spears or 3 section staff instead,2023-04-03 22:56:52

It's full-on night on the Sacre-Coeur stairs, and then boom we see the sun rise, but it's still super-dark in half the sky. That's not how sunrise works at all! Even under cloudy conditions, first the sky gets lighter (nautical twilight), then ambient light gets stronger until just before sunrise so lights aren't needed any more (civil twilight - would start \~5:30am in Paris if the sun's rising around 6:05). Not only did it wreck the scene for me, but also the gradual increase of light would add to the suspense and characters wouldn't have to be consulting their watches!!! What were the filmmakers thinking? Has nobody involved ever seen a sunrise?",2023-04-05 17:22:33

"I've predominantly enjoyed all the JW movies, but 3 and 4 definitely seemed to feel more like self-aware musicals to me, just replacing the musical numbers with action scenes. That being said, aside from Winston once referencing that he shot John off the roof of the hotel and John having ""punched his family ticket,"" you could almost go from JW2 to JW4 without missing anything plot-relevant, and the resolution in 4 didn't seem to fit John's initial goals. He doesn't need to ride off into the sunset, but we went from ""kill them all"" to seemingly settling for ensuring a friend could free his daughter.

Just wished the series had biased a little more towards retaining a tighter story than awesome choreography & action (which it certainly did well nonetheless) among seemingly endless new characters. ""Nobody"" could have been a disgraced Cassius, for example, and in the end John hasn't seemed to have changed anything in regards to the Table",2023-04-12 03:34:39
I loved it and I also don't think John is gone. I think he's back for 1 more film. There was a somewhat throwaway line about if John won the duel he would be seen as a saint and the balance of power of the High table would change. With John winning and likely achieving that Sainthood It sets us up for his rebirth and return to finally finish reshaping originally totally unintentionally the order of the high table.,2023-04-12 22:13:48
"Not sure if it was the theater or not but to me the gun shots were just way too loud. Just overtook so much of the sound and there was a disappointing lack of surround sound, maybe because the gun shots drowned them out(?). I feel old saying this but man I wish it would have just been a tad softer.

Only other complaint is John's dialogue was awful. And this movie seemed to invalidate and replicate so much of the third movie that number 3 feels kinda pointless now.

Other than that it was an amazing watch. Amazing fight scenes, beautifully shot. I think if the sound was more to my liking I would have had a much better experience. And easily the best JW sequel films.",2023-04-12 23:40:40

The first one is grounded, realistic and can be considered the best in the series, while the rest up the action and the overall scale but just lack the heart. Movie kinda felt like a video game and went too ridiculous - crazy physics, blind man being able to gun down dozens of people and so on. The action scenes of course were 10/10 but there were so many of them that a lot of them just get lost and feel pointless as you know random thug #531 won't be the one to get John Wick.",2023-04-23 20:46:11
"Just saw it, was a little disappointed.  I mean the pure quality is miles ahead of Marvel / most other live action franchise.   It’s a spectacularly crafted film like the three before it.

But it’s so full of fluff.   The world building detracted from the pacing.  I felt a lot more tense watching JW 1-3",2023-04-25 17:53:17
"John wick 4 was really disappointing. I had 2 major complaint

1. It Lost its realism. My major enjoyment of this franchise was the detail in the fight scenes from actual martial arts to accurate bullet counts. But having soft body armor spark and the actors show no pain from being shot in soft body armor is a huge downgrade from the previous installments. Also John wick became immune to blunt force trauma when? 

The introduction of a blind assassin is amazing but he needed to be a one off. You can’t have someone use Daredevil powers to dodge bullets then the next scene show him struggling to find an envelope. Between him and the Big mafia boss guy having super strength it’s like a bad anime power scaling. 

2. The plot seemed forced. The foreshadowed plot had John taking out the high table as another impossible task but instead he killed 2 replaceable characters and was still under the high table the entire movie. The Plot thread of his Japanese friend dying was never wrapped up and his “sacrifice” at the end didn’t feel satisfying. 

Overall the movie just didn’t live up to expectations. It suffered from the same fate as the Fast and the Furious franchise. John Wick 5 would feature him fighting his way out of Hell to get to his wife in heaven. Because that’s the next logical step in power gain",2023-05-02 14:58:46
"My favorite moment is when the Marquis’ bodyguard tells Donnie/Caine to “get to work,” after seeing him slurping on some noodles in the kitchen fight scene. 

He sources a gun from a dead goon and I’m like.. what’s a blind man going to do with a gun? 

And then he shoots the ceiling like 4 times and I’m now I’m thinking “Is.. is he using echolocation?”",2023-05-06 02:45:59

3rd one was better, still had some cool moments. That overhead scene I  tbe building was cool. Rewatched the first 3 before this but doubt I'll watch this again. 

Iv never seem many pistol shots in a movie I started getting sick of hearing them go off constantly tbh.

I was excited for Donnie yen but the blind part was kinda dumb. Like he shoots and fights ppl easy then it's like he remembers he's blind then can't see anything right in front or can't pick up something.

The amount of damage ppl taken was really a bit to much, it was like they can only do 10 % damage to each other .I don't really expect realism in action movies but cmon lol. 

Idk if it's because I seen fast x day before but when he kept rolling down the stairs and just jeep going it reminded me of that bomb ball for some reason that just kept on going . Him rolling down the stairs  became comical after awhile snd was a shooting star me lol",2023-05-21 16:12:09

"John wick vs Batman, the bets are now ope.. Nevermind",2023-05-25 01:41:03
"Honestly, it was... far away from previous one. Biggest problem is stunts. The only scene that actually looks good is a top-down one, because there they can't ignore enemies, and everyone moves. In normal scenes bad guys often just do nothing until their turn to die comes. Also while in other parts Wick overpowered enemies by strategic movement and percise shots, here it was 90% bulletproof suit and 10% enemies who can't shoot at the head or hands, use sniper rifles, explosives, or whatever. And the Caine were worst part of it, because literally all it takes to defeat him - is to stay silent and shoot in the head, since he approaches openly with no way to find out if enemies are there. Also it seems like law enforcement do not exist in that universe, since after massive firefights all over the big town not a single police officer shows up. But most likely it's because everything happens within a video game - and a club scene, where npc's completly ignore fighting and shooting and keep dancing until the very end of the scene are a proof of that.",2023-05-25 15:08:41
"Back here over two months later, having finally watched.

Great action as always BUT I couldn’t help of thinking, while watching him fall down all those steps, of Kung Pow! And, to a lesser extent, Hot Rod. So stupidly hilarious.",2023-05-25 20:50:33
"It wasn't a bad movie, really. But it lacked...pretty much everything compared to the other 3.

\-CGI was a bit weird/off/bad here and there.

\-Fight choreography wasn't as good and they used more jump cuts and the like.

\-The plot was non-existent, which is far worse than especially the original.

\-The fight scenes dragged on too long, and they took up like what 75% of the movie?

\-Another macguffin had to be pulled out of their asses in order for Wick to have another chance at a way out. And for that macguffin another macguffin had to be used as well. (The duel rules, and for that the needed family that he had to get back in to)

\-Thumping techno music was blasting over most fight scenes, which was more distracting than helpful most of the time.

\-The Japan scenes were basically pointless as even the daughter of the manager, which I thought would lead to some plot or something, was left hanging.

&#x200B;

And some specific stuff:

\-The gun that shoots flames was...flashy I guess, but kinda stupid considering what kind of action film the series has been so far.

\-The Frenchman was stereotypical and highly predictable. A typical ""overconfident loose cannon going after the main character, gets more desperate as things progress, and in the end tries to cheat his way out as he becomes nervous of the MC"" kind of antagonist. Seen it too many times before already.

\-The overhead scene in the building, which apparently people praise, was out of place and too gamey in my book.

\-The bowery king was relegated to just being a supply npc, pretty much. Same could be said for Winston. Relegated to someone on the sidelines.

\-Keanu's ""acting"" was even more dead-pan than in the previous movies, which weirdly impressive to me as I didn't think that was possible. But not a good thing.

\-The rolling down the stairs scene was also...pretty out of place imo. Like I was suddenly watching a 90's cartoon.

\-What was even the point of Mr. Nobody? All he was was a ""named mob"", to use a video game term, among the masses of mooks. A bit more importance and focus than regular mooks, but didn't really add anything to the movie. Also Wick saving his dog and suddenly he doesn't care about the money/consequences anymore was pretty predictable.

\-What the hell was with that female radio announcer in...I think France? The first announcement was good, but the ""updates"" after that just made it comical. In a bad way. Half the messages didn't even sound like realistic coded messages. Just thinly veiled status updates, but said with a ""sexy female voice"". 

\-And of course they leave Wick's end scene just ambiguous enough to either leave him dead, or bring him back for a JW5. Which will undoubtedly be more of a decline compared to 4...

&#x200B;

Overall this movie was okay. Not a bad watch, but not something I'd want see in theatre. More something I'd put on while playing a game. Everything gave me a feeling of complacency. Like the director knew that at this point he could just go through the motions and it'd make bank no matter what. And judging by 90%+ of the reviews I've seen he wasn't wrong.",2023-05-25 22:17:41
"we are taking a pee break at home lol didnt realize this is 3 hr. so far: didnt they already done a fight in a glass house with light box? it was samurai themed too i believe. there's some obvious shot of the daughter concierge done by a double because she's too slim and the stunt double had more waist, lol",2023-05-26 04:19:32
"Dumbest part was getting the blind man to gun fight a perfect shooter at 30 paces, a fight that you really need to win.

I was originally thinking there wasn't anything as amazing as the knife fight in John Wick 3, but then I got to thinking how much coordination the cars would take for that scene and appreciated it more. There was also a one shot (?) from bird's eye perspective that was great

Loved the guy in the fat suit doing karate kicks

The fight choreography is great as always, it's just that Keanu doesn't look believable when he's fighting hand to hand. Lots of awkward scenes where the enemies are just waiting to get punched. He really looked like he was no match for Chidi or even Killa. I'm really happy that he can finally rest now.

Also, is no else pissed that Winston got away scott free? He was doomed at the 3rd movie until John helped him in an almost unwinnable fight, but then he betrayed him instantly the first chance he got. And now he got everything back. He should've just been a straight up villain. Charon was the better man and he deserved to live.

Lastly, quite disappointed that the Bowery King was barely there. The 3rd movie ended with John and him teaming up and swearing against the High Table. But he only shows up to provide two suits, a gun, and a boat ride. 

I'm glad that atleast Koji was there to show someone with power who was actually on John's side even through the actual battles. The Osaka scenes were my favorite for being gorgeous and full of carnage for all factions.",2023-06-25 18:23:20
The only thing I can't stand about these movies is how ok all the public is with bullets being fired around them and blood splat all around them and have no worry whatsoever about a stray bullet. They'll see 4 dead bodies beside them then keep dancing or keep driving by a area where they just watched like 20 people get lit up. It's so dumb it half ruins the movies for me. Otherwise awesome combat,2023-07-04 13:50:52
Why was the duel only applicable with Marquis? Why did not John Wick duel with anyone from the High Table at the very first so he could get out?,2023-07-23 16:21:15
"Worst JW of the franchise. Firstly, those stupid bullet proof suits are dumb and ruin the action. 
Second: see, something people in a young country like the US don't often understand because most street corners look like the next, is that you gotta be vaguely believable with where you shoot scenes in Paris. The sequence is all over the shop. Porte des lilas is at the edge of Paris, at 2 o'clock. They go grab a boat in a tunnel that's at 1 o'clock, half way into the radius of Paris, but more importantly, from Porte des Lilas, halfway to the fucking Sacré Coeur. They then somehow cruise to pont d'Iena ""closest he can be dropped"", which is farther in the opposite direction than both the previous locations where they were. They then make John cross the Seine river to the opposite bank to where Sacré Coeur in the opposite direction on rue de l'Université, then the fight is shot near , to then drive to the Arc de Triomphe, 90 degree off he should be going from the fight to Sacre Coeur...add to that the american muscle cars that have no reason to be there, and the 2 cars that ram and tilt JW's car on the Place de l'Etoile round about and come of absolutely undamaged (not even a broken light), and the shit ass fake french accent of skarsgard, and a million visible details, and you have the worst realised JW ...",2023-07-31 07:11:17

"Possibly the best John Wick of them all. (Until a sequel appears).

Fantastic action sequences from the get-go with a fantastic grade A cast (RIP Lance Reddick) that elevate every scene and every moment.

Great visuals and cinematography that show you gorgeous places like Morocco (but they filmed in Jordan), Osaka Japan, Paris France, and Berlin Germany.

Intense and high paced with barely any room to breathe, John Wick 4 has murder and mayhem with: Pistols, Revolvers, Shotguns, Knives, Axes, Pencils, Horses, Cars, Motorcycles, Dogs, Playing Cards, Hand to Hand Combat, Bow and Arrows, Samurai Swords, Throwing Stars, Nunchucks, and the list goes on.

Keanu Reeves while providing a masterclass in physical acting, action sequences, and stuntwork does stumble along (but has his moments) in dialogue.

The heavy stand-out in this movie would be Donnie Yen as the blind master hitman Caine. Truly impressive fight sequences, touching emotional and funny moments as well. Audiences will have a fun time with Caine.

Rina Sawayama did a fantastic job as Akira. Held her own and then some, has a good presence and does not show at all that it is her first big time role in film. Greatly adds to any scenes she is in.

The rest of the cast (Bill Skarsgard, Fishburne, Sanada, Shamier Anderson, Ian Mcshane, Clancy Brown, Scott Adkins) are all just terrific professionals and once again just provide John Wick Chapter 4 with the legitimacy and gravitas to be as good a movie as it is.

Very excited to see what comes next.

TLDR, 9.5/10 easily could be 10/10 FANTASTIC ACTION MOVIE DOESNT SLOW DOWN DOESNT FEEL LONG AT ALL. GO WATCH IT IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A GOOD TIME.",2023-03-25 08:26:45

"Saw it in IMAX today. 

Goddamn people. 

What a fucking ride. I'm going to see it tomorrow night in Dolby. 

Donnie Yen KILLS it. Love his character. Just enough personality that he's not some soulless assassin, but not annoyingly so. 

I want an origin story of Nobody. And his dog. 

Apartment with the dragons breath was so goddamn fun, and the fact that the action set pieces were so well timed. 

Also, there's no way he's ACTUALLY dead. Lots of posters have mentioned his dog looking off screen during the burial plot scene. He's still alive. 

Well done, very well done.",2023-03-24 21:44:38
"There's so many loopholes here it's borderline impossible he's dead. 

- Like you said, we didn't see him die. We saw him slump over after the hardest 24 hours of his life and only bearing wounds that this series has canonically demonstrated aren't lethal.

- The last philosophical discourse between him and Caine, his friend who equally hates the Marquis and who might even have been in on Wick's gambit, lays the foundation for this; ""Those who embrace life find death, those who find death receive life."".

- There are only two kinds of graves with grass on them; old ones, and ones that were never dug.

- The post credit scene shows Akira has unfinished business. She's coming for those she feels are responsible for her father's death, and while Caine may have been the instrument, it's ultimately John Wick who killed her father. This is even more intriguing when you consider that Ballerina is going to take place between 3 and 4, so it's not like that will be resolved there. Ballerina isn't going to so much be a spin off as it is a rebuilding of the world's mythos.

- Edit, afterthought: Canonically, every time John says someone will die in this series, he kills them. He said he would kill ALL of the high table. This did not happen in this movie. This series in not yet done.

- Extra Edit: Not my observation, but as others have mentioned, John's dog perks up strangely at the end. Winston and the King's conversation is also oddly ambiguous and lacking in any finality. The next time we see John Wick, and I believe we will, he may be walking out of the cemetery from the tree line after noticing his dog notices him. 

John Wick is NOT dead. He received life by embracing death and is loving peacefully. ... Until one of two things happens. Possibility one: Akira slays Caine, and maybe even goes after Winston for being a part of all this, pulling Wick out of hiding. Or she goes after him and, in the process, outs his current hiding spot to the many many enemies he made in service to the table.  They then show up to try and collect the 40 million dollar reward that ostensibly is still in play as it remains in escrow despite the Marquis's death. And after all, the table will have a new member before his body is even cold. Perhaps they, too, will prefer not to have a loose end like John Wick running around.",2023-03-25 00:31:04

"I need some help. I just saw the movie and I didn’t like it. I thought it was way too long, the fights were way too long and over-the-top, John had insane plot armor (even in comparison to the other movies), and the story felt really shallow. It just felt like everything that worked in the other films didn’t in this one. But everyone I see says it’s amazing. Why is there this discrepancy? What am I missing here? And do other people think this, or am I alone?",2023-03-27 03:51:36
"doesn't it feel like this movie entirely undermines what felt like the drive of the last 3? john was a man fighting against an unjust system, but in this one he's just playing by the rules. even his death is meaningless by the internal logic the film sets out - the marquee will simply be replaced and the system will continue. so what was the whole point? more samurai swords?",2023-03-27 10:45:46

"I really enjoyed the film overall, but I have a lot of issues with it from a story and structure perspective.

Overall, it reminded me of No Time to Die, in that it was a very handsomely photographed, high concept, high budget entry in the franchise, which was also far too long and without nearly enough 'meat' on its bones to justify the runtime.

I long for the simplicity of the first John Wick and its commitment to lean, back to basics action filmmaking.",2023-03-24 02:59:34
"Finally got to see JW and it was spectacular! My favorite parts were definitely the fight at the Osaka Continental and JW using the flamethrower gun. Tbh I think the Osaka one is miles better than New York.

"Couple quick notes

- Bill Skarsgard was a perfect villain
- Style and choreography was turned up to 11 and I loved every minute
- Loved how they really used the bullet proof clothing to proper effect
- The only action sequence I had issue with was the Arc de Triomphe, my suspension of disbelief couldn't handle the idea that it wouldn't be an immediate traffic cluster fuck 
- Forgive me, Shamier, for thinking that you were John David Washington the entire time
- Soundtrack was perfect
- The ending, to me at least, was pretty clear cut. But reading up on it it sounds like it was intended to be more open ended? Or was that just pre-release fud?",2023-03-24 13:03:55
"So the Paris scene is like definitively one of the best action scenes in a film right? Like I’ve seen raid 2 comparisons but raid 2 couldn’t evade the length problem. But JW4 has just enough variety and careful pacing to make the concept work.

"It's funny that the least interesting thing about the John Wick films is John Wick. There are no stakes for him and he really doesn't have any character other than 'gruff man who maims'.

But the action.

Holy Shit.

That fight on the highway between roaring traffic, the Japan sequence, Donnie's Ip Man punches sounded like a machine gun in cinema sound, awesome.

Scott Adkins was hilarious, and obviously brilliant during his fight scene. Props to Keanu for committing fully to the action, I can't imagine the amount of time and effort it took to learn all that choreography.",2023-03-24 13:42:07

1) Keanu not being on fire in the old building, cut to jumping out the window suddenly on fire, then again, not on fire when he lands. I was crying laughing.
2) Having the most obscure cameo appearance from the Berghain bouncer
3) referenced already but the club goers continuing to dance as people are getting axed in the dome.
4) Donnie being the most incredible fighter despite being blind but then when he’s not actively fighting, bumbles to open an envelope and seemingly trips over his own feet.
4b) Donnie using motion sensors to emit noises when people walk by but then not being able to track where John is when he’s 7 feet away and talking to him lol.
5) playing Justice while in France was a nice touch.
6) I found it hilarious the number of times Keanu pulled a Dracula and used his blazer as a face shield as he took corners. I left the theatre mimicking this move with my jacket.",2023-03-25 07:05:22

"(LONG FANGIRLING WITH SPOILERS AHEAD, BECAUSE FAN GIRL) 

*I feel like they wanted to go all out on this film so they crammed a lot of stuff in. They reeled me in by casting Hiroyuki Sanada so I'm kinda bummed that the Japan subplot ended too early. I guess it's there so they can pick it up if they decide to make a spin-off or a 5th JW (but how?)

*That nunchuck scene was very dragging. We get it, John can be awkward and vulnerable sometimes since he's a formerly retired assassin in his 50s, but did it have to be this long and this early in a 2.5hr long film? 

*Akira continuously stabbing that giant dude on the back as he crawls up the stairs encapsulates my everyday struggles. WHY WON'T YOU JUST DIE

*You know those moments when you witness something so captivating that you're suddenly filled with longing, because you remember someone who would've loved seeing it? Donnie Yen gave me that. Jesus, if my grandfather (who was addicted to HK action cinema--even those without subtitles!) was still alive, Donnie's role as Caine could've changed his mind about Keanu Reeves films (he was too old school to appreciate The Matrix trilogy back then). 

*Award-giving bodies need to invent an award for that overhead one-shot fight sequence in that Parisian apartment ASAP. I resorted to just dumbly gaping and gesturing at the screen because what the fuck.

*That stairway scene invalidated my future excuses for skipping leg days. 

*The creepy-evil Skarsgard brother was wonderfully creepy-evil. Top-tier nepo baby. 

*This is peak John Wick. Sure he found himself inside a crowded techno club again, but how else are they gonna top this now that he massacred his way out of Berghain? The pencil callback to the 1st film and the dog that John was finally able to save led me to anticipate and accept the ending. If Keanu decides to retire and just ride motorcycles for the rest of his life (which he clearly deserves), I'd be happy with just this--and that's saying a lot because I've had a crush on him since I was a teen. But if he does decide to make another one, my wallet is always ready to be thrown.

*Keanu really is a genius for spotting gold. I never imagined that a guy-avenges-dead-dog story was just the foundation of something so insanely satisfying. No joke, I fasted for the entire afternoon (because I have a weak bladder) and just waited for the luxury recliner seats with free snacks because I was THAT ready for John Wick. Nothing and nobody was going to ruin it for me, a ""John Wickzilla"". 😅",2023-03-28 02:31:27
"I liked the 3rd better, think they are just getting worse in each movie, but the fighting in the last 2 and 1 ofc were way more iconic and memorable. Felt like this one was creating more cinematography for the sake of it and putting less emphasis on the actual fights. But also has way too many throwbacks and cliches from other movies, its all over the place from Last Samurai to For a Few Dollars more and the ending was straight from Blade Runner 2049 and felt abrupt. Of course he earned the duel but I figured he’d be taking down the entire high table not just another guy with a “Parlay” moment. And things like the stairs scene started to be too silly. The fight with the twins in the last movie and in clubs and the mirror room in 2 was amazing, not to mention 1 being perfect, this movie I’m struggling to remember anything but the explosive COD shotgun fight. And Halle Berry didn’t return but they brought back the dog fights which felt like they just wanted to use another K9 unit cause it was fun for the directors. Just too many different cliche themes and ideas taken from other movies as well with less dialogue that was as good, it tried a little too hard and was a product of its own success for me. Too much of a parody of itself, 7.5/10.",2023-03-28 03:33:04
"This was great!
- Chad Stahelski might just be the best action movie director of the decade, even the camera work is in constant motion just as a stunt actor would be. To be completely honest though none of it would work without an actor as dedicated as Keanu

- Keanu Reeves' commitment to the stunt work over four movies is truly commendable. This entire series rests on his willingness to go through the ardous training and he fully delivers. He's stoic but determined. Every scene he's in though is an action scene. I just wish we spent some time with him wrestling with all the destruction he's causing, all the friends he's endangering, maybe have a moment where he contemplates if this is truly the only way forward.

- Caine stole this movie for me. I was so worried he'd be a daredevil caricature but he brought he's own style and flair to his fighting and mannerisms. He was constantly tapping surfaces with his blade to assess he's surroundings. He's head was always turned so he's ear faced the guy he was fighting. The scene where he plasted motion-sensitive doorbells on the kitchen walls was genius.

- Nobody is a character I did not connect with at all. The movie gives him a lot of screen time as if he's going to be some big baddie but besides his sniper rifle, and ability to find John Wick (which everybody does anyway) nothing stands out about him. The Marquis relied a lot on Nobody but Nobody never proved himself worthy. In fact, the Marquis' second in command seemed a far more worthy match for John Wick. The actor playing Nobody was also incredibly weak. He tried too hard to make the character feel dangerous but I don't think the actor did a good job. Honestly, this actor was the weakest part of a stellar movie for me. Cut him out and the plot still moves forward. By contrast...

- Akira is fantastic. She did an excellent job. As soon as she came on camera behind that hotel desk you could sense this was not an extra. Her fight scenes were balletic and brutal. The Bow and arrow on the rooftop and that ice-pick kill scene as the baddie is crawling up the stairs was great. 

- Marquis also felt a little flat for me. He just seemed like a 12 year old richie rich ordering people around. The actor had so much room to let loose but he never did, instead he chose to be monotone. The only sense of danger he shows is in the horse stable with the knife. I have friends who were on set with him recently and apparently he's a massive dick in real life so I'm surprised how reserved he played this.

- The cinematography was gorgeous! For a movie set entirely at night
this really took full advantage of that. The tokyo scenes looked stunning. The overhead in the paris apartment. I could pause this anywhere and be happy to screenshot a new desktop background.

Overall. 9/10. Highly recommended to anyone who loves a good action movie. Between this and Top Gun Maverick I'm so happy to see real stunts. I am so over the Marvel/DC 3rd-act CGI monster mess. This is real. It's Gritty. You feel every hit, every gun shot. My god. This is an action movie.",2023-03-28 15:56:48
"My only issue with the franchise, is the lack of realism  in how Wick is able to take punishment to his body that no person in real life could withstand.

For example, how on earth does he surive being shot multiple times, falling of a building and hitting the ground at the end of John Wick 3.

Also, how is he able to roll down the stairs near the end of Part 4, and then get back up and keep fighting?

Is this franchise set in a universe where physics dont apply and people dont get hurt?",2023-03-30 04:33:40
"This is going to be an unpopular opinion but here goes....

They took a lot of the world building and general tone in the first three and lit it on fire in this one.

- I really liked the combat in the first John Wick movie where at the end, John's bruised, bloody, and limping along home (What real fighting is actually like), seeking medical aid where appropriate..  Now?  John can get hit by like...  20 speeding cars in a row and then kill like 100 people after that immediately.  
- In the second movie, they made a spectacle over how many guns John procured in preparation for his battle on the way out and then strategically placed those weapons along the way. Now?  Unlimited ammunition while John did donuts around the bad guys.  I didn't count bullets but it was definitely more than the 21 per clip that was stated. 
- In the second movie, they introduced the suits that stop bullets and they talk about how it will hurt like hell but at least you won't be shot.  Now, the suit is full on armor protection without even so much as flinching.
- In the third movie they made it a HUGE fucking deal that John was excommunicado and had a bitch of a time going pretty much anywhere.  Now?  He's a Jetsetter, going from NYC sewers, to Osaka to Berlin, to Paris in no time flat.  No problems here my dudes!
- And even in this one... The stormtroopers have hard bulletproof armor on.... But arrows aren't bullets and they can totally go through the armor that bullets can't.  Checkmate, atheists.

I feel like most moviegoers don't mind suspending disbelief at movies, so long as the world is internally cohesive.  And this latest chapter broke a lot of internal rules, which is a damn shame because the world building in the first few was incredible.",2023-04-16 05:08:52

Not that $20m+ isn't a ton of money for someone to have, but I think it seems incongruous against the sheer opulence of the high table and the transcendence that they seem to have about money.

It is an even bigger missed opportunity that he doesnt do any fighting in any of the John Wick movies, his only scenes including in this are just dialogue.",2023-03-26 11:40:02
"I gotta say, I love John Wick and I had fun with this for sure. But something about this one isn't sitting completely right with me. 

Something that I hated about 2 is way that the nonstop samey action caused it to all just blend together and get numbing. 3 fixed it by adding huge variety between all the fight scenes so they all felt at least slightly different from each other, and also have each action scene build up intensity from each other. I couldn't tell you a specific detail of any of the action scenes of 2, while in 3 I can remember each action scene separately because they all feel different and distinct. And while there still is some decent variety in this one, it didn't feel like they put the same thought into the variety at all. The only one that felt truly full of variety was the first one at the Japanese hotel and then they all started to have less and less distinct differences between them until it came really close to hitting that mindless, all blending together thing 2 had going on. And instead of each action scene getting progressively more and more intense like 3, it felt like the high point was the first action scene and then the rest was on the same level or worse. Sure there are some highlights like that overhead scene but it just felt like it had much less thought put into it from 3. The whole staircase sequence was alright i guess but for the final part of the final action scene for what could be the final John Wick movie? It left a lot to be desired. 

And then the story. Why did it devolve into being this directionless feeling? It felt like the direction story was going with 3 didn't match where it went here. Characters from 3 were dumped in exchange for new characters that didn't need to be there. When you really think about it, the Nobody guy didn't need to be there. He had no purpose. It felt like watching a movie that had weird retconing going on in a series that definitely didn't need retconing.

Still had a lot of fun with it but something felt so off about it. I wonder if the cancelation of 5 had something to do with the lack of direction this one felt like it had.",2023-03-27 04:46:08
The action got a little tiring and my god is Reeves a bad actor,2023-06-05 11:00:34
I really wouldn’t be surprised if the Academy finally adds a best stunt choreo category this year after JW 4 and M:I 7 makes everyone flip the fuck out.,2023-03-24 03:55:17
"Chad Stahelski is a master at his craft and this is easily one of the 5-or-so best action movies ever made, if not number one. It felt like watching Vince Carter in the 2000 Dunk Contest - the only person on Stahelski’s level is Stahelski, and he’s playing to one-up himself at this point.

Loved the references to the Warriors, Wuxia, top-down video games, and Game of Death.

And god damn - Bill Skarsgard had one of the best tailors in recent memory.",2023-03-24 07:13:10
"The Warriors homage was the icing on the cake in the third act. As soon as the DJ said ""all you boppers"", I was on another plane of existence",2023-03-24 13:28:01
"It might just be the best one yet, at least in terms of narrative and emotional weight. Hiroyuki Sanada and Donnie Yen both came out to play on this one, the perfect roles for them too. My only complaint is that there should have been more of John Wick interacting with his Dog, but besides that it’s basically a 10/10.",2023-03-24 05:15:35
The Paris scene set to Paint it black!!!! Amazeballs,2023-03-24 11:47:34
"Would’ve been hilarious if they used “Rollin, Rollin, Rollin Rawhide” or Limp Bizkit’s Rolling song when Wick was falling down the stairs in Paris like a Family Guy character.",2023-03-24 02:14:14
One of the best movies I’ve seen. Rare 10/10 in my books,2023-03-24 05:09:42
"I haven't watched it. I'm debating because it's almost 3 hours. The last one I thought was great but was just so much action I got desensitized to it and it felt like the action got a bit boring by the end even though I liked the film. With this being almost 3 hours long, can anyone tell me if it's going to be the same proportion of action but for an extra half hour?",2023-03-24 02:25:03
Reading some of your comments I'm starting to hate that I let dog memes make me think John Wick was a terrible series.,2023-03-24 02:32:55
"Fantastic film but man, the first two minutes were LOUD. The IMAX speakers nearly blew my ears out with every punch. 

My left ear is still wincing from that! Goddamn.",2023-03-24 03:29:27
"Firstly, my entire theater cracked up when John fell down all 222 stairs 

Secondly, was I the only one who didn't care about the Japanese daughter? The movie was wrapping up and I was like ""oh wait she's still somewhere, is she ever going to do anything?"" And then by the time she shows up I'm mad they even included her, because it's just another loose thread.",2023-03-24 06:13:46
legitimately the hardest movie i’ve ever seen,2023-03-24 06:57:10
Love the homage nod to The Warriors with no where to run no where to hide get em boppers,2023-03-24 12:54:13
"Good. It’s John wick being John wick. 
For some reason felt over the top compared to previous films. Some action scenes were fantastic , some not so much. Felt redundant and predictable. Sometimes I feel like the fight scene actors were waiting for their turn to be ass kicked , lol. 

Some parts of the movie didn’t connect , the emotional parts didn’t really land at all. Talking about landing,  wth was the rolling down the stairs in climax so many times. People were laughing in my cinema  ..

Hearing the screen play writer of the original films didn’t get involved in this one. Makes sense as to why this one is my least favourite out of all. 

Still stupid ass fun. Would definitely recommend watching it",2023-03-24 13:16:49
"Great movie, fun dumb action. Not much in terms of plot, my favourite plot is probably still 2.

Marko Zaror should've had more screen time and a badass extended fight scene, kinda wasted a bit. 

Akira should've had more screentime. 

Donnie Yen should've had more screentime, really liked his character's exaggerated movements and actions. 

Charon's death feels really awkward in the hindsight. Ouch. 

Loved it, wouldn't say it's my favourite in the franchise, but it kicked ass.",2023-03-24 13:33:48
I also want to give a shout out to the Marquis’ 3 piece suits. Oh my goodness so beautiful! The metallic one when he was watching the ballet was so crisp. Thank you to whoever designed the costumes!,2023-03-24 17:01:09
Has keanu reeves acting always been this bad. I remember watching the matrix and thought him being emotionless is part of his character but after seen him acting like that in every movie I see of of him makes me realized the farthest his acting capabilities can go. Regardless I love the movie,2023-03-24 17:54:17
Loved it. The only thing that bothered me was the light during the sunrise scene. They could've put more effort in replicating sunrise light source and a toned-down sky.,2023-03-24 21:14:00
"No spoilers in this post:

The entire movie was just an western/anime/video game/HK kung-fu homage.

Guns aren't even guns anymore. Firing a shot is like throwing a punch, and those kill shots are like ""fuck-yous"" rather than serving a tactical purpose (like the 1st movie). Which I started to like after realizing what they were doing.

I loved the nunchaku fight sequence. I could be wrong, but that was a Game of Death homage. John Wick fighting up multiple levels of the building and employing different fighting techniques as he advances. 

The bird's eye view, Hotline Miami, one-shot is mentioned a lot, and well deserved. I leaned over to my wife during that scene and whispered ""This is cool..."" I love how the dragon's breadth shots really added to that Hotline Miami tone. Shit was just flying all over the place, but it was not hard to follow the action at all. I was grinning that whole scene.

All the new characters were one-dimensional, but all pretty memorable. Donnie Yen fucking stole every scene he was in. This may be his best performance to date. 

I also found it funny that all the hundreds of bodies they throw around in the action scenes are all wearing masks or hats. I'm sure the same stunt team of a couple of dozen people are constantly getting killed over and over again. I'll love to see a stat sheet per stuntman for how many times they got killed by a named character.

There are certainly some annoying things in the movie where I didn't really agree with the choices. I thought the Nobody character was pretty pointless. You can remove him from the movie, and you'll have the same movie. 

John Wick's dialogue was more cringey than badass. The man speaks like he's been punched in the head too many times. I rather he go the completely silent protagonist choice than what they went with.

Overall, I liked the movie. Although, I felt the nearly 3 hour run-time was a bit much for a pure action film with virtually no narrative. I would've loved to have experienced this movie as a mini-series, where each episode was a new ""stage"" or action set piece. That way, you get a breather between each action scene and really let them marinate in your head. As a feature film, it kind of all blends together and it's hard to appreciate the last action scene when this next one is going off.",2023-03-24 21:27:09
"I'm glad that this movie is employing so many stunt guys, but I think that's it for me.  It's gone stale.  It went from a bunch of goons getting killed in a warehouse, to assassins with silencers killing people in New York while discreetly dealing with the bodies, to finally a full on terrorist attack in the center of Paris.  The only place left to go would have John Wick 5 take place on the 50 yard line of the Superbowl while the game goes on uninterrupted. The action and stunt work was of course stellar, but it is definitely time to retire this franchise.",2023-03-24 21:41:37
"Standouts for me were:

* The overhead long take, goddamn.
* Scott Adkins was killer (heh) in that fatsuit.
* Donnie Yen will probs get his own spin-off and deserves it.
* John's not dead - intentionally left ambiguous just in case they want to make another down the track.
* In the other films, there were only so many setpieces or standout action scenes. In this one, almost every action sequence is a treat - the donuts in the car?? Far out.
* Bill Skarsgard was a great villain, anyone reckon he's actually a decent fighter? He did manage to take Nobody by surprise after all.
* Speaking of Nobody, what's his deal? Where'd he get the book of John Wick? Is he related to Halle Berry's Sofia from Chapter 3?",2023-03-24 23:25:43
"So do we expect them to still do the 5th? Lionsgate greenlit it and its one of their only franchises left so I cant see them wanting to let it go. But that ending was satisfying and doing a ""actually hes not dead!"" runs the risk of being forced.",2023-03-25 01:29:33
"His last walk down the steps has to be a homage to Spike in Cowboy Bebop, right?",2023-03-25 02:58:54
"Theatre applauded at Bill's death, it was very satisfying as I really wasn't sure what direction the duel would go in. He played such an unlikeable character in such a way you could tell he was having fun with it and so the audience was too. Also shouldn't Caine be in trouble for killing so many henchmen on the way up? Caine had the best lines, from the fuck off to the let me see in the card game. Probably the best in the franchise.",2023-03-25 03:32:15
"I think Winston and Charon should have swapped roles. It makes no sense that John wouldn't want to get revenge on Winston for trying to kill him. The narrative making him out to be a noble guy and John's friend was disappointing since John getting vengeance was a big selling point at the end of Chapter 3. John always had a good relationship with Charon, and him being there till the bitter end (and becoming the head of the rebuilt Continental) would have been fitting. 

Also, I think the Mr. Nobody role was also useless. He didn't contribute anything to the narrative since his role in the narrative was already occupied by Caine. I think the daughter would have been a much better pick for the ""third foil"" role. She has it out for John and Caine, and it would have been interesting to see her continuously interfere with John and Caine's fighting by trying to kill them both. 

Otherwise, great film. Can't wait to see it again.",2023-03-25 04:02:23
"The choreography and long takes are absolute master. Fucking. Classsss.

What a good damn film and absolute ride

11/10",2023-03-25 06:29:32
"Absolutely amazing. The depth of the symbolism, upped ante on the action sequences, character development, direction, performances, and cinematography make John Wick 4 not only the best film in the series, but one of the best moviegoing experiences I have had in a long time as well as one of the best action movies of all time. 

I can’t remember a movie whose nearly three-hour runtime went by as quickly as this. I will admit that in the past (especially with Parabellum) I have had some issue with the length of the kill-spree scenes. In fact, I was a little disappointed with Chapter 3 and a bit worried going into this — I now know how foolish those thoughts were. 

That this series has been completely shunned by the Academy is a damn shame.

JW4 > JW2 > JW > JW3",2023-03-25 07:26:12
"It's really long... there's a twenty minute to thirty minute stretch in the middle where it drags.

Also I kinda think Bill Skarsgård is actively bad in this... too much mustache twirling and scenery chewing but damn... everything else was top tier.

Action especially everything Paris was amazing. Scott Adkins killed it here. Everyone beside Bill was pretty good too. Excited to see more of Rina's acting

Felt pretty ballsy to kill off Wick but I'm not sure if that sticks

John Wick and Neo will go down as two of the most iconic action characters ever.",2023-03-25 22:34:06

"**IF ONLY most other movies getting made have at least 50% of THIS movie's glorious action** LOL they might just save the theater industry, Box office thriving better than ever. Going to movies in theaters dominate every form of Entertainment.

So, PROOF is in the pudding you really don't need movies to have mind-blowing or much plot and talking, this 96% rated movie is just about ALL action! What more proof do you need  **this formula WORKS**? Hollywood is so afraid to try just this formula, but shit is proven to WORK!

BTW, this movie IS ONLY meant to be seeing in the theaters, everything from action to cinematography is EPIC. If you are waiting for VOD of this seeing this at home, you are a moron!",2023-03-25 22:52:50
"My favourite part of every John Wick movie is when there’s a literal knife/gunfight between multiple people covered in blood in full flow in a nightclub and people a few feet away notice it and just sort of… carry on dancing. 

Or on occasion 10-15 at a time will stop, grip each-other’s shoulders and sort of cower in place like GTA NPCs instead of, I dunno, just running away.

Gets me every time. Top work all round on this one.",2023-03-25 23:17:21
The original JW film is still the best imo,2023-03-25 23:36:30
"John Wick 4 was amazing. I think it's my favorite of the franchise. Cain's character was \*chef's kiss\*. Something I've been thinking about is just how should we rank John and Cain? Who is actually the more dangerous/talented/trained killer? John Wick is presented as the ultimate killing machine in the JW universe. But Cain is fucking blind after ""giving"" his eyes to The Table. If Cain could still see then would be be the true Baba Yaga? The dude is a fucking monster blind. What would he be if he still had his vision?",2023-03-26 00:14:14
"Loved the movie but at the end, i was, come on man, that goes almost F9 level of realism, but stil abosolutely loved it.

"Here's an idea for a sequel. John Constantine, played by Keanu Reeves, uses his magic to bring John Wick, played by Keanu Reeves, back to life. Then they high five each other, turn to the camera, and do that air guitar riff thing they did in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.",2023-03-26 12:51:41
"I loved it, but I really wished when the franchise introduced incredibly bulletproof suits and armour, that they also put in a warning about durability or something.

Osaka was ridiculous for that.

 All I really wanted was just some coded message like the rest of the Sommelier's scenes from 2. ""This suit will do you well for a party, but if it gets too wild, you'll need to let it breathe"" and just say that the suit won't stand so much impact within a short amount of time. Then you can have all the mooks fail to kill John Wick and by the time the big guys come around, reintroduce the threat by taking away the suit's protection.",2023-03-26 14:03:33
"Winston being John's father has so much depth. Keeping him a distant ""orphan"" but close and involved in the underworld. Winston basically orchestrated the downfall of the table.",2023-03-26 22:18:33
"Some things that bothered me about this movie though I can look past a lot if it as the action was amazing 


1.  The Osaka continental manager-  what did he offer john as his friend?  Just safe harbor and passage and why was john even there?  They just left it dangling and I felt I paid attention to a lot.  This irked me

2.  At the end of 3...you pissed john?  And then it was just left off.  I guess kind of answered with killing the desert guy but idk.  If this wasn't the last movie then ok but they said for now it is.  Didn't take down high table only one of them 

3.  John felt weirdly less reponsive in this movie.  I mean just weird

4. In the other ones john was banged up in need of medical attention.  In this one he literally fell and should have broken his back in that dancing scene...or if he got lucky there....the stairs??? I chalked it up to him knowing how to fall since he wasn't rusty anymore but still..  A bit too on the nose especially since he got hit.  And how did the dog not get hurt by the car?

5.  John dead....yeah obviously I think he faked his death and feel like the whole crest thing was to show john is dead but jehdani is alive imo

Felt like the movie could have used some more editing...I need to see this movie again to catch some extra things!",2023-03-27 04:01:11
"Glad it wasn't shit, but yeah, it was a movie with some video game characters. Dialogue was Ok, nothing special. Action scenes had some good concepts, but not very realistic. Seemed like it wasn't the best effort, cos it's John Wick 4 and people want violence. 

I'm happy to be alive. Rip Lance Reddick.",2023-03-27 07:08:15
"Did John's tombstone have ""A Loving Husband"" on it? Cause my friend said that it didn't so that means he's alive, but I thought that it did. Now I'm not sure who remembered correctly.",2023-03-27 14:54:09

Pull a palpatine on john.
SOMEHOW ~~PALPATINE~~ John wick is back...the dog didn't seem fazed,and the way the beggar king laughed

They could even do some style of Mr Nobody crossover,(bob odenkirk)

Really wish they had of followed through with the high table shit...those ppl seem to piss off enough of the ppl beneath them it's amazing no ones tried to coup them before.. johns shown that 1 man can fucking ruin their day if need be

The high table just seem like massive cunts,u give us ur eyes,and a never see ur daughter again kind of shit...They dont have enough muscle to kill all the familys,so it's  weird it's taken someone till john  came along to  be like FUCK  u guys

"I loved every bit of the movie but the Japan plot confused the hell out of me.

Why did John Wick ever go there. Like the daughter said, it's kinda his fault that everyone there died. If the narrative reason is him picking up the marquis pin Winston would have told him eventually whether he had the pin or not. So it's not like John gained anything from going there. I guess I'm struggling to see the point of that entire thing other than cool ninja fighting and nunchucks. 

Please tell me if I missed something. It kinda feels like koji died for no reason.",2023-04-01 07:46:58
Anyone else much prefer the 3rd one?,2023-04-03 09:55:12
"It's gonna be a hot take but the CGI was horrendous in this movie. The overhead action sequence felt like a video game in the worst possible way. People were on fire but the fire casts no shadows or illuminate anything. Everything was CGI and particle simulations. That big mirror on the floor breaking was terrible. Papers flying around was terrible. Color matching was terrible. Every car except the ones driven by main actors were GCI. Every bullet hole was CGI. Even the blood they had on their clothes at the end duel was CGI. 

And don't get me on the unlimited bullets. In the previous movies you could count the bullets and John changes the magazine when the gun is empty. In this they specify the gun holding 21 bullets but he fires more than 40 times. Knives materialize in the hands of people. People get stabbed with something but we never see with what. The attention to detail was lacking in this movie. 

And once more, the CGI was horrendous. Color matching was terrible. There was unnecessary green screen work at the end. John being illuminated in white light but the buildings are in yellow light. John being brighter than everything else yada yada.

I don't know. The fights on the third act didn't feel personal because of the excessive CGI. Never felt like John was in danger. First two acts though? Masterpieces.",2023-04-06 23:00:45

This installment was a bit ridiculous with all the lighting shanenigans in the fight scenes. Sure it looked nice but to the point it was distracting. I don't think I was meant to wonder why are there all these LED tubes everywhere in these abandoned warehouses.,2023-05-22 21:33:20
"This movie went too far, the fights were ridiculous, especially the kevlar suits turned out to be just silly after the initial use in previous movie. Whole fighting scenes looked lame. You could easily see how the mobs waited for Keanu to be ready to handle them. Bad guys were silly cartoon bosses, the blind hitman was total joke, i did like the actor thought. Black hitman was totally unneeded as was the japanese hotel's daughter. I got bored at the action after 15 minutes, it offered nothing new, like the whole movie. Similar scenes than in previous movies, repetition gets boring. It was watchable but i would have cut at least 30 minutes of silly looking fighting scenes. 7/10, mostly for the nice scenery and high-class places.",2023-05-22 23:41:35

"This one reminded me of a video game so much. Meet the Russian NPC who gives you a mission to kill the German sub boss and retrieve a tooth, thus earning you a tattoo to allow you to fight the final boss etc.

This one completely does away with any semblance of realism, for better or worse, it's all very over the top. It really was a bit long though, I think sometimes the fight scenes went on way longer than they needed to ,even for John Wick. The Nunchaku fight was probably my favourite.

Not entirely sure how I feel about the film. Very mixed on my end.",2023-05-31 11:06:44

"honestly, I was extremely let down by this one. John Wick (1) was glorious, just incredible action, writing, world building, no notes (except maybe next time get a Russian to show you what a Russian accent sounds like). John Wick 2 and 3 I still thought were good, not the fireworks out of nowhere that the first one was but they managed to create a trilogy that didn't completely fizzle out towards the end like so many do. but this time I felt like they couldn't suck their own dicks hard enough while also forgetting why anyone liked the first one. especially the very first fight, Osaka, was annoying more so than tense. bullet proof jackets were established - jackets that bullets will literally ricochet off with a silly ping, and can be shot a dozen times without any pain were not and I did not appreciate it. even worse that these same adamantium clothes were no use whatsoever at all again blades, except that one time John was able to avoid getting his wrist cut by Caine's sword through virtue of having his shirt sleeve intervene. but then they are also insanely good at absorbing blunt force considering the parisian stairs event. also going back to Osaka, drip-feeding the bad guys so there were always 2-3 to fight before the next 2-3 arrived was bad enough, given that the location was incredibly wide open with multiple avenues of approach so there was no natural funnel or secondary obstacle to regulate the influx of reinforcements. that out of five or so people who clearly saw John only two figured it was worth their time to come at him was a bit worse. but the number of times enemies would recover from John's attacks, move to attack him again but visibly stop themselves and, for no reason whatsoever, flail around a bit more because John wasn't ready to fight them again just yet was just silly. also John acting like ammo is infinite and quadruple-tapping people even if his second shot already did their head in was a head scratcher decision for me. but then again people are just really hard in this universe, like Mr. Nobody who used the hand he just split open a day ago to punch somebody without so much as flinching. and the whole duel premise... John's demand of ""leave me alone"" was fair enough, but for Winston to add on a bouncy castle and a pony and the contents of fort knox and not being laughed out of the building was silly - having a right to a duel is one thing, but a trade as uneven as that is unreasonable by any measure. of course it wasn't all bad, the Hotline Miami top-down segment was pretty mint for instance. and the ending wasn't the worst. but overall I come away from John Wick 4 disappointed and... kind of annoyed actually.",2023-06-01 11:33:03
"What in the f\* was this russian reboot of a Marvel movie disguised as John Wick?

I had to quit at 45 minutes in and fck that movie. All that expetation. Im not watching that, but I have to have some answers from a Wicker. 

1. When did the John Wick universe become a superhero world? Suddenly it was 4 clans attacking, 1. Samurai, 2. Maskman with guns, 3. a group of Jack Reachers and solo dolo Wick/Dare Devil. + IT as the movies boss. 
2. The blind guy was hella good in the start, and could hear every move the other person made. He was basically like Dare Devil. But when John Wick slid 2 meters next to him, and sat there for a good 15 seconds, while glass shattered while he moved + he reloaded. And the blind guy cant suddenly hear anything. Then he walks 1 meter to the left of John, and John moves towards him. 
3. Back to the superhero thing, when did John Wick become bullet proof? Ive seen all 3, and it was more like a modern take on Rambo. He was lucky and overpowered, and survived - like a 1 in a 1.000.000 scenario. But with this movie every guy needs 4 shots or a headshot to die. Wick just has to hold his hand against his face to survive, even though he has fought of 30+ guys within the first 30 min of the movie.

This movie should be in The Guinness World Record Book for the most Action in any movie ever. And I doubt it will be surpassed by an other movie any time soon. They worked hard for 4 years and it shows. Still 8.5/10 for the unrealistic part but atleast they had the balls to kill him off which backed it up a few notches.

But here is my question, why did they kill off John Wick???? So they basically killed the franchise right? How on earth can it possibly continue without John Wick?

I believe there is a post credits scene (why not show it after the main end credits finish? i ended up leaving missing the end credit scene).

Fantastic action throughout the entire movie. Everything after the bounty was raised to $26 million was amazing. 

I can not wait to see what the sequel movies are going to do. There was so much world building in this movie. The best part is all of it just makes sense. Of course there's huge numbers of assassins in each of these families. Of course! There's just enough there to start building a new protagonist for a new trilogy.

"Since everybody is already praising the action I want to talk about everything else I loved in this. First of all, it's paced extremely well, the third one felt a little bloated but I didn't feel the runtime at all on this one.

What Dan Laustsen and Kevin Kavanaugh accomplished here is nothing short of incredible, this might be the best looking film of the last few years, yet I already know it won't get any awards recognition. One of my favorite moments in this action film is simply Winston just walking through an art gallery in a dolly shot.

I also think this is a lot deeper than most people will give it credit, it's very obvious how much Stahelski is influenced by Greek mythology and I thought this film hit a lot of themes very well.",2023-03-24 05:11:44

Donnie Yen killed it and the setpieces were super cool.

"When they announced this feature would be a 3-hour epic, I had a gut feeling it would culminate in Wick's last outing. After they killed off James Bond last time, I feel like all bets are off the table. What I find curious is that they are still supposedly making a John Wick 5, but I don't see how they can resurrect the character, unless it's a prequel or a fake gravestone. (And if you watch the after-credits scene, it seems to hint at a spin-off with other characters.)

As for the movie itself, it was extremely John Wick-y...take that as you will. There are ridiculous set pieces where ravers are dancing wildly in the pouring rain (sprinklers?) while other people are being killed all around them, and another scene set in a busy traffic roundabout where cars drive on by normally. Then you have Wick himself who falls from several great heights and gets knocked down 800 stairs, but keeps getting back up again. And it all culminates in a good old fashioned fucking *duel*. What else could you ask for?

Donnie Yen was great as the blind assassin (did they call him ""Caine"" because he carries a walking cane?), as improbable as that character is in this world. And all the extended action sequences managed to feel like a live-action video game, especially in top down mode (probably the single most impressive shot in the film). My only complaint is that the film did seem like it was dragging on too long in parts, which could have easily been cut down. I miss when movies used to be less than two hours.

There was a quite a bit of chromatic aberration for some reason. I noticed it as lines in a lot of scenes I saw it but there was patches in some (on the columns in that golden room) and it seemed to get less noticeable further into the movie. Did the theater I was at have a bad copy?

"I enjoyed the film a lot. 

Still gravitate to the original as my favorite, though. There was just something brilliantly simple about the premise.

Also, I like what they did with the mythology expansion of the High Table and everything in the sequels - it was a good way to build on the story and keep things interesting - but frankly I also felt like it watered down the “legend” of John Wick somewhat.

In the original movie, he seemed like a badass hitman whose very name instilled fear in any enemy who heard it; it was like the very name John Wick was enough to cause panic for anyone who dared come against them…!but the more they introduced other hitmen and other foes and acquaintances in the sequels it kinda made Wick just seem like one of many others, and people didn’t seem to fear or respect him as much. He finds himself in numerous situations in this film where he doesn’t seem quite as intimidating or respected by his peers as the original film made him out to be… it was sort of like he was THE most feared hitman in the original film and that was gradually lost with each sequel.

If I sound like I’m complaining, I’m really not. The reality is that the original film was a lot more grounded and the premise was basically “what if a retired hitman came back for revenge?” - but they couldn’t keep recycling that plot in each sequel so I do get why they took it the direction they did. They upped the ante and made things a little more fantastical almost in regards to the High Table and the way the hotels are run and the network of hitmen…. It just naturally evolved over time in a different direction.

But to me the original film is still the best. I need to rewatch the other sequels but this one might take the too spot if only for that ridiculously absurd final hour or so.",2023-03-25 23:13:51
"Hear me out: Continuing the franchise here on out is a big mistake and should’ve ended with a fifth. Why do I think this way?

After the ending of 4 what exactly has changed in the grand scheme of things? Nothing as far as I can tell. The High Table still reigns at the tippy top of this assassination organization, and we’ve never seen who is the true head of the totem pole. It would’ve been incredible to go out in a huge epic-scale involving the High Table in some way, and then indelibly altering the way things are run in this secret society. The way Wick passes away in the end didn’t leave a lasting impact on the franchise’s story universe. After his death it will be business as usual for everyone associated below the High Table. So what would be an interesting hook going forward? Wick made a mess of things after avenging the death of his dog, while the High Table dispatched their expendable soldiers to murder one man in the process, so it’s ironically how both sides made mess of things. A potential domino effect seemed like how the series was flowing, until it built up to a climactic final flick where everything comes down like a house of cards. To me, it would’ve been cool if the High Table is toppled, and then all the crime organizations serving under them would splinter and become autonomous. All of this resulted from Wick’s war against the High Table. This is just head canon, but I still stand that the franchise is essentially done without its lead guy, so what would be the point if everything going forward will feel redundant? Something impactful should’ve happened to make the series a major turning point for the franchise. But I guess we won’t find out whether this was a smart move or not until Ballerina is released. I have low faith, but I’m open to give it a chance.

One more thing: What would happen if Ballerina becomes a critical/financial bomb? Lionsgate would either have to abandon the franchise or resuscitate it with one more Reeves-starring Wick flick. But this is just personal speculation, according to me.",2023-03-25 23:29:46
"It feels like the top-down one-take fire shotgun scene set to the Le Castle Vania soundtrack from the club scene in the first movie was made specifically for me but I'm happy it seems to have provided so much delight to everyone else

We see him as the pure brutal force he really is. The end credit scene was also perfect. I am sad and happy with the end of the series. I really hope we don't get a sequel because as hard as it is for me to admit it, they gave John the best goodbye, a happy death, remembering his wife, with a beautiful sunrise, at peace and as a free man. Each passing minute, the movie got better and better. And you didn't really hate any character, except the marquis and that bearded guy who was about to shoot the dog. So much death but so beautiful. I also loved when John got that gun that could shoot through the armor and then the flame shotgun. John wick, a movie quadirology with not a single bad movie. This should be left alone at this point.

"As much as I like John Wick movies and as good as the action was in this film it was way too long. I know these movies aren't exactly Citizen Kane but they normally have good plots that don't overstay their welcome and this one felt like it dragged a bit too much.

The last hour was pretty rock solid but that first 90 mins had a lot of extra that could have just gone away. The plot had a bit too much going on that didn't really add to the overall story.  

Like what was the point of Nobody? What did his character bring to the story? The entire Japan sequence seemed to be here because someone was like ""What if John Wick but bows and arrows?"" and while that was fun to watch you could have cut that entire sequence and the movie would have still made sense.

Same with the night club sequence with gold tooth boy. The plot could have just as easily been that the Marquis was the one that killed Katia's father and you wouldn't need that entire dance club sequence.",2023-03-26 16:42:45

"Really happy they decided against the unlimited John Wicks and cancelling 5.

This was a beautiful closure to a great character.  And new characters have been introduced every movie and we feel something for them.   Thought the franchise would suffer without Kolstad but they made it work.

And can we talk about how great a director Chad Stahleski? The framing, the cinematography (especiallg after Dan Lausten came in), the creativity, sound mixing.  Its all top notch and even with the cinematic homages.

And finally some good Hollywood usage of Donnie Yen & Scott Adkins

All these new action films wanna be like John Wick but they forget that its more than being a martial arts film.  The writing, the characters, the acting, the direction make the franchise what it is.

"Welp, there it is.

I get why people are really enjoying this, it's fun, has good action, some solid one liners, film looks absolutely beautifully—seriously. Some really stunning set pieces that makes me shocked they ONLY spent 100 million on this, it looks like it could've cost double, maybe triple that price tag. Osaka, Berlin, Paris, New York, it travels the globe and really it's funny to see where it all started from in retrospect, kind of humble beginnings.

Donnie Yen was scene stealing, made me want to watch some of his Hong Kong action films. I thought Bill Skarsgard was the best villain the series has seen yet. Shamier Anderson feels like a great newcomer and I'm stoked he's from Toronto (though felt his character was slightly under baked and more of a vessel to have more sweet dog kills...). The cast is pretty great.

I think it's the best John Wick movie, but again, not as stoked on the franchise as a lot of people are, but glad people are going to the movies and having fun! For me this was definitely a little long, exhausting in some parts and more of the same really. I feel like John does that somersault, flip over move pop someone in the head like every few minutes. To me it feels like these movies are just kind of like a really really expensive fight choreography stunt showcase.

Also, I still can't get over how Keanu delivers his lines in these films, this movie in particular. He went hard for the stunts, but he wrote it in on the acting. It feels like every line he says was the first take. And while you're acting with an ensemble cast who is actually trying to act, it's even more apparent.

I think it outclasses the first film in the franchise ever so slightly and kind of a fitting end for everything. It's fun, (even though it's so long). I think you just need to turn your brain off and watch and realize these films don't take place in 'our reality' but one close to it where people in a night club just keep dancing when multiple people are getting fucking murdered, lol.

I don't know if this is already floating around the internet, but Mr Nobody has dreams or premonitions of images.  He then draws those images in this little notebook.

The cinematography was very good with nice scenery, but the action scenes were sometimes waaay over the top like when he rolled down the stairs it was like he was rolling by himself or when he falls off the 3rd floor and just walks away…. It felt a bit lazy, on the first film you believed he was a very good assassin. Now it felt like he was bulletproof. Also come on now how can all this baddies be pro assassins and also be so bad at aiming. Plus sometimes it really showed that the were waiting for their turns to join the fight choreography. Not very good but also not bad, 6/10",2023-03-28 11:36:23
"If i had wrote the movie, i think an ending that would have been a thousand times better than the ending of the movie, would be if Wick and Cain came up with a plan off screen, in which they would purposely miss each other the first two shots (eg. hit each other in the arm), then on the third shot, they both turn thier guns on french guy and both put thier bullet in his head. Then  have Wick tell the guy that was judging the contest to walk away and not tell anyone what happened, or else he will wind up dead. Honestly if i had seen that ending at the cinema, i would have applauded at the twist. 

Even Caine, what did he gain by being in the dual and poetntially dying. He could have killed French Guy at any time, and be on his way.

Or, have them both threaten french guy, and have him sign a document to free both Wick and Cain from the obligations of the table.

I would also write it so that her wife did not die, she just dissapeared for her safety, she comes back into Wick's life, gets kidnapped by french guy, and so Wick in an act of desparation decides to participate in a duel, not with French guy but with Cain, to which French guy agrees. Then it would make perfect sense for 1) Wick to do the duel even though he could die, and 2) Wick dying in the end. 

Also, why on earth would Wick go and see Johnathan, when he tried to kill him at the end of Part 3. If i was in his shoes, Johnathan would be the last person on earth i would want to see, let alone agree to his plan. 

The ending was so poorly written. So let me get this straigh, Wick agreed to a plan which leads to him dying? Also, what an extremely poor and unsatisfying way to end the movie franchise. Me personally, the way it ends makes the entire four movies, and evrything he fought for completely pointless.

My score of the movie. The action and fight choreography 10/10. Storyline and ending 1/10",2023-03-30 11:54:19
"The movie gets off to a kind off start with deserte scenes and the elder, feeling the need to go back to elements of part 3, but after that its a well oiled machine.


Really with a slight rearrangement of elements, this could have just been the third film.

I alleviated how well this film built out a new supporting cast and how much the themes of loyalty and friendship and what people owe eachother played put through them. 

Much as I love John Wick 2, the introduction of the bullet proof suits really skewed things. Now when many of the goons have the same technology, it's almost like Dune where everyone has shields so they have to resort to fighting g hand to hand. Really brought stakes back into the fights in a way that had been missing for a while.",2023-03-24 04:48:44

But a blind assassin? No way. Not even the dumb fun of the series could keep that from being a total immersion killer. Every scene he was in just yanked me out of the movie, and I could never settle in.

Wolverine works because as tough as he is, other mutants can kill him. There are no other mutants in John Wick, just an indestructible hero, and countless inconsequential bad guys for him to kill. It has all the excitement of playing a game on god mode.",2023-03-28 10:10:51

He just kind of keels over and then we see a gravestone.",2023-03-24 07:44:53
"Absolutely epic.

>!I don't think John is dead BTW. When the Bowery King asks Winston whether John is in Heaven or Hell, Winston replies 'who knows?' I think that could mean he's still alive and Winston is just at the funeral for appearances.",2023-03-24 07:47:35
"whole movie is fantastic and it might be the best one so far. say what you want about Keanu's acting but he poured his heart out for these long sequence action scenes, massive credit to him for that. 

VERY much looking forward to more of Rina, i thought she killed it. They didn't just make her an unstoppable force of nature, i liked seeing that she had to struggle a bit to get her kills.",2023-03-24 07:48:51
"Gorgeous cinematography. That single take with the music from previous movies was the chef’s kiss. 

There were some silly bits however. The nightclub scene was very “I want all you extras to pretend there’s club music and just keep throwing your hands in the air like you just don’t care about the killings happening around you, even when your life would technically be at stake”.  

Also, John should have easily been able to headshot the guy when he saved the dog. That dude had way too much armour and plot armour. 

Lastly, the assassins who had a clear view of John and could have easily shot him, instead just stared at him and then waited for him to fall in the street before hitting him with their cars. Worst strategists ever.

However the roundabout car sequence was awesome though.",2023-03-24 07:54:58
"That overhead sequence is so fucking good. Pretty much every action sequence in the movie was amazing but that one definitely takes it for me. It was just so satisfying. The fight on the stairs was great but John getting kicked and rolling down like 8 flight of stairs was goofy as fuck. I kinda cringed when he rolled down the first 2 but then it somehow became better when he just kept rolling because it became so ridiculous that it was funny. Caine was awesome. The whole Berlin club sequence was probably weakest action-wise (though still really good) but the big german guy was so hilariously hammy in the best way possible. >!I'm pretty sure John isn't dead since they still have 1 more movie announced afaik.!<

Overall, it was amazing and 3 hours went by so fucking fast. The movie felt much shorter than it was because it was just pure fun.",2023-03-24 08:15:31

Is Donnie Yen going to be blind in most movies from now on?,2023-03-24 08:59:06
"A hell of a time throughout, with the standouts for me being the stairs, the incendiary shotgun and the overhead scene where it got used, and Donnie Yen's blind fighting style.

The thing I'm not big on is the end.  John Wick dying at the end of the series makes sense, but it doesn't feel like he's accomplished what the story has been leading him to -- Dr full destruction of the High Table and an end to this whole mythic rule-based criminal ""under""world.

He never ""killed them all,"" he never brought a war to the High Table, he just got his offical ""freedom"" and saved a friend.  But it seems like the deeper he got into all this, the less respect he had for their ""rules.""  Being given freedom by another of their convoluted rules shouldn't mean anything to John at this point.

Also weird that he never got his ring back.

So maybe they'll reveal his death was faked, it would make story sense that he'd do it.  But if that's the filmmakers' plan, then they should've revealed that to us.  They can lie to the High Table and the criminal underworld, but they're not supposed to lie to us, that's not part of the series.

That said, I'm still absolutely going to see it again soon.  That incendiary shotgun, maaaaan.",2023-03-24 09:23:58

"Re-sharing thoughts from another thread:

&#x200B;

This film continues the theme of John being a bringer of death and destruction wherever he goes - Sofia resented him for it and Marcus, Koji, Charon died for it. Alongside all the others who he called in favours for and were harmed in the process. He built up lots of goodwill over the years and we saw him burn more and more bridges as he fought for survival and freedom.  
  
He's always been established as selfless but not selfish, and after the 'loving husband' line I was thinking about how they would resolve Caine's story without John becoming someone who would rather sacrifice his friend and Caine's daughter, and how the best resolution would be for John to die and his last act be one of saving a life.  
  
Problem with that conundrum was that the Marquis wouldn't have got what he deserved so the resolution to the duel still surprised me, but I was satisfied with the end to his story, seeing him think of his wife, and free.  
  
On the film overall, it's still fresh in my mind but it does feel very indulgent, and as a fan I'm happy with it but can see how those who aren't obsessed with the films could get lost easily. It makes sense to think that they grouped Chapter 4 and 5 together since there were original talks to film both back to back.  
  
Action sequences were so fun, particular favourite was the gunchaku sequence, Arc de Triomphe, Hotline Miami/Dragon's Breath (also appreciate the reprise of the Catacombs music from Chapter 2) and staircase. Definitely felt some more western homages in the final duel within the score. Donnie Yen and Shamier Anderson stole the show. Bill Skasgard was fun but perfectly functional.",2023-03-24 13:44:00

"I think I just saw the John Wick franchise as one being more “grounded in reality” versus Fast & Furious which has leaned fully into being strictly a “spectacle” movie. 

It’s like the difference between Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig James Bond movies. Both are well made and good for what they are… but if you put some of the sequences from the Brosnan films into the Craig movies, they wouldn’t work because the Craig films are a bit more grounded in the rules of the real world — even if he is doing things that are otherwise impossible.

JW 1 & 2, and 3 to a certain extent have things that are “impossible” but still feel like they are on the very edge of what is possible for the world’s greatest assassin. When you have a magic suit that absorbs all possible damage it almost takes away from the skill that is supposed to typify the character.",2023-03-25 15:29:23

"Really enjoyed Chapter 4! I don't know, I may need to a second viewing, but I'm leaning towards liking Chapter 3's action scenes better. I think Parabellum was peak JW action. The fight scenes in 3 escalated at a really great pace. From the initial knife throwing and motorcycle/katana chases and introducing those armored SWAT units towards the end was so entertaining to watch. And to top it off JW fights the fucking Iron Chef Chairman at the end. 

I get they wanted to go with a poetic climax with the classic dueling pistol match, but I would have loved to see Yen and Reeves square off hand-to-hand or some combo of melee weapons. Can't go wrong with a final boss fight imo. The stairway fight was okay, but at that point so many of the previous action scenes were so good, it ended up being underwhelming. 

Scott Atkins as Killa could have fooled me for Kingpin. 

Favorite scenes was probably the beginning Osaka hotel fights. What a sequence.

1 & 2 feel like much different movies compared to 3 & 4. With the success of the prior movies, they were able to go so big and creative with 3. 4 just takes the best of everything and overall is very satisfying (conclusion?). Story-wise, probably the best of the franchise. Also the cinematography and action shots were top-notch. Gotta give credit to the John Wick team, they been hard carrying the action genre for a while now and deserve some high praise for the phenomenal choreography that has become so vacant in a sea of CGI blockbusters.",2023-03-25 23:26:55

"What did the Marquis and Wick say to each other at the end? It sounded like the Marquis said ""Fools"", and Wick responded ""Fools quit"". Is that correct, or did they say something else?",2023-03-26 02:13:52
I thought this was really good with a solid ending.  But I will say the two on one choreography was bad. A lot of one person just fumbling on the ground until their partner was killed. Then getting up to fight. Otherwise a great action movie,2023-03-26 02:13:57
"The soundtrack was soooo good!   
Also I love how John  was trying to kill this German guy and all the people in a club/rave didn't give a shit and kept on dancing hahhaa",2023-03-26 02:36:15

"Loved the movie except for one thing.

The nod to The Warriors was really cool the first time and really lost its magic each time they cut to the DJ.  If you saw The Warriors you could cut out 30minutes of this movie because it's basically the same thing.",2023-03-26 02:42:39
I’m beyond full of adrenaline after watching this movie. The fight scenes were the best I’ve seen in a long time. The Arc D’ Triumph segment was my personal favorite.  Props to all the stunt coordinators who made me believe this was ALL REAL!,2023-03-26 03:24:06

"I loved this movie but I'm a bit conflicted about John's fate. Call it cope, but I'm not convinced he's gone. 

I think we've learned that gaining your freedom from the High Table doesn't really stick. Didn't work in John's case and even though Kaine is retired and gave up his eyes, they still hold a life for a life over his head. 

Makes some sense that they would fake his demise so that he can live the quiet life he wanted. Plus I'm not convinced a shot to the abdomen could take him down based on his ability to soak damage and with Winston right there and reinstated and able to use the Continental facilities. 

Of course signs point against this (it wasn't filmed, they show his grave and the Bowery King walks off with his dog), but part of me wants to believe he's still out there. He definitely earned his freedom.",2023-03-26 12:32:44

"So John's not dead right? Right? It's chapter 4, not the final chapter. Too many obvious red flags signaling his death, like they want us to think he's dead and even expect it. 

Other little signs (imo he's not dead:

-Winston being cagey when answering ""where he is""

-John dog kinda looked like he saw someone he recognized

-Caine owes him one

-Its stated by the marquise that if John wins, it could be very bad news for the high table. Shake it to it's core or something, I forget exactly what he said. Well John won, and I don't think the high table is going to be very pleased. He might be free, but John is 100% in danger. Best place for him to be for now is ""dead"" so the high table backs off.

-Bowery King is trying to form a resistance army against the table. So far only John was it's only real soldier; I'm under the impression that John's friends can theoretically be recruited.

-The table itself. We never saw them; feels hollow if John is truly dead and never dealt with the 12 of them personally. Break the table, then truly everyone is free.",2023-03-26 22:58:09

I was in the camp of thinking they didn't need to make anymore after 3, but this might now be my favourite of the series.

"Great entry, superb stunts and action sequences. Proper use of Donnie Yen and Scott Adkins skills.

I have a question about Shimazu/Cain swordfight - why Shimazu continued the fight, after Caine told him to stop and live? It's clearly shown that it won't end well and Shimazu has nothing to earn by proceeding to fight and he'll just orpan his daughter? Was it a honor thing?",2023-03-27 09:17:45

"Great. John Wick is not a saga where you have to find physical or script explanations, you just enjoy it.",2023-03-28 01:54:25
"I always expected this series to end with John dying. After leaving such a trail of carnage in his wake, however justified you may or may not think it was, there's simply no going back. And even if he WERE to finally put an end to it and gain his freedom...what's he even have to go back TO? It only made sense that John had to die at the end of all this...

...and yet, watching him draw his last breath - after 9 years of following this series - still hit like a truck. I'd be happy getting a new JW film every few years from now until the end of time, so for things to seem so final is really sad, however necessary it may be. These have been some of the best flat out action movies I've ever seen, and they really went all out for this one. The cinematography in this movie was, for lack of a better word, incredible. Everything was so crisp yet dripping in moody colors and lighting, it was a fucking joy to watch when combined with the usual level of JW insanity. 

If this is the end, I'm going to miss the fuck out of the series. But I'm so thankful that we got 4 great movies that all lived up to a high bar of quality, and a truly epic-length conclusion (even if it did feel a bit draggy in spots).",2023-03-28 02:18:35

"Final scene with John walking down the stairs gave me Cowboy Bebop vibes.

It's a good end for him if they decide to end it there, it can go either way. Winston was in great debt to him for getting back to his former position and helping him fake a death had no consequences since he was free from The High Table.


Edit: He was also in a vehicle related hit like 8 times (6 if you're just counting being run into while on foot).",2023-03-28 05:01:52

"Incredibly stylish movie. I didn't think they could continue it from the previous films without it being stale, but it absolutely proved me wrong. So many cool scenes like the car drifting while shooting and the fire shotgun, it really felt like a video game come to life.

Story was fast paced and it never felt boring despite the long running time.  It definitely has a ""the real treasure was the friends you made along the way"" feel, but I think at the core of it all that's the moral of the story; doing the right thing for the people you love despite the world's rules against them.",2023-03-29 02:33:51
"If it ends here (I hope this is the final ""John Wick"" film), it really is impressive to have an action franchise of this quality that constantly ups the stakes/skill on display, with the same core cast and director (wish I could say writer but they oddly snipped Kolstad for this one). It's rarest in action franchises to have a director stay on for sequels, let alone for all four in the franchise. This makes me a lot more open to the spin offs, as one of the most fun things with action franchises that swap directors is seeing new takes within the established world, so thats how I view things like Ballerina. I think the Wick/Stahelski style has been done to completion but the stunt format in the series and the world building could carry on for a lot more",2023-03-29 02:38:05

First one is still my favourite. It had an elegant simplicity that can't be beaten, IMO.

Cast was all around great and I like what they did with the story.

"I think as a final movie in its series it earned the true jump-the-shark moments in the same way that the Fast and Furious franchise slowly built their way to increasingly absurd action sequences. 

Almost like a video game, it was really interesting to see how the elite level bad guys adopted the high level gear like the bulletproof suit (introduced in 2) and the heavily armored guards (introduced in 3). With all these concepts and established rules of combat coming together, we got some really creative action scenes that are pretty much up there for best in the whole series. 

Sure, if in the first movie we saw John Wick doing donuts and shooting at a bunch of goons, or judo throwing his enemies into traffic and shooting them as they ragdoll in the air, or tumbling down an absolutely massive flight of stairs it might be a little silly, but here it feels right. I loved the balance of the brutality and whimsical absurdity that reminds me of HK-style action; the fighting can be lighthearted and fun within a serious story and you can still have a great time!",2023-03-29 11:56:21

"Watched it last night in a small barebones theater.  Will be seeing it again in IMAX with a fuller audience. 

 Fantastic addition to the series 

I didn't pay much attention to seeing previews, in fact ii barely new it was being released.  I read Keanu's AMA a couple weeks ago and then I randomly saw some clip with Scott talking about Wick.  Couldn't. Wait.

 If you're not familiar with Adkins, check out the rest of his stuff.  I've seen everything he's been in... As well as Donny Yen and they've worked together before (IP Man 4).  Two of my favorite martial arts actors.  They both have seriously improved their non-action acting. So happy they were in it.    

The overhead shootout scene.  Amazing.  Reminiscent of s1:e4 of True Detective single take.  

Rolling down the stairs made me think of the myth of Sisyphus and that John is both Sisyphus and the stone.  

Doing donuts and shooting.  More please. 

What a jam-packed movie. Loved it.",2023-03-29 13:48:38
"Absolute god tier of an IMAX movie. Had enormous fun, then the third hour came and my jaw dropped repeatedly.

The 2nd and 3rd movies were good but suffered a bit from being ambitious. I hoped that they would tone it down for the 4th. Turns out I was wrong and the solution was just to press even harder on the ambition pedal. More locations, more complicated shots, craizer action scenes. 

The ending did bring back that bit of heart that made people love the character so much in the first movie. I really liked it and applaud the choice.",2023-03-29 21:21:45

"Such a fun film! Action is on point and really badass. Well choreographed and chaotic while also over the top yet gritty. So much fun action it’s hard to pick a favorite fight. The incendiary shotgun scene seems to be the fan favorite. I really enjoyed the club fight sequence where Wick fought the fat guy (although I thought it was kinda bs that fat man did as well as he did). The third act is fun but that’s where the action got to the most ridiculous. Wick getting hit by several cars, and later falling all the way down the stairs lmfao. A western style duel was a fitting final fight. I had some problems with the film (not the runtime tho. I thought the film had good pace), but it’s my favorite in the Wick franchise",2023-03-30 02:18:27

"I just watched it in theaters. What a fantastic movie.

The franchise was already known for its gorgeous cinematography, but Chapter 4 tops the previous ones. Action movies rarely get love during awards season, but this movie should get nominated for its cinematography (but it won't).

In addition, they shouldn't go forward with a fifth movie, because I don't think they can top Chapter 4. They have explored a ton of exotic settings with ridiculous set designs throughout four movies. Maybe the geniuses who worked on this movie can think of more places to explore, but I can't think of anything else they can do with this franchise.

And Donnie fucking Yen, what a badass.",2023-04-02 06:07:40
"Can somone help me out here, in the end john challenges the marquee or however you spell it, to a dual, each gets to nominate a second, we are told if either side loses, their second also dies....so firstly why was cain dueling when wick challenged the leader, secondly, upon john....winning so to speak, why isn't Cain killed as well as per the rules.",2023-04-02 11:41:21
"The only things that were kind of meh for me: 
- the character of Nobody, you could take him out, have Caine kill the other assassins to have John for himself, and that's it. Useless character IMO.
- the outright terrorist attack in the middle of Paris, and no police intervention. In the first movie, Jimmy came to his house because some noise was reported, here, cars kept going for 10-15 minutes. Although it had that awesome scene where John did the drift around the assassins and killed them.
- the stair scene. I honestly would've preferred Caine( and Nobody if he had to be in the movie) to just help John. The whole him getting to the top, then falling back, and then getting back up again was a bit much in a movie that had 2:49 hours runtime already.

Other than those, amazing action and all that, and I'll even give the benefit of the doubt to the Osaka scene(meaning that story wise, it's hard to believe John would endanger his close friend). A solid 8.5 on my part.",2023-04-02 14:20:45
I'm just glad after 4 movies this franchise is still good. Usually things fall apart around the 3rd movie.,2023-04-02 17:48:18

Is John Wick really dead tho?,2023-04-03 05:55:55
"Just watched it. Have watched the previous 3 and for further context, my favorite movie of all time is the Raid 2, John Wick is the closest thing to the Raid 2 that Hollywood has to offer. Im a sucker for good action, however, average action does nothing to me which is what youd see in a marvel movie. Doesnt mean I dislike average action, but it just doesnt get me any excited.

That said, I dont remember much of John Wick 3 since it has been a while since Ive seen it. I think it ended with him having that huge bounty on his head and all of New York about to chase him? 


Spoilers ahead:


>!Now to this movie, first the positives, I really really enjoyed the locations and sceneries. Whoever was responsible for those, absolutely fantastic job. I wish I couldve paused the movie and just look at some of those places for a good minute or two. I continue to enjoy the world theyve built with its rules and factions, its really fascinating. The action was really good, as always, however, maybe its just me but since my favorite movie of all time is The Raid 2, I wouldnt mind the John Wick movies to have a little more blood and have a little more gore. Here in Germany, you can only watch it if youre 18+ which is the highest rating, so its not like they had to hold themselves back from a bit more brutality. The Raid 2 was also shown in cinemas here uncensored, maybe its a bigger issue in other countries.!< 

>!To me it also felt like it didnt need to be this long. I think John Wick 4 wouldve benefitted from being a more compact movie, cut one or two action scenes, cut some less relevant ones short, have it be around 140 minutes and i believe it would be a better movie. to make a good action movie imo, you need a quality over quantity approach. dont have too much ""normal"" action and the action you do have, make all of the scenes unique and innovative so theyre memorable. john wick 4 didnt quite hit the perfect balance but dont get me wrong, it was still really good, especially the locations and some of the camera shots were amazing. that apartment fight with the above camera like youre playing a videogame was great. i think you could also remove one of the side characters as part of making the movie more compact, in hindsight, i dont think the movie would be any worse without the black guy with his dog. i was also under the impression that john wick was 110% definitely beyond recovery, so him getting out of all his troubles completely within the rules, was a little lame.!<

>!Is he dead? is he not? the ending reminded me a little of the cowboy bebop ending. maybe he is, maybe he isnt. came a little unexpected for me, i thought there were more john wick movies confirmed and i guess the door is open if it happens, if not, this is enough to bring the series to an end.!<

overall, i really enjoyed john wick 4. it couldve been a little more compact but I still came out with a smile on my face. Id give it a 7,5/10",2023-04-03 18:45:42
"Just seen it and for me easily the best JW movie.

Absolutely loved the overhead camera action in the style of Diablo hack and slash gaming, really fucking brilliant.

Equally loved the homage to *The Warriors*, wasn't as good but then nothing can beat the original, however it was really good constant action.

The cars were a good touch, you think it's an easy home run once he gets the car but nope, that didn't happen.

And the scene where he went rolling all the way back to square one made me genuinely laugh out loud, because those stairs were fucking painful.

Great movie, loved the finale, the arrogant coward thought he had John but yeah, arrogance brings comes with a side serving of complacency and carelessness.

Great sound track, and among the classic covers was a really nice violin piece *Cry Mia River*.

Felt like they never really tied off Akira's story though. And I'm still not sure if the end really was as it seemed.

9/10",2023-04-04 02:33:27
"guys, am I trippin, but why everybody saying that part 4 is good? 
Let me explain 
John wick is not “good story” movie
But part 4 is not good even good action movie 
Yeh, scene like hotline Miami gameplay is incredible, but other tricks and fight scenes are so bad, even this fight in a club 
That fake purple jacket muppet etc
Don’t know, but every time I saw fight scenes, i cdobt believed in them 
because they were so fake",2023-04-04 04:17:20
Good but I could’ve done without the first half and still been ok. Kinda a snooze until Paris. Everything after that point was great. Though I think 3 is still my favorite.,2023-04-04 06:29:37
"Well that was insane. The last hour in Paris was one of the greatest action sequences I've ever seen. Just when you think it can't get any better it just keeps getting more crazy in the best way possible.

One thing I don't like is how invincible John is. The amount of times he gets hit by a car or falls from a lethal height is ridiculous. And he doesn't even get hurt that much. When he reaches Sacre Coeur, there isn't even a drop off blood on him. It's a bit too over the top for me.

I think i still like the first one the best but this one is probably second. So in the end I'd rank them - 1 > 4 > 2 > 3 . 

I am glad the main series is likely over now, they've been skirting the line of over the top for a while and I don't know if they could keep it up.

Overall this is an 8 out of 10 for me.",2023-04-04 08:42:52
"A much more satisfying fourth movie would have been Wick going out to end the High Table once and for all with the help of Koji, his daughter and Caine. That would have made for a much better movie.",2023-04-04 20:36:50
"*ding dong* BAM! So good.

I freaking loved this movie. Not as good as the first one, but I thought it was better than 2 and 3.

Just so many good scenes to pick from. Saw where the duel was headed as soon as he didn't fire and it still felt great to witness. But man when he hit the top of the steps and the top henchman Sparta kicks him back the bottom I audibly said, ""YOU DICK"". I felt John's exhaustion lol.

Our boy ain't dead. The dog perking up suddenly during the funeral points heavily to a fake out to be able to finally be away from the Table bullshit is what was suggested there, yeah? Was really expecting John to just go ham and go after the whole High Table but maaaaaan.

And I think my favorite running bit was any time John's pistol would run out of ammo he'd chuck the thing at people. Made me laugh every time.",2023-04-05 01:41:46

"I quite enjoyed this movie overall, but I do wish the action hasn't gotten quite so ridiculous and it felt less violent and impactful overall. The entire nunchucks sequence just felt slapstick. The hotline Miami sequence was amazing though. Really liked the ending too. But there is nothing else for this series to do. Even Wick had to give up on trying to kill the high table. This world is now set in stone. Maybe you could do John fighting a predator or something, but I like this being the end and John dead. Parabellum is still the best of the films.",2023-04-14 12:55:23
"Finally watched the movies, can’t add anything that’s not already been shared here!

Think Wick finally died because he was at peace. No amount of hard falls form buildings, high speed car hits, and what not could even leave a scratch 

It would be extremely bold of LG to let John Wick be (hope they do) and move the universe forward with other characters

All studios looking for easy cash cows",2023-04-15 00:57:39

For 4 movies I watched this guy escape death in a numerous amount of ways, inflict pain and death in fashionable style, and literally own the nick name “baba yaga” as he is the one you send to kill the boogeyman. I feel like the image of john wick to the viewer, was supernatural, Almost godlike, an un-killable force, the literal boogeyman as he was hyped up to be. And to just die instead of kill everyone who sits at the high table, seemed anticlimactic and boring? Is that just me?",2023-04-20 03:38:05

"My favorite part of the film is Donnie Yen just walking up and poking people in the chest with his sword. All he needs to do is hit them in the heart and they stay down and he does it like 5 or 6 times. Meanwhile John is leg sweeping and judo throwing people to get close enough for a guaranteed head shot.

It was a really cool Yen and Yang at the two fight styles as John is giving his all to move forward and Caine is really not in to this fight.",2023-04-27 04:56:49
This film introduced so many cool new assassins that I'm now much less sceptical if John Wick spinoffs would be a good idea. I'm absolutely up for a Caine movie.,2023-04-28 23:52:51
"Does anyone know what that move is called that John used a couple times, where he lays on his back in front of his opponent, his legs straight, feet on the opponent's hips, to keep them out of range? 

He did it in Osaka, then again against Mr. Nobody in the apartments. Mr. Nobody countered, though -- flung John's feet away when John tried it on him. 

Move name and/or fighting style / martial arts name would be great. I thought maybe jiu-jitsu.",2023-05-01 03:23:11

"So one thing I didn't get, how did the blind guy get everything he wanted? As far as I can tell the duel rules went like this: the duel is to the death, you need to a have a ""second"" standing by, if you win both you and your ""second"" get your demands met, if you lose you die and your second gets executed along with you. Blind guy and John were dueling, bad guy (blind guy's second) tags in at the very end to do the coup de grace because he wants to be the guy to kill John, gets shot and loses. Doesn't that mean the entire blind guy/bad guy team loses, and that blind guy is supposed to be executed? At the very least, I don't see why he'd get his demands met when he's on the losing team. Or was he just let off the hook from being in the duel altogether when bad guy tagged in, and bad guy dying also just automatically absolved him all debt since that's who his debts were to?",2023-05-05 18:14:37

"I finally got around to watching it. This one, moreso than any other John Wick movies, felt completely like watching a FULL GAME WALKTHROUGH NO COMMENTARY. Like there were clear levels, boundaries, tiered henchmen with palette swaps, quick time events, cutscenes, etc. 

The most video gamey one (nope, not the top down shooter view) was the car level where cars just kept driving through until John disposed of all the current enemies, and the level could go to the next cutscene where they finally stopped driving.

EDIT The choreography is fun as always, but in a campy way more this time than any before. Even though he does a lot of his own stunts, Keanu still moves like a 60 year old man, which is more noticeable in some of the more flexibility or agility requiring movements (specifically grappling movements on the ground). Also I stg no matter how much armor they have, or how well equipped they are, all the henchmen have the slipperiest soles on their shoes of all time. Everyone struggles to stand when hit, until the moment the current protagonist can get to them.",2023-07-24 14:02:06

The way the duel was introduced was excellent. Outside the first film, it was probably the best the series has been because it encapsulates the world of the films perfectly. John's only way out is to understand the complex and archaic rules that govern the world. And as soon as he understands them, the rules change seemingly on a whim. Just when he things he's got de Gramont right where he wants him to be, de Gramont forced Caine to fight on his behalf because of his unspoken ""right"" to do so. That's what made the ending so satisfying when Winston tells de Gramont how he got it wrong. >!I just wish the film had given him a moment longer to let his mistake sink in.!<",2023-03-25 12:25:23

I actually thought his name being Caine was a clever nod to Stick from Daredevil considering he is also a blind martial arts master. Then I saw others on here commenting how his name could be a reference to the Biblical story of Cain and Abel since he is tasked to kill his 'brother'.

The overhead in that stairwell was one of the most interesting shots I've seen in a movie in a long time.,2023-03-24 23:32:58
Was one of my favorite parts. I thought they did it really well,2023-03-24 23:37:37
And it brought back that hype night club shootout music from the first movie as well!,2023-03-25 01:48:26
there is a dub step type song that plays during that scene that i would love to know the name of. it sounds so familiar,2023-03-25 02:05:55
should check out the hospital clip from hard boiled- one of the longest takes out there,2023-03-25 20:56:31
"the way he falling from stairs is funny though, the marquise bodyguard is kind of disappointing not giving any impact despite appearing and positioning as major obstacle. probably the biggest flaw in this movie",2023-03-25 22:04:15
That was my favorite scene in the whole movie. I’m not the biggest fan of the John Wick films but I loved the cinematography in this one,2023-03-25 22:04:42
"Just witnessed this, now coming out of the theater. Early contender for favorite movie scene of the year. That was so fucking cool. People in my audience were whooping, me alongside them.",2023-03-26 00:06:56
Was is all CGI?,2023-03-26 00:18:44
By far the coolest scene i think I’ve ever seen in a action flick with only 1917’s line charge scene being a close second.,2023-03-26 00:39:15
legitimately blew my mind. I’d never seen anything like it.,2023-03-26 04:57:18
"It was spectacular, a reference to the Joh Wick Hex videogame perhaps. I loved they brought the song from John Wick 1 for that scene, the rave song.",2023-03-26 06:22:08
"This sequence is my favorite, not to mention probably one of the best well put together scenes in an action movie since...? My second favorite sequence is definitely Scott Adkins character at the poker/rave club.",2023-03-26 06:30:32
Felt like I was witnessing some movie history being made,2023-03-26 08:02:18
Hotline Miami scene,2023-03-26 15:31:49
Made me think of that super controversial Hatred game just because of the camera angle.,2023-03-27 00:38:33
"Loved that they used the ""Shots Fired"" track from the first movie in that scene",2023-03-27 13:18:45
"Like a lot of people have said, it was very very VERY Hotline Miami-looking and so freaking awesome.",2023-03-27 13:36:09
I absolutely loved that scene.,2023-03-27 21:31:30
Best fight in the movie too,2023-03-28 03:33:17

Hail to Chad stahelski.",2023-03-28 18:05:53
"My girlfriend who's not really into action films absolutely loved it and noticed that it was one take 

Sometimes, quality is definitely appreciated even if they're not the target audience",2023-03-29 00:20:38
Possibly the most iconic action sequence added with fire spitting shotgun!,2023-03-29 07:42:18
"It reminded me of competitive R6 Siege with the overhead

Absolutely beautiful",2023-03-29 18:19:25
Made better by the dragon fire shotty. Like watching csgo,2023-03-30 03:27:50
Yes I loved the way this was filmed. I wondered who was going to fall in the hole in the flòor,2023-03-30 12:35:43
I had a boner the entire time.,2023-03-31 19:36:52
As were the Arc de Triomphe and the stairs scenes. Three fantastic set pieces.,2023-04-01 12:25:33
yeah the God's Eye view is so amazing. Especially love that in Kill Bill: Vol. 1,2023-04-02 03:21:10
"If you watched close, he didn’t kill them.  He tried to incapacitate them.",2023-03-24 04:00:21
"I like how he doesn’t try to kill them in Japan, yet goes all in against the Marquis’ men",2023-03-24 12:53:21
"I thought he was planting small bombs.  Nope, just doorbells.  Brilliant.",2023-03-24 08:19:05
"I didn't realize those were doorbells when he was first setting them up. When the fight started and the first doorbell rang, I laughed out loud in the theatre. I think I was the only one who did.",2023-03-25 23:48:51
"My theater lost it during the stair scene too, my stomach hurt so much. Reminded me of the game “getting over it” which is why i laughed hella hard",2023-03-26 09:33:41
"I don't know if this was intentional. But he lowered his first doorbell, my thought was because Asians are short",2023-03-27 21:18:18
The Oscars really need to introduce a stunt award. Almost every mainstream movie these days has multiple fight scenes,2023-03-30 21:08:41
I was only disappointed that he didn't pick the doorbells up after he was done so he can potentially use them again elsewhere. That would have been an awesome detail.,2023-04-15 12:05:44
"Just watched and all I was thinking during the stairs scene was ""If I was a stunt-double for Keanu Reeves, I would have walked off the set after reading that stairs scene in the script"" lol.",2023-05-28 19:32:23
I couldn't stop thinking of the slinky scene from Ace Ventura when I saw that happen.,2023-04-09 04:25:55
That really was some video game shit where people would rage quit lol,2023-04-15 18:56:38

"Every JW movie has one of these and it's usually relatively early.

In JW1 it's during the nighttime raid on John's house when he breaks the dudes neck over the edge of his kitchen counter.

In JW2 it's in the catacombs when he pins the guy down with his shotgun barrel while reloading it, then blasts him without even moving.

In JW3 it's a tie between the library book kill and the guy who gets hit with twenty five throwing knives in ten seconds in the Knife Room scene. 

They always sneak one of the best kills in early to make you go *""oh fuck here we go""*",2023-04-23 04:27:54
This one guy in my theatre when crazy when that dude blocked the arrow with his arm and pulled it out,2023-03-28 19:53:39
He... took and arrow to the knee,2023-04-16 20:21:08

My theater went wild on that line. 10/10 delivery and comedic timing.,2023-03-24 03:36:28

So was Hiroyuki Sanada.",2023-03-24 12:21:14

"That line alone made we wish Donnie could be cast in a full on comedy, the timing abd delivery of that was absolutely perfect.",2023-03-24 13:36:14
"Donnie Yen was so great in the movie for me. Badass action, some great comedic lines and a lot of the dramatic stuff was really good.",2023-03-24 23:05:29
"Loved that and ""I am Klaus"" with the whip 😀",2023-03-25 08:54:51
"He crushed every line, his whole persona and physical acting was awesome, I loved his character. Lights out assholes",2023-03-25 07:49:21
"I really loved Donnies sassiness in this movie.  He usually doesn't get to portray that too often, he's usually stoic and tough, it really feels like he had a lot of fun in this movie.",2023-03-26 01:43:11
Cane's fighting style was the best.,2023-03-25 10:18:15
When you have important work to do and your asshole boss is micromanaging you,2023-03-25 14:16:25
Donne yen was both hilarious and awesome. His fight scenes were all great.,2023-03-25 00:42:08
">Caine's line of ""Fuck Off"" to Marchese was hilarious. Donnie killed that role. (and others)

>!By others, do you mean John?!<",2023-03-24 04:59:19
"When Caine went ""Pokkai Ham Ka Cham"", the threatres went wild here, in Singapore",2023-03-26 10:01:05
"Yeah, everyone in my theatre laughed hard at that line. And everyone cheered loudly when >!Winston pointed out that John had not shot Caine at all!<",2023-03-28 13:02:50
"Best moment was him winding up his punch in the hotel kitchen.

And double tapping every kill with his sword.  Donnie Yen is a treasure.",2023-03-29 01:56:06
He made some great changes to that character by bringing in more humor and sass since apparently originally the character was written more off a stereotypical stoic Asian assassin.,2023-03-27 15:34:31
"Donnie was just incredible all around


It’s wild how grounded they made him as a blind person and avoided going into superhero feats",2023-03-28 00:39:30
Donnie is a legend. Loved every scene he was in.,2023-03-26 01:50:51
That was so fucking appropriate too. Fuck if Caine was some sort of lacky of Marquis. That's exactly how I expected Caine to react being forced to kill a friend.,2023-03-27 09:27:11
"Donnie Yen was a fuckin monster in this one, every fight scene was so fluid. Great choice.",2023-03-29 10:32:40
"I was slightly annoyed to read he's super patriotic to the CCP, but I watch him for his acting and not politics so whatever. But he does think that Hollywood should bend to portraying Chinese a certain way.",2023-03-29 13:31:54
I loved him and that damn dog. This movie was spectacular.,2023-03-26 01:07:56
he killed it in the Berlin rave/club scenes literally and figuratively lol,2023-03-26 02:45:01
It is NEVER a surprise to me when Donnie is the best part of whatever movie he's in.,2023-03-27 15:07:43
Hes honestly so awesome in this! I mean Ana de Armas is cool and all but I honestly hope they would make a spinoff with Caine as the main character,2023-04-05 06:08:30
[deleted],2023-03-24 15:45:39
"Just saw it in theaters! What was Caine’s other line after kicking ass? Something like, “Lights out, muthafucka!”",2023-04-08 04:23:09
"Hopping on this comment: why did Caine duel Wick, and not Marquis? I thought Wick and Marquis were going to duel",2023-04-08 15:06:09
That was unexpected but long overdue,2023-04-09 14:45:05
I watched in in the theatre yesterday and everyone cracked up laughing at that line 😂,2023-04-15 07:06:17
How wick knew the marquis would take the final shot?,2023-05-09 04:36:00

"i saw it thursday night and had some idiot laugh at that scene and make fun of the fact he died . Never felt more enraged but so is life.  Other than that , that scene and the ending with donnie yen on the steps and the showdown was amazing",2023-03-24 06:34:20
"Almost cried when he repeated ""such is life"" back at Winston. So fitting that much of the movie is grieving and seeking revenge for his death. I did want him to live forever in the franchise, though.",2023-03-25 06:29:06
"Wish we had more of him in the movie, but it was also fitting considering what happened in real life.",2023-03-24 05:44:56
Same.,2023-03-24 02:35:53
The best part of the movie for me was Winston stopping by the painting of Charon and repeating his last words,2023-03-25 01:08:04
Most likely Lance’s final last words on screen :( besides the voicelines not used in Destiny 2 yet.,2023-03-26 17:44:56
Makes me wonder if Lance felt something was up in his life during filming and spoke to producers that he wasn't planning on participating in potential sequels,2023-03-24 03:01:58
"yeah, that was a bit tough to watch. was glad to see they were able to get in RIP in the credits on such short notice.",2023-03-26 04:58:37
"I was fully expecting him to have just as much of a role as the 3rd movie. His character was taken from us too soon, and it really made me realise that Lance was taken too soon as well.",2023-03-25 11:49:35
Most likely Lance’s final last words on screen :( besides the voicelines not used in Destiny 2 yet.,2023-03-26 17:45:07

 No I,2023-03-27 01:07:33
I also follow another ip where lance's character delivers a eulogy of sorts...then to see him die in this film that hurt...Rest I peace Lance.,2023-03-31 22:22:59
Fr. RIP,2023-04-01 21:24:20
"At the same time I do think they lucked out and that will the best we get for a proper goodbye and vengeance. If his character was still alive they'd have the issue Star Wars had with Carrie Fisher. As sad as it is to see Charon / Lance gone, at least they didn't Mary Poppins that shit.

Idk how they added it in post so quickly or maybe they somehow ""pushed an update"" to theaters, but at the end of the movie after the post credits there was a ""In memory to Lance Reddick"". I think it was very nice of them to add that in.",2023-04-03 05:14:23
Charon dying is when I knew Winston wasn't going to betray John again. Dude was furious.,2023-04-05 01:53:23

I haven’t seen a cop in these movies since the second one,2023-03-24 03:43:15
"There’s a moment when a van slides sideways and John is slammed into it. *Immediately* after that, there’s a wider shot as he’s getting up where you can see into the van and… there’s no driver. The driver’s side door isn’t even open like the driver decided to flee. There’s just no one, period. Weirdly, in any other movie, I’d be annoyed, yet the way civilian existence is treated in these movies is just one piece of the charm.",2023-03-24 09:04:55
I think you kind of just get used to it when 2/3 of the population are assassins.,2023-03-24 03:36:46

"Dancers became less aware of danger as the series progressed.

In John Wick 1, the club dancers freaked out when John started to execute bodyguards right beside them.

In 2, the crowd at the castle party cheered when John started killing people.

In 4, John was burying axes in heads, and the dancers didn't even react.",2023-03-26 03:05:48
The John Wick movies run on video game logic. The civilians in these movies are pretty much are like the NPCs in GTA.,2023-03-25 22:35:45

Also, a shootout in front of one of the most popular tourist attractions in the most tourist filled city in the world, at SUNRISE? Bro there would be road sweepers everywhere, the market would be setting up just down the road, it’s so silly but you can enjoy it because they lean so far into how silly it is.",2023-03-25 23:25:57

"The entire night club sequence, I wondered what kind of drugs would cause these people to keep dancing while JW be killing them MFs next to them",2023-04-22 08:16:10

They do react tho...people dispersed a few times in the sequels when they realize what is happening and people in the nightclub were visibly horrified when they noticed lol,2023-03-27 12:53:40
it felt like the background to a street fighter level,2023-03-28 19:31:12
"This is not our world, so I accept it for what it is.

I think they left it ambiguous intentionally. I have a feeling Lionsgate will want to milk this franchise and might push for a 5th but I really kind of want John Wick to just be at peace and end on a high note.,2023-03-24 02:31:38
I’d like for him to be dead because this felt like a good send off for the character.,2023-03-24 02:34:21
"I’d guess he’s still alive,  faking his death would be the only real way for him to stay gone without someone coming for him.     But I’m completely fine with him being dead it was never going to be a good end for Mr Wick.",2023-03-24 04:00:48
"I read a theory somewhere that  it looks like he was shot in the same “safe places” as where he shot the doctor in the last one.

And even the final scene made it look ambiguous, so that they can either end it there or choose to do JW5 later on.",2023-03-24 05:35:17
"He asked for his tombstone to say, ""John, loving husband"", not ""John Wick, loving husband"". In a different part of the movie they talked about how ""John Wick"" is a killer, and ""John"" is the person who has a peaceful life. In a movie where symbols are so important, I don't think this is just a coincidence. A tombstone for John Wick just means he really quit, and he is John now.",2023-03-25 18:26:37
"The dog perking up felt oddly like a way to show a scene in 5 with John watching... 

At the same time, Keanu is 60, can't have him doing this forever. What he did for this alone is incredible.",2023-03-25 01:33:40

"At the end Winston said, ""Where do you think he is? Heaven? Or Hell?""

And a part of me feels like Heaven and Hell are probably the names of two places in the JW universe. It would fit so perfectly.",2023-03-27 14:32:32

"If they bring back John that would invalidate his entire 4 movie arc. After returning to his old life in the first the next two films were solely about him being able to live and die as a loving husband rather than a legendary assassin. It would make no sense to have him live, he earned his greatest prize and got everything his character wanted",2023-03-25 09:50:49
He’s not dead,2023-03-28 15:29:19
"I don’t think that he is. I would think he would try to end the high council once and for all. Seems like an odd way to build 4 movies into him just getting his freedom and dying. I think there are plans for spin-offs so I can imagine a team being built, maybe John mentoring them, and then they go towards the high council.",2023-03-25 06:27:35
I saw a speculation where his tombstone represents him finally being free. He may still be alive.,2023-03-26 01:14:19
The next one could be “The Legend of John Wick” or something. Maybe prequels or maybe a new guy trying to live up to his legacy. Who knows.,2023-03-26 03:19:09
"I’d say 100%, saw an interview from Keanu and director they both insisted that the character are honest",2023-03-26 07:11:47

Idk Winston saying “who knows” and BK laughing his ass off makes me think they’re at least leaving it ambiguous,2023-04-07 20:04:12

You COULD NOT want either one of them to die, and that's where it was headed.  Also that cheeky little hand stab, c'mon, gotta love Caine.  Loved how they sorta escaped the scenario of having to kill each other, I didn't want a huge fight, I wanted them to get through this as brothers somehow.",2023-03-26 03:14:56

"For me it was Japan 

But then the arc de triomphe 

But then the house

But then the stairs 

But then the duel 

So… nearly every longer major action scene. 

The only extended battle setpiece that didn’t hit like an all-timer for me was the Berlin nightclub, and even still, that was a hugely entertaining scene.

I think Japan was the best overall though because of how many different things were happening and each done *so well*",2023-03-24 02:36:45
The dragon’s breath rounds were SO cool. And he kept grabbing clips off the dead dudes!!,2023-03-24 02:40:15
"Same. It’s hard to pick one. Each action sequence feels different and could easily be the highlight of any other action movie. 

Osaka has the best aesthetic, along with the most amount of weapons used, including swords, guns, bows, knives and even nun-chuck. 

Fighting in the middle of night traffic in Paris feels the most creative. Incorporating cars and oncoming traffic into a shoot out and hand to hand combat makes the fight feel brutal.

Shooting indoors with the overhead Hotline Miami cam is the most video-game like and something we didn’t know we need in a John Wick movie. 

The stairs fight is the most badass as we finally see John Wick and Caine teamed up. It’s the moment they built up the entire movie. My theater cheered when Caine showed up and helped John up the stairs. 

The final duel is the most stressful and tense, but also satisfying at the end. 

The only action sequence that felt “meh” in this movie was the Berlin club scene. Still a good sequence, but the previous movies did club scenes better. The rest of the action sequences are easily some of the best we have seen in the John Wick franchise and action movies in general.",2023-03-24 07:15:04
"The fluid shifts from thst top down, back down to closeups and then back up fro the ceiling was incredible.

During some similar shots in Malginant, they actually adapted an NFL stadium camera wire rig to zoom around. I wonder if something similar was used here.",2023-03-24 04:52:57

That was one of my favorite action sequences of all time. The way they transitioned to top down was super fly and the single take was just a cherry on the top. This is why I love this franchise so much,2023-03-25 06:02:38

"I’ll be the first to say: I love ‘em both to pieces, but it’s Mission: Impossible for me. Purely because I enjoy the spectacle of those films — elaborate chases of all kinds, big stunts, espionage — more than Wick’s, which is almost entirely gun fu shootouts. Don’t get me wrong, I love a good gunfight but it feels like Mission: Impossible can do what Wick does but Wick never does what Mission does. 

In the end, it’s like choosing between candy and ice cream. They both serve the same purpose, are done super well, and on different days im in a different mood for one or the other. They’re the obvious contender for best action films right now and it’s not remotely close. The merits of the comparison are only in how their different styles have different appeals.",2023-03-24 02:36:51

In another scene, after wringing out of being captured, the protagonist jumps in his damaged car, driving in a tight circle as he uses a pistol and the broken door as cover to shoot the captives around him. It's a memorable scene.

It likely wasn't homage at all, but those two scenes really stood out to me. *A Bittersweet Life* is also a gangster-turned-rogue story well worth the watch with some superb action scenes.

"> Speaking of Caine, I like the way his blindness does hinder him in some ways. 

I thought the biggest flaw there was how they made an obvious rip-off of Zatoichi and then they throw him into the middle of a fight scene where the lights go out... and that's *not a primary element of it*. I mean, that's such a staple of Zatoichi that they titled a film ""Darkness is my Ally"".

I feel like the better option would have been to start the fight between both groups without Caine. Partway through Koji's guys are able to rally and take control of the situation. They get the archers into an elevated position, they kill the lights, the Marquis' guys look like they are proper fucked... and then Caine shows up and just starts demolishing people since in the darkness they can't see him but *he doesn't need to see them*. Now that's a hell of an entrance.

In general I thought they relied too much on having him shoot people. He should have leaned much more heavily into the sword. Partly for more variety in the fights, but practically because it would be more tactile and better suited to him.",2023-03-26 20:38:30

">Alongside Mission: Impossible -- Dead Reckoning Part 1 (Jesus, that's a mouthful), this is one of two movies to release in 2023 to have a car chase with all the doors ripped off the car to clearly display **it's the actor doing their own driving.**

We'll have to wait for the BTS but I'd be *very* surprised if the driving was real at all.  Movies have had tons of ways throughout the years to ""cheat"" driving even beyond just using stunt doubles.  For example, a pretty common one is to have a rig either pulling the car on a modified trailer or having the ""real"" car be in front of the fake car that the star is ""driving"".  You can even mix up different types of ""cheats"" in this way so that the audience is shown all angles of the car during the scene, making it seem as real as possible.  While I didn't spot it in this movie, an easy tell from less choreographed/budgeted movie is when they only show the vehicle from the top of the wheels or higher.  When the scenes do this, the car is 100% being dragged or driven by a stunt driver on the front of it.  These scenes usually end with the camera pulling back to show the full car as ""proof"" for it being real even though none of the action showed anything.",2023-03-24 03:56:48
"> weirdly satisfying? It's like there's no other way this could have ended and makes the entire series into this impressively melancholic tragedy.

I personally needed to see this happen (storywise I mean, not like I hate John Wick) for there to be any weight to the action scenes. The guy was frankly too much of a one man army, which made for great spectacle but obviously removed *any* dramatic tension or weight...and then the ending of the film happened and it retrospectively made it all worth it and better because it showed that there is a price to what's happening and everything that happened previously actually added up.",2023-03-26 17:34:41

">Warriors homage

A shocking amount of this movie was made out of shots/references to other iconic moments in media. Off the top of my head:

* The Lawrence of Arabia transition at the start, which actually had me laugh out loud

* The first shots in Osaka with the cymbal are too similar to the shots and score from the River boat scene in Ghost in the Shell

* That bit from the Warriors you mentioned 

* an extended top-down house clearing with multiple different types of weapons set to blaring techno music a la Hotline Miami

I’m sure there’s a lot more, the movie wears its influences on its sleeve. The last bit of John walking down the stairs in front of the church was straight out of the last episode of Cowboy Bebop, which Keanu Reeves has mentioned as a favorite of his for years.",2023-03-26 04:15:00
I feel like Reeve's wooden performance was exacerbated by the fact that Donnie Yen is so fucking charismatic. Every time he was on screen I was thinking I'd rather just keeping watching him casually hit people with his stick instead of cutting back to John.,2023-03-25 19:21:23
"I think Keanu should've leaned into the angry growl his voice had at the end of 3/that part in 1 where he's explaining to Viggo why killing his dog was so devastating to him but I disagree, the scene at the church shows he could still emote like in the other films.",2023-03-24 04:09:15
"I get the feeling that someone in a test audience for the first film really, *really* liked it when Keanu turned to the cameras and said “yeah…” in the graveliest, lowest tone manageable, and so it appears every 5 minutes.",2023-03-24 21:43:32
"Keanu in general seems to be acting that way more and more. I'd thought he's just always sounded like that until I went back and watched some of his older movies lately. He was never exactly a generational talent, but man, it's really noticable how stiff and wooden he's gotten lately. I almost have to wonder if something is going on with him behind the scenes health wise tbh, though I hope not.",2023-03-28 02:05:23
"That's not his natural speaking voice. He lowers it to an absurd degree. Like Mark Sinclair, I mean ""Vin Diesel"" does. That's why he comes off as insincere and unnatural when he speaks. While Keanu Reeves may be a great movie star, he's quite limited as an actor.",2023-03-28 03:40:19
"He was kinda like that in Matrix 4 as well. Honestly I don't think Keanu's heart is in the dialogue anymore, he's just interested in producing cool action.",2023-03-24 20:14:21
">One criticism I did have was that this is probably Keanu’s worst performance as John. The way he delivered lines felt like an alien speaking English for the first time. Very odd. 

Why has nobody said this for the past 6 years? This performance has mostly been the same for two prior films so by this point I've sorta gotten used to it.",2023-03-25 00:15:26
"To be fair, Wick really doesn't have a lot of personality to work with, so there isn't a lot Keanu can do with those lines.",2023-03-24 13:45:38
">One criticism I did have was that this is probably Keanu’s worst performance as John. The way he delivered lines felt like an alien speaking English for the first time. 

When we came out of the theatre, I said to my friends ""it was like he was constantly doing a Keanu Reeves impression, or like he was a recent stroke victim"".",2023-03-26 05:36:47
">One criticism I did have was that this is probably Keanu’s worst performance as John. The way he delivered lines felt like an alien speaking English for the first time. Very odd.

Sounds like typical Keanu Reeves to me lol.",2023-03-26 05:54:56
"I know what you mean but I feel like it kind of worked in a weird way? That ""Yeah... not really"" line from the trailers is a perfect example",2023-03-24 13:10:46
I would like to see how many words he actually spoke.,2023-03-25 05:24:46
"I loved that it ended at that church, it was built as a final insult to those who died fighting for the Paris Commune.",2023-03-24 04:39:07
Thank you for mention Warriors,2023-03-24 23:00:26
I noticed that too. Dunno if its an intentional choice but some line readings were unintentionally hilarious.,2023-03-25 00:49:13
">As of right now that entire action sequence in the Arc de Triomphe is the one to beat this year. That whole section was spectacular.

The thing that makes it work is the way it's intercut with the radio broadcast. The tempo of the sequence changes to fit the tempo of the next song.",2023-03-25 12:29:29
The radio station had callsign WUXIA as well.,2023-03-25 18:55:16
His dialogue has gotten more and more like that as the movies have gone on. Personally I love it. It's kind of cheesy and campy and I like that they're leaning into it. You know its on purpose because he said yeah like 3 times in a row that one time.,2023-03-27 14:25:47
"Some of the dialogue is just not good in the franchise.

""Tell them. Tell them all. Whoever comes, whoever it is. I'll kill them. I'll kill them all""

So much bad repetition. There's a version of that line which is much much cleaner",2023-03-27 15:15:34
"The Warriors bit was funny because I thought it was going to be a one-off reference, but they kept going back to the DJ to the point where the movie just became The Warriors for about 30 minutes. 

And the fact that so few people here seemed to have gotten the reference tells me that we’re overdue for a Warriors remake/sequel/re-release",2023-03-29 17:35:58
He sounded like Dooley from King of the Hill most of the time.,2023-03-24 04:50:28
Keanu is like that in literally everything he’s in. On d you accept that it’s fine.,2023-03-25 18:13:19
">One criticism I did have was that this is probably Keanu’s worst performance as John. The way he delivered lines felt like an alien speaking English for the first time. Very odd.

I was worried for his health",2023-03-27 04:52:42
Yeah his dialogue felt like a parody of itself. They left a lot of meat on the bone for more of an emotional connection with him until he mentioned his wife at the end. Other than that fun movie though.,2023-04-01 05:30:04
"I think Keanu is just playing to the audience. I read that he deliberately cut out more and more lines from John Wick as the movies progressed. His laconic and deadpan delivery adds to the movie's tone so well. Personally, I loved how stupid it sounded because it's becoming more and more self aware.",2023-04-02 15:59:19
"The way he delivered lines felt like an alien speaking English for the first time.

this was actually one of my favorite things. Look at boxers after a match. They are tired and it's hard to make words. It feels more real to me.",2023-04-10 00:33:20
"The way I interpreted it is that he was just tired (the character, not the actor.)",2023-05-12 06:49:16
Isn't John supposed to be autistic?,2023-03-24 22:20:01
"I honestly liked 2 and 3 more but they’re all amazing and I can see easy arguments for each. 

2 and 3 had more unique memorable sequences with the horse, ninjas on motorcycles, the catacombs opt out, the crazy throwing knife fight etc.",2023-03-26 20:44:42
Yh apparently he only spoke 300 words in the whole film. As a lead that's crazy. Alot of his lines were very predictable too,2023-03-28 23:16:01
Cause he's been beat so bad,2023-03-29 00:09:13
Frogger: The Paris Edition.,2023-03-30 02:28:39
Keanu is more bubbly than the character is (not by a ton but still). I get Wick being somber and not giving a shit about saying much. All the shit and death that’s happened around him I don’t blame him at all.,2023-04-01 01:00:33
Keane is getting old,2023-04-02 11:01:53
"At firs I honestly thought the Arc de Triomphe sequence was the best action sequence (cinematography wise) Ive ever seen, but then came the apartment sequence… 

OMG how is it possible for a movie to be this good??!",2023-04-05 06:22:07
"that line about ""and he's going to kill you"" or whatever to the marquis would've gone so hard if he delivered it better",2023-10-20 23:28:10
"The four action sequences that closed the film- Arc de Triomphe, Hotline Paris, Stairway to Heaven and the Western duel- were all god-tier",2023-03-25 14:11:16
I really hope he’s truly dead and they don’t make it like he faked his death. Perfect ending to the series,2023-03-24 03:24:21
"Mr Krabs worked for the High Table all along, I knew it!",2023-03-24 03:06:47
"I love that the blindness wasn't just hand-waved as pure Daredevil-esque mysticism, but he clearly had adapted in practical ways.",2023-03-24 15:50:17
"They added little details to his blindness that I liked. At one point, he runs out of ammo and if you pay attention to his hands, he’s shoving his finger into the  locked open slide of his gun to verify that the chamber and mag are both empty.",2023-03-25 06:39:08
">the Osaka fight…fantastic seeing new fighting styles and weapons (lots of blades and bow/arrows.

You can tell Chad Stahelski cut his teeth as a stuntman and second unit director. He has an excellent understanding of how to stage, pace and shoot complex action sequences without losing momentum or risking the audience getting lost.",2023-03-25 12:32:36
What do you mean it would be crazy in the real world? I know a lawyer who can’t see and does stuff like that all the time.,2023-03-24 08:24:55
"I just saw it.  I'd say it was the best of the sequels.  I did like Donnie Yen's character.  He was such an efficient killing machine.  Also, the way he played Caine was just done in such a way, that I felt sympathy for him by the end of the film, and I felt like I didn't want to see either him or Wick die.",2023-03-28 04:57:55
A fifth movie was greenlit in 2020 so I don't think he's really dead,2023-03-27 14:35:27

"The set design, lighting, cinematography/camera work and color grading all combined to create one of the greatest action films of all time. 

Comparing it to the first film, you definitely can tell the craft and budget went up 100 whole notches. Love how far we've come.",2023-03-27 07:12:04
The Japan shots with the cherry blossom trees were so good.,2023-03-30 03:29:44
"When he gets out of the car, I was like boo, is that all of the song we get?
But then he gets back IN the car, and the music booms again!!",2023-03-25 14:21:40

"Yes, I was impressed by that. Like damn he's prepared",2023-03-24 11:19:54
"Not only he tried to stab Killa with a card, he then proceeds to throw the card at another dude",2023-03-24 16:04:11
"During the stairway scene, he disassembled a pistol and I thought he was gonna yeet the parts at dudes. Nope he stabs 2 guys with it lol",2023-03-26 15:03:34
">I love how it shows he makes anything he can into a weapon

He killed with a pencil. A Pencil! I mean what kind of guy does that?",2023-03-30 08:07:28
At this point he’s that ben pointdexter dude from daredevil who’s deadly with any object with his 100% YEET accuracy,2023-03-25 19:48:44
He threw so many things at so many people. I'm pretty sure I counted 4 pistols straight to the head.,2023-04-01 22:55:58

"Thank god there was no connection, that'd be cheap, his character was really cool already and a connection would be unnecessary.",2023-03-24 04:49:59
I feel like they teased it. The dog made me think of some connection to Halle Berry’s character.,2023-03-24 04:16:21
I strongly got the impression that he's not part of high table bullshit. He's some elite ex-military dude freelance bounty Hunter who studied the High Table system from the outside and dealt himself in so he could hunt high-value targets.,2023-03-27 14:11:57
"Thats why theres gotta be a JW5 imo, him + Rina’s character, there will be more for sure. A lot of people will think JW isnt dead",2023-03-24 02:51:21

Every time I saw him he reminded me of the Lone Wanderer from *Fallout*.,2023-03-25 22:31:32
I thought he was going to be Charons son,2023-03-24 03:56:05
in my mind he's Halle Berry's son or something.,2023-03-26 04:28:06
I feel like in terms of characters who warrant a spinoff he’s definitely up there for me. Loved every second of his character.,2023-03-24 06:45:14
"Nope, he was entirely superfluous to the entire movie. I got the impression it was just an excuse to have a dog in the movie.",2023-03-25 22:33:02
"I liked this character, but if he was that good with tracking he should know it all started because of the dog, so he has no interest in killing Wick as a fellow good-boy fan.",2023-03-27 08:46:16

Yep just like how everybody thought the third was going to be the last and then it ended with a setup for 4.,2023-03-24 09:56:33
I feel similarly! This series has so much life (where most action films run into the ground as a trilogy) that there’s no way they don’t revisit it time and time again — with the advances in AI deaging it’s not prohibitive to do more backstory behind old friends.,2023-03-24 04:11:56

Okay glad I'm not going through these comments thinking I'm crazy. Google said 4 and 5 were shot at the same time. Really hope he's dead because its a solid end to the story,2023-04-16 04:22:45

"The only films that come close to this level of cinematic carnage I can think of off the top of my head are John Woo's Hard Boiled and The Killer, and The Raid 2. Easily the best action movie I've seen in a cinema, every gunshot felt like a punch and the size and scale of the action was unparalleled on the big screen. Every successive sequence tops the previous one, and any out of Osaka, Berlin or any individual section of Paris could be the grand finale of 99% of action films and be an improvement. First movie this year I think I'm going to see a second time",2023-03-25 06:55:13

I think there's several things to nitpick -- but it can still be a 10/10 with the understanding that not every 10 is at the same ceiling. I think the *biggest* issue is the lack of emotional stakes. But as pure action it's hard to imagine something better, and they do such a good job making each fight seem distinct at least in terms of location, and this is by far the best balance of lore and action, as you said.

> The conundrum of Wick has always been, how do you keep topping them, how far will they go, how much can you defy the table and still live if they're so powerful? And in the respect of all those questions, I absolutely loved how this series wrapped up. I'm not saying it's impossible to bring Wick back, but if this is truly how his story ends I think it's a fantastic end.

Hell, the film even begins with Wick being handed his “invulnerability suit”, and then he spends half the fights running around pretending to be Dracula with his jacket over his face. None of the bullets even have weight until they get to massive shotgun slugs. It kind of cheapens the action, in my opinion.

I enjoyed the movie but I think you definitely make some valid points,2023-03-24 04:25:03
"Honestly, I'm so glad I sorted by controversial and found your comment. You have summed up my exact feelings walking out of the theater. I rewatched John Wick 1-3 last week before seeing Chapter 4, and I remember distinctly walking out of 3 feeling upset at the ending. The fact that the writers wanted us to believe John survived such an extreme fall was just too much for a franchise that had always taken itself very seriously when it comes to showing the physical toll these fights taken on our main character.

John Wick Chapter 4 doubles down on these over-the-top injuries that John walks away from without a scratch. I don't even understand what it adds to the story. In previous movies, the amount of physical abuse he's taken has been for a purpose or at the very least is used to show us the struggle he endures along the way to reach his goals. It also was used to show us more of the world building, the Continental having an in-house doctor, or the doctor being bound by the rules and having to stop mid-surgery when John is cut off from its services. In this movie, it’s used for no reason other than… well I can’t even think of a sarcastic reason. There was no point to have John be hit by MULTIPLE cars at full speed, or jump out of a 3rd story window and bounce off a car. Hell, even the dog gets hit by a car at full speed and bounces off without any injuries. John is kicked down probably 10 flights of stairs in a row and stands up like he’s fine. It's just too disconnected from what we have established before and doesn't actually do anything for the story. The suits are apparently magic in this movie. In Chapter 2, John and Cassian shoot each other while both wearing bullet proof suits and they both fall backwards to the ground in pain. In this movie, people are hit with bullets that just ricochet off of their suit. I’m willing to accept bullet proof suits, I’m not willing to accept that the person wearing it is 100% unaccepted by the impact.

In terms of story continuity, I feel like this one is extremely disconnected from 1-3. We ended 3 with John wanting revenge on the High Table after they had sent an Adjudicator to kill anyone and everyone who had ever aided John along the way. Winston even shot John Wick off the roof to momentarily appease the Adjudicator. Yet she makes no appearance in this movie and isn’t even mentioned. I understand she was just acting on behalf of the High Table, but so were many before her, all of which John has taken personal revenge on. Instead, John goes directly to the Elder (which isn’t even the same Elder) to get his ring back (which he doesn’t even get). Based on Chapter 3 I would have assumed this movie was going to show John going against the High Table directly in an attempt to dismantle the entire system, but apparently being told that they will just get replaced is all it took for John to give up on that quest, even though he’s NEVER given up on anything else that has seemed impossible. It’s disappointing that instead of going after the High Table itself, we were given a villain who is in a position we’ve never heard of before, The Marquis. This guy has a rank and title which are meaningless to the viewer, and honestly quite confusing how he is connected to the High Table and what his purpose is. Had the movie been about John working his way to The Elder to issue the challenge of a duel, that would at least make more sense and conclude the story in a meaningful way.

The Tracker was the most pointless character in the entire movie. He accomplishes nothing in the movie, his goals and allegiances flip-flop for no real reason, and his presence changes nothing in the story. He tells John Wick that he intends to kill him for a bounty but it’s not high enough… and John just walks away from him letting him live. That is extremely hard to believe. John has killed colleagues who made it clear they were going to try to kill him. Why would John let some unknown guy survive who had just threatened him? The Tracker then meets the Marquis and makes a deal with him, even going as far as pulling his hand through a blade to make an agreement. An agreement which is ultimately just an open contract for any one to claim. He is found by the Killa's henchmen and BROUGHT to the table. Why would this gang let a stranger into the same room as their boss and John Wick? They have no idea who he is, but he has a gun and a dog. So they let him and the dog in? Then he is present for basically every fight scene doing pointless and unnecessary things that don’t add anything to the plot. He then ends the movie by sitting down and watching the duel and even taking a drink when everyone else does, yet no one acknowledged him or even cared that he was there, because he didn’t even have to be there. And his dog was used the EXACT same way as Sophia’s dogs. It feels lazy to use the same trick and attacks we already saw way too many times in the previous movie. He felt so disconnected, even his attire and acting felt like it belonged in a different movie. I’m sure they included him to create a spinoff series or film, but I’m not interested.

The Fat Guy villain (I finally looked up his name, Killa… how original) and all the scenes around him were shockingly bad. Overacted, unbelievable fat suit, and an extremely long and pointless scene with a poker game which led to nothing. Why have a hand of poker decide things if he was going to cheat anyway? John could have used the playing cards without the long drawn out poker scene. It was useless to the overall plot. In fact, why did his “family” send him in to kill Killa as a hostage? This seemed like a PERFECT opportunity to get a great John Wick hunting scene. Showing him gearing up, plotting his attack, and executing the plan, much like Chapter 2. We only got to see that once and I think that would have been a much more interesting plot to follow than just walking him in and seeing him fight his way out. We have seen that so many times before. The fights outside in the club were a bit more interesting, but I don’t even understand why Killa was originally running away scared from John, but then decides to fight him. I feel like they just wanted to recreate that scene from the first John Wick in the club, but it doesn’t work if Killa ultimately fights John moments later. I also don’t understand why sometimes the people in the club were concerned about the fighting and killing, and then other times they were just dancing around it. It was hard to stay immersed when realistically the crowd probably would have ran away fairly early on.

And can we talk about that radio station? I think it’s dumb that they were stationed in the Eiffel Tower, but whatever… And fine… apparently there is a “secret” radio station that EVERYONE knows to listen to for information. And yeah ok, they somehow constantly have John Wick’s location ready to broadcast everywhere he goes. But why the hell do we need to have this stupid voice over telling the “boppers” to go get him every 2 or 3 minutes to break up the fights? I get it, it's a Warriors reference, we don't need it 6 times within 10 minutes. Why even have a radio station? Sending the bounties to cell phones was established for the first 3 movies. It was kind of the John Wick THING. The phones all go off and John knows something is going on and suspects anyone with a phone buzzing.

The duel itself being a challenge of pistols was a pretty disappointing choice, seeing as John primarily used a pistol for the ENTIRE movie. You’d think having Donnie Yen as the challenger, the obvious choice would be hand-to-hand combat. We saw some of the quick punches Caine used in the Osaka fight scene, which looked amazing, yet never got to really see him highlight one of his greatest skills as a martial artist.

Finally, John’s “death” seems so pointless in the grand scheme of the story. Why was he ok with dying at this moment? What did he accomplish that he would feel ready for death? He killed the Marquis… someone who, up until a few days ago, he didn’t even know existed? He issued this duel to gain his freedom, and then was ready to die in the duel after winning the duel? The entire movie John is told these people just get replaced, so what did it accomplish? Was it to allow Caine to live? Why? He knows Akira is going to go after him for vengeance, making a sacrifice for Caine pointless. And John has previously killed friends or colleagues who were trying to kill him. He has always killed anyone to survive. John’s entire motivation in Chapter 3 was to continue living to remember his wife. Why now, would he be at peace with death?

It’s hard to feel satisfied when there are so many issues with plot and motivations throughout the movie. I suspect many people who say this was the “best one” either don’t follow the story, or don’t care. But one of the things that made me such a fan of this franchise was its attention to details, and the attempt to make everything seem somewhat believable. This one didn’t even seem to focus at all on reloads. I don’t want this franchise to be a Fast and Furious style franchise where every movie gets more and more ridiculous until John Wick is shooting people on the moon. I like the grounded, gritty, secret nature of the lore and world building. This movie was the definition of style over substance in my opinion. I won’t deny the amazing cinematography throughout, and some scenes were done rather well, but I don’t think the story warranted such a long run time and ultimately the fighting didn’t overcome a very messy and pointless story. I’m glad others enjoyed it, but I wonder if they just haven’t seen a John Wick movie recently. Watching this one after recently watching 1-3, the dip in quality is very obvious, from the fight choreography to the story, acting, and special effects. This one was very subpar for even a standard action movie, let alone part of a franchise with such a high bar for quality.",2023-03-26 01:57:45
"Agree with all this. Almost no one in the thread is talking about the dodgy CGI. The cars in the arc de triomphe section pulled me right out of the movie, but the worst offender was the duel. It looked so bad, you could tell the actors weren't actually there, all of the shots were blatantly composites. And the writing was very poor, I don't even understand why Clancy Brown just called it a day and gave him his freedom at the end. Still enjoyed it overall but action movies like Mad Max Fury Road and The Raid 2 are in a different league",2023-03-26 20:27:47
"I respect your opinions, I really do, and I agree with a lot of your points about the film. But I do want to play a bit of devil’s advocate here for the sake of some fun. 

The plot felt different because it had to be. Despite reasons you’ve mentioned for the spin-offs, it’s established early on that John killing the High Table accomplishes nothing. “Hercules had his Hydra, you have your High Table.” John knows this, so he pivots in his revenge mission against the Table. It’s also clear that John is trying to find a way to conclude the madness, or return the chaos unleashed from the Pandora’s Box after killing Santino in the Continental. Initially he thought killing the Table would do it but realizes that it won’t do anything. Instead he has to reset the status quo of the Table to a less chaotic time. Almost a “killing the idea of the Table” thing instead of literally killing them. Conversely that’s what the Marquis is trying to do with Wick, kill the idea of Wick so the Table’s overstretched authority remains unchallenged. 

I also see a lot of complaints about why John went to Osaka. It’s told early on that John has about 2-3 friends in the world he would trust with his life, and Koji Shimazu was one of them. It’s not exactly a stretch for Caine to predict that John would go to Osaka. Coupled with the shared history between Caine, John and Shimazu and it’s more believable. As for Shimazu continuing to fight Caine, it was simply out of loyal friendship to John. “Friendship means little when it is convenient.” If only everyone had a friend like Shimazu. 

Speaking of that, the theme of family is pervasive in the movie. Shimazu orphaned his daughter out of loyalty to a friend. John re-ingratiated himself with the Ruska Roma, his adoptive family. Caine’s very deliberate naming implies that he will, and does, kill his brother, to save his daughter. Winston’s last words to John’s gravestone were “Farewell, my son.” Not sure if all this means anything, just interesting to note. 

So anyways, creative and design choices aside, I don’t think the plot is as leaky as people are making it to be. Is it as strong as the other movies? Absolutely not. But it’s also not grievously bad either. It’s serviceable for what the movie is. 

Cheers.",2023-03-28 12:51:47
"I hated how they overused the bulletproof suits, made many scenes feel repetitive and too long.

They wanted to conclude the series yet added enough characters and unfinished plotlines to make multiple spinoffs.

"I think you’re totally right. The movie was bloated and needed editing, badly. 

The biggest WTH for me was that no one thought to have Caine be the one with the service/attack dog, and having him be the one conflicted trying to buy his way out or whatever would have been *way* more compelling than this random tracker guy whose storyline and motivations were super unresolved. We didn’t need *two* father/daughter storylines either. Just trim Caine’s and give him the dog.

Also, it was so unclear why Caine would kill all the Osaka Continental folks if he was only there to hunt John Wick. Why not just give us a scene of John and Komi fighting side by side against Caine and the dog? 

And later, if we could’ve had John spare Caine’s dog, the “you owe me” sequence would’ve hit so differently, too.",2023-03-29 12:28:26
"I know I’ll get downvoted for this but I agree with everything you said. I liked John Wick 1 because it was tight as hell. It was only slightly over 90 minutes and they didn’t waste a second of it, and it wasn’t ‘turn your brain off’ action, it was deliberate and details mattered. If I wanted over the top, nonsensical and consequence-free, I’d watch a Fast & Furious film.

There were absolutely points where I enjoyed the cinematography and the spectacle, like the overhead scene, but these were exceptions. Several fight scenes felt interminable - apparently the supply of faceless goons in Paris is beyond measure, and they’ll happily throw themselves forward to have a go at John despite his reputation (wasn’t the first film about how no one will fuck with him?) and his now literal invincibility. It got to the point where John bounced down the Sacre Coeur steps, seemingly making it impossible for him to reach the duel before sunrise, and I could hear Ryan George in my head whispering ‘super easy, barely an inconvenience’.",2023-03-24 07:42:14

My main gripe was the film's length. The Berlin club scene was unnecessary and should have been cut. Also, while I did laugh at John falling back down the stairs and having to fight his way back up them, I think the scene also needed cutting. It felt like a bit of a let down after the top-down Dragon's Breath sequence, which should have been the final action scene before the duel.",2023-03-24 23:54:03
"i must say, Caine (Donnie Yen's Rogue One) character, with his fighting, reminded me too much of [Blinkin from Robin Hood and his fight scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jyS5uXQer0). He felt like a character from some parody. What is the point of him not seeing if his hearing isnt improved? When he, in Japan, looks for John, John replies, like a meter away, and Caine doesn't even know where the sound is coming from. And he seems to see everything anyway. Why not keep him normal, instead of pushing it this far? It is a cool idea, but it didnt made much sense, imo. It really felt like Blinkin came for a visit from a parody movie and they took him too seriously.

And John survived. so. much. It felt without weight in the end when we dont even know what can be fatal for John and what can't. Is being shot into the arm a big deal or not? He can survive falling from heights without problems, he can survive being hit by a cars multiple times without a problem.. what can one bullet in the arm mean anyway? He walked off worse than that, so why should we be too bothered.",2023-03-26 17:30:13

Absolutely worthless.",2023-03-26 15:42:14
"I understand your criticisms of the movie, but I think you're ignoring that the other movies of the franchise had very similar issues. 

John has always gotten fucked up from fights and then miraculously heals for the next fight. The laws of the High Table have always been extremely convoluted. Are we really supposed to believe that there are hundreds of assassins in that park when he's talking with Winston? What about the ridiculous shootout scene with Compton in the subway station? John's motivation to keep fighting was complete dogshit in the third movie. Keanu looks awful in some of the fights of the third movie, he was honestly giving me Steven Seagal vibes during the final fight with the two south Asian guys. Even the first movie, which seems to generally be considered the best out of the 4 movies, is a very cliche and predictable action movie, plot wise. Some of the dialogue is hilariously bad (don't get me started with Viggo...). It would be a footnote on Keanu's career if it wasn't for the brilliant action scenes and the impeccable aesthetic.


But overall my point is that the John Wick franchise has always been about Keanu killing people in semi-realistic ways, while looking as cool as possible. It's most definitely a ""style over substance"" franchise. And that's perfectly fine! Not all movies need to follow real world logic.
It's by far my favorite action movie franchise, and the fourth is probably my favorite out of the 4. It doesn't make any less sense than the other movies, imho. And most of all, it is ridiculously entertaining from start to finish. It has the best action scenes. And it is still beautifully shot, scored and directed.

It sucks that you didn't enjoy it, but I agree with almost everything that has been said about the movie, online. It's a brilliant movie, that I see myself revisiting again and again.",2023-03-31 23:10:20
"> the 30 million bounty is null

I found this chapter of John Wick pretty corny, for many of the reasons you listed.  The dollar amount of the bounty on Wick being one of the biggest.  The High Table, the Continentals, all of it throughout the entire franchise has been nothing short of opulent.  It oozes generational wealth, like they've been running things and making money for centuries.  And their bounty for killing the biggest threat in the world is a measly 20 million that gradually gets increased throughout the film.  It felt like Dr. Evil demanding *one million* dollars in that Austin Powers scene.  A much larger dollar amount would make more sense to me, but so would using some of their in-universe currency.  Coins and markers have been the big currency in the Wick universe, then all of a sudden we just switch to USD mattering out of nowhere.",2023-04-10 02:51:20

This movie turned those up a notch but didn’t break those previously established rules.

If this movie directly followed JW1, I’d agree it would have felt absolutely jarring. But imo it’s not fair to just forget everything that’s been established in 2 and 3 to knock this movie.",2023-04-24 04:32:12

Yep pretty much my thoughts. Was rewatching some clips from John Wick 1 after seeing chapter 4 and its kind of shocking how much has changed since the series first started. In the first movie the action is just so much more tight and the dialogue although nothing special is witty and quick. Felt like all of the dialogue and acting in chapter 4 made me wince and cringe a lot.,2023-04-03 16:56:03
"Man, I had to scroll way too far to find a critical comment, and yours was excellent and put my thoughts perfectly into words. 

I think this is the movie where they jumped the shark. John just takes too much damage and shrugs it off, he is some sort of side kick throughout the first half and we watch random people who we don't care about fighting, the armored suits and henchmen are just too convenient and we have to believe that a blind man makes through it alive, even winning a duel. And yes, the overall ridiculousness of the Arc de Triomphe scene, with driverless cars driving at 80 km/h non stop at a roundabout while there are tens of bodies on the street... Please. Too much farfetched action. Finally, they add Mr nobody to the plot, who was just useless, except offering some more K9 action. In the end he just watches the duel as a spectator somewhere alone, and then the dog shows up and pees on the body like they where there all the time. 

That said, I liked the western-style ending with the duel, and I hope they don't pull a Fast and Furious and resurrect him from the grave.",2023-04-07 06:53:44

"Finally saw this movie today - I loved it and thought it was a great action movie but I mostly agree with all of the points you made, especially the egregious CGI during the Arc De Triomphe sequence and the terrible green screening in the burned out continental and duel scenes. Oh and also how nothing narratively makes sense lol

I saw somebody say this movie is supposedly the originally planned Part 4 and Part 5 mashed into one, which might not be true but it's a great way to describe how it feels. It's as if they had only the important narrative scenes from one film but the filler from two, with a lot of missing context (why is John in the desert at the beginning just to kill a different elder? how is John teleporting around the world? why does the Harbinger not explain what Caine being ""nominated"" actually means during the meeting, unlike every other rule? it is never explained why John goes to Japan just to leave on his own anyways???). And then the duel has the really strange and over dramatic writing, the tracker being in a weird closeup shot and in none of the wides and John slowly walking down the stairs alone while Winston just stands there after telling John he'll take him home.

But yeah, despite the dialogue driven scenes being boring and sluggish and the few weird visual choices, the action and cinematography (wow is this a pretty movie) are so engaging and give my monkey brain lots of dopamine. Also I loved the bit where he fell down the stairs

> What's the point of John winning and liberating himself in such a specific way if he's gonna 'die' afterward?

Probably just the idea of John becoming a saint and showing that you can actually leave the High Table. 

> Who is the tracker character exactly?

I assumed the tracker character was the son of the concierge, makes sense cause of their love for dogs and that he is hunting John Wick down to get at the people who killed his father.

> Why does Wilson just let John pass out/bleed out on the stairs after he just said he'd help him get home? There is literally no one around as he's dying.

Yeah this part seemed weird as well, I just assumed John just wanted to rest a bit and then Winston will get some doctors to come patch him up and then bring him back to New York.

What about staying alive to keep the memory of his wife and those who died alive with him?

"I just got around to watching the movie and i was shocked to find so few complaints. Your write up is very similar to my thoughts. Like, yes, I enjoyed most of the movie (especially the top down scene in Paris)  but I was highly disappointed by many parts as well. 

The Osaka fight broke my suspension of disbelief so many times with the bulletproof armor- a couple of the scenes people were getting knocked around when shot even if they weren't injured and then seconds later some dude in a magic bulletproof suit isn't even flinching while bullets bounce off of him??

And yeah, the tracker felt completely pointless. Obviously just in the movie to include a dog. 

And the complete lack of any thing to do with actually attacking the high table... The summary of the movie on Amazon says its about finding a path to defeat the high table... John just apparently died basically killing the high table's dog! 

Definitely nowhere near as good as I was hoping from all the praise.",2023-08-26 20:10:11

Bulletproof suits was a novel idea in JW2 when it was only John who used them, now that everyone uses them it's too much. I liked the fully armored soldiers from JW3 and the armored samurai in JW4, I thought they were really unique bad guys, but they sort of became redundant when you realise the full armor isn't needed and they can just wear bulletproof suits.

I agree about the top-down sequence. It was the best action scene in the film. I loved the logistics of it. It was just cool seeing an action scene from that kind of perspective. Normally it's up close and sometimes you can't quite make out what's happening because it moves too fast, but seeing it from a top-down view allowed you to see all of the different actors and stuntmen move through the scene quite clearly.

I don't know if John Wick said a sentence with more than 5 words in this movie, or talked to Marquis or Chidi.

Yes i almost feel confused that something is wrong with me 😀 but in reality i was just expecting somewhat grounded action film like first three movies (3rd started this way over the top trend but was still managable). This feels like a superhero movie with guns and without costumes. Its like fast and furious 5. Beginning of the end of the franchise for me. Also the whole high table was way better in small scale now its just bad and you can see they want to create massive universe but it just doesnt work i think. I respect that people like it so much its probably not for me anymore. Chapter 2 will stay as my favourite one.,2023-03-28 19:00:32

"The one the Marquise was in front of was [Liberty Leading the People](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Leading_the_People), from which you can draw a couple things out of. I like to think that the Marquise, in his hubris, sees himself as Liberty, but in reality it's Wick.

Pretty sure the one Winston stopped in front of is [The Raft of the Medusa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Raft_of_the_Medusa), from which you could draw connections of Winston being cast adrift from the Continental and fighting for survival/a glimpse of hope.

">and I get that they wrote themselves into a corner and they didn't want to go the route they had seemingly considered (overthrowing the high table),

This is the problem I had. From the JW3 trailers I assumed that John would be trying to overthrow The High Table, but halfway through it goes in a different direction. JW3 ends by setting up the plot of JW4: John finally overthrowing The High Table. JW4 starts with John making it clear that he's finally gonna go to war against The High Table, but halfway through it changes direction again and introduces the idea of a duel. 

It felt like it didn't know where it wanted to go. JW2 ended with a pretty clear idea of where JW3 will go: John is on the run so he goes up against The High Table to earn his freedom. But JW3 and JW4 both discard that plot point halfway through in each film and decide to go elsewhere. It was very messy.",2023-03-25 02:23:26
"I'm with you, buddy. The action was cool, everything was really cool. But all of it was meaningless. John shows up in Osaka, the bad guys can simply guess he's there, and it gets everybody killed, except for one character who disappears to a spin-off. And John walks away having accomplished nothing. Hunter shows up and seems to play both sides, ultimately leading to absolutely nothing. He took, like, one shot to help John during that stair sequence and his one shot didn't even kill the guy he was shooting. The Marquis, the movie's main villain, comes out of nowhere is completely untouchable right up until the moment he's allowed to die. Even though John Wick can single-handedly wipe out the entire criminal underbelly of several cities over the course of a couple of weeks, there remain people who are untouchable to him. It feels like Winston and the writers can just come up with any rules they want at any moment, seemingly just to prolong the script. How do we kill the Marquis? Let's dust off the rules of single combat! But you can't just challenge him, you've got a whole quest line to action scene your way through. 

I could just keep ranting. The story and characters are all just surface level deep and it did not make for a good experience for me.",2023-03-24 11:17:18
"> Furthermore, the killing of the high table elder was so shoehorned in, it was absolutely disorienting and served very little purpose. It felt like a quest in Skyrim that you never ""checked in"" to finish, so the marker has been sitting on your map for days and days until you finally fast travel there to talk to the NPC and watch a cutscene to officially complete the quest.

Yeah, I felt like the opening was, quite frankly, awful. Compared to the rest of the movie and what we see, John Wick on a horse, chasing 3 guys and taking wild potshots was terrible. 

I almost wonder if the scene with the harbinger and the Continental was supposed to be the opening, then they realized that they couldn't have the titular character only show up during the Osaka sequence, so they quick threw that together.",2023-03-28 03:11:32
"Upvoted for sharing your opinion and adding to the discussion!

Regarding killing the Elder, this is the event that alerts the High Table that John Wick lives and is a threat. Marquis doesn't come around if John doesn't kill the Elder. John also explicitly states that he went to the Elder to take back his ring, and from his perspective it does make sense that this is the first of his targets after healing up from his injuries in chapter 3.

I agree in part with your points around Osaka. From a narrative perspective, the only explanation for John going there is that New York would likely be found way too quickly by the Marquis, and that the Osaka manager was one of his few friends that he had left. I do think from a thematic perspective, Osaka is important to highlight the bond of brotherhood between John, Shimazu, and Caine. This point could have hit much harder if the relationships were introduced earlier in the series, but I found the dialog exposition adequate to convey that. Having Caine kill his ""brother"" here ties into this and sets up a small emotional arc between him and John for the rest of the film.

Just wanted to share my take on these 2 points. I'm sorry that you didn't like the movie as you'd hope, but at the end of the day you like what you like, and who cares what other random people on the Internet say you're ""supposed"" to enjoy 🙂",2023-03-27 06:31:26

If a movie wants to have bullet proof clothing then screw it, let it have it. Its a turn off your brain for the most part type of movie and most people know this going into it.

three things break this movie to me: the over use of the antibullet suits ( some fights looks like childs playing with invisible shields ), the lack of fightings styles ( the same superjiujitsu thing all time over all movie ) and the lack of deep in the world ( like dont show the hightables characters, or the lack of differents iconic gangs, or the super swat guys that in this movie are made of paper )",2023-04-10 07:07:50

Also felt more noticeable here than the other movies just seeing all the attackers wait to attack him or wait to start shooting him. JW2 still gets my vote for favorite in terms of striking a balance of campiness while still managing to keep me in the film, but they did hit him with nine cars so I don't want to complain too much unless we are complaining about him not getting hit by enough cars.",2023-03-24 05:17:56

Just to show another assassin going after John this one very dedicated only to give up just like rest of them.  The ones that fight john either die or give up lol.

For example, him going to the Roma Ruska and not thinking they'd hang him to die-- or maybe he did think it but we the audience weren't shown.

But either way, I agree with you about how Akira felt. But it seems like her father was the type to stick to his own moral code REGARDLESS of what the high table wanted him to do especially if it meant betraying his values",2023-03-24 19:56:32
"Yh, it seemed very weak of his charecter. This shit was his own mess, and just throwing his friend into this for no reason seemed very selfish. Akira has more reason to have gone after Wick than Caine. Heck, Caine even told him to leave with his daughter......",2023-03-28 23:57:21

"I want you to know that I watched this movie having seen *none* of the others, essentially knowing nothing about this movie at all, and felt the *exact same way.* The acting was so bad and the action so over-the-top, I started wondering if it weren't actually a sort of brilliant comedy self-consciously taking itself to extremes in the service of its surreal humor.

At some point, I turned to my friend and whispered, ""hey, is this one of those comic book adaptations?"", and with that fact confirmed, was able to relax into a sort of dreamy enjoyment of the stylistic visuals and choreography. A lot of the reviews call the fight scenes ""balletic,"" but ballet is fundamentally about emotion and experiencing emotional range, and JW4 seems more about mimicking the trance state of a 12-hour FPS session, but with better visuals. 

I think instead of ""so bad it's good"" for me it was more like, ""so bad it's somehow tolerable."" I like Jackie Chan, Guy Ritchie & Tarantino, and can get into silly action comedies, but I dunno.",2023-03-26 13:19:57

That’s how I felt. I’m okay with them leaning into the nonsense of it and channeling the ridiculousness of some past action franchises - but this is a franchise that first became popular and well rated because it was regarded as the most realistic one to date.

"Here's just my take on it; the radio station was appropriately namedropped as wuxia because John Wick verse basically operates like the old school wuxia realm, except in a modern world. Some of the common themes or plot points is that the real authority is corrupt or not powerful enough to control their territories. The martial artists in these types of works will typically form their own factions and govern themselves, operating by their own rules where members must follow specific set of codes. Like the movies, wuxia also placed a lot of emphasis on following the rules and customs set by the Old Ways. Outlaws, revenge, honor are also common plot points in wuxia. The normal folks/ authorities tend to turn a blind eye to the 'wulin' (the realm these martial artists operate in) and in turn those part of the martial world will usually try to not involve those not part of theirs. There's even a beggar sect and it's not unlike how Fisburne's character leads all the homeless as part of his faction.",2023-04-02 23:56:16

Also it sounds like they were running behind and didn’t have time to pre plan and rehearse some of the fights. So they had to make up some stuff on the spot as they shoot.

> the high table, structure, corruption, system is all in place as it was. John just got some of his friends hurt and killed but didn't actually further any goal

I think John's goals in 2-4 can be summarized as a consistent 'freedom with a side of vengeance' and the only way he knows how to do that is to kill anyone who gets in his way. I don't think he ever had a goal of ending the system except insofar as it was the only way he could think of getting out again.

> John set out to kill them all

That's true, at the start of the film. Then his mind is changed after talking to Winston, who convinces him that there's a more direct and realistic way to get his freedom (that also conveniently serves Winston's interests at that time). This convinces John because, again, his goal is not to bring down the whole system, it's just to be free of it.

> Also Winston could have raised the idea of the duel at the end of two

Maybe he could have, but the entire plot of 3 is Winston using John to secure his power over New York after the high table investigation. Winston is a self-serving person who is essentially the only one who can control John Wick to some extent, and he uses this to his own advantage. He wasn't ever out to help John for the sake of it, and had no reason to help him get out again until he had at least undone the damage John did to him by bringing the high table down on the NY continental after the events of JW2. My mental picture is that the events of 3 were the best way Winston figured he could keep power, and then when that fell apart in 4 he had to come up with another plan, which was the duel",2023-03-27 10:33:51

"I'm one of the rare people who hated this movie (after liking 1-3), but thank you for acknowledging the repetitivenes of the action sequences. Whenever they spice it up a bit (Donnie Yen using the motion sensors, nunchucks, axe, Dragon's Breath) it's pretty cool, in the case of Dragon's Breath spectacular even. But the problem is pretty much all of it is just Keanu awkwardly dodging a point blank gunshot (god bulletproof suits were a mistake), disarming/hitting the person, then shooting them in the head. This happens, no joke, at least *150 times* throughout the film. And like you mentioned, the choreography is pretty lackluster too, just people waiting to be hit by Keanu. Add to the fact that every one of the fight sequences was more than double the length it should be, I felt like a crazy person in the theater watching everyone enjoying this. It's like WTF was so much more impressive about the 120th instance this exact same bit of gunplay happened vs the 40th or the 2nd.",2023-03-29 07:58:04

"> Also, what was the point of Tracker/Nobody? It felt like they wanted a repeat of Halle Berry. In fact, I think it would have worked better if it had been Halle Berry, especially if the Table has found her daughter and was threatening her like they were doing with Caine.

Same. Like the high table is realizing they're falling apart and are throwing just about anyone they have left to stop him at this point.",2023-03-26 19:56:07
"all good points.

\- the japan hotel felt like it could have easily been the ending.  very dumb pacing and then making us wait more than a hour for the next mini fight scene in the berlin club

\- the repetition of the stair sequence was so anti climatic.  the 2nd time he just went up and shot the same people in the same way in half the time.  i swear i was expecting a slo motion, back to back, with 360 camera angles or something as he climbs with donnie or something clever like that the 2nd time

\- i think the movie was pitched based off the paris set pieces, and then they had to come up with the first 2/3rds of the movie thereafter.  the first two acts were all over the place, the desert, japan, ny, france, back to ny etc.

\- the sheer amount of missed shots was laughable, when compared to the other 3 movies, and thats being generous.  my audience eventually started laughing how bad guys were missing with john 2 feet from him.  and then john shielding himself from bullets in every single gun fight took me out of every set piece immediately it looked so ridiculous.  i may be wrong, but i never noticed this jacket sheilding strategy from him so often in the other movies.",2023-03-26 22:48:40

"It's extremely difficult to shoot from walking, almost impossible without training while running. I'd imagine riding a horse and shooting is even harder. It's pretty much the most realistic part of the movie.

He has defy the table numerous of times, killed their elder, killed hundreds of their men and in the end turned their own rules against them to get out. He showed a chip in what was an impregnable armor of the table, demonstrated to others that the will and determination of one man can achieve against bewildering odds.",2023-03-25 21:46:19
"No. You obviously didn't understand it. The point was to remove already used plot lines. Like you obviously didn't catch on.

Good. And then the continental was a done idea. So they blew it up. GOOD. What could be done differently that wasn't done before? Prioritizing interpersonal relationships of John Wick. This movie was about him. Not about whatever rascal was bothering him today. So the Marquez was belittled. Noone in the movie even respected him as a serious threat. The movie itself highlights that the high table is what is granting him his powers. He himself is not a pivotal character. He's just a figurehead. As the movie tries to explain. How can John best this redundant cycle? By getting his freedom back. How? Well that's what happened really. Fuck the elder lol",2023-03-26 22:40:45

"> like most of the kingpin henchmen not using guns and using tomhawks instead with no context whatsoever

You answered this part yourself at least, everyone is wearing magical bullet-evaporating suits whereas knives, bows, blunt weapons, etc all have the ability to damage through them.

The magical suits is the only thing that took me out of the film a bit. I appreciate the style and that it both made the huge insane gunfights possible (there are only so many dozens of ways you can make John dodge bullets from a distance and we don't want to see him hiding behind walls for 3 hours), and made other cool weapons relevant, but I wish they didn't bother with the holding suit flap over their face thing. It felt like that kind of explicit acknowledgement took it from ""this is a stylistic decision we need to take to construct these scenes, just go with it"" to ""this is a real part of this world and it's valid to ask why they don't wear full body wraps made of this material"".",2023-03-27 11:27:43
">The ending: while it looked very good, with the very beautiful dawn shots, i don't think the ending is a satisfactory conclusion to the story. Basically jhon lets himself get killed for what? To save Winston and the blind assassin? If he had to die to get his freedom back, he might aswell just have died in the last movie. His death is just dumb and nonsensical, he literally achieved nothing, everyone who died, died for nothing, the guy in osaka sacrificed himself for nothing. It is also implied that even the blind guy will get killed. Just a weird way to wrap it up.

If you think about it, basically all his friends got in trouble with the high table because of John. He manages to save them from the High table. In the end, it was just unlucky that he had to fight Marquis by proxy via Caine, otherwise he would have killed Marquis on the first shot and could have lived a life in peace.",2023-03-27 22:35:24

"Also before going in I heard someone say there were 14 set pieces, I only counted 10, but here’s my ranking / thoughts:

1. Berlin - Club: just incredible, from the buildup, to Wick, Caine, and Nobody teaming up, and then Wick brutally murdering goons on a waterfall-dance-floor with an axe - this is perfect. Action scenes are honestly just better when there’s also people dancing in the same shot.

2. Paris - House: I was a bit stumped when they started playing the club theme from the first for just Wick killing some goons on a staircase - but then the camera just kept pulling out and it was like ‘oh okay - here we go!’ Also the fire-shotgun is huge fun visually.

3. Paris - Entrance onto the streets: Paint it Black carries this - and I love that (Nowhere to Run was great too - kinda wish they’d kept the playlist up, it was a fun gimick).

4. Paris - Arc de Triomphe

5. Paris - Duel: ‘fuck off!’

6. Osaka - Garden: Love a good sword fight - and Donnie Yen looks particularly cool here

7. Paris - Sacre Cour steps: There’s some good laughs (Wick just keeping on rolling back down) but there were so many moments where I felt like any random good could have easily taken him out - which I don’t love.

8. Osaka - Continental raid: If Yen is there, it’s fun, the rest feels like busy work (doesn’t help that everyone has those stupid bullet proof suits).

9. Osaka - Art hall: Again Yen is great, I hate bullet proof suits, and too much of this is just Wick vs. one guy on either side.

10. Desert - Horses",2023-03-24 02:52:24

"it doesn't help that the scene is supposed to have weight, but prior to this we see John walk off major injuries no problem, why should this be different and suddenly heavily emotional when from what we saw, he should be able to just walk it off anyway.. he could as well have cpt America serum in him at this point",2023-03-26 20:29:41

"Kinda disagree here. 2 and 3 essentially were just consequences of Wick's actions of the first movie.

&#x200B;

4 kind of reflects that this escalation has to stop and that Wick is getting more and more people into trouble. It also creates some dilemma. Of course I sided with John, but I also have to admit that Caine and Shimazu had much more to fight for. I wasn't hoping that John would win the duel with Caine because that would mean that he couldn't spend more time with his daughter.",2023-03-27 22:04:11

I don't remember 2 or 3 so much.  I thought 3 was the worse of the lot.  I thought Keanu's limb movements were really slow in 2 and 3, to the point that I couldn't suspend my disbelief.  In 4,  I didn't mind his fighting so much, but I think it's because they didn't really show as much martial arts as they did in 2 and 3 or didn't display as much of his limbs moving.

"Actually, thinking about it now, Wick says, ""You owe me a favor."" after the duel was over.

"A large part of the plot of 3 is Winston using John to secure his power over New York after the high table investigation. Winston is a self-serving person who is essentially the only one who can control John Wick to some extent, and he uses this to his own advantage. My mental picture is that the events of 3 were the best way Winston figured he could keep power over the NY continental, and then when that fell apart in 4 he had to come up with another plan, which was the duel",2023-03-31 16:08:48

Would've been great to get the original actress who played the DJ in that movie, sadly, Lynne Thigpen died in 2003.

The fact that the Marquis can choose to nominate someone to take his place in the duel is a separate thing - if John kills the nominee he has still beaten the High Table in the challenge. One assumes by stepping back in at the last shot the Marquis removes the nomination, hence John headshotting him still counts as playing ""by the rules"".",2023-04-06 23:07:34

"I think jw4 is absolutely amazing if you enjoyed 1-3, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Probably would not recommend if you didn't like all 3 of the previous ones.

It leans way further into the stylistic choices developed throughout the sequels. For example in 2 they introduced the bulletproof suits but the impact still ""hurt like hell"" and gave the impression that you could break ribs or whatever, and now by 4 the fabric on the suit doesn't even move, hundreds of bullets just evaporate harmlessly if they hit any character's suit jacket. It's stylistic to makes the insane massive gunfights work and to make non-bullet weapons, which can damage through their magical jackets, feel meaningful

It also is a direct continuation of the plot of 2 & 3, so if that's what you didn't like, you're not in for a huge shift there",2023-03-26 13:20:13

"Yeah, I loved the first 2 and liked the third but I didn't not really enjoy this. It had some great moments, but narratively it made no sense to me --- didn't the last one end with John and the Bowery King planning to go to war with the High Table? I thought John would be more in control in this film (like in the first half of 2) instead of just on the run again. 

And while these movies were never super realistic it still felt like John was a real human, who got injured during fights. In this one, he gets hit by about 6 cars, fall multiple stories several times, and is totally impervious to all attacks up until the finale. Even with a bullet proof suit this guy still probably has a subdural hematoma.",2023-03-27 18:22:29
"It wasn't an ""unjust"" system. John violated the rules by killing inside the Continental.

The movie made clear that the High Table is a system and killing its members would just make them being replaced by others.",2023-03-27 13:15:48
">doesn't it feel like this movie entirely undermines what felt like the drive of the last 3? john was a man fighting against an unjust system, but in this one he's just playing by the rules. even his death is meaningless by the internal logic the film sets out - the marquee will simply be replaced and the system will continue. so what was the whole point? more samurai swords?

John wasn't fighting the high table throughout the entire 3 movies. That is just in the 3rd movie because he was killing on continental ground. Honestly the High Table did nothing wrong to John. 

I kind of like the idea that Winston argues with John. Because him trying to kill everyone at the high table is BS. The high table just represents the crime families and even if he kills their representatives - now all these families are after him. Thinking about the lore - we have a crime family in almost every larger country it seems. That would mean that John Wick would spend the rest of his life fighting ... over nothing exactly.",2023-03-27 22:31:05

"Interesting!

I liked 4 over 2 and 3.  And one of the reason is that the fights weren't as bothersome for me!  I get what you mean about the fights being more iconic in 1 and 2 and even 3.  I agree with that.  


  
But Keanu visibly lost a step in 2 and 3, at least for me.  I thought he looked really sluggish and his limbs were so slow, I couldn't suspend my disbelief that he could take on guys half his age with how slow his limbs were.  I kept complaining to my friend about it when we left the theater.  I said Wick should be a gun guy who can do martial arts if he had to, it would make him more realistic.  (Yes, hahaha... as if Wick is a realistic film, but I hope you get what I mean.)

  


With 4, there wasn't as much emphasis on martial arts (not iconic) and no close up shots of him throwing a block and counter punching, etc.  The director might have just filmed it so you couldn't tell how slow Keanu was by picking the right angles, or editing strategically.  Or, as others have put it, made the fight scenes more ""cinematic"" as opposed to a choreographed scene.  And also he just used his gun more.

  


So his unrealistic slowness wasn't a distraction for me.  I ended up liking it better.",2023-03-28 07:08:46
"Its a movie, that's the point. In no way this is meant to be realistic. There's an underground intelligence built by homeless people under New York and Paris, gunfights inside a club where people keep dancing while people kill themselves with axes at 30cm from they faces...

"Wasn't there that blind magician who did card tricks irl?

As far as I remember the way he did it was that his sense of touch was so good that he could identify the subtle differences in texture of each single card in his deck. He would just feel the card and know what it was.

Now Donnie Yen's character wouldn't have had a chance to inspect the cards beforehand but the movie is kind of a hightened reality anyway so I just assumed that he was able to feel what cards he was holding anyway.",2023-03-25 08:23:21

3. A side plot to keep you interested because you have another main assassin whose goal is to kill Wick by saving him to up the ante on his bounty.

Then why did he die,2023-03-29 07:22:34
"He brought the cards up close to his face very briefly. So he wouldn't be completely blind up close, but anything farther than that is a blur.",2023-03-29 06:43:28
Yeah he was a pointless character to me too,2023-03-29 07:15:48
"The point is that he is a younger mirror of John, who catches a conscience before getting trapped by the Table forever like John was.",2023-03-29 13:44:32
Needed $50 million to buy his way out and retire.,2023-03-29 04:57:33
"My interpretation was that the Elder was just like, the most senior member of the High Table. Like a club president or something. The rest of the High Table is probably some sort of council.

Bill's character was just some dude the council essentially gave resources to so that he could try and kill Wick. Like an Inquisitor",2023-03-29 13:33:36
"The elder was above the table. The Marquis was a top member of the table and, in response, he takes that action against the New York Continental. That's because Winston had failed to make sure John was well and truly dead in the previous film after he shot him and watched him fall from the building.",2023-03-29 13:39:19
Agreed they went too much with more.  Coulda used some more bowery king. and the villain is basically a rehash of part 2's villain. Fancy dainty rich smug guy,2023-03-29 22:04:22
"As far as i can tell, he just wanted it to end so he figured killing the elder, who was above the table, would end it all. But as the elder said to him, someone else would just replace him which is exactly what happened with the french guy being the new top guy.

As for Caine assisting John up the stairs, i have no idea. If i was in Caine's shoes, id be waiting with the others, hoping he gets killed.",2023-03-30 04:37:24
"Caine is fighting for his and his daughter's freedom and that happens only if he is the one to kill Wick in the duel based on his agreement with the Marquis. If John doesn't make it to the duel, the Marquis has no reason to grant him their freedom. Just like why Mr. Nobody spent a lot of the movie saving John, because his goal is to collect the bounty for himself and having someone else kill John instead would ruin it for himself.",2023-03-31 02:15:26
"Because Caine and John are good friends and he wanted a fair duel. Additionally, it could be that Caine knew of John's plan to shoot the Marquis with his last bullet.",2023-03-30 13:12:09
what are you talking about ? he helped him after that.,2023-03-30 21:53:20
friendship means little when it's convenient,2023-03-30 20:20:00
"My theory - he is still alive. The scene where Winston and Bowery King are at the Wick's gravestone, is to make the heads of the table believe he is finally dead. Someone could observe them at the grave site, and report back to the table that John Wick is indeed dead. 

Off screen, Wick could be somewhere finally at peace. So if there are no more Wick movies, thats it but of there is a sequal then they can have John Wick come back. I would love to see one more sequal in which he goes after the table and brings it all down.",2023-03-31 06:38:38
I'd lean more toward Winston as a member of the Ruska Roma or former one.,2023-04-02 06:48:13
"1) Caine was ""nominated"" by the Marquis during the discussion of terms in front of the Eiffel Tower. This is in line with High Table rules - Wick was technically the ""nomination"" of the Ruska Roma high table representative. (Or, you can ignore that interpretation and just say that the Marquis nominated Caine)

2) Caine was relieved of his ""nomination"" when the Marquis took up the pistol for his right of ""coup de grace."" The Marquis never had a second.",2023-04-03 06:02:27
"> In the first movie, Jimmy came to his house because some noise was reported, here,

I assumed it's because at that time, people in the know are aware that John's retired so it would indeed be suspicious/unusual thus the cop went to have a look. Whereas by the time movie 4 rolled around, dude already has an ever increasing bounty on his head worldwide with a radio station providing live updates so everyone already knows to back off.",2023-04-02 23:36:59
"i mean the guy is 58. towards the end of john wick 3, he had that 1v2 against two of the assassins. Now I know those two guys because they were previously featured in the raid 1 and 2, two amazing action movies from indonesia and it was obvious that they had to slow down for keanu to keep up since they fought at a much faster pace in the raid movies.

but then again, keanu is 58 years old, its amazing he can do this stuff at all at his age. it would be unrealistic for him to keep up with martial arts fighters at their peak.",2023-04-03 19:08:30
He should be gassed canon wise lol. Dude has gone through the wringer!,2023-05-30 04:49:18
Weird how so many people are calling it a rip off.. I saw it as an homage.,2023-05-30 04:47:24
"A hand, yes. It kinda happens out of nowhere, but the rest of the damage done can be avoided lol. I had to close my eyes because I'm the same way.",2023-04-02 21:05:39
"yeah well, you do have to just accept that. i mean a real human, no matter how well trained, wouldve been long dead in John Wicks shoes. Just the fall from the apartment at the end would be enough to break several bones and make you unable to move for weeks if not months, if not permanently. 

if there is any justification, it is that blind people develop a better sense for hearing than people with functional eyesight, so maybe he can roughly locate the people in his mind through his better hearing ability.

but you can also use as counterargument that the very loud gunshots would disrupt his concentration and therefore his ability to locate enemies in his mind.

yeah if you look at it from a realism standpoint, it doesnt hold up of course but that kinda applies to any action movie. humans simply are very fragile, so if you had it completely realistic, youd have the protagonist at most take one fall or one bullet but that would make worse cinema.",2023-04-03 18:56:11
"maybe he's a ""really good lawyer""",2023-04-10 23:00:52
well it is the finale. If it just toned down then wouldn't it just be the same as the other movies? It needs something to set it apart.,2023-04-22 19:54:25
He wasn't in 3 either,2023-06-07 08:13:14
Did you see the after credits scene? It's implied we'll be getting more.,2023-05-15 19:41:09
">Blind guy and John were dueling, bad guy (blind guy's second) tags in at the very end to do the coup de grace because he wants to be the guy to kill John,

In that moment Caine asks Maquis if he's free and he says yes, Caine and his daughter are free. Essentially ending their contractual obligation included the duel.",2023-05-15 19:37:44
What scene/movie?,2023-05-15 19:34:58
They're real ammunition.,2023-05-30 03:53:59
"Dragons Breath rounds are real. Check it out on YouTube, it's cool stuff",2023-06-02 04:17:36
I think its cause Caine got nominated and not that he was one to nominate,2023-06-11 04:13:37
"He’s not Marquis’ second. The job of a second is to help you with everything besides the actual fighting (like negotiating, preparing the weapon etc) so you can focus on the duel itself. He’s more like a champion that fights in Mqrquis’ stead and he was relieved of his duty before the duel ended.",2023-06-24 08:05:58
"Yeah, if you ignore the 200 scenes where the enemies try to stab him with a gun.",2023-07-11 03:37:14
I don’t think the director and Keanu want to do a fifth one.  Keanu is 58 and living with injuries from the first Matrix.  The director mentioned he wanted to do other films.  So it looks like they went all out for the fourth.  Definitely the best and great ending if they decide to stop here.,2023-03-25 12:48:41
You could have told me it was an hour forty and I'd believe you. Blew past.,2023-03-25 04:14:31
"I check my watch when jw climb those stair. I really hope real time clock matches the in movie clock. 
... 
Its not",2023-03-25 12:53:46
Fastest 3hr movie of my life.,2023-03-28 04:14:17
"I checked my watch exactly once because I really had to pee and wondered how much time was left. 

Answer: too long",2023-03-29 03:34:47
"Same here, I only checked it twice because my watch wanted me to stand up and move around lol.",2023-04-03 15:29:52
Same experience! As credits rolled was the first time I glanced down. Incredible cinematic experience,2023-03-28 04:47:52
"It did not feel like 3 hour. Frankly, I was shocked when I checked my phone as the credits rolled. The time just flew by.",2023-04-02 13:47:58
I checked the clock a few times but because I was curious how long the fight segments actually lasted,2023-04-25 00:01:42
"Yep and I checked a lot watching 3, GJ",2023-03-27 08:57:24
I didn’t even get the urge to pee.,2023-04-05 00:31:00
I actively avoided checking my watch because I didn't want it to end.,2023-04-05 10:11:47
Agreed - it felt a little long. I enjoyed it don’t get me wrong. But I also was at a point where I could have sworn I saw Keanu ‘kill’ the same stunt man 2 or 3 times as I was starting to recognize them.,2023-03-26 12:23:13
"That was the only part of the movie where it felt like a chore. 

I was mentioning that if they cut out half, or all of the Arc scene, it wouldn't have felt out of place to me at all. It felt like just filler, and didn't actually bring the plot point that much forward.. Just some more random useless goons that die. 

Now, the scene after that in the building with the overhead shot... that was pure artistry.",2023-03-29 18:17:40
The top-down section of the apartment sequence was absolutely brilliant,2023-03-28 19:47:23
"I think this movie avoided action fatigue better than 2 and 3. The actions scenes were ridiculously long but I thought they mixed things up enough to keep it interesting. Like the Paris fight going from the streets, to the building, to the stairs, all with very different styles and environmental obstacles. The only action sequences that I thought could be trimmed a little were the German night club and that final stair fight, but they were only slightly too long, whereas I definitely started to get bored during the catacombs fight in 2 and the dog fight in 3.",2023-03-25 06:41:36
"Honestly, I loved every sequence. Each one individually is fucking awesome",2023-03-25 01:29:30
Agreed. The Berlin section also dragged like crazy.,2023-03-24 22:21:42
Yeah that was about when I was checking my watch lol,2023-03-25 04:01:29
I’m picturing you sweating buckets trying to hold the line 😂,2023-03-26 12:24:08

"I love that all these comments about incredibly paced immediately contradict themselves in the next sentence by saying it dragged. 

It definitely did drag in some scenes. I was worried that he’d be fighting the elite high table guards the entire movie. The escape from osaka dragged since it took like a minute to kill each mercenary.",2023-04-24 03:00:01
I feel asleep during the poker scene. I loved the top down scene with the white phosphorus. I think I’ll see it as a matinee tomorrow and see what I think.,2023-03-25 03:55:53
"This is the thought I always have. What are the pay rates for henchmen? Are there companies who specialize in henchman contracting?

"I kept wondering about that. Like at some point as a henchman don't you go ""We're going after  John Wick? Nah man I'm gonna take a sick day today.""

Nah man weren't you watching the movie? If you kill one they'll just put another in his place.,2023-03-29 02:56:29
He's probably saving the money with all the new armor and weapons they have. The technology is so good they don't need the extra bodies and wick is just thinning the herd without the future grubts being the wiser.,2023-05-26 07:15:06

Yeah it really started with that guy. John hasn't stopped since then.,2023-05-30 00:28:43
Unironically the 3 dudes in wick's house at the first movie came the closest to killing Wick. After that he got MC status and by then it's too late.,2023-06-20 19:19:45

You have five downvotes. Stop crying about getting crucified.,2023-03-27 14:44:08
"“Crucified” is when people disagree with you. It’s not exactly a realistic movie. There’s a lot to criticize if you go by that angle.

It’s also just not valid criticism when there’s an in universe explanation. John shot first, the dude has extremely good awareness, it’s a straight line, etc",2023-03-27 13:39:54

"Same. It's not the most realistic film series and the action does force you to buy into some unbelievable shit, but I can get over things like a secret society of criminals and armored High Table soldiers because the story requires me to, but a blind man being able to shoot perfectly and kill dozens of people pushes it into the realm of fantasy for me. It's kind of obvious they looked at Donnie Yen's character in Star Wars and thought ''you know what would be cool?'', and added him in without really thinking about how illogical it is.",2023-03-25 01:35:43

"Honestly, this series really evolved like a video game. The first movie was, generally speaking, more grounded because the game was just beginning and John was low level. But then he survived and levelled up, so the second movie introduced upgraded armour and weapons and so on. That's why Wick was able to survive such ridiculous shit in 3 and 4: he was a really high level vitality build.",2023-03-24 02:13:46
Yeah it was CoD warzone resurgence map in Ashika island with all noobs running fire breathing KV broadside shotgun until they nerfed it last week lol,2023-03-24 02:22:00
I leaned over to my buddy and said I felt like I was watching Metal Gear Solid in live action. So cool. Seeing incendiary rounds in live action was one of the coolest things ever.,2023-03-24 11:51:17
"If this was not a movie franchise, it would make a hell of a game series all the story beats are the same pretty much too.",2023-03-24 06:16:56
Especially with the fire/explosive shotgun blasts.felt like something out of duke nukem or doom,2023-03-24 22:25:01
The western vibe of the pistol dual at the end with the sunrise was very much like Red Dead Redemption 2,2023-03-24 05:10:59
"This was Videogame: The Movie. Killa Harkan was a multistage bossfight with John injuring him at the end of every stage and the overhead one take was absolutely inspired by hotline miami. 

The last act was one big callback to a movie called The Warriors, a movie of which the story is very similarly structured to a videogame. Having to fight a new gang in each new neighbourhood till they make it home. John Wick 4 also used that same structure in the third act. 

You even have the classic coop formula where John and Caine have to fight together to reach their destination, only to have to fight eachother at the ''end of the game'', similar to double dragon, streets of rage and tons of other coop games.",2023-03-28 13:12:59
I don’t even think it was the only video game feeling scene. The Arc de Triompe scene was straight out of Twisted Metal 2.,2023-03-24 06:11:43
"I've said it before, just as Pacific Rim is the best anime live action take that's not even adapted from (any specific) anime, John Wick series is basically the best video game adaptation that wasn't even based off a video game property. It's wild, so many live action adaptations of games fail to capture the spirit of the works they're based off. Meanwhile John Wick actually feels like how a video game movie should be.",2023-04-02 13:35:56
It was likely modeled after the John Wick game called John Wick Hex.,2023-03-24 04:01:08
I kept seeing exclamation marks and hearing the sound from Metal Gear Solid 😉,2023-04-07 21:52:08

Was this CGI?  It seemed like CGI in some spots.,2023-03-31 08:54:41

"Every fight was so amazing I really couldn't pick a favorite.  So well shot, for me, John Wick is the only franchise where the movies just keep getting better and better.

Comparing different kinds of action is incredibly hard for me. Like how do you compare the landing scene in Saving Private Ryan to the bathroom fight scene in Mission Impossible Fallout or Helms Deep in LOTR2 to the long take boxing round in Creed 1? Definitely is going in my top 5 shootout scenes. In no particular order: (1) Matrix Lobby. (2) John Wick 1 nightclub scene. (3) Heat shootout. (4) Collateral nightclub scene. (5) This scene. Pushed out the Fenway shootout in The Town.,2023-03-25 04:13:58
The way the scene seamlessly transitioned from a third person to overhead shot was fantastic.,2023-03-24 07:36:15
which I'm in two minds about - but it was an amazing sequence regardless,2023-03-24 23:49:52
Plus another scene in a club. Love the throwbacks,2023-03-24 03:02:09
I think it was something called a hydra crane!,2023-03-24 22:17:26

"the only time he killed in Osaka was the samurai fight, and even that was probably not intentional",2023-03-26 10:46:30
Good catch I was wondering why he wasn’t killing people in japan,2023-03-25 10:39:02
Bit late here but he lowered them because he shoots based on sound. Since he didn’t want to kill them he lowered it so the doorbells are not at head height.,2023-05-23 00:00:33
Told my wife it reminded me of that feeling when you forget to save progress in a video game and have to go all the way back to start.,2023-05-25 03:27:02

"You _didnt_ see him die. You saw him slump over after and entire night of the hardest fighting in his life, and bearing lesser wounds than this series canonically considers lethal. You did not see his body. And there's only two kinds of graves with grass; old ones, and ones that are not dug. Even the last philosophical discourse hints at this reality; Those who cling to life receive death, those who cling to death, receive life"". 

John Wick is simply hiding from the enemies he made throughout his years in service. He is veryuch alive, and only he and Winston know it.

Edit: Also consider, Ballerina is taking place between 3 and 4. But the post credit scene demonstrates there's clearly more going on with Akira's story, which obviously can't play out in the spin off. _John Wick_ killed her father. She will find him. She will clue in the underworld for the 40 million dollar price still on his head, which in theory remains open and in escrow despite the Marquis's death.

"I noticed that too, it was slightly jarring but I think even with the revealing error it could be laughed off as the ""Civilians?"" trope you just mentioned.

It was the perfect video game setup. Bosses and mooks galore, and no police or obvious civilians to speak of. Badass first boss turned friend. Double-life-bar boss in the club. Penultimate boss the toughest in the franchise. Final boss marathon runup and thrown right back to the goddamn beginning for failure. Final boss dies to quick time button press.

Back in Paris, the van dude popped out. Literally out of the FOV plane, and his van stopped.",2023-03-24 10:11:27
Yes!! The Berlin/dancing and the Paris/cars both felt like something out of Tekken.,2023-03-25 13:59:08
That’s a flex from the high table. They can just take that location from the public.,2023-03-26 23:44:42
We’ll see it starts with John killing a bunch of people to escape. Then he kills a bunch of people to kill one guy. Then he kills a bunch of people so he could get to the duel. Then he kills the bad guy and dies.,2023-07-15 22:23:11

"Since the start he was protecting John, making him harder to kill so his bounty is eventually worth more and more and when he sees a good enough number, go kill him.

He tried to kill him at the end at Paris, but John saved his dog by shooting the Marquis’ goon instead of shooting him. That’s why he decided to stop hunting John and instead help him.",2023-04-03 04:54:57

I would love if they just pick up the story from Donnie Yen and Rina Sawayamas pov like the end credits show,2023-03-24 07:28:20
If they give spin offs I’m not mad at that. But not another one. I mean really what the fuck else can they do? They did every form of violence I can even think of in as many ways as possible,2023-03-25 02:16:12
Wasn't a 5th confirmed a while ago?,2023-03-25 00:05:43
I'd settle for John wick before he retired. Show us the impossible task he had to pull off to leave and go marry helen,2023-03-25 23:08:13
id love a prequel movie of john getting out tbh. it would be cool to see more of how these bonds john had grew in the past.,2023-03-25 21:13:06
"lol ""ambiguous"" ... he gives a final dying word, slumps over lifeless on the stairs while bleeding out, and they cut to his fucking tombstone.  Did you need Bones to check his pulse and say ""he's dead, Jim""?",2023-03-26 04:02:27
My bet is they make a 5th movie centering around a different (maybe newer/young assassin) and as part of their journey they are  on the run and they find John wick who trains them to be badder than ever.,2023-03-28 02:41:25
"Yeah it ended to where it would make sense if they made another within the story, as he couldn’t be in hiding (“who knows”) but if that was the last John Wick, then that is also a very very solid ending to the franchise",2023-03-26 04:28:04
I loved all 4 John Wick movies and they should stop here and quit while they’re ahead. If they continue John Wick’s storyline at this point it’s going to feel very cheap and unecessary.,2023-04-09 08:21:01
Not that ambiguous… they gave him the godfather 3 send off and included a gravestone scene ffs,2023-03-25 07:01:11

He's not dead.,2023-03-28 20:58:38
The director has not confirmed anything. He left it open for the audience,2023-03-26 01:13:13
"Why not? The marchese took back the place of his nominated, released him from all obligations mid-duel & was then killed. All technicalities were fulfilled & followed.",2023-03-24 13:12:22
Even he found Skarsgard insufferable,2023-03-24 07:57:37
"Honestly I feel the opposite. Like, John dying invalidates all the sacrifices his friends have made for him and the one's he's made himself to earn his freedom. The deaths become pointless and to what end? So John wouldnt have to be an assassin anymore? But hes killing people anyway.

Idk, especially considering the high emotion of the Osaka fights and Hiroyuki's lines about owing John a debt not relegated to markers, but also continuing to fight Donnie's character and claiming to be doing it for his daughter? What's for his daughter? Certainly not fighting someone else's pointless fight. You have to believe it's for a higher reason aka standing against the table to help John dismantle it so Akira doesnt have to live under those rules. For that, he gave up his life to give John the chance to escape, because if not for that reason, all the death in Osaka is pointless. Why was John even there. 

And I just dont think thats the type of man John is, just letting friends die so he can stop by for a chat. Because he had multiple chances to kill friends throughout and he never did. He values his friend's lives. JW films aren't just mindless action movies, they literally revolve around emotional arcs and decisions as the driving points. 

So if John is dead, while the high table still exists.... then John knowingly put his friend in lethal danger for absolutely no reason and that just... doesnt sit the right way with me. 

Anyway I'm team faked death. John Wick is still a martyr inspiring others to rebel and he still gets his freedom. The ""loving husband"" died a long time ago as they said in the movie. Who knows where he is now.",2023-03-25 18:15:20
What's the fifth movie? Him escaping from afterlife after killing everyone there?,2023-03-30 07:54:04
I know this line from my Peloton instructor,2023-06-24 06:58:24
"On the other side of the spectrum, my best friend of 30 years basically stopped caring about me at all this year.

That line fucking killed me inside.",2023-03-26 04:11:47

I'd agree with you but the stress of worrying if the dog might die during the entire length of the movie is too much for me,2023-04-01 13:46:34
"I wish they'd given him a backstory, like having some huge debt he has to clear, or a huge purchase he wants to make (his own continental).

Otherwise, I can't fathom how he thinks a $20 million bird in the hand is worth $50 million's worth of birds in the bush. Especially given that he walks away from it in the end, there.",2023-04-17 14:33:01

"Japan worked so well because the three Big Assassins got to show off just how cool they are, like you feel that these guys are definitely the very best the High Table can throw at you and the only thing it does is make John/Caine exert effort",2023-03-24 02:55:25
"The Berlin nightclub was hilarious, and not in a bad way.

There were ladies and gentlemen gyrating, undulating, floating, gliding, smiling and staring obliviously at the insane asthmatic guy throwing and being thrown around by the silent black-suited assassin. It's Tuesday for them.

Berlin nightclub guy was absolutely the second-life-bar boss. I giggled at his ""Why don't you die?"". I was thinking it was *this* guy who would just never die.",2023-03-24 03:17:49
BUT the nightclub had the moooooney slomo shot of John entering the rave through the fog. And i swear they brought back some of the same techno from one the first movie,2023-03-24 05:06:57
"I loved how the intro to Osaka only served to show the audience the layout of the coming action and was hardly even focussed on Wick. 

Mostly on his friends, Mr.Nobody, the Marquis' hand and Caine's abilities",2023-03-25 01:10:26
"The apartment was unique, cool, and had me cheesing but I agree with Japan, it just felt like great choreography, good ole action, character introductions and even character deaths while the apartment had the fun with cinematography and insane gun",2023-03-24 03:18:12
I agree about the Berlin nightclub. The Red Circle scene in the first movie did it better imo. Still loved it though.,2023-03-24 04:18:58
">	The only extended battle setpiece that didn’t hit like an all-timer for me was the Berlin nightclub, and even still, that was a hugely entertaining scene.

Yeah that was the only one I think didn’t hit the mark for me. The villain was comical. Johns fall would have almost certainly killed him, and it just wasn’t as good as the other action scenes. And it’s also a let down because the scene from the red circle in the first movie is still one of my favourites.

Thing is, it was still far better than most other action scenes in most other movies. It just doesn’t come close to the others in the earlier movies or this one.",2023-03-24 22:27:12
The duel was so elegant and beautifully shot. Also I find it great that what eventually killed John Wick was losing a duel to a blind man.,2023-03-25 15:18:30
The visuals of falling water in the Berlin club looked amazing though. And of course Scott Atkins killed it.,2023-03-27 14:14:07

Very impressive how they shot that, though. Really made sure his face is visible without ruining it",2023-03-29 13:33:07
"The night club scene was top sequence in the movie for me, with 1 being the house and 3 being The Osaka Continental. The hand to hand with the axes was a nice change of pace, just like the nun chuks in Japan, to the two the body, one to the head gun stuff.",2023-03-25 06:16:06
I just wish the world around them would react normally to what was going on.,2023-03-30 21:11:11
"Yeah... Berlin was the weaker part I believe. I feel like they could've halved the time spent on it, it really just went back and forth and left me kind of confused about the whole sequence.",2023-04-03 02:37:27
Nunchaku for sure was the most entertained and the hotline Miami pov dragon breath shotgun was the most beautiful,2023-06-18 13:04:16
"I didn't like the night club fight. I know extras are just extras but still, it's super weird that they witness people fighting seriously right in front of them, some dying, and then just go back to dancing and stuff. It's not like the crowd is used as a stunt setpiece ala Jackie Chan either, so they don't *need* to be there. Idk why they didn't just make the crowd panic and clear up the place from the start.",2023-03-27 19:54:07
"For some reason it had too many different themes and set pieces that it felt a little silly compared to the last ones, I remember the twins fight with iron chef guy vividly and the mirror room from 2 but this one was like last samurai, a over the top Kingpin boss, Frogger fight and the COD fire shotgun fight. Then For a Few Dollars more ending, it felt a little bit too all over the place with cheese for some reason. Not sure why it felt like that compared to the last, and with the scenes of him falling down the entire staircase I thought the 3rd movie was better. Got a little over parody of itself in this one.",2023-03-28 03:43:43
"Guess Im hard to please but I was not impressed with Osaka scene

is not my thing",2023-04-22 08:21:42

I don't think those rounds come in clips,2023-07-08 02:19:44
"I agree with everything with you've just said, you're absolutely spot on in how each action scene looked and felt, and this will be a very unpopular opinion, but my god Osaka and the Arc de Triomphe action scenes dragged on for a good ten minutes too long. The Berlin rave action scene actually felt like it was the right length. It wasn't too long, it wasn't too short. Same as the house and stairs action scenes.

I was physically exhausted by the time the film ended. I felt like I needed a nap. There was no room to breathe. I love the film and I'll absolutely watch it again, but there's no way I could watch it all in one go again or as part of a marathon. 

Honestly, as much as I love these films as a whole, I have to say that the first two are my favourites because the action scenes felt like the right length. And to be honest the only parts about JW3 that I like were the first and third acts in New York, I felt like once he got to Casablanca the film grinded to a halt, and I didn't like Halle Berry and her attack dogs as much as the armored High Table soldiers at the end.

And given how this film ended, I kinda hope it really is the last one. I'm really not sure where they could take it storywise and I just feel like the action scenes are gonna get longer and longer in an effort to outdo the last action scene in the film.",2023-03-25 00:39:30
"For me, I was getting a lot of fighting fatigue at the Arc de Triumph scene. It didn't help that our theater, I think, over pushed the volume. It was extremely loud. I thought that act was a little excessive. 

Other than that, loved it.",2023-03-29 18:24:21
"They absolutely used the NFL Superbowl camera system. You're spot on.

whole theater laughed for me,2023-03-24 06:32:12
My theater had a laugh. I think the one where he rolls all the way back down and Donnie Yen helps him up is definitely a comedic moment.,2023-03-24 06:35:36
It gave me flashbacks to Lone Survivor which also featured unintentionally hilarious extended scenes of actors falling down hills.,2023-03-24 07:43:03

"I thought they let it get a little to over the too in this one personally, it kinda became a parody of itself in a way that I liked the last one better. They had really fucking goofy villains in this one too. that card scene was shot kinda stock photo looking with the lighting, and wick should’ve been throwing all kinds of cards at people haha. I do like they did a throwback to the pencil with donnie yen, but why did they need another dog k9 fight?",2023-03-28 03:51:31

Loved the throw back to the tracks from the first movie,2023-03-25 07:21:34
"Felt like they made a couple scenes the definitive versions of previous fights cause they knew it would be end + full circle moments. Fight in a more luxurious club & bigger fall from the 1st movie, Wick saving Nobody's dog, vehicle combat from 2 to all those cars in Paris, stair fight from 2 to the stairs in this one.",2023-03-26 11:49:13

"It did look great, only time I could tell it was a fat suit was when JW did like a bear hug grab and the suit kinda shrank in.

Great mini boss type character.",2023-03-29 15:08:54
I was a little surprised that they had the fat dude that can still kick ass when he wants to. They let him be a semi-legitimate threat to John.,2023-06-01 09:29:17
He's the exact opposite of slept on though? He's very well regarded as one of the absolute best in the business,2023-03-26 04:05:48

I’d say make him blind in one eye or missing an arm or something.",2023-04-08 23:49:53
"If you're looking for realism, the blind guy who's a trained assassin shouldnt be the first thing bothering you. John Wick should have been dead since Chapter 1 or 2 when he got hit by multiple cars. He should be dead from contusions or just broken spine. Chapter 3 ended with him literally dropping from a five floor building.

And each time he fights with a gun, the guy puts his arm up as if the bullets are just punches.",2023-04-06 14:03:42
Yeah felt like a typical kung fu trope shoehorned into the movie.,2023-04-30 14:01:00

"It's weird that Stahelski has talked about all the plot threads and arcs that they had to cut out because almost none of the characters really do much. Nobody just wants some money and then he decides to let it go at the end because John saved his dog? That's *it*?! They were building up The Bowery King and how he has this big underground rebellion against the High Table that he's trying to pull off and... he stops by to drop off a suit, give him a brief boat ride, and that's pretty much it? Akira seemed like she was going to team up with John or something, but just drops out of the film completely instead.

This film just has no idea what to do with any of the characters.",2023-03-26 20:27:57
"Yeah I actually first learned about it in a call of duty game haha.
https://youtu.be/dh8pbgC_CDk?t=56",2023-03-29 03:42:09
I got a bit annoyed by that in Osaka before Caine's fight,2023-03-24 03:34:51
"A lot of the times also you can tell they were flailing around pointlessly while JW was busy with another guy, waiting for him instead of using that time to attack him",2023-03-25 03:34:50
"I mean I think the problem is that it's pretty impractical for 1 person to beat a whole group at once no matter the skill level, so having that happen on screen is going to pretty much require some of the participants to be useless for parts of the fight and take turns so the protagonist doesn't get instantly overwhelmed. There are certainly less and more believable ways to do it, and for the most part I think John Wick does a pretty good job, but I think it's just inherent to 1 v many fight scenes.",2023-03-25 06:35:26
"It's still better than the earlier films where John bursts into a room, grabs a guy's gun, holds him in a joint lock as he shoots everyone else, then shoots that guy last. Then he takes the gun, fires off a few rounds as he moves down the hallway, and throws it away before repeating it again and again and again.

Or in *3* how they kept reusing the same basic moves with the dogs repeatedly.

I think they run into a problem with the choreography where they come up with a few moves and then repeat them in overextended fight scenes. They would benefit greatly from cutting them down into shorter, tighter sequences with a lot less repetition.",2023-03-26 20:19:35
Literally every action movie ever.  Watch Kill Bill Vol. 1.  They are legit dancing around waiting their turn.,2023-03-24 06:00:23
I'm not sure about 4 since I can't rewatch the scenes yet. But I feel like scenes such as the knife gallery scene in 3 handle background enemies pretty well. They are often struggling from wounds or trying to get up after a takedown. Granted they still come in groups of 2 most of the time.,2023-03-26 11:28:09
I was doing this for this movie also! The guy who kept hitting the large drum in Japan was hilariously throwing himself into it while waiting for John to give him some attention.,2023-04-01 03:47:44

As much as I like John Wick I have to agree. At some point it's not as exciting to see John shooting people in the head again and again with a pistol.

Big budget action set pieces are usually the protagonist/s vs objects or the environment. A well choreographed fight performed by people is more engaging.

John Wick, this one in particular, manages to marry set piece and some of the best action choreography in cinema. Nothing in any MI movie is as memorable to me as some of the scenes in the JW franchise. I don't recall anything as good as that overhead sequence or anything getting as many reactions out of me as his entire journey to the church.",2023-03-24 12:15:41

I love the MI movies, and the stunts are incredible...but the John Wick franchise has much more engaging/impressive camera work, imo. And it's not just the one-shots (as awesome as they are). They get a little experimental and creative with things like the top-down shot in the Paris apartment.

Like you said though, candy vs ice cream. I watch MI for the spectacle and the 2-3 ""how tf did Tom Cruise do *that*"" stunts. I watch John Wick to see beautifully shot/choreographed fights.",2023-03-24 02:59:29

This movie gave him a solution in using their rules against them and then he just dies anyway which sort of ruins the cleverness of Caine and John's plan to goad the Marquis into participating.

"Actually, Keanu Reeves, who made a movie called ""Man of Tai Chi"", should've had a ready answer for that.


Yang Luchan, the man made Tai Chi nationally famous in the mid-19th century, gone through something very similar:

He was an indentured servant for a family of wealthy merchant when he learned Tai Chi.  When he was in his 40's, the master died, leaving at home only a widow very close in age to Yang Luchan.  The widow released Yang from servitude because two of them living alone in the house would invite endless gossip.

Yang then tried to make a living trying to teach martial art.  The details are hazy, but he either killed or seriously injured challengers, and had to leave town to avoid trouble.

He ended up at a home of a wealthy merchant in Beijing.  But several months later, the families of injured/killed challengers found him, and tried unsuccessfully to kill him.

At this point he already at one point saved the life of wealthy merchant from 20 armed robbers.  That merchant is wealthy because he supplies favorite picked vegetables to the dowager empress and other royals.  The merchant told him, the only way out of the ""dark path"" is to join the ""light path"", then he'd be untouchable.

He was introduced the house of a Manchu blood prince.  First as teacher to the household manager (Wang Lanting), then to 8 royal princes, and emperor's own teacher.  He accepted endless challenges, and winning them all (except one draw), earning the nickname ""Yang the Peerless"", but no one tried to assassinate him again, as he's the teacher of princes and nobles (his other nickname is ""Yang the 8 earl"" as he was the teacher of 8 princes).

He was the boogie man of his day.  So in modern day, if John Wick were to say recruited by the US government, the underworld would not dare touch him, as they (part of the ""dark path"") need to stay in the dark, the same way Black Widow's organization had to stay far away from her when she became internationally famous Avenger.",2023-03-28 19:56:18

"I get it, but at the same time there's only so far you can go with a story like this. With Fast and Furious or Mission Impossible having ten and eight films works because each film is about the next mission, with John Wick each film is about him surviving another day. From pretty much the start of John Wick 2 it's just one long fight for survival over the course of a few weeks, maybe months now since they don't say how long its been since JW3 and JW4.

"I'm gonna go in parts. 

For starters, thank you for such a thoughtful answer. When I make big comments like these on things I'm passionate about, I honestly expect the bare minimum. To have someone read it all and respond with such a similar passion and proper thoughts is a breath of fresh air. I see that controversial is the reason why my comment still got so much engagement. I knew I'd get downvoted to hell, in fact I already was at the beginning, so I didn't care. But over the past day or two, I've had a sudden surge of support and I'm finding a good chunk of people who agree with me, which makes me feel less insane as I see major online presences still saying this movie is fucking amazing, which sometimes still makes me feel like I'm insane for seeing it so differently. 

I do want to also add: I noticed a lot of toxicity toward this one reviewer who saw the movie before it came out. (Grace Randolph) she has most of the thoughts I do and she got absolutely demolished in the comments by people who hadn't even seen the movie yet because it wasn't out. It's like people walk into it to watch it while already convincing themselves it's the best thing ever. So they ignore all these glaring issues. 

Regarding the armor, I don't have much else to add beyond what I said and you said. It's ridiculous and even if we suspend disbelief, the bullet sponge aspect of it is to the movie's detriment. It's actually very interesting to read your thoughts as someone who had rewatched the first 3 before this one. It just continues to cement this idea I have that the people behind this movie are either a completely different creative team or they, for some reason, said ""fuck it"" and gave up on realism and their continuity. 

I had absolutely forgotten about the adjudicator. It's even more weird now that you point it out since, for what I remember, it was the adjudicator that kickstarted the raid on the NY continental. So why is the adjudicator not present in Osaka's raid? And where the fuck did the Marquis even come from?

I believe I said it in my main post but it bears repeating: I am absolutely convinced the ORIGINAL idea was that yes, the franchise would end with John going against the High Table. I feel like we all agreed that was the point, especially after the third movie's ending. But it was between 3 and 4 that they decided this would be a franchise that expands. So we already have the continental prequel and ballerina spin off. Now, what's interesting is that the ballerina spin off doesn't have a set timeline... But apparently John Wick will show up in it? Maybe? So... What does that mean, exactly? Is he alive? Is he not? It's so convoluted and weird. If the High Table dies, the evil is defeated basically. So now they're like ""we can't do that yet, we got 1000 spin offs to make"" 

EDIT: I looked it up and apparently the Ballerina Spin Off will take place between 3 and 4. 

The problem is that they chose to do this even if it meant ruining the John Wick story. And they fucking did it anyway. Worst of all, they're being REWARDED because most people don't give a fuck. They think his death is poetic and amazing, almost like they're willingly ignoring the whole point of the character's journey. So welp, there's that. 

Agree with everything regarding the tracker. I had someone try to justify him and his motives by saying. ""No, but you see, in a split second moment as he's passing through his notebook's pages full of stuff you'll be trying to look at in milliseconds, there is a drawing of a house and his dog next to it. So he wants the money for a house to live in with his dog"" 

Like... That's cool, but how is this relevant to the movie? Isn't this John Wick's story? Isn't every character connected to his past and being potential friends or enemies? Don't we have a big henchman villain and the Marquis to be the ones to get on John's way? Why do we need a dude who adds nothing to the film other than comedic moments with his dog? 

Like, couldn't Bill Skarsgard do some fighting himself? Even his character was pointless. 

Agree with the nightclub scene. Personally I was also paying attention to that. All I could think was ""Are these civilians? Why aren't they running away? Or is this a nightclub for assassins and they just don't care?"" It's like they're murdering each other for 5+ minutes and it's only 10 minutes in that people stopped dancing. It was just very distracting. 

The Eiffel Tower thing is dumb. But I suspended disbelief over the idea that the High Table has already been established to have a huge influence over the world. Correct me if I'm wrong since you rewatched them, or maybe I'm confusing it with the warriors as you say, but didn't the radio station briefly show up in JW3? Or maybe I'm mixing up the Warriors and the fact the women who do the bounties do show up in the third movie. 

I assume you're aware but in case you're not: there IS a post credit scene where Akira goes kill Caine. She has a knife she intends to use on him as he's sitting at the park like in the introduction and the screen then goes to black. So this already generates two dumb outcomes: 1- She forgives him for absolutely no reason despite the fact he didn't actually have to kill her father and could've left. (After all, he left her alive and the Marquis didn't complain, so it wasn't a ""no witnesses"" situation) or 2- She actually DOES kill him, making John's sacrifice and unwillingness to kill him an absolute waste of time. 

So yeah, I don't know. You have a good theory as to why people enjoyed this one so much. But at least I no longer feel as insane as I did seeing all the support while I kept seeing these very real and MASSIVE flaws.",2023-03-26 02:29:40
"Man, it's been so long since the last ones that I don't think most ppl are gonna notice but you nailed it. I honestly didn't gaf about anything in the movie. The whole ""honor"" bs. Just get it over with.",2023-03-27 06:36:42
"The tracker really wasn't flip flopping.  You notice in the beginning he had a set of numbers in his notebook.  That gave you the idea that it was how much he was thinking he would need to buy his way out, which didn't really become evident until the poker scene.  Remember he would have to kill John so much like the Japanese dude from JW3 it was in his best interest to secure the kill AND manipulate the marquis to drive the price up.

John issued the duel to kill him and his defeat would make the high table look weak (and make JW a saint).  Freedom was never a motivation after Parabellum anymore.  He wanted to grieve alone. 

Pistols I think brought the scene and the ending a bit more tension then a fight scene would have brought in my opinion.  Both were great shooters and you got the sense that they really didn't want to kill each other.  If you noticed the places that were hit were the same places the keymaster Dr guy told John to hit him to make it look good.  Did you want Winston to die or Cain's daughter to die? How could this end and marquise be brought down within the ""rules"".

Those are the only parts about your comment that I disagree with. That being said, I do agree that some of the falls and other things were way over the top but in a sense the fact that he did get up and how tired and beat up he was by the top of the stairs lent into the feeling that... He was a force of sheer will and focus.",2023-03-30 04:27:50

Fuck I hate the suits. Takes all the cool out of the fights that the previous movies had. Wick just lifts his jacket up to his jaw and is bulletproof just running into bad guys who can't hit shit.

"The Osaka scene at the ""art room"" area is the worst offender. 

I remember this point where he finishes up all the guys and then 2 more walk in. And he takes like 2-3 minutes to dispatch them with the nunchucks. And then two more comes in after that and he takes, again, 2-3 minutes to dispatch them. So you're like ""Okay, it's over right?"" But then TWO MORE come in. Interminable and repetitive. All with bulletproof suits. 

Regarding the second portion, It's as I said: between 3 and 4, they decided to turn this into a franchise with spin offs. So they couldn't do the epic John vs the High Table movie since that'd end the whole ""universe"" they created. So we end up with people somehow accepting Wick's pointless death? Like, what was the point of surviving 3 full movies? Just so he could kill the replaceable Marquis? Get his freedom and die? Uhhh.... I just can't understand how people can be fine with that. Especially when so many good people died to help him survive. 

I do agree this movie felt very different to the last 3. I heard the ONE reviewer who didn't like the film either refer to Keanu as ""Out of it"" in this film and I kinda agree. It felt like he was autopilot and barely even cared for some reason.",2023-03-26 01:55:36
">they overused the bulletproof suits

It really bugged me that a lot of fights had ""lift jacket side up"" instead of creative ways for John to get to cover. This really got me on the stairs.

Him ducking under the railing from side to side made me realize that scene could have been much cooler if they didn't have these suits.",2023-03-26 10:53:47
The suits are the point. Not everyone can afford/ earn one which is why you didn’t see anyone other than John wearing one for until the third. High table assassins get the bulletproof suits which is prob how John had one already in the first movie.,2023-04-01 11:28:45

The overhead shootout was one of the best things I've watched in an action movie, hands down. The first fight scene of Caine in Osaka was really cool as well, as were some moments you saw him fighting further into the movie. So many good details like him shooting over and over to a certain area after the person is already dead and so on. Feels like the best use of a blind character in an action movie. 

I also liked the water raining down Wick in the nightclub.

But these fight scenes are not enough to fix the many issues with the action in this movie. Or the issues with the CGI and the story. It was all too ridiculous and interminable as you point out.

Forces you too suspend disbelief massively and feels like this movie was made by an entirely different team. We DO know it was written by someone else when compared to the last three films at least.",2023-03-24 15:44:26

> But as far as this goes, you noticing this during your first viewing of the movie concerns me. This is the last thing you should be noticing during the insane gun fights going on in front of you. The drivers/cars are all in the background. You watching those things go on in the back and out of focus says to me that you were wanting to nit-pick this movie for some reason.

Huh?, I noticed the disappearing drivers immediately and honestly whole arc de triomphe scene just felt way too fake and completely took me out. I get it, it's all fake and suspension of disbelief whatever but it was just ramped up way too much in my opinion especially compared to the first John Wick. Even worse was the stair fight, it just got too ridiculous for me at that point. Like really? none of these 100s of trained assassins can land a headshot without john having any cover? 

I get that the series had to evolve from the first, but there were better examples of how to do that *in this movie already*. The hotline miami scene was amazing, the Osaka scene was great (except when henchman just inexplicably come in pairs like 3 minutes apart *3 different times*  apparently just to give John enough time to handle each pair).

""Semi-realistic"" is fine. Some suspension of disbelief is okay. Bulletproof suits? A society that is mostly assassins with no self-preservation instinct? 500+ assasins can't get a headshot? Fine. 

But the end of the 3rd movie and at several points in the 4th movie, they basically just make John Wick into a Marvel character. Why does he need to get hit by so many cars? It is one thing to roll onto the hood of a car. It is another to get hit full speed by a car into the side of a van. 

Why does Cain need to be Daredevil or his character from Rogue One? The doorbell thing was clever, and they could have done some other clever things with the character, but they just gave him superpowers. At least Daredevil and Star Wars have a radioactive accident and the Force to explain the ability to ""see"" without working eyes. And this guy supposedly gave up his eyes fairly recently. Seems to be doing well considering he can 1-shot multiple people from across the room or up a bunch of stairs before they shoot him.

The club fight where everybody in the background continued to dance and party as men were shooting and killing each other was pretty dumb.

Also it's been a while since I've seen them, but I'd say 2 and 3 are worth your time as well. Though you do get bits in 3 that foreshadow some of the dumber stuff in this one.",2023-05-12 19:03:12
"Except it goes against what the first two movies established. Proper round counting, getting hit hurts, no falling off buildings and magically surviving, and everything is done in secret to not draw attention to their society. 

Now guns have unlimited ammo, Wick brushes gun shots off like it's nothing while the people with actual armor are reeling from the pain of being shot, the secret world of assassins make no attempt to hide their existence, the High Table has been elevated to a god like entity with how much power they have, etc. 

The first two arent turn off your brain movies either because the lore remains tight, follows its own rules, you can count rounds, and john acts hurt when hit. The little things that are unrealistic can be easily ignored when everything else feels solid. None of that exists in this movie and is largely lacking in the 3rd as well. 

The director wrongly assumed the first two were only praised for their choreography and has watered the movies down to ""Watch Wick kill a bunch of bad guys who all wait their turn to fight him because when $40m is on the line, you don't want to accidentally hit a comrade"" 

Also, a blind assassin who kills people as easily as Wick does and is expected to win a pistols duel? Are you freaking kidding me?",2023-04-01 18:44:35

Instead everyone is doing their best impression of the hunchback of notre dame and every kill is just a close up headshot or quick knife hit.

"Oh that's the fine print under the contract. Funny that this will work out with only the Marquis man as witness, while for everything else they need markers marked with blood to proof something. Eve for the other guy to remember that he is owed.

While the idea of JW keeping his last shot for the marquis was clever, it was impossible for them to foresee what the Marquis would do. Especially that the Marquis would let the Blind Guy walk before he steps in to shoot JW. 

Also why would the Marquis be allowed to finish off JW legally, if both duelists are still alive and the duell ended in a draw? 

My expectation was that the Blind Guy would JW let him kill him thus being able to legally also kill the Marquis and JW then being able to protect the blind guys daughter with the MArquis gone. But the way they went was unexpected.

"I also thought I was the only one, and so I had to ask here XD but yeah, just to check, I rewatched all previous movies and I can confirm there is a step down on blood and gore. Previous JW were not as violent as the raid 2 but surely on par with the original raid movie (as in, hardcore R levels of violence) , and that's something I loved about them. I have a few theories about why this reduction in gore, all of them for the wrong reasons.  


* Post production suffered because of the pandemic and possibly, some changes on the direction of the franchise, so there was not enough time and resources to invest in blood effects
* There could have been changes in those involved in choreography and those people decided a good amount of gore was just not important
* And the worst possible scenario: they are probing audience reactions to see if they can pull a PG-13 rating for future installments. A proof to support this is the dragon breath scene, as a way to show something spectacular and flashy but keeping it tame to ratings boards. If you think about this, with just a few edits in certain scenes like the Mr. Nobody hand stab, and removing a couple F bombs, this would have been a PG-13 movie easily. I hope this is not the case, that would kill the franchise for me. For a saga obsessed with consequences, I don't like to see portrayals of violence detached from its consequences, specially in these kind of movies that glorify it.

Anyway, any more thoughts or theories on this are welcome, I'd like to know more.",2023-04-03 19:21:53

I know he's a big part of the story. He just felt kinda odd with his acting in the scenes he was in. Still love seeing him show up in Paris etc. I can't quite place why he felt strange to me.

In the other movies there was a lot of subtle killing happening in those scenes that club-goers might not notice quickly. In this one there are people dancing in front of the camera as several people are brutally killed with axes in a highly visible open space. Maybe they thought it was a part of the show, I guess?

For a nearly 3 hour film, I was fine with some of the comedy. I didnt feel like anything was out of place in that regard.

I will say that the weakest part of the film for me was the desert scene - how he found the 3 guys on horses and then the subsequent murder of the man above the table...it was done too quickly, especially after how they were introduced in part 3. The man above the table was said to only be seen if he wanted to be. That was quickly dashed in JW4. It should have been fleshed out better.

The marquee de grammo was a cool concept - the antithesis of babayaga. However, also needed some fleshing out to bring passion to his purpose.

Yes, that WAS the bullshit excuse the movie gave for why they didn't want John Wick to destroy the high table in this movie for no reason. That doesn't mean they couldn't have left that line out and found an excuse for why John Wick COULD successfully kill all of them or something.

About him being slow, John was basically fighting continually from 2 thru 3, like a non stop fight so he was tired af. But yeah 3 put emphasis on martial arts fights, like the knife throwing battle and the slowness felt more realistic to me. 4 was straight up a last samurai battle in a hotel which came off as silly and overproduced, not like The Raid, which why didn't they bring those guys back? Then a Kingpin boss fight after a cheesy fake poker game, the club part was good, but German guy was cheeseball. I liked the fire gun fight but it was top down like a video game and the stair fight was fun but that henchman sucked and him falling down all the stairs was like the movie making fun of itself.

John himself wasn't aware of who Winston was ofc. But it makes alot of sense and it makes Winston a bit of a weirdo father. But it also mirrors John the unparalleled killer to Winston, the brains to the brawns equivalent or whatever."" 


Basically Winston being his father. John being an orphan. Winston put him in that orphanage and raised him to be the way he is. And there was never a point where Winston wouldn't have backed John. He was his father. So that speculation is thrown out of the window.",2023-03-26 23:34:36

such as John shooting chidi who was about to shoot the dog, he knew the pain of losing a dog, he sacrificed killing nobody to save the dog, then the nobody character returns the favor and helps him out.

Nobody is, essentially, John's living legacy, the result of his legend showing the criminal underworld that you don't *have* to play by the bullshit rules and you can just be like him instead. He isn't a wildly important character in the movie's plot events, but he fills a thematic role that helps the movie and adds depth to the John vs. High Table conflict by helping emphasize the *knock-on effects* John has had.

Also none of the wounds looked fatal for him.,2023-03-27 09:44:18
"I felt like they lingered as long as they should have. If they were doing a John Wick death, everything went exactly as it should have imo.",2023-03-27 19:02:54

"It's a great place to stop, not least because of its endings. The sparseness of the lore that was ever explained meant there is so much they could do with it as a franchise though. They are already making the Ballerina spinoff. Having just watched this John Wick 4, I already want to see a prequel about Caine, and a sequel about Akira.

That said, part of the appeal of the series has been that we didn't know that much about the world. Only the bare minimum that we needed to know, and we could imagine the rest for ourselves. That's why I think some people have been unsatisfied by the ending. They might not have any problem with the demise of Wick, but it built such an intriguing world that it feels incomplete.

It's easy to forget that the series is called John Wick - not something broader like Star Wars (but would have faced the same problem if it had been called *Luke Skywalker*). He's dead, and the story is over.",2023-04-06 02:38:54
"Wow yeah, the director so far has only done the John Wick movies, whereas his co-director from the first one, David Leitch has branched out to a Fast and Furious movie, the  Deadpool sequel, *Atomic Blonde* and most recently *Bullet Train*.",2023-04-09 04:03:52

After John they are about to start asking for a lot fucking more lmao. He singlehandedly created a job shortage,2023-04-04 22:13:55
I want to scene about the fallout of one of these massacres. Are there entire clubs that are just weirdly empty the next day because it was the hangout spot for 100 now-dead henchmen?  Do they all get buried in one long line of funeral plots?  Are there ex-girlfriends just sitting around crying about how their bf and 50 of his friends all got slaughtered?,2023-04-06 02:38:52
They recycle within the same movie. Shaggy haired bearded guys become clean shaven monks in other scenes. And now they have storm troopers so they don't have to worry for those scenes.,2023-03-26 01:03:10
John wick himself was also an orphan I think,2023-03-27 06:46:50

"I was thinking the same thing. By the Paris part I would be like “this is not worth even that much. He has destroyed everyone”. 

It almost would have been cool story wise if no one responds to the Paris call and John is on edge waiting but nothing happens. Marquis freaks out",2023-03-24 16:21:23

"I know that I may not be a top tier deadly assassin confident in my abilities. But if I KNEW all about John Wick, which everyone in this universe does, and I got an alert on my phone that there was a contract on his head?

I saw 140 in another comment.,2023-03-26 01:26:10
Yes but he could have walked away like John asked him to. In reality what did it was that he tried to kill John after he killed his sister.,2023-03-25 19:46:21
He was already his second though. I don't know if the proxy can be someone other than the second.,2023-03-25 04:09:44
Yes,2023-12-31 04:32:53
Bill freed Caine after he grabbed the gun and stepped into the duel,2023-03-29 05:26:31

"The problem is that it implies that either his aim is so insanely good he intentionally missed John's vitals on the first couple of shots, or he was actually trying to kill him and John was just really really lucky.",2023-10-14 04:42:54

"I don’t think so, 
Where he got hit at (between neck and shoulder, and left lower side above hip) are the same spots the doc told John to shoot to make it “look like he fought back” 

We see the dog at the grave scene pick up a something, 

And John’s work isn’t done, the high table sent somebody after him, he only killed that guy, he didn’t get revenge on the high table (which is his only motivator) 

So I don’t think we have seen the last of wick yet, he still has vengeance to claim.",2023-03-26 00:36:26

That dude was 100% a weird German version of Marvel's Kingpin.,2023-03-25 21:54:56
I loved that - that his size ended up being a strength against John Wick.  Because that motherfucker was BRUTE FORCE.,2023-03-25 05:04:20

Man was incredibly light on his feet for his size. I'm reminded of all the videos I've seen of people his weight doing back flips or ballerina routines.,2023-03-24 04:41:50

it was the best fight on this movie,2023-03-24 21:51:56

"Seconded on alternate universe. The only police in the entire series are the ones that showed up to John's house because of disturbances/the fire in the first two films, and the only cop among them that has speaking lines is very much aware of John's line of work and treats it extremely casually. 

Every single character we see - not extras, characters - is part of the underworld in some way, except for three characters who exist to provide motivation for assassins (John's wife, Sofia's daughter in JW3 who exists only in a photograph, and Cain's daughter). There are effectively no civilians and no civilian authority to speak of. The cops never show up to any of these gigantic fight scenes, the only consequences that come from open violence are ones that come from other aspects of the underworld. No one ever talks about hiding their activities from the police, the concept of jail or prison seemingly does not exist, nobody is afraid of it. There's those clean up guys that hide bodies, but considering how big the threat of reprisals from other criminals are it's clearly more for their sake than for any legal troubles. The High Table is extremely powerful and is effectively the only real legal authority that is relevant in the John Wick universe. 

It really hammers home how difficult it is to escape this life, because the very *concept* of a civilian life doesn't even get shown on screen or is ever relevant to the story. It makes the underworld seem all-pervasive and totalizing, a normal life seemingly doesn't even exist, hence why everyone treats it like it's completely impossible to achieve. Every time you think you're dealing with the ""real world"" and John seemingly interacts with a civilian, it's revealed to just be another part of the underworld. There's no regular NY taxi driver, he takes Continental coins and knows Wick's name. There's no regular ranting homeless guy, they all work for the Bowery king. The camera never follows any panicking extra, no goon takes one as a hostage, John never speaks to one or finds out their names or what they want or how they sound, and so many of them could be assassins in disguise waiting to pounce.

You could even argue that the civilian world *literally* does not exist. There is nothing in the films that actively contradicts that. If you go in the films imagining this as a world quite literally and openly ruled by the High Table - like, there's no US government, no EU, none of that exists, the world is *actually* run by some ancient mafia-assassin feudal system and the average Joe is fully aware of this if not a gang member themselves - then so far nothing breaks that assumption.",2023-05-17 21:17:55

"John Wick spin-off idea: It's the shadowy assassin department dealing with covering up their increasingly ridicolous stunts. Make it like the office, except they're dealing with trying to sell you the Paris attack as like... gas explosion or something.",2023-04-19 07:14:47
Even continental being leveled. I really love the first movie because it felt like an underground world in the shadows. Last three movies everything happens out in the open.,2023-04-24 02:47:59
i feel like that's mainly a result of the writers changing,2023-03-26 23:14:19

They probably have diplomatic inmmunity or something,2023-05-16 03:10:11
it's not even that. It's basically an NPC machine running them into Keanu's gun and fists.  It's total trash,2023-07-11 14:02:16
The masked and armored High Table soldiers in Osaka are also like Tekken Force!,2023-03-27 19:58:39
wow. the entire plot in 3 sentences.,2023-07-15 22:51:59
I’m specifically talking about that top-down scene.,2023-03-25 20:20:04
"I really like the contrast of how practically everyone character in this movie is super witty or poetic except John lol.

I absolutely LOVED some of Hiroyuki Sanada's lines.

""Don't insult my gift to you"" or something that makes John give up at attempting to fight with him, because he respects the culture.

I forget, but right before he and Donnie fight, he says something like ""if you think that, you really are blind"" or something with that gist.  Help me out Redditors, Hiroyuki had some really poetic lines.",2023-03-26 03:27:07
I loved that scene. Three expert assassins forced into a poker game.  Briefly bonding over their host bullshit  theatrics (and cheating ass. ),2023-03-25 22:36:27
"Right, I followed that but he still seemed to just ride off into the night without a final word or request",2023-04-03 05:28:06
That’s literally why he was there. The stunt coordinator really likes working with dogs.,2023-04-30 14:06:09
Donnie Yen pov would be really dark movie though.,2023-03-25 18:06:11
They can take down the high table.,2023-03-25 06:39:48
John wick died.  But the babayaga lives on.  Burning the table to the ground for all the pain it's caused.  Calling it.  You see his dog look off into the distance?  John might be dead. But the boogeyman is not,2023-03-26 01:41:32
"I agree. 5 would have to be even bigger than this, and I can't see how that'd work out. Focusing on other characters lets them explore interesting ideas more freely without having to worry about topping the last movie.",2023-03-25 02:59:27
I wouldn’t mind seeing sort of an origin story for John Wick and how he managed to create these friendships. Seeing him do the Impossible Task would be rad.,2023-03-28 04:32:28
Originally they were going to shoot this and a 5th film back to back. I can't help but wonder if the reason this film is so long is that they combined the scripts for both films into one.,2023-03-25 11:28:09
"I honestly think them announcing 5 was a way to keep the spoiler of him dying from getting out and gaining traction (if anything, if it is a real movie then that is just the working title of a spin off movie - not an actual John wick movie)",2023-03-25 04:47:34
They were planning on shooting back to back...but honestly I think they just combined them and we got a super movie,2023-03-26 00:37:44
I think an animated movie/series of his impossible task would be cool,2023-03-27 14:40:38
yep! need more of marcus too,2023-03-27 16:55:05
"Doesn't he get shot in the same places the doctor tells him to shoot so it looks like he struggled but wouldn't be lethal? We never see his dead body, just slumps over from exhaustion. According to Reservoir Dogs, getting shot in the stomach takes hours to die from. He's spent 4 movies not even bruising or getting scratched from blunt force trauma that is usually lethal. If they really wanted to drive home a death they could have had him shot in the chest or head or had an open casket funeral scene. If the deal was he was free to live his life and be left alone, wouldn't faking his death make sense as part of that?

Have you ever seen any TV or movie series cause unless Bones confirms he’s dead and then blows his head off on screen he can come back.,2023-03-26 22:08:19
"I hope he stays dead & yeah, Gary Bettman does suck.",2023-04-01 20:49:13
"If they want Keanu to stay in this franchise till he's like 80, I wouldn't be surprised if he does end up in a trainer position or like taking over the Continental maybe. Not sure how that would work but it wouldn't surprise me if they try to pull something like that.",2023-03-28 02:47:15
That would be a godawful cliche,2023-03-26 04:42:31
"There was a line about him having nothing to kill for, die for, or Live for, he’s just… there. The thing fueling Wick’s life was revenge, he was finally set free and could rest.",2023-03-24 04:27:58
"Yeah 100%, I loved this movie to bits until the last 3 minutes. It felt like I was being trolled, the events as they played out felt really out of place, really contrradictory to the rest of the movie. What the fuck was the point of the duel if in the end all he got out of it was... killing the Marquis? Which was his plan before he found out about the duel thing anyway? The only real answer to that is getting Winston re-instated / his hotel back, but there's so much wrong with that, the whole ""your second in the duel gets a wish too!"" felt completely contrived.

It felt like the films were leading up to a revolution against the High Table of some sort, or at least a significant restructuring of the system, with many characters in the story seemingly being very displeased with it. But no all we got at the end was Winston goes back to working under the High Table, John Wick is dead, his efforts in the last 2 movies were pointless, and he might as well have died at the end of John Wick 2 after killing D'Antonio at the continental.",2023-03-24 21:20:31
"TBH it feels like a pretty tragic and almost nihilistic ending. John Wick killed hundreds of people over the course of these movies, and for what? Is literally anyone better off after all of that? He didn't overthrow the high table and change the system, he didn't save anyone's life, and he didn't achieve his wife's wish for him to live and find happiness again. Everyone who died pretty much died for nothing. If this was a more philosophical series about the waste of meaningless violence it could work, but feels wrong for a series like John Wick. I loved the movie but I feel like this movie threw out any thematic meaning to the wonderful action.",2023-03-25 06:58:36
I agree. Also so much of the first two are about how John wants to live to keep her memory alive.,2023-03-24 04:36:01
I assumed it would be a fake out,2023-03-24 04:29:11
"But he died a free man with no obligations to the table. He was always going to die but he gets to die as the man his wife loved, the one who was out of the criminal world.",2023-03-24 15:56:40
"I agree. Loved the movie, but the ending was very disappointing.",2023-03-24 19:41:45
I feel so mixed like it’s John fucking wick!!! How the hell can my mans die? It was a good sendoff but come on! The allure of Wick was because he’s “the boogeyman” and seems like this completely unkillable character and he goes out like that maaaaan that’s bogus. Even if he is dead I refuse to believe it,2023-03-24 19:43:45
"The first film and him getting a new dog felt like a life reaffirming to me, everything fell apart but he was able to pick up the pieces and when everything fell apart he found something to love, something to live for outside of the killing.

And the third film ditches the dog and kind of ends where it starts.

Lawrence fishburn and Ian McShane were barely wicks friends in the previous films and he died for the freedom so they could what? Start more killing. The high table can't replace Bill skarsguard because of a duel? The high table still exists, its in the movie.

The film chooses a ending where John ended up dying to continue the cycle of violence that started everything, but its framed as a good thing? Why.

I liked the action but this is the weakest John wick plot wise, 1 and 2 both were very rich in theme and style and this film ends with the completely subtless ""Is he in heaven or hell"" ""IDK"". 

Probably hell if you look at it seriously at all, im no Christian but the methods of execution of Johns will far outway any good hes done, and Winston's continental will be part of his legacy that will probably do little good for the world.

It will be good for the spinoffs tho",2023-03-29 04:17:00
"What's the point in faking his death after he literally escaped the world of assassins? We've spent four movies showing how much they're obsessed with rules. They told him he's out. No reason to fake his death. He's dead, it's the perfect ending. Bringing him back after those scenes on the steps would feel so cheap.",2023-03-24 12:25:01
"For the entire four movies, I never expected anything other than it ending with his death. Nothing else fits.",2023-03-25 22:30:30
"Him dying fulfills what Winston was talking about early in the film; they made a martyr, a hero who shook the table that others can now attempt to imitate. Him being 'dead' is perhaps better for the cause, he can do as much damage as a legend as he could a man.",2023-03-24 10:29:11
"Also, we’ve been building towards meeting and destroying the high table for the last 3 movies and then he just dies after killing someone he met 10 scenes ago? The series doesn’t make any sense if he actually is dead.

Also where are the characters from the other movies? They just show up and disappear by the next movie. 

Future movies can still save the franchise, but for now without tying the movies together its just another soulless action franchise. 

Getting blue-balled on this one.",2023-03-24 04:39:26
He wanted to die a free man. The man that Helen knew.,2023-03-25 02:45:54
"His freedom meant he could die as he originally intended & wanted for his life with Helen; out of the job, and as a loving husband only beside his wife forever (as keep in mind had he died on the job under the table he most certainly would have been made a guest for a dinner reservation and not get a proper burial, especially since the goal was to ensure he didn't become a martyr)

Since everything else was taken from him, this was the very last thing - the only thing - he could obtain from his ideal life.",2023-03-25 04:50:35
"You think a man like that heals and goes and lives on a farm watching the sun rise on a grateful universe?

Even if Marquis was obnoxious, they hammered it in pretty well that there is nothing for him to really live for.

He's an assassin. Sometimes the ending isn't happy.

BUT the franchise prints money like the Fed and there is a lot of universe intact. Bowery King, New York is back, Osaka. Who knows.",2023-03-26 05:57:55
I think there was multiple lines in the film that explained his situation pretty clearly to me tbh. He’s lost everything and at this point really has nothing to live for. The only way he’s “getting out” of this violent life is by dying and John Wick is no saint. But at least he acheived the one thing he’s really good at “revenge”. And was buried next to his wife.,2023-04-09 08:23:41

[Chad disagrees.](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/john-wick-chapter-4-ending-chad-stahelski-ending-1235359772/amp/),2023-03-26 01:16:30
"I've seen several replies with people saying the movies built towards an overthrow of the table and having just watched all 4 movies now, John nor any of the other characters expressed a desire to overthrow the High Table. John broke the rules in 2 and for 3 and 4 he spends it all looking for a way out of the consequences. With both 3 and 4 giving him a way out, but having to kill a friend to do so (the Elder asks John to kill Winston as well as pledge himself back in 3 and in this movie he has to kill Caine in a duel). But 4 ends with a clever scheme that should've definitively gotten him out without having to kill a friend, but ends with him dying anyway. 

Otherwise, I agree. Like if he just died at the end of 2 none of friend's lives would've been at risk in the first place. They even get pissed at him for asking for help or putting his assassin friend's in the position to kill him. Even Akira gets pissed at him for even showing up.",2023-03-27 07:52:47
"I think those are good points, but the main thing for me is that John just wanted to die as a regular dude. Even if it’s dumb and symbolic that’s what he was stated to want, he would have killed himself in the first movie if Helen hadn’t gifted him the dog. In the third movie he could hardly even make an answer as to why he wants to live so bad and there’s seemingly a theme of him fighting without a clear cause. 

They also said in the movie that if John won the duel it would somehow shake the foundation of the high table. I think the fact that John was able to break free, no strings attached after killing the elder and wreaking untold havoc against the table is a huge message to others. Winston even said that John would do more damage by twisting the rules against the table than if he tried to kill all of them.",2023-03-25 19:38:08

"Yeah I know that, haha. As a saying though, I'm trying to understand it. 

Is it more like ""(to most people) friendship means little when it is convenient""?

I can't recall the context that made him say it, and I only watched the movie a few hours ago lol.",2023-03-24 23:34:53
"The last scene we saw him in before he showed up for the stairs. I think it was the meeting with the Marquis. He finished his drink (as I recall), set it down and his hands brushed by a pencil.

"The Berlin club shows almost the same angle and cuts as the Red Circle, but you can see the difference in John's face. In JW1 he was focused, ready, deadly. In JW4 he looks weary. He knows he is stuck inside this endless samsara of violence, which is another theme JW3 brought to us: a whole lot of miles, rivers of blood, missing ring finger, all for nothing.

I felt like a fussy old man leaving the theater, but I said something to the manager on the way out. I've absolutely been to IMAX movies before, and it was never cranked this loud.  He just said some cheesy buzzwords ""big picture, big sound"" and said they don't change the settings which are set to a certain specification.

He's now retired as he originally intended, spending his days working on a classic car, walking his dog, and quietly mourning his wife and the life he never got to have.  Doing little acts of penance here and there and keeping his head down.  He put up a good fence and a security system to keep drunken Russian monsters from accidentally stumbling into his path again.  

But try as he might, something keeps nagging at him from the back of his mind.  He can't find peace, and it takes a former acquaintance stumbling into his life one day to reveal to him what it is: that world still exists, and it is still out there destroying lives.  And he won't be able to rest until it's torn down.",2023-03-29 03:08:19

I don't see this being discussed but it really seems like that's what Chapter 3 was setting up and they scrapped it for this movie.

Especially with the whole ""high table vs NYC"" theme 3 had going.

"I disagree with this. The first film has more emotions from John because he's still accustomed to being ""out"". He's fresh off a life where he could afford to show emotions and do things besides killing. Him getting less and less emotional during the series shows that he's sinking further back into the lifestyle that had him as a cold-blooded killer. John's back to being a robot with the sole mission of killing whoever he needs to.

That's just my take, anyway.",2023-03-24 06:00:06

"It's crazy what they're doing with this series.  I (and probably most other people) went into Chapter 3 fully expecting it to be the end of the series, because hey, trilogies.  I got to the end just to realize that nope, there's going to be more.  Then I went into this one expecting that it won't be the end, because how many quadrilogies are there out there (not counting the trilogies that got a random sequel 20 years later)?  Not many.

I honestly don't know what to think.  If this is the end to John Wick's story, great.  I'm satisfied.  I know there's more to this universe that we'll be exploring in The Continental and Ballerina (and there could be dozens more spinoffs).  But if we end up getting a John Wick 5 (and 6, and 7, etc), I'll be perfectly fine with that too.",2023-03-24 14:20:33

"> these guys could clearly write another five of these

You see I don't feel like they can. John Wick 3 and now 4 have sort of confirmed for me that the writers really didn't know where to take the story beyond John being hunted by The High Table for killing Santino in JW2. That's not to say its bad writing, but they did sort of paint themselves into a corner by ending JW2 the way they did. 

But the problem didn't start with the ending of JW2, it started with the story for JW3. I honestly think they should have combined the story for JW3 and JW4 together. The first half is John on the run, the second half is John fighting to get to the duel. At some point they were gonna run out of ideas of where to take the story, there's barely four films worth of story here already let alone nine or ten films worth of story. 

And that's not to mention the action scenes. How do they keep the films fresh and exciting when each film goes bigger and bolder than the previous film when it comes to the action. Again at some point they were gonna run out of unique ideas for the action scenes. There's only so many ways you can make a gunfight or fist fight or sword fight or car chase feel fresh. 

I honestly think the best thing for Keanu and Chad could do now is just focus on the spin-offs, and end the John Wick series on a high note, than trying to top the last one. Let's face Chad can write his own ticket now and I'll be there day one for whatever projects he does after this. I'm really excited for his Rainbow Six film, one thing will be for certain, the action is gonna be awesome.",2023-03-25 01:11:29
"Exactly. It's better to go out on top as one of the best action series of all time then rolling the dice on John Wick 5-8 and eventually going too far.

Though, I thought there was talk of a fifth one at one point. So maybe they decided to call the game now and combine ideas they had for 5 with 4. Could explain the longer run time.",2023-03-24 02:36:09

"What a disappointing and meaningless end to his character arc. Died to save Caine in a duel John himself requested, knowing full well the Marquis could appoint a challenger in his place and already had Caine working for him. All in order to grant his freedom from the organization he was fighting against. So to die right after you gain your freedom is pointless. He could have died in the beginning and saved everyone in Osaka. Now he's dying to save a man who he KNOWS is targeted by Akira. Everyone who died along the way was a waste. If he is going to accept death, why did he endanger so many people around him?

I think you were absolutely right about changing the original story to continue the universe in spin-offs. Maybe Keanu didn't want to do it anymore either. 

I read an interview with the director and he said that the excess of the fights was part of a ""gag"". That the audience is in on the humor of the ridiculous nature of the drawn out fights. He mentioned how he wanted to subvert expectations with Killa running away from John and not just starting a fight. But then he ultimately fights John, so that doesn't work. 

From the interview I read, it sounded like the director wasn't taking it too seriously and just wanted to have fun. Which is fine, but it's further proff that this franchise has gone into Fast and Furious territory where the writers and crew just want to make an over the top action movie instead of presenting a realistic depiction of this criminal/assassin world. I think the progression of the franchise is following Fast and Furious very closely with each installment getting more and more unrealistic until we have Caine sword fighting some henchmen on the moon. This isn't the direction I wanted for John Wick, as the films were enjoyable to me specifically because they tended to avoid the absurd action movie tropes. Though admittedly, Chapter 2 started to dip it's toes into unrealistic, and Chapter 3 doubled down. Now Chapter 4 makes 3 looks better. 

As for John being dead, regardless of what anyone says, the character will come back when needed. They went out of their way to not show a dead body, only Winston and the King at his grave, the dog perked up, Wintson refusing to answer if he's in heaven or hell and then they both laugh. He's ""dead"" until they need him for the box office. I wouldn't be surprised if he pops up in an after credits scene of whatever comes next. Neo ""died"" in Matrix 3 and they found an excuse to dust him off for a 4th. I'm certain we will get an old man Wick movie in 6-8 years after some of the spin-offs fail to capture the magic.",2023-03-26 16:39:26

"Just wanted to let you know I walked out of the theater feeling exactly the same way. I was honestly stunned to see the reviews that praised the movie. Cinematography was undoubtedly amazing, but everything else that makes John Wick movies actually good was thrown out the window. In particular, that Arc d’Triomphe car battle sequence is where the movie officially lost me completely.",2023-04-07 05:57:56
"Just to a point of the adjudicator it seems that this part of the story is where things elevated past what the adjudicator does. The marquis is the ""prime"" adjudicator if you will given the leeway to do as needed to kill JW with the elder being dead as opposed to the other one.

Yeah it was kind of dumb to see a different elder and not get the ring back. As someone mentioned before it felt like a loose end to tie up from the 3rd as he is now healed.

So from a lot of your posts I get it. Your ability to want to enjoy the movie is tied to it's believable action sequences and zero plot holes.  There are some things I agree with, some I don't , and I don't necessarily think that all of these are dumb.",2023-03-30 04:37:35

"Thanks from me, too, for writing this out. I very much enjoyed the movie, but  I always come to reddit to find a comment which would put my uneasy feelings into words and your assessment was that this time. The flaws you point out are valid and sometimes it took me out from immersion, because of how dumb some of them looked. For me the constant hiding behind the suit was too much, the dog attacks got boring the 3rd time and you could see from miles away that the tracker will end up on John's side, because of the dog. The movie was interestingly less bloody/brutal than the previous movies, no gut wrenching deaths, only the usual action movie quick deaths. Did someone count the 3 minutes from the bottom of the stairs? It felt more. Anyway, I enjoyed it, but the first two was the highpoints of the franchise.",2023-04-10 05:12:13

">The suits are the point.

The point being? Making the fights look stupid? Great point and sure driven home hard.",2023-11-04 21:45:49
"I'd like to think of some of the fight scenes as video game inspired. The scenes you mention were ""boss fights"" and the most enjoyable of part of the film. for me.

The first fight scene with Caine in Osaka was him against the top henchmen of the Osaka branch. Caine had to use his quirky gadgets to assist in fighting stronger opponents.  Meanwhile in Berlin, the Boss had multiple fight stages. The boss will use his inhaler after each stage until John finally knocks him dead. 

I felt lots of the smaller fights were fatiguing, but necessary. The Marquis represents the entire weight of the organization. The Marquis spared no expense in trying to take John out every step of the way, in Japan and Paris.  Note, we don't see many goons chasing him in Berlin because he is in his family's territory.

In Paris, we have the  Marquis' home territory. So it kind of makes sense that the whole entire city of goons would try to hunt him down on the request of the boss of the city. Similar to what happened in NYC.",2023-03-29 10:40:30
I didnt notice any CG in the last act aside from the final green screen. And one bad green screen isn't going to sully the thrill ride that was the previous 2hrs35 minutes of the film lol,2023-04-03 02:05:08
"FWIW I definitely agree on the bulletproof suits. The choreography was generally great, though some of the grapples looked odd or awkward. But I wasn’t entertained much because the action lacked the brutality and efficiency that I think defined a lot of the earlier movies. 

It just went on and on, and because of the suits there is no tension and it’s weird that out of hundreds of bullets not a single one hit his hand or face? It was also hilarious in the stair scenes several times he’s standing on a step reloading or looking around and you see bullets hitting the street lights and such, and not a single one even glances him and he wasn’t even trying to hide or duck at all. Ignoring all the suspension of disbelief of the cars/falls etc. 

Regardless, 90% of the fighting is holding his arm to his face and shooting. The nun-chucks were great, but the shooting scenes (besides hotline miami) were exhausting and I had already scene hours of this in the entire series. Felt creativity in previous movies was a lot better. Not saying it was all slosh, there were some entertaining moments. But definitely not seeing it as some action piece masterpiece that some think it is. Oh well.",2023-03-26 03:30:58

Too often it felt like people we waiting for Keanu to recover. A more recent gold standard is a movie like The Raid, where it's just relentless brutal and doesn't come off as fighters working through a dance.

Post first movie, everything went to sideways with suit, over the top blunt force trauma, over the top gun scenes, and zero plot moving forward. Imo they could’ve made John came close or even killing one of the table, explore how the table was so influential, how the police generally stayed out to give audience a sense of forward motion. 

This 4th instalment greatly under-utilised bill as the main villain imo. Could’ve made him more over the top, ambitious, desire to rival napoleon, more cunning, more sadistic, but he was flat, rich white spoiled kid with no charistimatic viggo to balance out. 

Still I enjoyed it somewhat",2023-03-25 07:56:28

"Well to each their own, I personally loved the fight sequences but I get where you're coming from, the gun fight sequences felt a little too long and repetitive sometimes so maybe that's why you didn't like it so much.

Just like a video  game! The dead always disappear when you go back. So many similarities like the overhead view Osaka. Maybe this is the matrix,2023-04-01 12:09:37

"Explain why John wouldn't have just killed the tracker when he first met him. 

The Tracker made it clear his intention was to kill John once the bounty was high enough. Why would John just leave him be with everything else going on.

"The weird thing is that The Elder just feels like such a pointless character since moments after John kills him, Winston is told that the twelve members of the High Table granted the Marquis war powers so he can finally kill John. The way they tell it in JW3 they make it seem like he's the head of The High Table, but in JW4 he's killed off and The High Table is still a massive threat. It's very confusing as to what his role actually is.",2023-03-25 02:12:56
"Yeah, JW4 feels like a complete celebration of the genre. The Good, The Bad and The Ugly was why he chose to have a main trio of characters for the film, plus Mr. Nobody's character is very inspired by The Man with No Name and all the duel stuff is very Leone. Stahelski also cited Barry Lyndon as a influence for the duel and the epic scale, and then there's all the other homages to Lawrence of Arabia, The Warrios, The Killer, Zatoichi, Sammo Hung, the radio station being named WUXIA, and on and on",2023-03-24 12:35:39

In this movie, I think they hinted at him having trained back into shape. But that ""training"" scene is done pretty lazily and forgettable. Like just some shots of him hitting a pole with a rope wrapped around it.

Outside of that the fights were indeed lazy and repetitive though. Just send in small wave after small wave (like 2\~4 people at a time) of mostly faceless mooks, like some terrible version of WH: Vermintide.",2023-05-25 22:43:46

"Technically correct. I am wrong, but can you see where I'm coming from? 


We don't 'see' him 'follow' John anywhere,  he appears at the places John is at when he's in the most danger at a convenient time.


I'd argue that character was created as a Deus ex machina - john is here, how do we get him out? They know that shit is unsatisfying so they just let us know that ""hey guys our protagonist can get himself in unwinnable situations unlike the last movies because we wrote a character that will show up and save him 100%. We didn't name him, he has no past, no future no story, he has no personal emotional or motivational beats other than 'dog owner', he exists purely to save john, and even when he gets dragged into the plot a little more with the knife hand scene he still just shows up randomly in the correct place at the correct time to take the correct shot.""


Only character actually using a ranged weapon at range, he just breaks so many of the fun rules the franchise setup to make the action good, can find John better than the godlike abilities of the high table, John has never noticed this weird guy following him around with a dog when he's globe trotting?

I noticed a lot of scenes where a henchman could've shot a gun or some something, but instead kept falling around on the floor or took a second long to get back up.

"There's probably something in the rules that lets the first take the place of his second. The Marquis did say he invoked the ""coup de grace"" rule, so I'm assuming that means the first can tell the second to move aside, he is taking over now.

All we saw was John Wick passing out on the stairs, then we see a gravestone. There's no proof he died. My guess is he faked his death so that some new arbitrary rule could not be created by the High Table to draw him back in, or some person from his past with a marker could not force him to do their bidding.",2023-03-26 02:41:19

I would hate a watered down john wick, nobody needs that. when i watched the first venom movie, all i could think of is how badly the venom character would need an 18+ rating and show us the brutality that this character clearly has in mind. i think venom would be a perfect candidate for a brutal and violent 18+ movie but its not gonna happen. and yeah, i didnt watch venom 2.

As for the rest of the john wick world, I also agree that there's definitely more to tell, and I'm looking forward to it through other characters.",2023-03-27 11:43:43

"Reminds me of Space Hulk: Death Wing. Vermintide and Darktide have random mooks or large groups standing around, and every now and then horde waves will attack. Horde waves will generally last a few minutes each apart from map events. And you can cleave through mooks like butter. Then there's Death Wing...where ""waves"" consist of 3\~5 enemies running at you at a time for 10 minutes straight, and it takes a good few seconds to dispatch each of them. It's a mediocre slogfest of almost constant ""action"", but nothing to really get that adrenaline going.

Yeah I agree also though I don't think John will be actually dead for good.  I think they will make it that he faked death.

The final hour of 4 is almost nonstop action, and a huge chunk of the first two hours is action as well. I assume the new one has the most kills.

I think John realized the only way he could get out of this life was to fake his death. Then nobody could make him work for them anymore, not the High Table, not the group he rejoined, not someone from his past with a marker.",2023-03-26 12:37:44

That being said he DID kill the the shot caller right at the beginning of the movie but it changed nothing.

So instead he had to use their own rules against them.

And yes, many people died because of John Wick. Then again, that's been the running theme throughout ALL of the movies. He's not a hero. He's an anti-hero at best, a ruthless mass murderer at worst.",2023-03-25 13:17:56

If you assume (big assumption) that their plans for #4 and #5 stayed relatively the same (changing a few details, of course) and they just mixed them together into this movie, you can easily see different setpieces that they could have cut at.

Osaka is a movie-ender already in terms of setpiece quality. If you told me a draft of JW4 ended with John beating Caine in Osaka as the final boss, I could absolutely believe it. Berlin ending with John reinstated into the family and challenging a High Table member to a duel is a movie-ending plot point. John fighting his way through Paris could be expanded easily and made into multiple setpieces with differing styles and could make up much of a movie already.",2023-04-04 12:39:33

"it's also worth noting that he was not born blind, but he gave his eyes to serve the table. which means, he probably was already very good at shooting before becoming blind. it's muscle memory especially for shooting straight. like nba players shooting free throws with their eyes closed.",2023-06-09 08:13:56

I think they purposefully left in such a way he could be dead and it would be a good end to his story but they could easily have him survive with the lore of previous movies backing it up in case they want to make another.,2023-05-30 12:15:01

if you do a quick Google they said they were going to shoot 4 and 5 at the same time. that's why I'm here reading what other ppl think because whatever asspull they're going to use for the start of 5 is going to ruin what feels to be a complete story at this point,2023-04-16 03:20:08

Goes down two flights, oh maybe he'll be able to recover, nope nope nevermind, oh theres a fairy gone, and another and another, oh more flights of stairs, okay well there goes the rest of your fairies, oh wait hes stopped rolling!

Oooooh oh but hes finally at the bottom. Annnnnnnnd hes dead, wait, Miphas Grace! Yeaaaaaa boi!",2023-03-25 06:03:09
Everyone getting hit by cars and getting back up was great too! Felt like they were making a point about how little it affected John in the previous films lol,2023-03-25 00:21:23
"That scene was so comical - not in a *bad* way, but it made me question if it was intentional or not lmao. The way he just kept tumbling and tumbling I swear sometimes it looked like he specifically accelerated is rolling on the spaces between the stairs.",2023-04-06 19:38:34
Hello?  I've had a bit of a tumble.,2023-03-24 14:07:32

Kicked his ass BADLY. He went down 8 flights (7 at once!).,2023-05-26 21:47:54
"Some aspects of the movie disappointed me since these are specialist assassin's trained, and some are the best there are out there, but couldn't John slow his fall from stairs even a little bit? Or grab onto something, it felt bad but it was also fun. But it didn't feel like he roll with it to get less damage like when he jumped over a car but still gets hit",2023-06-18 12:54:50
"Not that it makes it realistic suddenly, but come on now, that was NOT the same height as one of the open areas on top of the Continental hotel.",2023-03-26 06:46:12

You think he's really dead?,2023-03-26 21:22:48

"Yeah. Super beautiful sets and production. But the fight choreographies - and the move from efficiency to ballet - pulled me right out of it at least a handful of times.

The amount of times a bad guy stood still for seconds and then just positioned their head to be hit made it look amateurish to me.",2023-03-27 11:28:07
It was a big oof but I feel like the fat dude from the opening who just wanted to crawl home and regret his life choices while some Japanese chick was climbing him with knives was a hard way to die.,2023-03-25 21:56:01

I love how they decided to give him the Colin Farrell as Oswald Cobblepot look. The man looks completely unrecognizable.,2023-03-24 20:39:30
Had no idea that was him until the credits rolled.  Just figured it was some popular German actor I wasn't familiar with.  Damn fine job all around creating that character.,2023-03-24 06:56:55
I remembered he was in the film but sort of forgot… until he started doing those kicks. Signature Scott Adkins kicks.,2023-03-25 09:44:13
What?!  That's him?!  How is he a better actor in a fat suit and prosthetics than in his regular form?  I thought he killed it!,2023-03-26 01:36:02
"Whaaaaat! Holy shit now I see it. Those filthy kicks make a ton of sense now.

Appropriate, since I've long felt that John Wick is essentially a modern take on the wuxia genre.

"I interpreted it as ""John Wick"" is dead. But the he is still alive.

They also hinted at this with his family scene imo",2023-03-24 03:33:44
"This is the 4 and 5 back-to-back in one film, that's why it's so long. Those were the pre-COVID and pre Matrix delaying the release date plans.

Everything Chad has said recently in interviews denotes that this is the ""end"" they wanted, but it's not like story is that rigid a factor in the JW series so they'll come back when they feel like it and money talks. 

I doubt John is dead but them wanting a break and Chad having a lot of other projects to get to is probably the bigger reason why JW5 is less likely. By the time they feel like getting back to it, Keanu will probably be in his late 60s and the only way they could go about it is one final Old Man Wick or and a passing of the torch",2023-03-24 05:53:39
"Those plans were scrapped after COVID, I feel like they combined 4 and 5 into this film. It seems Chad is done with it and wants to focus on his other projects now",2023-03-24 04:19:31
"I don’t know. These movies are known for doing things the right way. And having John on the stepS. Mirroring the start of the first film. With footage, him swimming in memories of his wife. Kind of a perfect ending. Would hope him coming back doesn’t take away from that. Would love to find a couple more dedicated actors an audience can get behind like they do with Keanu to continue it on.",2023-03-24 04:32:14
"> They already had plans to film JW 4 and 5 back-to-back. 

I assumed they then combined the events into JW4 hence the long runtime.",2023-03-24 15:41:59
"I really hope they don't. A 5th would feel like Toy Story 4: sure it could still be good, but why spoil a perfect ending?

Plus Keanu can't do this stuff forever.",2023-03-24 04:52:11
"John Wick is the flagship of Lionsgate, they literally can’t afford to end it.",2023-03-24 05:43:47
"I’m thinking they blended 4 and 5 together after Stihelski and Reeves decided to take a break, and that John Wick dying was originally going to happen at the end of 5",2023-03-24 12:23:12
"No way he is dead. This has to be something similar to the dark knight rises. John’s car is still being repaired and no way they left that out. So he probably is living peacefully somewhere else, maybe in Monaco or something, like Bruce Wayne",2023-03-25 03:30:56
"They have it set up so they can explain how he's back and what the film will be about. The Rat King mentions how he already had a gravestone and his quote made ahead of his death so its to reason Wick took that advice and is in hiding after doing the same, Akira is still alive and got revenge on Caine, and Winston seems to be in the know of where John is.",2023-03-25 03:32:05
So fake death and living remotely? Maybe they will pull an old obi wan / old luke on him.,2023-03-25 04:47:24

Maybe JW5 could be a prequel. I wouldn't want them to mess up that ending. Him being dead is such great closure. :),2023-04-04 15:30:24
"What is there left to do for his character?

I’d take a buddy cop movie where he teams up with the cop from the first movie",2023-04-03 04:04:10
"On the other hand, I feel it makes more 'emotional sense'  if J is dead. 

JW says to Winston before leaving the boat to put 'Loving Husband' on epitaph. He was going to die anyway after Caine took the third shot and JW didn't, but planned to kill MDG with the third bullet to have his 'freedom' from the table. To me it feels like JW wanted to have freedom at any cost, even in death. And that's the only way he could go back to being a normal person or a 'loving husband'. Even if he is dead, he is still free and can return back to being a loving husband which was also his wife's last memory of him - a free man away from the underworld of crime. 

&#x200B;

I really hope JW5 doesn't bring back J from the dead, a side story or a prequel of sorts is still good with JW action sequences. But this ending of JW4 is very well rounded and conclusive in terms of storyline and philosophically as well.",2023-04-01 08:40:46

"Yeah, I initially thought ""Oh shit, they offed the character, guess Keanu's stepping down from these movies.""  But then I realized, ""Well, we never actually saw his body go away"".

It's kind of like when Gandalf ""dies"" at the end of Fellowship.  If you don't see the body dead, never say never",2023-03-26 02:14:50
I think this was 4 and 5 condensed into one movie. the original cut of this movie was nearly 4 hours.,2023-03-26 04:06:46
"They also set up that John winning the duel would have fundamentally damaging implications for the table itself, so there’s loose threads if they want to pull them",2023-03-26 11:41:26
Looks like they are making a prequel instead. I’d be okay with that since this movie would end the franchise on a good note.,2023-03-27 02:40:53
"If a 5 movie happens it should be a prequel to 1 I don’t want John’s death to be a fake he’s survived a lot of crazy shit even though he was only human, a prequel of young John would be great especially if they build up to his wife’s eventual illness to bridge the events of the 1st movie.",2023-03-29 23:40:58
"Unless, it's that dreaded of dreaded things - a prequel.",2023-04-15 07:03:51
The reason 4 is so long is likely cuz they combined the two movies. I dont think there will be a 5 with john wick. I thought maybe that he’d kill everyone at the high table but they made a point saying it was pointless because like a hydra theyd all get replaced immediately.,2023-04-24 02:45:37
perhaps with 5 we get to find out how many bodies he had to bury for viggo,2023-11-26 05:03:19
"Yup, and because they ended the same way, it lays enough foundation for John to make a potential return if they choose to continue his story; but otherwise it's conclusive enough that they can put a stamp on it all here. Smart way to do it.",2023-03-24 19:20:21

For caine, those clinging to life dies (that's why he's now the one being hunted)
For john, those cling to death, lives (by faking his death, he can now live his life peacefully)

"Facts. All 4 of these movies have been a reminder that if John keeps going on this path, he will end up dead one way or anything. The story is about struggling against futility because everyone around him, including himself, knows that there's no real reason to be doing what he is doing besides revenge. John doesn't have a plan to uproot the high table, he doesn't have a plan to change anything, he's just going on a murder spree. I feel like during 3 he started to slip back into his mindless killer mindset, and that's why he's so monotone and sounds like he's not all there in 4. His revenge was accomplished in 2, then the high table went after him. He was trying to find meaning in his struggle for life, and thought he would find it while taking on the high table. I don't know if I'm overanalyzing, but I do feel like 4 presents so many philosophical metaphors that it could actually be dissected.",2023-03-31 07:24:24
"Honestly, I wish they would have left out the grave. It makes no sense for his story to end here, and even less sense if he is faking his death. Leave him on the steps bleeding out.

His story needs to conclude with the high table. It's been the Emperor Palpatine in the background the whole time as the evil puppet masters. To have him not go after them and dismantle or rebuild it is just insane.",2023-03-25 06:10:47
"Without the duel, the High Table would still go after him. However, the duel meant he had to go up against his friend and kill him. The trick at the end was to goad the Marquis into participating himself which gave John the opportunity to get out, avoid killing his friend, and killing the Marquis consequence free.

But then John dies anyway so the High Table in the end got what it wanted.",2023-03-27 07:22:25
"Exactly how I feel. Thanks for writing it out. John Wick has always been an absurd escapist fantasy, so to kill him off without a clear accomplishment just feels so wrong. Either have him die successfully dismantling The Table or... just let him survive. You don't need to give him a super happy ending or anything, just let him go off to be free doing whatever.  

It really feels like the only reason this ending was done was because someone really didn't want to make another one and thought this was a good way to put the nail in the coffin.",2023-03-25 07:13:28

Nah, I thought of a pretty good alternate in the theater.

"I feel like John and co had made several comments about killing ""them all"" which to me translates to all those in power aka the table. Maybe not an over throw but certainly making them suffer. Just killing the Marquis, who even at the end was trying the table's patience if the Harbinger's words meant anything, seems like a cop out because he wasn't even on John's radar till the final movie. So what had John been planning up until this guy interfered with his two oldest friends?The only real things brought about by John's rampage were Winston getting his hotel back and Caine winning his freedom. And arguably the first wouldnt have been necessary if John had died at the end of 2. I just dont buy it. Chad and Keanu put a lot of thoughts into these movies, not just the action, and it just feels a bit... incomplete to me. But, i enjoyed the movie as a whole and thays just my take.",2023-03-28 01:08:38

"It almost certainly is. In the same way John Wick gets hit by like 20 cars in both John Wick 3 and 4, and how in one scene in John Wick 3 he gets thrown through like 10 identical glass panels in a row. It's almost a confirming wink and a nod that facilitates the world building. But in a way that many, for example, Marvel movies fail to do--those winks don't undermine the conception of the world itself. That's why many people are growing tired of disingenuous comedy in action movies. This element present in John Wick definitely works on some subconscious level. I was just thinking about this actually: there are some over the top action movies that I can't stand and it's because they don't take their world building seriously at all. John Wick somehow tows the line between tongue and cheek and serious very well. When he gets hit by a car, thrown through a window or off a building your brain goes ah hah! But, then the filmmakers are there to remind you they know what you are thinking, and that their world doesn't play by the rules of your preconceptions.",2023-03-26 04:35:59

And even earlier than that it was supposed to be two films shot back-to-back.

I completely agree about the Osaka part. It was so totally unnecessary. Like, it was still probably my favorite part of the film, but it added absolutely nothing to the story and made even less sense than the rest of it.

Honestly, it would have been even better if they cut the filler fights, trimmed out the repetitive elements from them, and delivered a lean, 90 minute film.",2023-03-26 23:16:51
"And what was his entire deal to begin with? He'd been stalking John for a while, anticipating that the price on his head would keep going up? They only showed the pages of his notebook fairly briefly, so it was hard to parse it and tell what his scheme was. Not to mention... how did he assemble that information to begin with?

It seemed like he was going to end up trying to play both sides against each other more, had some larger scheme in mind, or something. Like, the whole thing with the knife definitely hinted at something deeper going on. From his introduction on it never felt like it was actually just about the money.

And why the dog?

My thinking was that he was likely involved with the Bowery King. He had a kind of homeless sort of look and the dog really fit in with that. It would make sense that he was involved in whatever the King's larger scheme was.",2023-03-27 00:37:01

This is actually why my favorite 1 man army action set piece in the past decade is the Batman warehouse scene from BvS. He gets shot in the head from behind, which is ridiculous, but it was at least a step forward in addressing that there are goons that can just come up from behind you and end it. Like he also gets dragged by his cape by 2 goons and stabbed in between his armor plating where it meets the shoulder.

It is definitely a stylistic choice to give Reeves lines of no more than 3-5 monosyllabic words, and your idea makes sense from a thematic perspective though I almost take it as being a bit intentionally comedic first and foremost. These movies aren’t action-comedies in any explicit sense but they definitely do weave a kind of dry and dark humor in.",2023-03-27 04:28:31
"That's one way to think about it. But if that was the choice, it sure as hell doesn't make for a compelling character. 

I'm fine with John Wick being a shell of a human where action/death just happens around him. That's kind of the point of the movie. But if Keanu's performance had any personality, I think it would've elevated the character further.",2023-03-24 21:37:40

"Right? Imagine jumping from JW1 to this and seeing how the style and character has shifted. JW in JW1 was a real, albeit shallow, character and it was the _villains_ that had mythologised him as Baba Yaga, which was cool to see - normally we only see villains mythologised to make _them_ seem scary for our protagonist

Even the freedom he won for Caine was totally hollow. Caine was already free until a high table bigwig decided to coerce him into service by threatening his daughter. There's nothing to prevent that from just happening again.,2023-03-27 22:28:07
"Keanu absolutely didn't want to continue anymore. The interview has the director states that when they brought the idea to Lionsgate, they outright said ""Are you fucking insane?"" Which makes sense, since John Wick is one of their flagship franchises at the moment. 

Says him and Keanu 'smiled' and said ""Yeah, we want to tie it all together. [...] Because at some point this has got to end, man"" - I just find it so ridiculous that the only way they could've thought to 'tie it all together' was to have Wick die pointlessly. Couldn't he have escaped elsewhere? What was the point if he's going to die without generating any major changes in the world they've created? 

Apparently the original ending, on Lionsgate's orders, showed the grave scene but the dog looked up, insinuating MAYBE Wick was alive and he was there as well. But the people watching the test screenings did not like it. So the amazing idea they had was to make it CLEAR he's dead. And in his words ""We thought we nailed it the first time and, to the studio's credit, they didn't even blink"" suggesting that they brought the idea of John dying originally, got backlash from the studio, had a vague mysterious 'is he alive?' Ending and then due to poor reception, they just took the feedback as assuming its best to go to the original idea and make clear he's dead. 

But yes, not amount of money is too much. So who knows.",2023-03-26 16:53:42
John didn't even know about the duels. He seemed taken aback at the appointment of Cain to take the marquis place.  He didn't care if he died. He just wanted a clean way to kill the Marquis and have the high table realign without having to just keep getting his friends killed.,2023-03-30 04:32:21

We’ve already established that JW is nigh-superhuman and that the fights are more balletic dances to see who can get a head shot first. Previous movies established that shots to the suit, falls from decent heights, and standard car hits don’t kill or incapacitate people here.

"I don't care about the realism. I don't care about how many bullets come out of his gun before reloading and I don't care about trying to find flaws intentionally just to be able to say something sucks. But howbout we have some real stakes so that I can actually get invested in the action?  It's pretty clear during the entire last act in Paris that John is just going to survive whatever encounter until he gets to the final duel, so at that point it just becomes purely about the action and choreography 

And yes I can appreciate the choreography of the actors, but by hour 2 it wasn't doing anything interesting  in terms of action that wasn't already done earlier in the film and series. This movie had no reason to be dragged out for as long as it was.

I see no reason why couldn't we have had LESS bad guys and more meaningful encounters with them instead of hordes of mindless boring ass henchmen that just throw themselves at John Wick so that he can grab them and body shot them. 

The hotline miami scene was a perfect example of an awesome and unique action scene and was easily the best part of the movie. Let me be clear that I thought overall it was a decent movie, I loved the soundtrack, Donnie was cool, I liked some of the action set pieces and the ending, but there was a lot of shit around it that could have been cut.",2023-04-13 19:29:46

The long take of him moving through the ""bath house"" area with Think in the background, going into Iosef running through the crowd with John slowly advancing towards him like a fucking T-800 and LED Spirals playing, going into the big blow-up where Shots Fired kicks in... it's just perfect. Absolutely firing on all cylinders. It's a simple idea executed as perfectly as humanly possible.

"Ya'll weren't listening to much dialogue or went pee during plot points, lol.

John Wick's ""family"" holds a seat at the high table. *They* have to issue the challenge, and then put John in as the representative. There was no reason for the family to issue a challenge against the antagonist of JW2, and no reason for Winston to tell John about it. John wasn't the highest bounty on the planet, fighting against the entire High Table at that point. He was having a fight with a dude he gave a marker to and the fallout from that. No one, not even Winston, expected John to blow a dude away on continental grounds. Especially not a seated head family member of the High Table. 

In ""IRL"" sense, the writers came up with it after JW2. We aren't even introduced to the concept of John being part of a ""family"" until JW3. Even still, him being told wouldn't make any sense in the events of JW2 at that specific time, so it still fits in ""lore-wise"" for that point in the overall story.

I'm not saying Nobody is some secret player who actually had control of/destroyed the High Table himself. I'm saying his *existence* is more or less a knock-on effect of all the damage to the High Table's reputation and power John has done.

John building his myth even more than it already was, over the course of the movies, creates more assassins like Nobody who don't ""properly"" respect the High Table. That's the entire problem the Marquis is trying to nip in the bud by having John publicly killed.

The knife in the hand scene kind of plays into this; compare how Nobody reacts to it (extreme annoyance that turns to fear when his dog is threatened) to how everyone else in the series with a High Table-inflicted mutilation reacts to it (respectful, if unhappy, acceptance). Nobody doesn't look at the High Table as his masters, he looks at them as a bunch of psychopaths with money, and the prospect of *everyone* looking at the Table like that (resulting in them having no real power beyond what they can shoot) scares the fucking shit out of them.",2023-03-28 08:50:07

Winston and the Bowery King saying goodbye, John having beaten the table and cleared his name, everything seems like it ties the story up nicely.

I think John needs to rest. He deserves it, more than anything else. He's been on the run for what, months? Killing and fighting and nearly dying? 

If he's alive, I hope they only show it as a brief glimpse in a spin off. I'd love to see Sawayama helm the series and maybe Keanu floats by in the background somewhere.",2023-03-26 07:00:24

"Just watched this last night.  I agree with you.  The first 3 had a ton more story, a lot more exploration of this underworld.  Ridiculous fighting, but more interesting story surrounding it.  JW4 jumped the shark.  

The scenes in between the fights were boring, and then the fights were just stupidly over the top.  No real storytelling.

In JW3 he nearly has to kill himself to get to the elder in the dessert, in 4 he just… tracks him down.  

In 3, it’s at least maybe a tiny bit surprising at first, even though we knew it would be the case, that he survived the fall from the Continental.  And then he had to be rehabbed in the new Bowery.  In 4 he’s nigh invincible.

In 3, the big fight in the Continental, with its intermission and all, was an incredible piece and still kept putting good storytelling in throughout the fight itself (Wick basically calling a time-out when fighting the students to catch his breath, “hey, that was a really good fight right?”).  In 4, they tried to do that with *every* fight and failed.

There was no reason why this needed to be nearly 3 hours long.",2023-06-19 16:44:50

I think the original plan was to move him to a fifth movie with a clean slate so he isn’t reactionary killing his way through a movie but a fifth moving being like Shooter where he goes for the high table as the true bogey man. 

Then it ends with him going to Winston and saying something like…

“So I heard you might have an opening for a new Concierge?”

Then we get John Wick 6: Bell Boy",2023-03-24 05:37:47
"That's how I saw it too. Then Winston in the boat talked about how he just burried his friend. The way I see it, it was a redemption arc and Wick didn't want others to die by his fault. 

So he decided to cut ties with the high table. at the same time, the marquis talked about how Wick winning would open a new ""sect"" so ... Many we could a story building where Wick gets a following and goes against the high table. Dunno. 

I love the ending because it gives John a perfect death but at the same time, it's open ended",2023-03-25 04:01:13
"Sorta, but we learn that that's impossible.  Like a hydra, another head will just grow in its place.  The battle would've been everlasting.",2023-03-26 03:01:22
"Yes which was quickly forgotten about after the first 15 minutes. That’s why I dont think he’s dead. That, and the dogs reaction at the grave site",2023-03-25 20:18:52
"Yeah I wanted him to completely decimate all of the high table, THEN die. Dying after killing a low level lackey (essentially) feels wrong",2023-03-26 20:52:58
"No, the point was to be free of their influence - being free means he could die the man he was with Helen and not the man he was before. He wanted to shed that life (represented at the end when he could finally discard all the items on him of that life that was weighing him down - ammo and even his belt) 

Consider that if he died while 'working' his final burial wishes might not ever be honoured, no eternal plot next to Helen, rather he would simply be made a guest of a dinner-reservation (especially since the Marquis explicitly said he wanted to kill the myth around him, and so erecting a tombstone would only add to his martyrdom)",2023-03-26 19:43:43

He already killed 3 members of the HT before the events in Osaka,2023-04-30 13:52:27
"You missed the point of my post. If John Wick's mission in going against the High Table after the events at the end of the 2nd movie was to kill a whole bunch of people coming after him, kill a random person in charge of those coming after him, then die himself, then he didn't need the duel.

He wouldn't have needed to kill his friend either. He only needed to do that BECAUSE he picked the duel option. He could have just done what he intended to do before Winston convinced him to do the duel - kill the Marquis solo. The duel was supposed to get the High Table off his ass, but dying after killing the Marquis would have done that anyway lol, rendering everything he did after the end of the 2nd movie pointless. The only thing he accomplished after killing D'Antonio, is get a bunch of his friends killed for no reason.",2023-03-27 22:29:00

"He's also a very simple guy too, he doesn't really make clever plans like Winston. The director said as much during a recent video I saw. The franchise isn't really about outwitting the audience.

That was before it was made clear he's taking on an ancient global order of assassins.,2023-03-27 07:38:07
How does that change anything? They'd still kill him immediately afterwards. Nobody's looking for a symbol and it's not like that would stop Wick from killing.,2023-04-08 18:20:05
"Right but, and hear me out, maybe they just don't write it that way?? That ""rule"" wasn't established until this movie. So maybe just let him kill the high table members, since that would be the satisfying ending. 

Actually, even going by the rules of THIS movie, why not challenge each member of the table to singles combat for their seat at the table? He could fight any of their challengers and then assign his own allies to the table one by one. 

That would at least bookend these movies better. We went from John wanting to desperately survive in JW3 so he can remember his wife, to him accepting death after earning his freedom and killing a guy he didn't even know existed until 2 days ago. Not quite what is call good storytelling.",2023-03-25 06:04:04

JW1 didn't even have the bulletproof tech and JW2 only had John and Cassian wearing them because they were the top of the top. JW3 had the bulletproof body armor but not the suit, that was reserved for John. JW4 was like, ""here's the top-tier enemies, have fun!""

Maybe he's just there to show that it's not just about money for some of these folks? That seeing Jon fight for ""love"" and his ""freedom"" inspired him too?

"> Wick being dead shows that even if you're a master assassin who can defeat all the other greatest assassins in the world single handedly the Table will still get you no matter what the cost.

Not really. It showed that even though John died, people can still fight back against the The High Table. It's not so much about beating The High Table, it's about showing them that you're not willing to take their shit anymore. 

Look at from the perspective of a real world left wing rebel group, something like the YPJ in Syria. They might be outmatched, outgunned and outnumbered, but they still fight everyday to topple a tyrannical regime. The High Table is basically another Bashar al-Assad. All it takes is one person to fight back to show people that it is possible to fight back.

"And Akira (the Osaka Concierge) had already told John that she was going to kill Caine if John didn't. So John gave his life to save Caine's, and now Akira is going to kill him. So pointless. 

Though, given that this goes like a Fast and Furious movie, I'm sure Caine and Akira will fight until they realize they have a similar enemy and they will team up. No doubt Mr. Nobody will wander into that story as well. What a terrible story this is.",2023-03-28 00:04:19
"You know, I'd agree with them that the franchise has got to end, and I would have been fine with this being the last John Wick movie, I just wish they would have done a better job at wrapping it up. In my original reply to you I had written an even longer response but went over the character count by about 3500 characters! So I had to trim it donw, but there is just so much to say about why this movie is a disappointment to fans of the franchise thus far.

I still don't understand WHY it ended the way it did. It feels so disconnected from the previous movies. Why did John fight so hard the entire movie and kill so many people to get the duel if he ultimately was going to let Caine win? John accomplished nothing in this movie and in his death. He killed a man who up until this movie we had no idea existed. And everything is basically reset to the way it was at the start of the movie, except now John is dead. It doesn't really feel like a satisfying end to the journey. 

That interview you quoted is so depressing. It sounds like they didn't put much thought or care into the ending, and perhaps the poor feedback was due to the purpose of John's death and not his actual death itself. Like I previously said, I'm fine with John Wick dying in this movie. I think it's strange to end John's story on the 4th installment, and not the 3rd or 5th. But I'm ok with it. I just wish they actually had him die for something meaningful. I wonder if the test audiences felt the same way but the studio didn't pick up on that (or want that). Maybe if they had established early on in this movie that John wanted out so he could die a free man, I'd at least be able to say that his motivations throughout THIS movie made sense. But watching Chapter 3 and then Chapter 4, the story is complete mess.

I didn't realize it until after watching the movie but the original creator and writer of John Wick 1-3 (Derek Kolstad) was not involved in Chapter 4. In an interview I found from 2 years ago, he said it was not his decision to no return. So basically he was forced out of his own franchise and the reigns were handed over to one of the writers of Chapter 3 and some one new. In hindsight, it's completely obvious that Chapter 4 is missing Derek Kolstad. While Chapter 3 certainly dips it's toe into the unrealistic, I suspect it was Derek who held it back from what we got in Chapter 4. 

I think without Derek Kolstad, the heart of the John Wick journey was not there. Perhaps his plan for the story was ending the High Table and collapsing the criminal underworld, and like you said, Lionsgate wouldn't allow that. Whatever the reason, I think this movie suffered from his lack of involvement.

Obviously the action is still there in this movie, but I think the new writers don't seem to understand that a John Wick movie should be about JOHN. Having too many allies and adversaries that can kill people with the skill and style of John Wick, make John look less special. It started in Chapter 3 when we saw Sophia killing groups of people with the same moves as John. And now EVERYONE can fight waves of henchmen like it's nothing. That was supposed to be John's special ability, and they have passed it off to eneryone else. At least Akira and Caine used different weapons from John and had somewhat unique styles of fighting. But others in the movie were just too overpowered and the script spent too long highlighting them over John. John was supposed to be the man that when you got a call that your son stole his car, you panicked. Now you'd expect the same reaction if your son stole the car of ANYONE from Chapter 4, and that makes the character of Wick so much less special.

Hopefully Lionsgate realizes that without John and his story/motivations these movies are nothing but generic action movies. I don't want spin-offs and tv series that follow other characters in this world. The world that was built is unique and interesting, but only as a backdrop to the story of John. Everytime it's explored in more detail it loses it's magic and I suspect the more they expand, the less interesting it will be. And obviously, the more action and fighting the include without John Wick involved, will just diminish his legend.",2023-03-27 14:11:31
"Im super late but to maybe offer the people above an explanation why this movie is getting so much praise:

 The points they make are totally valid and in hindsight I agree with them but your argument is key here. I think most viewers werent expecting realism or looking for gci or wondering why you wouldn't stop driving when theres a gunfight in the middle of the street. I know I wasnt. 

And if youre in that headspace, the action is so fun and entertaining that the story around it can be serviceable at best and you will still love the movie.",2023-05-28 06:49:29

"I think you’re right. People want to believe in it and they do. And compared to other movies come out recently it is incredibly good. 

Sometimes I wonder if the storyline consistently questions I ask in my head in the movie, just don’t occur to the average viewer. Not that I’m even smart but millions of people will watch this, and maybe they are genuine uncritical consumers",2023-03-26 07:54:34
"Well, the director speaks about him and Keanu talking to the people at Lionsgate about ending the John Wick story, to which they replied ""Are you fucking crazy?"" (Because John Wick is their most popular franchise at the moment) 

They replied to that by saying ""We thought 'this has to end eventually, so we wanted to wrap things up properly"" 

Seems like Lionsgate was against killing Wick so they tested an ending where the grave scene is more ambiguous but it tested poorly. (Which isn't explained well, but I assume people didn't like Wick's death? But they took it as them not liking the ambiguity) 

So they changed it back to their original idea, which was that Wick dies, period. And the director says that they didn't really bother them again, so they took that to say their original plans were right after all. (Things ending with part 4)

That portion of the article seems pretty clear to me about Wick dying. I don't know what else to tell you.

The article you linked does seem to be more recent, but this article still remains as factual information the director shared.",2023-04-02 07:00:13
"You’re seriously thinking too hard while watching a John Wick movie. The action was still done really well in the Arc de Triumph sequence, even though the circumstances were more over the top. But that’s the final action sequence of a multi-movie series, it’s supposed to be a big bang.

The first movie was more grounded because it was the introduction. First movies are almost always that way. Did you want more pistol close combat for the end of the 4th movie? They wanted to show you something you haven’t seen before, and they delivered on multiple counts. Just enjoy it for what it is.

Edit to clarify: I totally get what you’re saying about the action itself being realistic. Being conscious of needing to reload, etc. is why I initially liked the first movie. I’m just saying they understandably wanted to up the ante with the 4th movie. If they kept showing the same, more realistic combat of the first move people would be complaining about being more of the same.

My initial comment about them not taking themselves seriously was with the writing. It’s always been self-aware and a bit cheeky with itself and the drama. I agree it took the realism of its action seriously for the most part.",2023-03-24 15:43:50

In this one; there’s barely any “boss” assassins; just a few henchmen in suits that all look the same, Nobody and Caine. 

I feel like there’d be a few higher level assassins dispatched by the Marquis as a hunting party.

"> I also think the movie implied that Caine wasn't blind back when he was doing missions, and had maybe blinded himself to force the High Table to consider him too useless to force to keep working- until the John situation happened.

They did outright say this in the movie, which makes it worse. He blinded himself to be useless to them as an agent, yet somehow he's the 2nd best combatant in the whole movie. 

John was hesitant to kill him? Maybe, but they should have shown that by John whooping his ass easily but not finishing the job, John outright loses the first fight and is saved by Marlo's character, and in the further fights he's at best even...with a blind guy...who wasn't blind until recently (10 years at most)...to be useless as an assassin....without superpowers.",2023-03-29 18:09:43

">John building his myth even more than it already was, over the course of the movies, creates more assassins like Nobody who don't ""properly"" respect the High Table. That's the entire problem the Marquis is trying to nip in the bud by having John publicly killed.

I mean it's hard to disprove your point but my feeling is that the John Wick universe always was full of bizarre characters and not every one of them is a friend of the high table or even care that much about it. Considering they put out a bounty on people's had implies that a lot of the assassins are freelancers and do not really are directly employed by the high table (Like Caine is). Then there is the Bowery King who basically always hated the high table. There is also Perkins who didn't give a damn about High Table rules whatsoever.

If this continued, it would just continue and he would be a rat in a maze. Just trying to constantly find a way out. This was his way out and in my opinion a beautiful way to go out.

"Mostly by watching a good number of martial arts movies! Most of the guys above became popular outside of Hollywood since there's a good amount of martial arts movies being made in foreign cinema.

Scott Adkins was super popular for playing the villain Yuri Boyka in the 'Undisputed' film franchise and went on to have roles in movies like Ninja, Expendables, Ip Man etc. Essentially, since there aren't too many actors that have the acting chops + physicality + martial arts background needed for movies like John Wick that emphasize fight choreography, you tend to see familiar names being casted.

Scott Adkins has an awesome youtube channel with a playlist called the 'Art of Action' where he interviews fellow martial artists that have featured in Hollywood and elsewhere.

"We've also seen the Marquis and the Harbinger, who are it's handlers apparently. And we know that the Tarasov's must have been part of the high table as well, because they got John Wick out by asking him to do a job.

Didn't Katia say they were under the table?,2023-03-27 02:35:30
Totally different movie and one that’s been done to death including by yen,2023-04-30 13:34:25
"the intro scene of Wick hunting down the Elder in the desert and how it did zilch in stopping the High Table was quite telling and definitely set the tone, which was re-emphasized by Winston's Hercules vs Hydra analogy later on",2023-03-25 14:32:47
"Actually, I think you're onto something. If they do another one, it has to end with the status quo still in place",2023-03-24 13:25:32
"I kinda feel like they answered that when Winston was talking to John at Charons plaque. John insists that he'll just go kill Marquis, and Winston just interrogates him on where it finally ends, and that the high table is just a Hydra to his Hercules. To win, he must beat them at their own game.",2023-04-07 14:37:34
">I thought this was the idea, and why they were originally going to shoot 4 & 5 at the same time. The ""I'll kill them. I'll kill them all."" line from 2 (at least to me) meant ""This isn't over until the entire structure of power that made me do this is irradicated."".

But after he re-united with his family in Berlin - isn't he part of the high-table himself now?",2023-03-27 16:36:18
"I agree, I think John realizes there's no point in trying to beat the table, so instead he shows you can beat the system by winning his freedom and Caine's by extension and in death he becomes an even bigger legend that really disrupts what the table has going on. So just like his coming back to life in the first movie set things in motion, his death can also do the same.",2023-03-26 08:26:32
"Yeah I feel like the point would be killing the entire table itself would be killing the heart, versus any of their heads.",2023-03-27 15:32:14
But we don’t actually know that since we’ve haven’t really met the hydra (the high table),2023-03-26 04:35:54
He did kill members of the high table (we see three killed on screen) problem is they just get replaced.,2023-04-30 13:44:46
He beat the high table and died a martyr. One man can’t overthrow the system but he can definitely start a revolution.,2023-04-30 13:48:39
"Sure, but it seems strange to continue the John Wick story without John Wick. 

And Caine is a more similar character to John Wick. The only reason he was involved was because the High Table had leverage over him with his daughter. Just like John was forced back in by a Marker. They are forced into doing things they don’t want to do but must do it anyway, all while resentful that the Table is making them do it. I think Akira and Caine will have a common enemy by the end. But John should still be involved. It’s HIS story.",2023-04-01 22:21:44
"Ahhh I see. In that we agree, it felt totally pointless. Like A++ movie until that final minute. ""And then he died, roll credits"" made me and my friends just go WHAT!? lol I mean I still highly enjoyed the movie.",2023-03-28 02:34:58
No? He won the duel. He's free to go by their own rules.,2023-04-08 23:55:51
"He'd have to kill every member of every family of the Table at the very least, and we have no idea how deep that goes",2023-03-24 06:48:51

"I can suspend my disbelief for a lot of stuff. Ridiculous is _fine_.
The universe they build around his character makes the beatings he takes and walks(staggers) away from sufficiently reasonable. Even the 7 cars hitting him within 15 minutes was not a problem. (Maybe apart from the fact that it made me and my friends actually start counting them)

But when it is clear that you _force_ yourself to keep rolling down stairs that is a completely different thing. Rolling all the way down would have been fine. But they made it look like he was _trying_ to roll all the way down. Bad choreography/execution.

Same problem with lots of the fights where the bad guys are way too obviously playing into the hits. The efficient violence that made John Wick a bad ass was turned into a over choreographed - and super obviously telegraphed - fight ballet. That just makes it look dumb.",2023-03-27 21:47:23
"Caine, John, and Koji with the old guard assassin vibes where there was honor and respect amongst those in the business vs the new blood who just are out for the cash/notoriety was really cool to see. It's a nice contrasting world build, which is pretty dope addition to a franchise that's done a rather insane job at world building. 

Really sad to not see more of Hiroyuki Sanada's character, but nice to know Donnie Yen's is alive (for now).",2023-03-28 07:13:46

To my surprise, a lot of celebrities have went shooting at Taran to better their skills in action movies, so it's a great phenomenon for all movie-goers that Chad wanted Keanu to train for real here.",2023-04-03 12:36:38

"And even then, arrows could sometimes penetrate depending on a variety of factors. But yeah, armor without the smooth, curved deflective qualities of full plate...aka modern ballistic armor...doesn't help much against arrows if the archer is equipped with arrows designed to pierce armor (more slender shaft diameter, hardened-steel tip, heavier arrows). 

But a heavy compound bow using regular field tips or broadbeads will not penetrate Class IV plates. They will go through soft armor all day though.",2023-03-26 21:20:38

I'm not asking for quips. They did John Wick with the appropriate amount of personality in the first 3 movies. He came off as a guy that just had a lobotomy in this 4th movie.,2023-03-24 21:48:12
Yep that's the **only** possible solution to his really stilted dialogue,2023-03-25 20:20:04

The only one crying here is you.  Stop embarrassing yourself.,2023-03-25 06:35:26
"It's absolutely got to do with the lack of Derek, massively so. As you say in your comments, this movie feels starkly different to the first three and outright disconnected. 

You bring up this very interesting point I hadn't thought about. Which is how Wick started as this mystical figure who can kill anyone, which is expressed through the action in the movies, but then you bring MANY people who can basically do the same, making Wick seem like just any other assassin in this world. 

I think it's like you say: this wouldn't be as much of a problem if the other assassins were starkly different with their fighting or at least visibly less good. But EVERYONE is a killing machine. Even a literal blind man. 

You know, I KNEW this movie was to a very bad start when they kill Lance Reddick's character, who was someone everyone in the fandom absolutely loved, and he dies pathetically with a goofy shocked face before he's shot. Felt like they were already shitting on the franchise with that, you know? ""We kill this character who was so slick, serious and capable as we've seen in the past 3 movies. And we do it like it's nothing."" 

To further shit on his grave, Winston gets his Continental back like it's nothing, so what was the point? We know Lance has unfortunately passed now, but this movie was filmed and written BEFORE his death. 

If this movie had a better ending and they had handled things better to continue keeping Wick as this ultimate assassin, I'd be excited about the spin offs. But now I'm not. Who cares if John shows up in the ballerina spin off? It takes place before 4 and after 3. We know where he's gonna end up. 

And then we got interviews or shit showing up like. ""Akira's actress would like a spin off! Nobody spin-off! Caine!!!"" Like... So JW4 was just a movie to pointlessly kill Wick and create more spin off potential? 

Don't people HATE shit like this nowadays? Why are they suddenly okay with it? Maddening.",2023-03-27 16:14:25
"The problem is, it was the second ascend after he already fell down. So the whole going up the stairs was much longer",2023-04-12 11:08:30
Yeah exactly. I think worse part for me was Killing off you know who so soon in the movie. I didn't like that lol.,2023-05-23 22:45:20
" I feel like I'm being consistent in what I liked and didn't like and I said the movie was decent overall. I mentioned that I actually did like some of the action set pieces: specifically the hotline miami scene, the club fight with the fat dude, and *most* of the tokyo continental stuff. That was all memorable and enjoyable. 

We both can agree that there are no stakes because we know he's going to survive and this isn't game of thrones. And because there are no stakes, it becomes purely about getting enjoyment out of the action set-pieces which we all expect from this type of movie. But it felt like for every memorable fight scene, there was also an equally un-memorable, dragged out action scene that did not need to be in the movie and didn't bring anything new or interesting in terms of action. Dude this movie was nearly 3 hours long whereas the previous 3 were 1h40, 2h, and 2h10. Like I could have easily skipped the *entire* paris fighting sequences including the stair fight fast forwarded right to the duel for example.",2023-04-14 18:04:05

"That's not how the movie actually views at all. The grave scene **was** ambiguous. You literally can't tell me we watched the same movie if there was any clear indication that he died. 

His **story** may have concluded. But again, there's nowhere explicit in the director comments that he's dead.",2023-04-02 07:11:43
"I'm not 'thinking too hard' I'm pointing out the things that got on the way of my enjoyment of the movie. When you notice something, you simply can't let it go. I've been watching Marvel movies lately and the CGI has been awful, so it's made it easier for me to point out when the usage of it is bad. 

That scene is amazing in writing, but it was executed sloppily. It did not feel real, just completely over the top in a fast and furious kind of way. From getting ran over like three times in that scene alone and brushing it off, to the amounts of CGI cars with disappearing drivers, the flying CGI rag dolls, disappearing bodies and the fact you could tell they simply were NOT there. 

This was never the case with past Wick movies. They always filmed on location because they never did these insane over the top scenarios. They couldn't even do the final scene at the Sacre Coeur on location, it's just them in front of a green screen and it shows. It was really hard to pay attention. 

Maybe you and most people are okay with over the top indestructible John Wick, but that's not what made *me* love this franchise and character. I do not watch fast and furious, I do not watch ridiculous over the top action. I like realism and meticulousness... You know, what made John Wick such a revolutionary action franchise. 

And even the close quarters combat here was made sloppily for the most part.",2023-03-24 15:50:11

I think the more fitting end is Wick dismantling the High Table, or at least inserting his allies into positions at the table. Seeing as his vengeance against the table has been his driving force for the last 2 movies. The Marquis is not a member of the table, and John didn't even know of his existence within the organization until Winston told him in this same movie.",2023-03-25 06:25:04
"Sorry but this is absolutely Fast and Furious levels of make believe at this point. 

He has always been shown to suffer real injuries and consequences frok injuries. Yes he has taken a knife to gut and continued on, but he also required a doctor. 

You'll have to remind me of the multiple cars he got hit by in JW2. I just rewatched it last week and don't remember back to back cars hitting him. He was driving a car and got hit while inside a car, and he got knocked out of the car when another car hit his car. And a car came directly at him but he rolled out of the way. If there is a scene of him being hit by multiple cars please share it with me. 

Falling 3 stories out a window and hitting a car on the way down is not something any one can walk away from. And that was the LEAST ridiculous of his injuries.",2023-03-25 06:33:16

John kills off a generation of seats and leads to the reshuffling of the organization.

Or maybe John kills a few seats, duels some actual members, and achieves a status as ""standing beside the Table"" as an independent check on egregious abuses by the 12 seats. Or any number of other options. 

Instead he kills off some random mook and doesn't even get to enjoy his ""prize"".

So just like his coming back to life in the first movie set things in motion, his death can also do the same.

Did John actually have beef with the high table though? The only reason for the high table to be against him is because he killed on Continental grounds. John said he'd kill the entire high table but realistically, there is no reason for him to do so.",2023-03-27 16:56:41

Rule 2: Shots to the head and chest are fatal (Charon, the Marquis), while off-centre shots to the lower abdomen are survivable (Akira).

The fact that John's death breaks both rules was done deliberately to leave the door open for him to come back in the future (probably if the spin-off movies underperform). If they wanted to kill him, they'd have him collapse on the stairs staring upward.",2023-03-25 19:33:52

"If you look at the story structure from a thematic element the only thing that works for the script is for him to die. His peace was the five years with his wife. He is a man of death, death was ultimately going to be the only answer, again thematically. 

You can sway away from that but the characterization built within the scripts for each of the films should lead to a death for the protagonist because death follows him. Dante’s Inferno is a huge influence.",2023-03-25 06:46:42

"That bar is possible. Caine was basically as badass as John, and he was kinda nerfed because he was blinded. Prime Caine would be able to pull through the same thing John is pulling through. 

Most everyone who ""gets out"" got out by making a deal with the Table aka playing by the rules. John by the marker with the guy from the 2nd movie, and Caine by ""a life for a life"". It was only at the end of this movie that both John and Caine were given unconditional release from the table. Probably the Marquis was their last ditch at eliminating John before they themselves go bankrupt. 

Beside, we see from the movies that one really good assassin can kill 1000 average one. Keeping the leash on the like of John and of Caine is a million time more valuable than having 1000 average assassins who are just cannon fodder. 

And now other Caine/John recognize that they can get out by just beating the shit out the High Table, that it's possible to wage war against the table and get out of this world with no string attached.",2023-06-20 19:08:00

John Wick barely talks, and when it does, it's only what's necessary.

But when he interacts with others, he's always polite. Always ""thank you""s and ""well done""s and polite requests for what he needs. The fact that he barely talks means what he says hits harder. When John Wick thanks you for your work, you know you just impressed a genuine master of their craft.

No wonder all the service people throughout the whole series adore him, from the bartender in JW1, to the shopping sequence in JW2, to the doctor in JW3. It's like if you, I dunno, brought custom art supplies to Da Vinci and he looked in your eyes and gave you a genuine thank you.

Yeah I agree. I expected his death to be meaningful or not at all but never to be so sudden like that and imo if they were just going to do that they might as well have had it happen in the last movie and maybe let the character die a hero or something.,2023-05-24 06:27:58
">And way earlier in our discussion you were being very pedantic and questioning every single move John made in the plot, the characters and who they were, saying the Marquis himself was a waste, saying the Continental dying and Lance dying was a waste.

I see what's going on here, I'm not the OP that you replied too and I didn't say any of the above things. 


But also, you contradict yourself here:

>I mean...obviously he's going to make it until the end? Every hero makes it until the end of the movie. What else is going to happen? Or you can kill them and then it's the end of the movie. Get what I'm saying? But then the twist came at the end with the duel when he didn't end up dueling the Marquis himself and the way they had the actual duel happen. Like, do you want John to die 45 minutes in and then swap to someone else for the remainder of the movie?

to:

>And I disagree here, because I legitimately thought he might not make it to the duel and wondered what would happen if he didn't, given the Marquis' displays of what violence previous to this. 

and I'm sorry but there's absolutely no fucking shot he was gonna die before reaching the duel. The movie was literally set up for the final duel and he was either going to die AT the duel or be alive by the end of the movie.",2023-04-14 19:08:54
"yeah, but that doesnt mean he is released from the sacred duel with the sacred rule of losers dying. 

If Winston was dueling instead of John and then John said to Winston that he is gonna give the final shot and John got shot, do you think Winston would go scott free? The rules of the duel still applies to them. In short, there is only one winning side, not one and a half. Caine was still part of Marquis' team. And it was said that when the duelant dies, his partner dies with him. And Caine was still the partner of Marquis. That wasnt revoked. Marquis' deal with Caine is not the same as dueling rules. Marquis has the deal with Caine, but they both still fall under the duel rules. And they lost, both of them. So Caine should not be walking away from it.",2023-03-26 19:56:40
